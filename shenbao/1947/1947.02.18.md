### Emergency Measures to Stabilize People's Livelihoods: National Government Orders Strict Implementation. Total Amount of People's Overseas Deposits Exceeds US$300 Million; List Already Investigated, Self-Declaration Required.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The National Government issued an order on the 17th, stating that in view of the current economic situation, which is sufficient to affect the livelihoods of all citizens and lead to significant social unrest, the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" has been specially formulated. It was submitted to the 218th Standing Committee Meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, which resolved: "(1) To amend and pass the plan; (2) To submit the penalty sections in the respective measures to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary legislation; (3) All people, companies, or organizations of the Republic of China with foreign exchange deposited abroad shall voluntarily declare it to the government. This foreign exchange deposit, except for legitimate uses, shall be purchased by the government periodically at the statutory exchange rate. Those who fail to declare, refuse to sell, or deposit it in domestic banks shall be severely punished. Detailed implementation measures shall be promptly drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted for approval." In addition to separate distributions, copies of the relevant documents are hereby issued to the relevant parties, ordering them to act accordingly and strictly comply. They are also instructed to direct their subordinates to take full responsibility, earnestly comply, and strictly implement this order, which is of utmost importance.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Economic Emergency Measures Plan has been promulgated, and the response from all quarters has been extremely positive. The Economic Policy Research Committee will hold another meeting in the coming days to continue discussing fundamental measures to stabilize people's livelihoods and stabilize finance.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The government is fully determined to stabilize prices and will strictly implement the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, effectively control prices, guide floating capital to invest in productive enterprises, and strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and manipulating prices. Such merchants will be severely punished.

[Further Dispatch] The Four Joint Offices held an extraordinary meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, attended by responsible persons from various national banking bureaus, to discuss the strict implementation of various loans under the "Measures for Strengthening the Management of Financial Operations," focusing on assisting the increased production of daily necessities and export goods. Amounts of 50 million yuan or more must be approved by the Four Joint Offices; otherwise, they cannot be granted. The handling banks and bureaus shall be fully responsible for conducting investigations and assessing the uses of loan applications in advance. All surplus funds from the various banks and bureaus shall be deposited in the Central Bank and shall not be transferred to provincial and municipal banks or commercial firms through foreign exchange purchases, rediscounting, or other means. When military, political, and state-owned enterprise agencies use deposit funds, they must use crossed checks. When cash withdrawals are necessary, the purpose must be stated.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The total amount of foreign exchange deposited abroad by Chinese nationals exceeds US$300 million. The government has already investigated the list of depositors. If depositors do not voluntarily declare, the government will publish their names when necessary and impose penalties. Some economic experts believe that it would be better for the government to borrow these funds rather than purchase them at the statutory exchange rate. Other experts advocate using long-term bonds to collect these deposits.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] After the exchange rate was raised to 12,000 yuan, the issue of remittances to Hong Kong should not be as serious as in the past. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously consulted with the Overseas Department, the Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department, and the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture to determine a remittance subsidy method, deciding to adopt an import and export subsidy method to subsidize 100%. However, since the announcement of the Emergency Measures Plan, this method is no longer necessary.

### Jewelry Stores in Various Locations Close Down; Ministry of Finance Plans Handling Measures; Prices Fall in Beiping, Hankou, and Taipei.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] After the government announced the suspension of public trading of gold and banknotes, all gold shops, jewelry stores, and US dollar trading shops in Nanjing closed their doors on the morning of the 17th. It is reported that the guilds verbally notified them separately and scheduled a meeting that afternoon to discuss whether to continue trading jewelry. According to Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, this is an inevitable phenomenon after the government implemented emergency measures. The bureau has decided to follow government instructions and will not pay attention to the closure of businesses.

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] The ten money exchange shops here that deal in US dollars have voluntarily removed their glass signs because the government has ordered a ban on foreign currency transactions. According to an employee of a large jewelry store, there are about 40 large jewelry stores in Nanjing. If the government permanently bans the sale of gold and silver jewelry, the number of jewelry store employees who will lose their jobs will reach 2,000.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance is drafting measures to handle the processing of gold jewelry made by jewelry stores and will soon announce and implement them. Today, all jewelry stores and foreign currency exchange shops in Nanjing are closed, with their doors locked. The Nanjing branch of the Central Bank has not yet received orders from the Shanghai head office, so it has not started purchasing foreign currency or posting prices for gold purchases today. There was no price fluctuation today.

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 17th] All jewelry stores in the county are closed today.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 17th] After receiving news of the government's financial controls, the trading of silver ingots immediately stopped. Most gold shops did not open, and only a few jewelry stores had scattered sales. Other commodity prices remained stable, and the restless public sentiment has calmed down.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 17th] All gold shops in Kunming have stopped trading today, and the Gold Industry Association convened an emergency meeting. From today, there is no market for gold or foreign currency. Cotton yarn and cloth prices have fallen in unison due to the suspension of the gold industry. Da Mei Heng cloth (per bolt) is 360,000 yuan. Department stores remain firm and brisk. Rice prices have fallen, with top-grade rice at 58,000 yuan per dan.

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] After the Supreme National Defense Council decided on emergency economic measures to suspend gold trading and raise foreign exchange rates, all jewelry stores in Hangzhou closed. Guerrilla merchants who collected gold on the streets also disappeared. Foreign goods have risen in price, with newspapers now costing 150,000 yuan each. Daily necessities are also stirring. Rice prices are now shouting for 130,000 yuan. The general public is both happy and worried, just like the gloomy and snowy weather today.

### Hangzhou Allocates Low-Priced Rice

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th] The food situation for Hangzhou residents is becoming increasingly serious, especially for public servants and teachers. With the provincial government allocating 100,000 dan of grain, the Civil Food Regulation Committee is allocating it in the form of low-priced rice, which has somewhat calmed the public's mind. It is understood that the Financial Department has telegraphed the counties in the Fuchun River basin and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to immediately transport 50,000 dan of grain to Hangzhou, with the expectation of reaching 73,000 dan in March.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 17th] After the government's emergency economic measures were announced, commodity prices in Beiping generally declined, such as the highest-grade flour produced in Beiping, which fell to 68,000 yuan per bag. However, buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and very few transactions have been made. The order to prohibit the circulation of gold and US dollars has not yet arrived in Beiping, so the exchange industry is operating as usual today. The US dollar is offered at 12,400 and purchased at 12,000. Gold is traded in the black market at 640,000.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 17th] After the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced, rice and commodity prices in Taiwan have stabilized somewhat. Rice is 36 yuan per catty, and first-grade white sugar is 95 yuan per catty. During the period of soaring prices, public enterprises in Taiwan Province did not raise prices. Chief Executive Chen Yi also ordered a 10% reduction in the prices of trains, tap water, and electricity. Chen believes that the prices of various commodities in non-public enterprises should also be lowered. This afternoon, he ordered the Civil Affairs Department to convene trade associations in Taipei to discuss pricing matters, hoping to gradually reduce the prices that have been rising recently. The Bank of Taipei is purchasing gold and collecting US dollars. Today's listed prices are 11,500 NT dollars per tael of gold, 158 yuan for US dollars, and 34 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, but there were no transactions.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 17th] The Suzhou Provincial Government has recently telegraphed the county governments, stating that the prices of daily necessities in the counties along the Shanghai-Nanjing line must not exceed 70% of those in Shanghai; otherwise, the respective administrative officials will be held accountable. The Suzhou County Government has now begun investigating and stabilizing prices.

### Legal Tender in Hong Kong; Market Conditions Improve

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 17th] After the Chinese government announced its emergency financial control plan, the market conditions for legal tender in Hong Kong improved. This morning, the opening price for 100,000 yuan of legal tender was equivalent to 41 Hong Kong dollars, while the price last Saturday was 37 and a half Hong Kong dollars for 100,000 yuan of legal tender. Gold prices have fallen, with the opening price at 277 Hong Kong dollars per ounce, while the closing price last Saturday was 291 Hong Kong dollars per ounce. A Chinese banker here told our reporter that it is doubtful whether the new plan will be effective, especially the order for foreign currency holders to exchange legal tender at the official rate, which may be difficult to receive a widespread response.

### Legislative Yuan Meeting; Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The 315th meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 20th. Another meeting will be held on the 21st, and President Song Ziwen will be invited to report to the Legislative Yuan. Meeting notices were sent out yesterday.

### Strictly Prevent Gold; Smuggling Out of the Country

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Among the government's announced Economic Emergency Measures, there is a clause prohibiting the carrying of gold bars out of the country, with violators' goods being confiscated and forfeited. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed all customs offices to strictly prevent the smuggling of gold out of the country.

### On the Eve of the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman Broadcasts to the Nation; Emphasizing Its Importance in His Address at the Central Memorial Week Yesterday; Encouraging the Enhancement of Spiritual and Moral Strength

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement (18th), Chairman Chiang will broadcast to the nation at 8:00 PM. At that time, the Central Broadcasting Station will broadcast simultaneously via medium wave at "454" meters, short wave at "660" kilocycles, "30.8" meters, "9730" kilocycles, and "25.35" meters, "11835" kilocycles, and all broadcasting stations across the country will rebroadcast on time.

[Further Dispatch] At 9:00 AM on the 17th, the Central Government held an expanded Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, he gave an impromptu address, explaining the importance of the New Life Movement in the current stage of national construction. Excerpts from the address are as follows:

The day after tomorrow (19th) is the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement. I have a separate announcement to encourage compatriots nationwide. When the New Life Movement was initiated, we relied on the efforts of our compatriots to implement it, which brought about a fundamental change in social customs. In the 26th year, the government resolved to resist Japan, using the New Life Movement as one of the main spiritual forces. Later, our compatriots across the country were inspired and able to defeat the enemy, which is a clear testament to the implementation of the New Life Movement. However, the purpose for which I initiated the New Life Movement was not only to resist foreign aggression but also to regard it as the basic work of national construction. As Sun Yat-sen said, "Spirit is more important than matter; revolution must first reform the heart." The policies of political leaders throughout Chinese history have also prioritized changing customs, because the foundation of a country lies in society. If society cannot establish good customs and if the people cannot adapt to modern life, then the country can never be modernized. However, since the end of the War of Resistance, the remaining poison of the enemy and puppets has not been eradicated, and national order has not been stabilized, leading to a decline in customs, a slump in spirit, a descent into depravity, and a degeneration of society. Those who speculate and seek advantages for themselves consider themselves capable, and those who indulge in excess and ruin are shameless. Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame have been swept away. The recent financial turmoil in Shanghai is clear evidence of this. Therefore, today, only by vigorously implementing the New Life Movement and enhancing spiritual and moral strength can we save the social crisis.

The essence of the New Life Movement lies in incorporating the four pillars of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame into daily life. Therefore, the implementation of the New Life Movement must begin with the transformation of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Everyone must examine their own lives and actions to see if they meet the six conditions of simplicity, frugality, neatness, cleanliness, speed, and certainty mentioned in the New Life Movement. Our party, government, and military personnel should take the lead and thoroughly implement it, extending it from themselves to their families, to the institutions they preside over, and to the entire society. Only in this way can we create a new atmosphere of positivity and form the strength for national construction. The Chairman finally mentioned the appearance of Nanjing, believing that it is very different compared to before the War of Resistance. The Municipal Government, the Police Department, and the Social Affairs and Health Bureaus must urge the Gu, Bao, and Jia and mobilize the people to seek improvement, especially strictly prohibiting public urination and spitting to maintain the city's cleanliness and hygiene. We must not regard these matters as trivial and ignore them. We must know that the distinction between civilization and barbarism lies in this point. We must first achieve neatness and cleanliness before we can talk about other construction.

### Council of Political Affairs Commissioners Reviews Economic Measures; Passes Six Measures for Government Approval

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Council of Political Affairs Commissioners held an extraordinary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th. Mo Dehui, Fu Sinian, and others attended, with Jiangnan presiding. They reviewed the Economic Emergency Measures Plan announced by the government on the 16th and discussed the stabilization of prices in great detail, believing that price stabilization should be based on the index of this year's New Year's Day and should not be increased further. They considered the sudden fourfold increase in the adjusted price of US dollars to be inappropriate and believed that the government should give it serious consideration. Regarding the deposits of Chinese nationals abroad, they advocated that the government should borrow them. They then discussed the proposals for finance and economy that had been reviewed and submitted by the review committee and immediately passed them, sending them to the government for approval that same day. The original text is as follows: (1) The Premier of the Executive Yuan and relevant authorities failed to prevent the gold rush, causing great harm to the national economy and people's livelihoods. The Supreme National Defense Council should investigate the responsibility and impose serious punishment. (2) It is recommended that the government form an investigation team jointly with the Council, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the current financial situation in Nanjing and Shanghai and the manipulation by bureaucratic capital in this gold rush. (3) The government should properly determine methods to absorb floating capital and use it for productive enterprises. In order to promote the practical development of productive enterprises, those who embezzle production loans or divert them to speculative purposes should be severely punished. (4) Those who use public funds and power for illegal profiteering (including delaying salary payments for profit) should be strictly prohibited. (5) Effective measures should be taken to fully control daily necessities, and frugality must be practiced and waste prohibited. (6) Swiftly formulate measures to stabilize prices, implement them effectively, and strive to restore the price standards of January.

### Positive Response to Emergency Measures; People in Nanjing Believe It Is a Victory for Public Opinion

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] According to the opinion of neutral sources in Nanjing, the government's new financial and economic measures are a victory for public opinion. According to these sources, these drastic measures were demanded by just public opinion long ago but had been blocked by bureaucrats and vested interest groups until Chairman Chiang personally intervened to make them a reality. They also said that the government's measures are the most comprehensive to address the economic situation, but their prospects are not optimistic because their effectiveness depends on how they are implemented. Therefore, they pointed out that the implementation of the new measures is the greatest test of the government's administrative efficiency. We must see if the government has sufficient power to prohibit the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, control black market speculation, store gold, freeze gold, and daily necessities, and restore the level of the living index of January.

Lou Tongsun Discusses Measures Plan

[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Lou Tongsun, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan, said today that the Supreme National Defense Council's approval of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan shows that the government has recognized the economic crisis and its solution. Lou was the first in the Legislative Yuan to advocate banning gold and foreign currency transactions. It is said that if the measures in the plan can be faithfully implemented, they will be effective in stabilizing the national economy. The government's decision to collect the assets of Chinese people stored abroad to purchase food and major goods is commendable. According to a report from the US Treasury Department, in June 1941, the deposits of Chinese people in the United States were no less than US$356.4 million. If this foreign exchange is purchased by the government, it will make a great contribution to construction. The government should strictly supervise the use of production loans for private companies and factories. In the past, loans were often used for speculative transactions. Another legislator, Jian Guansan, supported Lou's proposal to control gold and foreign currency. It is said that this Economic Emergency Measures Plan is based on the painful economic experiences of the government in the past, implementing the slogans of increasing production to increase tax revenue and simplifying administration to save expenses. Its main purpose is to reduce the degree of inflation in China. Regarding the purchase of US dollar deposits of Chinese people, Jian made a further suggestion, advocating that the government should immediately request the United States. Various banks should temporarily freeze all deposits and securities owned by Chinese people, pending the issuance of 10- to 20-year government bonds by the Chinese government to purchase them. Jian strongly opposed the use of legal tender to purchase foreign exchange deposits, because a large amount of legal tender flooding the country would inevitably harm people's lives.

Two Thoughts from Xu Chuanlin

[This Newspaper] This reporter recently met with Xu Chuanlin, a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party, and asked him for his thoughts on the Economic Emergency Measures Plan. He replied: "I am not familiar with economics and cannot offer sophisticated opinions, but in general terms, I have two thoughts: (1) All current measures should first seek to stabilize people's hearts. If people's hearts are restless, it will have a ripple effect on prices. At the same time, attention should be paid to effectiveness during implementation to avoid causing criticism of the effect and further damaging the government's credibility; (2) It is necessary to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency in our country's market. First, any sovereign country can only use its own currency within its borders; second, our country has suffered eight years of hard fighting, and everything is devastated. Our economic strength is by no means comparable to that of the United States. During this period, if US dollars are circulated domestically and all prices are measured by them, then the purchasing power of legal tender will be even more severely depreciated once compared. I remember that when the British recovered Malaya, they immediately declared the 7 billion military tickets issued by Japan invalid and issued new currency for use. This move was very "poisonous," and overseas Chinese suffered greatly, but purely in technical terms, it was also successful, because they did not want a comparative standard for the country's currency to exist in the newly recovered area when the economy was not stable. Strictly speaking, the circulation of foreign currency should have been prohibited immediately after the victory, not today."

Sun Jiulu Comments on Economic Policy

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Sun Jiulu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, recently commented on the government's gold and foreign exchange policy, saying: "In addition to the objective and irresistible causes that have caused the current financial crisis and economic panic in China, the administrative authorities have been responsible for policy errors in the past. The two largest points are: (1) During the time when Kong Xiangxi was the Minister of Finance, he pegged the US dollar to 20 yuan of legal tender, creating an unreasonable situation in which prices and exchange rates were thousands of times apart. The government's benefit was that foreign currency could come to China and reap this small convenience, and many illegitimate foreign exchanges were used to escape from China at 20 yuan per US dollar. Later, when foreign exchange was raised, prices jumped, and the ratio of prices to exchange rates could never be made reasonable. If the exchange rate is not raised, foreign goods will be imported cheaply, and domestic production enterprises will never be able to stand on their own feet. This is Kong's policy error that he should be responsible for. (2) After the victory, Song Ziwen raised the US dollar exchange rate but supplied importers with unlimited foreign exchange, causing foreign goods to flood the market and preventing domestic production enterprises from surviving. This foreign exchange can be said to have been wasted in the past year, and it was truly a loss to the country. It was too late to use the import quota allocation method after it was out of control. This is Song's policy error that he should be responsible for. As for the government selling gold, the original intention was to contract the currency and suppress prices. I have always believed that this could not be done, so I did not agree with this policy when I was in Chongqing. Today, the government has decided that the Central Bank will no longer sell gold, which should have been done a long time ago, not today. This is different from gold nationalization. Nationalization must be done after political stability and currency stability, so as not to lose credibility with the people. Now the government has stopped selling gold, which means that the government will temporarily not set the legal tender price of gold and allow the people to treat all the gold in their hands as valuable luxury goods for preservation. Gold cannot be eaten or worn. Those who are obsessed with gold can buy it at a high price. Why not? But the only condition is to stabilize the prices of daily necessities so that they no longer rise and fall according to the price of gold. This is the government's serious task."

### Minister Peng's Important Statement; Refuting Foreign Media Distortions of the Chairman's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Minister Peng Xuepei issued the following statement at midnight on the 17th: "I have recently received an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on February 15, as reported in American newspapers. The dispatch contains several errors and distortions; some of its contents appear to be excerpts from Chairman Chiang's informal discussions with several American newspaper publishers and editors but completely change their meaning.

The Associated Press stated: 'Sources close to Chairman Chiang say that Chairman Chiang blames the United States for deciding to stop supplying arms and loans to China, thereby prolonging China's civil war.' I was present at the time, and I feel I must make a serious correction to this immediately. Chairman Chiang did not deny the right of the United States to stop selling arms or providing loans in his speech but expressed his unwillingness to make it public. He said that publicly announcing that the condition for selling arms and providing loans was for China to organize a coalition government containing the Communist Party would only make the CCP's attitude more rigid and refuse to negotiate with the government. To change this to Chairman Chiang blaming the United States for prolonging China's civil war is a clear distortion.

The Associated Press dispatch also said that Chairman Chiang's confidants said that the Chairman believes that if the United States continues to supply arms and loans, the Communist Party problem can be resolved more quickly and its troops can be defeated. This statement is also based on the Chairman's above-mentioned remarks, and the distortion is extremely obvious.

As for what the Associated Press quoted a senior official as saying, that Chairman Chiang deeply regrets that his arguments failed to move President Truman and General Marshall, this statement has not a single word that Chairman Chiang ever mentioned.

The Associated Press dispatch also said that Chairman Chiang sternly refused to accept the documents submitted by the political leaders of the CCP. This is presumably referring to the CCP's so-called document denying the treaties signed by the government. At that time, the responsible personnel in charge of receiving and sending documents in the National Government considered it strange and unfounded for a political party to deny the government's foreign treaties, so they returned the document."

### General Chen Returns to Nanjing

### Chairman Banquets American Personnel

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet at his official residence at 8:00 PM on the 17th, inviting a total of 18 American personnel and our military and political leaders. The ambassador and General Chen, among others, were invited.

### New Life Movement Association Holds Five Social Activities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] With the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement approaching, Huang Renlin, the Secretary-General of the Association, received reporters on the 17th and then explained the work of the New Life Movement in the 14th year, coordinating with the five major constructions to cultivate moral integrity and rectify people's hearts as psychological construction. To observe order and cultivate ethics as ethical construction. To popularize public education and pay attention to health as social construction. To improve the Ba and Jia and promote constitutional government as political construction. To practice frugality and strive for production as economic construction.

Telegram fees will increase tenfold, and telephone fees will increase fivefold. Currently, telegrams cost two yuan per word, and a telephone call between Changchun and Shenyang costs 34 yuan.

### Washington Officials Praise Our Country's Emergency Measures

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 17th] Officials and diplomatic circles here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's emergency measures to curb China's economic disorder. However, they expressed doubts about whether China's turbulent administrative structure could implement them.

Some people believe that this move is "a step in deciding who should truly lead China." This group believes that Chairman Chiang has realized that the United States cannot mediate China's internal conflicts and that Western economic aid may be insufficient and unable to stabilize China's economic disorder in time. Therefore, he has taken his own strong steps, disregarding the displeasure of outsiders and old forces.

### National Forces Make Progress Between Peiping and Baoding; Communist Forces Launch Counterattack on Xushui and Are Repelled; Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies Outside Jiangcheng

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] National forces have made repeated progress between Peiping and Baoding. The National forces advancing southwest from Yishui and Gucheng reached the south bank of the Baoshui River on the 16th. The Communist forces fled to the mountains. Mancheng is now in sight.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 17th] A small-scale battle is underway in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The Communist forces, with a force three times larger than the National forces, numbering more than 50,000, are maneuvering with the National forces around Baoding and are showing signs of decline. A military expert said that the Communist forces' formation is "one point, two surfaces," forming a triangular shape. Their point in Mancheng is already under the encirclement of the National forces on three sides. The "surface" of Xushui Caohe has also been defeated, and the Communist forces have suffered heavy losses. Now, fierce fighting is taking place in the area of ​​Dawangzhuang, Yaocunzhen, and Suichengzhen, another "surface" west of Xushui. Suicheng has been captured by the National forces. Fierce fighting is underway in Yaocunzhen today. The Communist forces have surrounded Yaocun with six brigades. Strong reinforcements from the National forces arrived last night and encircled them in turn. Military authorities said that the outcome can be decided tonight. After this "surface" of Communist forces is defeated, Mancheng will collapse without being attacked. Rumors that Sun Lianzhong went to Zhuozhou to supervise the battle are inaccurate.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] At 10 PM on the 16th, 5,000 Communist troops launched a counterattack, re-attacking Xushui, and invaded the South Gate, engaging in fierce fighting with the defending troops. They were repelled this morning. Also, fierce fighting is taking place in Qicun North, Dawangzhuang South, and Caohe West, all belonging to Mancheng. The Communist troops inside Mancheng are preparing to withdraw.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 17th] Two companies of National forces in Dongximacun and Ximacun, 20 li southwest of Zhuoxian in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, were besieged by more than 5,000 Communist troops last night. The National forces in Zhuoxian rushed to reinforce them, and fierce fighting broke out again this afternoon. Fierce fighting is still taking place between the two armies outside Mancheng. The National forces have always maintained a favorable position. The railway damaged between Xushui and Caohe is being repaired.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 17th] After Tongxian was attacked, the periphery of Peiping is being mopped up and is gradually stabilizing.

### Eight Years of War Devastation; China Suffers Heavy Losses; Report Submitted by the United Nations Secretariat

[Central News Agency New York Dispatch, 16th] The United Nations Secretariat has submitted a draft report detailing the tragic devastation suffered by China during the eight years of war. This report serves as the basis for the Far East Working Group on War Disaster Areas to submit a report to the Economic and Social Council next month. The full text of this report has not yet been published, but it is known that this massive document includes a general survey of war disasters in the Far East, as well as the situation in individual countries. The report on the situation in China is as follows:

Nine Million Deaths; Forty Million Houses Needed

(1) Living conditions and manpower: It is estimated that the number of war deaths reached 9 million. At the same time, due to the war, millions of people died from diseases and injuries. Survivors were forced to leave their homes due to poverty, malnutrition, and difficult living conditions. At the same time, due to the lack of education, they have suffered greatly both physically and mentally, and most of them have not been able to return to their homes due to the disruption of transportation and the instability of the situation. (2) Housing problem: Except for Shanghai, it is estimated that China currently needs more than 40 million houses.

School Facilities Extremely Inadequate; Clothing Shortages Difficult to Restore

(3) Education: During the war, educational facilities in the Japanese-occupied areas of China were destroyed by the Japanese, so it is very difficult to promote education in these areas after the war. It is estimated that the number of students enrolled in schools at all levels in China increased greatly in 1946, but the facilities in the schools are still extremely inadequate, especially in middle and high schools. Moreover, China's general education level has declined due to the war. (4) Clothing: At the end of the war, China's cotton production decreased to one-third of its pre-war production. At the same time, due to its slow recovery, in 1946, it still did not reach 38% of pre-war production. This means that the clothing shortage that China has experienced in the past eight years "seems unlikely to be remedied in the long term."

Food Imports Will Continue; 90% of Machinery Lost

(5) Food and agriculture: Surveys conducted last year showed that there were famines of varying degrees in various regions of China. It is estimated that there are 6 million residents in the famine and plague areas of Guangxi, and about 10 million in the famine and plague areas of Hunan. Although a bumper harvest is predicted, it can alleviate some of the famine. However, in the long term, the search for and purchase of large quantities of food imports will continue, and the only way to quickly solve the food shortage problem is to expand agricultural production. With the assistance of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, some progress has been made in the reclamation of flooded and abandoned farmland, as well as in the establishment of fisheries. (6) Industry and mining: Due to the war, the bombing of the occupied areas by the Allied forces, and the situation at the time of the takeover, it is estimated that China lost 90% of its original industrial machinery. It is reported that the only industries that can maintain 15% to 20% of their pre-war production are the steel and coal power industries. However, some recent signs have indicated a significant recovery in the coal mining sector.

Insufficient Transportation Reconstruction; Railway Materials Most Needed

(7) Transportation and traffic: The war has caused huge losses to China's railway vehicles. At the same time, reconstruction efforts are extremely insufficient. Currently, the most urgently needed are railway materials to restore railway traffic from Hangzhou to Quzhou and from Hengyang to Guilin. According to further estimates, even after the entire United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's railway plan is completed, it will continue to support China's various rehabilitation needs. It is estimated that imports of railway transportation to China will exceed US$40,000 within two years. During the war, China lost 30,000 tons of fishing boats, and more than half of the total tonnage of other ships was also lost. It is expected that 160 surplus ships from the United States, totaling 800,000 tons, will soon be transferred to China. Eventually, China's shipping tonnage will reach 1.5 million tons, which is temporarily sufficient for domestic navigation. However, to restore China's total commercial shipping needs, it will require US$300 million. A two-year highway restoration plan will require more than US$100 million, and the needs for telecommunications and air transport will reach US$50 million.

Imports Exceed Exports by More Than Four Times; Low Salaries for Civil Servants

Regarding the payment of foreign trade, China's import rate appears to be more than four times its export rate. The most recent import and export figures for the first eleven months of 1945 show that imports exceeded exports by US$450 million. Calculated at the official exchange rate, imports from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are not included, and these imports can increase this figure by 20%. The recovery of China's foreign trade after the war has been "disappointing" due to the unsound state of production and transportation, and the excessively high prices of export goods due to inflation. A serious consequence of fiscal inflation is the low salaries of civil servants. China is facing a major problem of balancing its international payments. However, food, resources, foreign assets, and enemy property can still be used to alleviate the problem. The fundamental problem is the imbalance in the national budget.

### Ministry of Communications to Build Guilin-Zhanjiang Railway; 188 Kilometers Long from Liuzhou to Zhanjiang; Construction Cost of 300 Billion Yuan Scheduled to Start in June

The plan is for the re-surveying work along the line to be completed, and construction is scheduled to begin in June this year.

Editorial

### Politics More Important Than Economics

The economic crisis caused by the gold rush has now led to the adoption of an economic emergency measures plan by the Supreme National Defense Council. The government will vigorously implement ten emergency measures. Given this spirit and determination to deal with the current economic crisis, as long as it can be thoroughly and earnestly implemented, overcoming the current economic difficulties should be no problem sooner or later. The people of the whole country, who have not seen stable governance since the war, naturally place deep expectations on the adoption of this decision. They feel that the difficulties in their lives are mainly due to the constant fluctuations in prices. Under the current situation in our country, even if they do not harbor extravagant hopes for lower prices, they still hope that general prices can stabilize so that they can have some respite. Originally, price fluctuations and the economic crisis caused by price fluctuations are economic phenomena. The changes in economic phenomena are governed by economic laws. Understanding and properly applying these economic laws may well overcome these economic difficulties and guide the national economy onto the right track. However, in our country, the current economic crisis seems to be caused more by political relations than by economic relations. Political factors played a role in creating the current economic crisis. Therefore, after the government has come up with emergency measures to deal with the current economic crisis, we must point out that the importance of political measures to resolve our economic crisis is no less than that of economic measures. In a sense, political measures may be even more important than economic measures: this is what is meant by politics being more important than economics.

In terms of politics, there are at least three aspects to dealing with and resolving the current economic crisis.

First, when we read Chairman Chiang's remarks after the economic emergency measures plan was passed, we can clearly understand that the current economic crisis in our country is mainly caused by the Communist Party's disregard for national interests and deliberate sabotage. "From the above, we must be able to deeply understand that the current economic difficulties are actually due to the destruction suffered in the eight years of the War of Resistance and the disruption of the country and the destruction of peace by the Communist Party in the past year." It can be seen that our wise chairman has explained to us the main causes of the current economic difficulties without reservation. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed and elaborated on this point. The Communist Party's armed rebellion and sabotage of transportation have prevented the national economy from recovering, and they have stirred up trouble and disrupted finance. All these facts should be known to the people of the country. As long as the Communist Party's rebellion does not stop for a day, the national economic crisis cannot be resolved for a day. Even if the government has economic magic strategies, if the Communist Party problem is not resolved for a day, this magic strategy will inevitably be attacked. After the war, the most urgent measure for the government to take to save the national economy is to reorganize the currency system. The reason why the currency system has not been reorganized is because of the Communist Party's sabotage. To resolve our economic crisis, we must first resolve the Communist Party problem.

Second, the ten emergency measures formulated by the government are good in law and intention, and are an appropriate measure. However, due to the accumulated malpractices in politics over the years, even if the government has good laws and well-intentioned policies, they often lose their original meaning during implementation and become a pie in the sky. The painful experiences of wartime are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, these emergency measures must not fail again, only success is allowed. To ensure the success of these measures, we must strengthen administrative efficiency, which in the negative aspect is to prevent the recurrence of malpractices. Our national economy has reached a critical juncture, and we must not allow the people's lives, which are already in dire straits, to be hit again. Therefore, these emergency measures must be implemented earnestly and strictly assessed. Those who engage in corruption and fraud must be punished with the penalties they deserve. This is also a political issue, an issue of how to maintain political discipline and administrative efficiency. For this problem, there is nothing more than diligent assessment, clear rewards and punishments, and a clear distinction between right and wrong must be made. It is essential not to confuse black and white, so as not to discourage the generally loyal and self-respecting people, and even cause them to follow the crowd. The plan is important, but the most important thing is whether the implementation fully conforms to the original intention of deciding on this plan.

Third, the gold market craze has now passed, but the people have suffered enormous damage. Although the causes of this craze are not simple, the authorities in charge of finance and economy have failed to prevent it beforehand and have failed to respond properly after it occurred. It is difficult to shirk the blame for mistakes and dereliction of duty. Yesterday, the National Assembly representatives and senators staying in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Chairman, suggesting seven items, including this point: "Investigate the responsibilities of the highest responsible persons for financial and economic policy failures, rectify discipline, and restore public confidence." We feel that this point really needs to be considered and adopted. This is another political measure, but it is related to the future of our national economy. If the responsibilities of the highest responsible persons for financial and economic policy failures are not investigated, how can the government claim to maintain political discipline and strengthen administrative efficiency to the people who have suffered enormous damage?

In short, the current economic crisis in our country is not just an economic problem, but also a political problem. We must start from both economic and political aspects before there is hope for a solution. The ten emergency measures adopted by the government are appropriate measures, but we hope that there will also be parallel political measures at the same time, so that we can resolve the current crisis.

### Strategic Islands in the Pacific; US Requests Exclusive Trusteeship; Formally Submits Draft Agreement to the Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] Disregarding the advice of Britain and the Soviet Union, the United States today requested the United Nations Security Council to place the Pacific islands formerly under Japanese control under US trusteeship. According to US sources last night, a draft trusteeship agreement for the strategic locations of the Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, and Caroline Islands will be submitted to the United Nations today, requesting that it be included in the current agenda. However, according to the most reliable sources, if Britain and the Soviet Union insist that this matter should not be discussed temporarily and should be decided after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, then the United States may also agree to postpone the discussion indefinitely. US officials here have received instructions to fully explain the US proposal for exclusive trusteeship of the islands when the Security Council meets today.

President Truman publicly stated in November of last year the conditions under which the United States would seek exclusive defense of the Pacific islands. At the same time, the United States believes that the relevant governments have also requested them to express their opinions on this US proposal. Both Britain and the Soviet Union subsequently notified the US State Department that they believed this matter should wait until after negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty. Australia also submitted a similar advisory note to the United States, pointing out that Australia would welcome the US trusteeship of these islands when the appropriate time comes. The contents of the British and Soviet notes have not been made public by the US, but it is heard that neither country has raised any detailed objections to the US proposal. Officials in Washington frankly admit that the US Army and Navy are determined to place this strategically important area under absolute US control, even if the Security Council opposes this trusteeship plan. They stated that the United States has no intention of accepting any changes to the main principles of this proposal.

The US prefers to submit this issue directly to the Security Council for handling rather than submitting it to the Trusteeship Committee or the United Nations General Assembly, because what the US is requesting is the trusteeship of a strategic area where foreigners are not allowed to enter in part or in whole, and where any naval, land, and air military bases and fortresses needed by the US will be constructed. According to the United Nations Charter, strategic trusteeship proposals are directly under the jurisdiction of the Security Council.

### Britain Plans to Ask the United Nations to Convene an Emergency Meeting to Handle the Palestine Issue; The Security Council Launches Atomic Warfare Today

[United Press, Lake Success, 17th] The British government may request the United Nations General Assembly to convene an emergency meeting to handle the Palestine issue. British officials have decided to bypass the Security Council and submit the case directly to the United Nations General Assembly or the Trusteeship Council. The British Labour government firmly believes that the seriousness of the situation in Palestine warrants the immediate convening of a special meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. However, it is not yet certain whether other countries will agree. The next regular session of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in New York in October. The members of the General Assembly believe that the Palestine dispute cannot be submitted to the Trusteeship Council before it has been addressed by the General Assembly. The first meeting of the Trusteeship Council is scheduled to be held on the 26th of next month to handle the issues of various trusteeship territories, and Palestine is one of the issues.

As for the Security Council, its current agenda is already entangled and unclear. Britain is happy to no longer submit another entangled Palestine issue to it. The debate on the issue of atomic energy control will resume in the Security Council on Tuesday. It is said that the Soviet representative will present his original ten control proposals at that time, and Britain will re-submit its long-delayed Albania issue on Wednesday. The Security Council is also prepared to accept the Albania issue. Albanian representative Kapo arrived here on Saturday to prepare a reply to Britain's accusation that it laid mines in the Corfu Strait, endangering forty-four British sailors.

### Izvestia Accuses US of Anti-Soviet Union

[United Press, Moscow, 16th] The Izvestia newspaper carried a report today stating that the US Republican Party is prepared to unite with Britain to carry out a "military attack" on the Soviet Union. The newspaper accused US political commentator Dulles of making remarks on the eve of the four foreign ministers' conference to undermine US-Soviet negotiations. Since the Republican Party gained a majority in Congress last autumn, this attack by Izvestia is the most intense. It is claimed that Dulles and other Republican leaders have engaged in undermining peace, and the reason for their anti-Soviet movement is that the Soviet Union has recently "proven in United Nations meetings that the United States is an imperialist armed country." Dulles's speech in New York on January 17 was actually a response to Churchill's request for British-American cooperation, and his words were tantamount to saying, "Mr. Churchill, we Republicans are prepared to accelerate uniting with Britain to carry out a military offensive against the Soviet Union."

### US Disarmament: Three Major Prerequisites

Nimitz Delivers Speech

[United Press, Washington, 17th] US Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz said in a speech at a university today, "The US can only reduce its military strength after three prerequisites have been met: (1) the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty to eliminate the causes of future wars; (2) there must be reliable guarantees, including a monitoring system; (3) there must be reasonable assurance that the United Nations organization is a truly effective organization. If all countries can cooperate sincerely, another great war is not inevitable."

### Soviet Union to Build a Large Sluice Gate in Siberia

[French News Agency, Moscow, 16th] Moscow Radio announced that the Soviet Union will build a sluice gate on the Angara River in central Siberia, with a power generation capacity equivalent to the Soviet Union's famous Dnieper River Sluice Gate.

### Franco Expresses Willingness to Step Down Voluntarily if Necessary

[French News Agency, Madrid, 16th] Franco recently told an American reporter that if he believes that his abandonment of power is necessary to save Spain, he would be happy to do so. Some quarters have accused us of assisting Germany during the war. In fact, our trade with Germany never reached pre-war levels. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, Britain and France had already declared war on the Axis powers, and it was well known that Japan would eventually participate in the war. However, the United States continued to ship arms and chemicals to Japan until a few weeks before the Pearl Harbor incident. This may have been a deceptive diplomatic tactic by the United States, but there is no reason why we cannot adopt the same tactic. As for the steps taken by the United Nations towards Spain, countries that have recalled their ambassadors to Spain should also recall their ambassadors to Poland, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union, he said.

### Japanese House of Representatives to Be Dissolved at the End of the Month; Re-election to Be Held on April 25

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese Cabinet decided today to dissolve the House of Representatives on the 28th of this month, and then hold another election on April 25, so that "national public opinion can be expressed in a democratic way" in accordance with MacArthur's instructions. The House of Councillors is scheduled to be elected on April 20 to replace the House of Peers, whose members were previously appointed by the Emperor. Municipal councils and village councils are scheduled to be elected on April 30, and local government officials are scheduled to be elected on April 5. Popular election of officials is an unprecedented event in Japanese history. The new constitution will be implemented on May 3 after the national and local elections are completed. MacArthur's headquarters said that it does not oppose the election dates decided by the Japanese cabinet.

Hirohito's Property Reaches 3 Billion Yen

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Emperor Hirohito and his family today completed the declaration of all their property in accordance with the new property tax law, totaling 3 billion yen. This property will be taxed by the government. Royal property is taxed the same as civilian property, which is an unprecedented event in Japanese history. The property tax paid by the royal family will account for 90% of its total property value, so the property that it can actually retain will be very little.

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] There are currently 93,000 police officers in Japan. The Ministry of Home Affairs plans to increase the number to 130,000 starting in April to maintain law and order during chaotic times. During the war, the number of police officers in Japan was reduced from 90,000 to 70,000. After the surrender, the army was disbanded, and the number of police officers increased to the current number.

Japanese Buddhists Oppose the Communist Party

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th, United Press] The Tokyo Times claims that 5 million Japanese Buddhists are expected to launch a political offensive against the Communist Party during the election to be held in April because Buddhism has realized that the Communist Party is launching an anti-religious movement.

### On the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference

Yoshida Hopes for Speedy Convening

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Prime Minister Yoshida indicated today that he believes Japan will be able to have a representative attend the conference in which the Allied countries will finally decide on the contents of the Japanese peace treaty. Answering inquiries in the House of Peers meeting, Yoshida admitted that this situation has not been completely determined, and Japan's representative will be decided and elected after the outline of the peace treaty has been established. For the sake of Japan's revival, he hopes that the peace treaty conference can be held as soon as possible and that Japan can be granted permission to participate in international trade.

### Rumors that the US Agrees to Abolish the "Enemy Trade Agreement"

Japanese Trade May Become More Active

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] An authoritative source here told a United Press reporter today that the "Enemy Trade Agreement" governing commerce between Japan and the US will be abolished within a month after Japan's surrender. However, this does not mean that private trade with Japan can be completely opened up. The control of the Allied Headquarters will continue to be maintained, and all import and export trade will temporarily be handled by the original agencies. It is said that at the beginning of January, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Allied Headquarters whether it agreed to cancel the trade agreement. The Headquarters immediately replied that it agreed. Since then, there have been various signs that the agreement can be abolished in three or four weeks.

Britain Is Willing to Restore Trade Relations with Japan

Near a small lake west of Hanoi, the Viet Minh attempted to infiltrate but were repelled by French forces. In other parts of the western suburbs, French forces are advancing house by house. According to French sources, Viet Minh radio announced that President Ho Chi Minh, at the request of a representative of the International Red Cross, has agreed to release some prisoners and children currently under Viet Minh protection.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 16th] Viet Minh representative in India, Mei Dezhou, today called on Viet Minh friends throughout Asia to provide the Viet Minh with moral, military, economic, and medical assistance.

### British Monarch Arrives in South Africa; Unprecedented Enthusiasm at Cape Town Landing; Royal Train Magnificent and Splendid

[United Press, Cape Town, 17th] The British Royal Family arrived here today aboard the "Vanguard" at 8:20 AM (4:20 PM Shanghai time).

### Severe Coal Shortage in Britain; Recovery Still Distant

[Our Dispatch] London, 17th Broadcast: The London climate remains below freezing today. Authorities acknowledge that coal reserves increased slightly over the weekend, but recovery is still distant. Factory shutdowns have resulted in increased unemployment, with as many as five million people idle. British Prime Minister Attlee and his cabinet continue to discuss relief measures.

### Britain Attempts to Repudiate Debt to India

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 16th] Negotiations between British and Indian representatives regarding Britain's debt of £1.4 billion to India have concluded. According to the British representatives, this debt is of a war debt nature, a portion of which was used to "defend India against Japanese aggression," and is therefore different from ordinary commercial debt. The Indian side strongly opposes writing off or reducing this debt. Financial circles here are pessimistic about Britain's ability to repay the debt.

### Who Will Be the Candidates in the Next US Presidential Election?

[United Press, Washington] Since the Republican Party gained control of both houses of Congress, the general trend has been to prevent the development of international economicism and focus attention on domestic labor-management relations, domestic markets, tax rates, veterans' benefits, and agricultural product prices. If this trend continues until 1948, the main tasks of the next US president will be: (1) to adopt a policy of reconciling US national interests with the world political system on issues such as protective tariffs and surplus agricultural products; (2) to balance the budget while further reducing taxes; (3) to establish a stable situation between organized labor rights and capitalists; (4) to expand the stability of agricultural product prices and control surplus agricultural product plans; and (5) to satisfy veterans' requests for assistance. Due to the Republican Party regaining control of both houses of Congress, the possibility of a Republican president being elected has greatly increased, and it is receiving attention. Historically, there are many precedents for a party that gains a majority in midterm elections to continue to hold power.

However, President Truman still maintains his leadership position within the Democratic Party, especially after Marshall expressed no other political ambitions. The new Secretary of State's goal is only to succeed within the cabinet and does not want to hinder Truman from becoming the presidential candidate in 1948.

As for the Republican Party, hoping to win in 1948, the most pressing question is: who can be elected?

This candidate should preferably be an efficient legislator and administrator rather than a reformer and idealist. Currently, New York Governor Dewey, Senator Vandenberg, and Taft are the most popular figures in the Republican Party. Others such as Senator Bricker, former Minnesota Governor Stassen, and California Governor Warren are also not without hope. If a political deadlock occurs at the Republican National Convention next year, it is not impossible for someone unexpected to be elected as a candidate. With Marshall not participating in the candidate race, the Republican Party is no longer discussing military figures such as MacArthur as candidates. Washington is rumored that New York Governor Dewey is the most promising Republican candidate. Senator Vandenberg, although popular, is in a very important political position as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and may take a backseat. Senator Taft also does not seem very concerned about the presidential candidacy because of his important position in the Republican-controlled Senate. Senator Bricker has also not adopted an active attitude towards the presidential candidacy. As for Stassen, he remains a mystery in American domestic politics. Some believe that Stassen's failure to run for senator last year was a mistake because once elected, he would have received attention. However, although Stassen does not currently hold public office, he is eager to try for the presidency in the future and has established his office in Washington. This is unprecedented in American history. Warren's election as Governor of California, supported by both the Republican and Democratic parties, and his reputation as an effective administrative expert, will make him a "dark horse" in 1948.

On the Democratic side, some speculate that current Secretary of Commerce Harriman may be the Democratic candidate in 1948. However, it is generally expected that he will only be a vice-presidential candidate. As for what Wallace's position will be in the future, it remains a subject of much debate. He is clearly no longer valued by the Democratic Party, but some political researchers believe that major changes in the international or economic situation may make it possible for him to become a progressive or third-party presidential candidate. However, such candidates may not receive many votes.

The Division of the American New Deal Faction

[Reuters, Washington] The left wing and progressives of the American New Deal faction will need at least four years to recover from the successive blows of President Roosevelt's death and the Republican victory after the war. Some even say that the left wing and progressives will not be able to raise their heads until six or eight years later. Furthermore, within these factions, the issue of being pro-communist or not has made it impossible to concentrate their strength for the time being.

Among them, the leading figures of the left wing include former Secretary of Commerce Wallace, former UNRRA Director LaGuardia, former Assistant Secretary of State MacLeish, and former National Citizens Political Action Committee President Kintner. They advocate a more reasonable and friendly policy towards the Soviet Union.

New Deal figures with different views include Mrs. Roosevelt and her son, former Price Administrator Henderson, Bowles, and former War Information Bureau Director Davis. They advocate a clear demarcation between genuine progressivism and pro-communism, and they particularly approve of former Secretary of State Byrnes' policy towards the Soviet Union.

The aforementioned two factions of New Deal figures have each established their own organizations. Wallace's group is called the "American Progressive Citizens Association," which is formed by combining the forces of the "Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions" and the "National Citizens Political Action Committee." It advocates expanding and continuing Roosevelt's New Deal domestic policies. In foreign policy, it advocates opposing fascism and imperialism and demands actively changing the State Department's current foreign policy. The opposing organization is called the "American Democratic Action Society," which was formed by Mrs. Roosevelt and several former government officials to counter the former two organizations that were accused of being communist. They advocate expanding and continuing the domestic policies of the late President Roosevelt and seem to approve of most of the State Department's foreign policy.

The number of left-wing members of American labor unions who support the former two factions is roughly equal. In addition to being divided over the communist issue, New Deal figures are also difficult to reconcile over the issue of whether to form a third party. Some advocate supporting any progressive figures in the two major parties, some advocate continuing to maintain ties with the Democratic Party, and some advocate directly establishing a third party. It is expected that within a few years, the first three opinions will not be able to reach an agreement.

### Mayor Convenes Meeting of Leaders from Various Industries; Minister Wang Invited to Attend and Express Government's Intentions; Elaborates on Key Points of Economic Plan; Expresses Deep Hope for People's Cooperation to Overcome Difficulties

[Our Dispatch] After the central government announced the emergency economic measures plan, Mayor Wu convened leaders from the city's industrial and commercial sectors at the City Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, and invited Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Wentao to participate, adjourning at 11:00 AM. Wang gave a detailed explanation of the economic measures that have been decided upon this time: regarding the implementation of price controls, he believed that it would only be effective if the people and the government had close cooperation. Regarding the balancing the budget item in this plan, the main focus is on reducing non-urgent expenditures and emphasizing private enterprises. State-owned enterprises already operated by the government, or state-owned enterprises that are about to be operated by the government, can be publicly sold to private ownership, with the intention of guiding floating capital to the right track.

Regarding suppressing speculation and stabilizing the financial market: Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles have two contradictions. On the one hand, there is a shortage of funds, and they request the government to handle industrial and commercial loans; on the other hand, there is a surplus of floating capital, and they compete to speculate in gold trading. The government, in view of the high domestic industrial costs, high wages, and difficulty in exporting domestic products, in order to compete for foreign markets, has introduced a 100% subsidy and a 50% import surcharge. Unexpectedly, after the implementation of this method, foreign goods skyrocketed, and domestic goods also rose accordingly, far exceeding 50%, the reason being that the people failed to cooperate with the government. This time, the decision to suppress gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency is mainly intended to stabilize prices. Furthermore, increasing foreign exchange is also intended to encourage exports. The government is now preparing to use US$200 million for the normal import of industrial products. However, the government hopes that after this time, the limited foreign exchange will be controlled, and that the people of the whole country will develop the habit of using domestic goods.

Regarding wages being based on the January index as the highest point, it is deeply hoped that the labor community will appreciate the government's sincerity and work hard on their own. At the same time, under the principle of taking care of the lives of workers, the government will implement universal distribution of food, cloth, and fuel. As for price controls and the supply of daily necessities, the government has decided to strictly implement them according to the "Regulations for the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry and Commerce During Extraordinary Times" and the "Regulations for Suppressing Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations". At the same time, it is also hoped that leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors will cooperate with the government, each with patriotic enthusiasm, to support each other through difficulties and overcome the difficulties together.

Next, Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the City General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, saying that what he wanted to say was that after the foreign exchange, gold, and US dollar issues were resolved, the price issue still could not be resolved. At the same time, he hoped that the government would not harass legitimate merchants when thoroughly investigating gold and US dollar speculation incidents.

Mayor Puts Forward Two Points

Finally, the Mayor delivered a speech: he said that recently the price fluctuations in this city have been very severe, as the City General Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu and Director Luo said at the City Hall's price discussion meeting some days ago, although the prices of various items have risen in a straight line, very few goods have been traded, indicating that price fluctuations are unfavorable to all industries. He would like to put forward two points for discussion with everyone: (1) Some days ago, the black market price of gold in this city rose to 9.7 million yuan, and the black market price of US dollars rose to 21,000 yuan. Now, the central bank has regulations for the price of gold, and the government has also stipulated the price of US dollars as 12,000 yuan in national currency equivalent to one US dollar. Gold and US dollars have both seen a decline in price, and the prices of various items should fall in proportion, and should never rise again. (2) The laws and regulations set by the government are very strict, but he is concerned that in the future, social capital will once again be transferred to hoarding goods. He deeply hopes that everyone will tell each industry not to hoard for profit, especially daily necessities related to people's livelihoods, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and food. Regarding economic measures, the government does not want to use political pressure, and hopes that each industry will cooperate with the government and work together to overcome difficulties. If there are any difficulties, the government will be responsible for finding ways to solve them. Regarding the detailed methods for stabilizing prices and suppressing prices, please ask the City General Chamber of Commerce to convene a detailed discussion with the industry associations of each industry in the city tomorrow. It would be even better if Minister Wang could participate, and he will definitely participate at that time.

### Chamber of Commerce Convenes Price Conference

[Our Dispatch] The City General Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a price conference at 3:00 PM today in the standing committee room of the Chamber. Each industry association under the Chamber will send the chairman and one standing director to attend the discussion. It is estimated that the number of attendees will be over 300. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Mayor Wu Guozhen will both be invited to attend.

Finally, Deputy Minister Xu listened to the opinions provided by the attendees, and the meeting adjourned after 4:00 PM.

[Our Dispatch] Deputy Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan brought the emergency economic measures plan to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday afternoon and exchanged views with the Economic Supervisory Team on ways to suppress prices.

[Our Dispatch] After being stimulated by the Westmoreland Road fire case, all 514 firefighters in the city's fire department recently submitted their resignations.

### Gu Chunfan Transferred to Head of Savings and Remittance Bureau; When He Will Go to Nanjing Is Still Uncertain

[Our Dispatch] Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, was recently transferred to be the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau.

### Propaganda Tool of the Puppet Regime, "China Film" General Manager Feng Jie's Trial Concludes; Also Claims to Have Received Secret Orders from the Central Government

[This newspaper] Feng Jie, accused of being a traitor, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning. Feng Jie, styled Jieru, is from Shunde, Guangdong, and is 44 years old. In 1940, he served as the education director of the Propaganda Training Institute of the puppet Propaganda Department. In 1941, he also served as a standing committee member of the puppet Relief Committee. In June 1943, he was elected as an alternate central committee member of the puppet regime and served as the deputy minister of the puppet Propaganda Department. He then became the director of the Shanghai Office of the puppet Propaganda Department, the general manager and executive director of the puppet China Film Company, and other positions. Anti-British and anti-American films such as "Regrets of Spring River" and "Ten Thousand Generations of Glory" were produced under Feng's supervision during his tenure as general manager of "China Film." Feng, who appeared thin, testified in court yesterday that he had received secret orders from the Central Government in 1939 to engage in intelligence work within the puppet regime. After 1940, he used his puppet positions to cover his work and presented several pieces of evidence.

### Sun Biwei's Traitor Suspicions; Yan Huiqing Called to Testify

The High Court held its first hearing yesterday. The defendant was tall and wore black riding breeches, a wool overcoat, and a gray-blue woolen scarf. The court asked: "Is it true that Sun Zhongli has gone to the United States?" The defendant replied: "I have not met Sun Zhongli for a long time and do not know where he is now." He flatly denied the accusations in the indictment that he helped Sun Zhongli purchase wheat and grains, providing resources to the enemy, and that he used bank funds for speculation. Yan Huiqing was then called to testify, stating that the defendant had not engaged in any activities on behalf of the enemy or puppet regime. Finally, attorney Duan Benkai presented documents favorable to the defendant. The court ordered the defendant to post a cash bail of 10 million yuan and provide a guarantee from a substantial business establishment, pending further hearing at a later date.

### Under the Supervision of the Supervisory Group, Merchants Dare Not Act Recklessly

[This newspaper] The Economic Supervisory Group officially began its work yesterday. After meeting yesterday morning to discuss the implementation steps and various technical matters requiring attention, the responsible personnel of the group began their work separately. The Gold and Currency Group continued to investigate the gold trading accounts of various banks and gold shops and illegal acceptance of gold mortgages, confirming that the Central Bank had sold a total of over 16,000 gold bars since the 13th of this month. The investigation of other banks and gold shops could not be completed in a day or two, so no results had been announced as of yesterday. Reports that the authorities had submitted a blacklist of over 100 people suspected of manipulating speculation to Chairman Chiang were inaccurate. According to the person in charge of the group yesterday, the blacklist has not yet been finalized as the investigation is still ongoing. The Food Group dispatched personnel throughout the day to monitor transactions in the North and South Rice Markets and implement the policy of requiring rice prices to fall by 4,000-5,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight) each day. Therefore, the situation in the rice market yesterday was very good, with white japonica rice falling back to 115,000 yuan per dan. The Yarn and Cloth Group, fearing that speculative funds would shift in this direction after the ban on gold and currency trading, closely monitored the market. Merchants did not dare to act recklessly, and yarn prices also fell slightly. Today, personnel from each group will continue to investigate accounts and monitor the market, and rice and yarn prices are expected to continue to fall.

### Compensation for War of Resistance Losses Should Await Unified Planning; Executive Yuan Denies Municipal Government's Request

[This newspaper] The Municipal Government requested instructions from the Central Government, citing a resolution passed at the first meeting of the Municipal Council, requesting that the government advance the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of the city for the losses suffered during the War of Resistance. It is learned that the Municipal Government has now received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan stating: "It is not appropriate to use the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties in a certain area as compensation for the war losses in that area. All proceeds from the aforementioned sales should be submitted to the National Treasury in full. How to allocate funds for loss compensation in the future should await unified planning by the Central Government. The Shanghai Municipal Council's request to advance the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet properties confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of the city for their losses is difficult to approve."

However, the Municipal Government believes that the second meeting of the Municipal Council also made similar recommendations, which are related to public opinion, and will resubmit the matter to the Central Government for review.

However, a person in charge of a certain company said yesterday that if the rush to purchase gasoline disappears after the price increase, the rationing system may not be necessary, as the company finds this system quite troublesome. The reason for adopting it this time is following the recommendation of the Public Utilities Bureau.

### Preliminary Hearing of Car Repair Corruption Case; Collusion to Issue False Invoices; All Suspected of Corruption

[This newspaper] Last summer, when the Investigation Group came to Shanghai, the corruption case of the Municipal Government's automobile receivership, which was first discovered and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, was investigated by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Prosecutor's Office. Based on the list of vehicles transferred by Shen Zhenjia, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, to Chen Wusong, and the original list of vehicles received by the Municipal Government, the condition of the vehicles was clearly stated. Among them, three Chevrolet trucks received from the puppet Air Defense Headquarters were produced in 1940 and had completely new components. However, Feng Peifang of Wan Tai Motor Company issued repair invoices for these three vehicles, totaling 4,955,000 yuan. In addition, three Ford sedans were property of the traitor Wang Jingwei, with only the batteries damaged. However, Chen Wusong's report stated that they were dilapidated and unusable. Using this kind of fraudulent method, it was confirmed that 16 intact vehicles were not actually repaired, and Chen Wusong colluded with Wan Tai Motor Company to issue repair invoices, defrauding more than 40 million yuan. Therefore, the two defendants were suspected of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 3, Clause 6, and Article 5 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption and were prosecuted according to law.

Chen Wusong Claims: Never Profited

The case was preliminarily heard at the District Court at 3:00 PM yesterday. Shi Bangrui, the former director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Shen Zhenjia, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department, did not appear in court. Presiding Judge Meng Tingke signed for the defendants, Chen Wusong, the former head of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, and Feng Peifang, the manager of Wan Tai Motor Repair Shop, to be brought to court. According to Chen, all received vehicles were first appraised, rated, and a vehicle score table was compiled. Vehicles with a score of 60 or more could be used, and vehicles with a score of less than 60 had a separate damage report prepared and submitted for approval before ordering repairs from the repair shop. The procedures were complicated, and corruption was impossible. He also claimed that he never profited from it. Regarding the repair of new cars, Chen argued that new cars left unused for a long time would have rusty parts that needed to be replaced, which should not be regarded as evidence of corruption. He also said that after Mayor Wu took office, he sent Yang Ke to Wan Tai Motor Company three times in June of last year to repair cars, which proves that there was no corruption in Wan Tai's repairs.

Feng Peifang Claims: Very Low Profit Margin

The second defendant, Feng Peifang, claimed that he was a legitimate businessman who had been engaged in the automobile business for decades. He accepted the business from the Municipal Government to establish credit, so the profit margin he took was particularly low. Moreover, the repair of Municipal Government cars was carried out on-site in the Municipal Government parking lot. After the repairs were completed, the Municipal Government had to send someone to inspect and accept them. There was no case of issuing false invoices and colluding for fraud. The defense lawyers for both defendants applied for bail, but the court rejected the application and ordered them to be detained, pending further hearing at a later date.

### Reader Consultation Legal Inquiries

(1) Inheritance and Gift

Xu Lidong asks: I have several legal questions; please advise: (1) Is property given to children during one's lifetime considered part of the estate? (2) If the transfer of ownership of said property was not immediately completed upon allocation, is it still considered part of the estate?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] Allocation during one's lifetime constitutes a gift. The allocated property has already been transferred to the recipient due to the gift. Failure to complete the transfer of ownership does not invalidate the gift. Therefore, (1) property allocated five years ago should not be included in the estate; (2) since it was allocated during one's lifetime and management has been transferred, it cannot be treated the same as property that has not been allocated.

(2) Marital Relationship

Chen Ying asks: (1) Does the marital relationship still exist after the husband's death? (2) Is it a crime if either spouse intentionally makes things difficult? (3) Can either spouse dissolve the marriage without the other's consent? (4) After a divorce, does the dowry belong to the wife's family and can they reclaim it? If the husband's family refuses, is it considered embezzlement?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Spouses have mutual obligations to cohabitate and mutual rights to inherit property. Upon the husband's death, the wife's obligation to cohabitate ceases, but the inheritance of the estate begins. Therefore, it cannot be said that all legal relationships have been extinguished. (2) A lack of a quick reply cannot be considered a crime. (3) Separation of family members requires a request. If one remarries, the relationship is naturally dissolved. (4) The dowry is the wife's private property. The husband's family has no right to retain it. However, if they only oppose the separation and prevent its removal, without intending to misappropriate it, it cannot be considered a crime.

### British Council Representative to China, Professor Joseph Needham, Passed Away Yesterday; Sino-British Association Cancels Dinner in Mourning

Professor Joseph Needham, the British Council Representative to China, suddenly passed away in Nanjing yesterday (the 17th) morning. Professor Needham actively promoted Chinese education during his lifetime, and he had many Chinese and foreign friends in China. The sudden news of his death has caused deep sorrow. Professor Needham was born in 1880 and studied at Oundle School and Cambridge University. While studying modern history at Cambridge, he won the Gladstone Memorial Prize. From 1917 to 1944, Professor Needham served as a professor of geography at the University of Liverpool.

First Visit to China

Professor Needham first came to China in 1913 while traveling the world on the Albert Kahn Traveling Fellowship. This fellowship was established by the famous French banker Albert Kahn to encourage university students to acquire knowledge of foreign cultures in order to promote international understanding. In the autumn of 1921, Professor Needham returned to China as a member of the Christian Education Committee to coordinate the work between church universities and middle schools, as well as between church schools and the government education system. At that time, Professor Needham and others traveled throughout North and Central China under the leadership of the former President of Yenching University, now the U.S. Ambassador, Dr. John Leighton Stuart.

Second Attendance

In the autumn of 1931, Professor Needham attended the Pacific Science Congress in Shanghai and Hankou, again as a representative of the British delegation. In addition, he also represented the Universities' China Committee in London, giving lectures in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Peiping. When in England, Professor Needham maintained close contact with students studying in England. Since the establishment of the Universities' China Committee, he has been a member and often served on the executive committee.

Stationed in Chongqing

In May 1945, Professor Needham and his wife came to Chongqing to serve as the British Council Representative to China. His wife was also a member of the Council's history lecture team, having previously worked in the history department at the University of Liverpool for many years. Last autumn, Professor and Mrs. Needham began visiting Shanghai, giving academic lectures at several schools and educational institutions in Shanghai. Professor Needham also gave speeches at the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, the Shanghai British Club, and broadcast on international radio once.

Activities in China

Professor Needham has always been active in China to promote close cultural exchange between China and Britain, thereby working for the British Council to promote friendship between China and Britain without political or commercial goals; he also closely cooperated with the Sino-British Science Co-operation Office. The Sino-British Science Co-operation Office is now incorporated into the British Council's science department, with its headquarters in Nanjing. Professor Needham has written extensively on Chinese history and geography, including the China section in the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica and a booklet on "China" for the Oxford University Press. Professor Needham's death is a loss to the Chinese cultural and educational circles, as he devoted his life to promoting and consolidating Sino-British friendship and understanding. Furthermore, the Sino-British Cultural Association had originally scheduled a dinner for tomorrow (the 19th), but it has now been cancelled in mourning.

### National Higher Normal Education; Recent Statistics from the Ministry of Education; There Are Nine National Normal Colleges

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] National higher normal education, according to recent statistics from the Ministry of Education, is as follows: In 1938, the Ministry of Education established the system of normal colleges. Colleges should be established independently or within universities. Some educational colleges were converted into normal colleges. In 1940, a women's normal college was established. All colleges have a five-year course of study, but the affiliated specialized courses have a three-year course of study. Normal colleges have affiliated primary and secondary schools for student teaching, and may establish a second department to recruit graduates from other university departments with similar characteristics, providing them with one year of professional training. Normal colleges may also have the following departments: (1) A junior department that enrolls high school or equivalent graduates for a three-year course of study; (2) A normal research institute for two years of research, awarding a master's degree in education; (3) A high school teacher in-service training class, studying for one year; (4) A junior high school teacher in-service training class, studying for one year; (5) A primary school teacher in-service training class, with a duration of one year. According to the investigation and statistics, there are nine national independent normal colleges: (1) Hunan, (2) Chongqing (Women's Normal College), (3) Guiyang (in Guizhou), (4) Hubei, (5) Guilin (in Du Xi), (6) Kunming, (7) Peiping, (8) Northwest (in Lanzhou) (9) Changbai (in Yongji). There is one provincial normal college, namely Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College. There are four normal colleges affiliated with universities: (1) Central University (in Nanjing), (2) Sichuan University (in Chengdu), (3) Zhejiang University (in Hangzhou), (4) Sun Yat-sen University (in Guangzhou). According to the investigation, the total number of normal students in normal colleges and specialized schools is no more than 10,000, but the number of secondary schools is increasing, and the shortage of teachers is increasing. In order to remedy this situation, the Ministry of Education stipulates that universities that have not established normal colleges can also establish education departments in the liberal arts to allow students in arts and sciences colleges to select 22 credits of education courses in the education department to obtain secondary school teacher qualifications; universities that have established agricultural and engineering colleges can also use this method to train vocational school teachers.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Education has hired more than ten people, including former or current university presidents, senior education administrators, and education experts, to serve as members of the Education Research Committee. These members are divided into full-time and part-time, and they are all advisors. All important educational issues are consulted or submitted for research in order to achieve perfect solutions. Previously, only a few full-time members, such as Tang Guhe, worked in the Ministry every day, and the rest were mostly mobile, mostly going out to inspect educational work.

### American Education Circles Actively Promote "Progressive Education"

—Jin

Extracting Living Teaching Materials from Real Life; Not Rigidly Teaching Students from Dead Textbooks

American education circles are vigorously promoting the system of "progressive education." This system abolishes the rigid educational methods of the academic school and adopts teaching materials related to real life. Many middle schools in the United States have widely adopted this system.

Professor Kilpatrick of Columbia University in the United States, in the May 1946 issue of the "Progressive Education" publication, made the following explanation of the differences between "progressive education" and traditional education: Traditional educational methods are rigidly teaching students only the dead knowledge in textbooks, while "progressive education" extracts living teaching materials from real life. Students can not only gain fresh and rich knowledge from it, but also develop many kinds of talents.

Mann (1796-1859) and Dewey (1859-) made great contributions to the principles of American education. Mann was the Director of the Massachusetts Education Bureau. He improved school facilities in the state, raised educational standards, and improved teacher compensation. Later, he served as the president of Antioch College, which implemented a system of alternating reading and work (two students do one job together, taking turns working so that both have time to read). Dewey was a professor of philosophy at Columbia University. He worked hard to promote the acquisition of teaching materials from experience and reality. Many of his writings on education have been warmly welcomed in the United States and other countries, and have been selected as teaching materials for textbooks.

The following pictures show the implementation of "progressive education" in some public schools in the United States:

[Picture 1] At the "Demonstration School" affiliated with the University of Wisconsin under the "progressive education" system in the United States, sound movies are used to teach students.

[Picture 2] The Sands Hill Elementary School in Georgia is the "Educational Experiment Room" affiliated with the University of Georgia. The school implements the "progressive education" system. The picture shows first graders listening to folk songs with a wireless phonograph.

[Picture 3] Students at Bersha Pre-University, which implements the "progressive education" system, are very interested in industry. Students are all interns in mechanical factories.

### Sunday First Division Football Match; Donghua Will Face the Soviet Union; Youth Cup Championship Decided on Thursday

The Football Committee issued Notice No. 19 yesterday, stating: In addition to warning and punishing players who violate sportsmanship, which has been announced in the newspapers, this week's schedule has also been arranged and announced. This Thursday at 3:00 PM, the Youth Cup final, Qingbai B will face the Railway at the Yiguo Stadium. From 10:00 AM on the weekend, there will be a total of five Mayor's Cup First and Third Division finals, which will be played at the Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Park stadiums respectively.

In the Youth Cup final, Qingbai B will face the Railway. Qingbai B has many famous players, such as Huang Shijie, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Fenggang, and Jing Linggui, so their strength is very strong, while the Railway also has many capable players, such as Lu Qingxiang, Xiao Ziwen, Wu Binghao, Qu Xigen, and Zhang Qichang, so their combat effectiveness is quite strong. Once they meet, it is difficult to predict who will win.

In the First Division, Donghua will face the Soviet Union. Both sides have been resting for a long time. Under the current situation of conserving energy, they will meet at the time and must do their best. In order to maintain the honor of the ever-victorious army, Donghua will send its elite to the stage, while the Soviet Union will also send its brave generals to fight in an attempt to improve its ranking. The schedule for this week is recorded below:

February 20 (Thursday)

Qingbai B—Railway (Youth Cup Final) 3:00 PM Yiyuan Stadium

February 23 (Sunday)

Donghua—Soviet Union (First Division) 3:30 PM Yiguo Stadium

Huaguang—Jiechi (Mayor's Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 1

Kangle—Paramount (Third Division Final) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 2

Jingwu—Customs (Third Division Final) 10:00 AM Zhong No. 3

Second Division—Final (First Week) 2:30 PM Zhong No. 1

The match schedule for the Second Division final teams Shanyun, Railway, and Qingbai B will be decided by drawing lots at the office of this Association at 4:00 PM on February 19 (Wednesday). It is hoped that each team will send one representative to the scene to draw lots at that time.

### Exciting Basketball League Matches; Chunmao Meets Renyu Tonight; Green Forest Faces Huayang, Women's Qingzi Faces Qianghua

The Second Basketball League will begin at 5:30 PM today. There will be three First Division women's matches at the City Stadium as usual. Tickets will remain the same. The schedule and referees are recorded below:

Women's Qingzi—Qianghua (Women's Division) 5:30 PM

Referee Yu Julu

Green Forest—Huayang (Second Division) 6:30 PM

Referees Xu Lanmu Jin Botao

Renyu—Chunmao (First Division) 7:30 PM

Referees Qu Honglv Yang Liecheng

In the women's division, Women's Qingzi will face Qianghua. This game is not of great importance, but due to the equal strength of the two teams, the battle will be tense. Women's Qingzi has good players such as Wang Wunang, and is a newly emerging force, while the Cao sisters of Qianghua have been training hard and their skills have improved greatly. It is not known who will win at that time.

In the second match, the Second Division Green Forest will face Huayang. The former originally held the ambition to win the championship, but unfortunately, an upset occurred last week, and they were defeated by Peier, suffering a blow. However, their young and brave generals over the years cannot be underestimated. Huayang is mostly composed of old men from the Fat Department, who have fought on the battlefield for a long time and have rich experience. Their lineup is comparable to Green Forest, and both sides have only lost once. Today's meeting is related to the runner-up position.

The finale is the First Division match between Renyu and Chunmao, which is a wonderful game. Chunmao was first formed and defeated the defending champion Hualian, which was the focus of the basketball world for a time. Unfortunately, they have lost to Giants and Hairenqing in the last two games, which is a pity. Renyu's skills are improving rapidly, and their teamwork is superior. Since their debut, they have defeated Encas and were defeated by Giants. They are comparable to Chunmao, and a fierce battle is inevitable.

### Canadian Girl Wins; World Skating Championship

[Associated Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 17th] Canadian beauty Barbara Ann Scott, 18, won the World Women's Figure Skating Championship here today. British girl Walker was second.

### Basketball Friendship Match

The Gymnasium Loses to the Sports Ground

In a basketball friendship match between the City Sports Ground team and the City Gymnasium team, the two sides met at the Gymnasium at 2:00 PM yesterday. Both Director Gu and Director Li of the Education Bureau, as well as the team leaders Jiang Xiangqing and Shao Rugan, were present to supervise the battle, making the game exceptionally tense. The referee was Chen Liang. In the first quarter, the Sports Ground barely won by a score of 13 to 12, leading by only one point. In the second quarter, Li Wenyuan of the Sports Ground was very active, while the Gymnasium only relied on Yao Minghua and Gong Shiyin to score six points. Therefore, by the end of the first half, the Sports Ground was in the lead with a score of 28 to 18. After switching sides, the competition became more intense, leading to a stalemate. In the third quarter, the score was 41 to 30, with the Sports Ground still in the lead. In the final quarter, Hu Zongshen, Yao Minghua, and Li Guoyuan of the Gymnasium team tried hard to recover, but the Sports Ground team refused to relax. By the end of the game, the Sports Ground defeated the Gymnasium with a score of 55 to 38.

### Railway Department Small Ball League: Business Department to Meet Materials Department Today

The Railway Department small ball league, which had been postponed due to rain and flooded fields, will resume today at 1:00 PM. The Business Department will face off against the Materials Department. In addition to the famous player Han Longhai, the former team has also welcomed back the strong Gao Baozheng, thus doubling its strength. The latter has evenly distributed talent, and the two sides are evenly matched, so a wonderful performance is expected. The match will be held at the Railway Ball Field on Qiujiang Road.

### Basketball League Situation Tightens Daily: Records of Recent Conditions of Teams in Group A and Women's Group

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The second basketball league is now more than halfway through. The situation in both Group A and Group B of the men's division is becoming increasingly tense, while the women's division is nearing the final stage. The current situation of each group is analyzed as follows:

### Green Team Dominates Women's Group: Final Decisive Battle Against Snow White

It is virtually certain that the Green Team will dominate the women's group and secure the league title. The night before last, they defeated Qinglian with a score of 54 to 12, with plenty to spare. They only need to wait for the final decisive battle against Snow White to determine the outcome. It is rumored that Qinglian and Snow White have made a defensive alliance agreement, deeply intending to let Snow White have the opportunity. Let's see how the replay between the two sides goes. According to general opinion, the Green Team's lineup may have been stronger in the past than it is this year. Is this true? Snow White has won all three of its matches so far, and based on its performance, it seems capable of contending for the title. However, the Green Team's Liu Zhenbao, Huang Mingyuan, Li Yunzhi, and others have confident shots, and they will compete with the Snow White guards. The intensity of the struggle at that time is expected to be high. Other teams such as the Power Team and the Women's Youth Team have repeatedly lost, mainly because they are still young, but their movements are already showing some promise. Given time, they will easily master the basics. Their spirit in each game is admirable.

### Sponsored by the Jing City Sports Association: First Indoor Basketball Tournament to Be Held at Central University Starting on the 12th

[Report from Our Nanjing Office] The Nanjing Indoor Basketball League, sponsored by the Nanjing City Sports Association, will be held every Saturday from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and every Sunday from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM at the Central University Gymnasium. This first league is scheduled to begin on the 22nd at the Central University Gymnasium. Nearly 20 basketball teams organized by various government agencies, organizations, schools, military, and police in the Nanjing city area have already registered to participate in the league. The teams' skills and players are divided into men's Group A, Group B, and women's groups. Each men's team is limited to 10 players, and each women's team to 12 players. The men's games will use the latest rules from 1946-1947, while the women's games will use the rules from the 6th National Games. In each game, the winning team will receive two points, and the losing team will receive zero points. The team with the most points in each group will be the champion of that group. If two or more teams in a group have the same number of points, a final match will be scheduled separately. The Jing City Sports Association will award trophies to the champions of each group as a memento.

### Special Feature on Female Athletes: All-Around Athlete Huang Mingyuan

Miss Huang Mingyuan, a pillar of the Green Team and a strong player in both basketball and volleyball in this city, has been in the limelight in Shanghai sports arenas in recent years. Therefore, Miss Huang Mingyuan is indeed the most ideal subject for a "Special Feature on Female Athletes." Some may question this, but my answer is: she is capable in all sports, and many of them have yielded exceptional results. Miss Huang has contributed greatly to the Green Team's many championship trophies over the years.

Has the Style of a Tomboy

She has at least a bit of a "tomboy" style, so—on the court, she has earned the nickname "A Yuan," a natural—childish nickname, indeed—she is sometimes so lively and uninhibited. When she watches the game with rapt attention, she will exclaim, jump, and even dance for joy for no apparent reason. In short, what she shows on the outside is purely natural and innocent. As for her physique, she cannot be said to be fat or thin. In terms of height, she is about average for a Chinese person, approximately five feet two inches tall. Her legs are very developed, of course, due to exercise. In terms of temperament, judging by her appearance, one would think she is extremely impatient, but in fact, the opposite is true. Outside of sports, she is always so quiet and taciturn.

School and Sports Life

She is a graduate of the Gongyi Girls' Middle School. In junior high school, she began to show promise in sports at the school, participating in everything. At that time, Zhang Lizhu, Zhang Huizhu, Yang Feibi, and others dominated the scene, and because she was still young, she couldn't quite catch up for a while. It wasn't until her third year of junior high school, when she was selected as a school representative, that she amazed everyone. Her performance was not inferior to that of several veteran players, so everyone began to look at her in a new light. Coupled with her natural talent for sports, her achievements improved rapidly. Basketball and volleyball became her main focus, and she also excelled in track and field events such as the 50-meter, 100-meter, and long jump, as well as cycling races, becoming famous for a time. In her third year of senior high school, she transferred to Minli Girls' Middle School, so she can be considered a top student of Minli.

An All-Around Player in Basketball and Volleyball

Since she is an all-around player, let me analyze her skills. Basketball: She is a good forward and also scores points. She can steal the ball, she understands the game, she can shoot accurately, and she can follow up effectively. She is truly a standard forward and can be said to have the style of a complete male athlete. Volleyball: She is a good second-line player and also a scorer on the team. Her spikes are almost as powerful as those of a man. When she spikes the ball, most young girls are afraid, which shows her strength. Furthermore, her 100-meter and long jump results were said to be very good in the past. This is based on her elasticity and speed. However, due to field conditions in recent years, her results cannot be confirmed. She once said that if she were to practice, she would be confident in scoring points in the National Games. The National Games is imminent, and I hope she can work hard.

At Home, She is a Young Lady

A Yuan is still unmarried. Her family is quite well-off, so—at home, she doesn't need to work so diligently. She listens to the radio and reads magazines when she has time. Sometimes, when she is in the mood, she will hum along to the songs on the radio by herself. According to friends who have heard her sing, A Yuan has a very sweet voice and has quite a bit of knowledge of music, making her a true singer. This is also one of her family leisure activities. It is said that when she is happy, she will even go into the kitchen, put on a white coat, and cook a few dishes that her mother and she like to eat. Aside from family life, she is completely active on the sports field. (Meizi)

### Contest for Places in the Basketball League: Renyu Should Beat Chunmao Tonight

In the past, Renyu was often defeated by South China. Tonight, when they face Chunmao, the reincarnation of South China, Renyu should beat Chunmao based on the current state of the two teams.

South China has three shooters: He Jingui, Li Ruixiong, and Liu Fushan. Chunmao only retains Fushan, while Renyu has more evenly distributed shooting talent.

If Renyu assigns two players to keep a close eye on Fushan, Chunmao will be in a paralyzed state, and Renyu can do whatever they want.

However, Chunmao's defense should not be underestimated. He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, and Zheng Jiabiao all have unpredictable shooting accuracy. Chunmao can focus on defense, and the score difference will not be too large. How Fushan can break free from the double-teaming is the highlight and the key to victory or defeat.

In terms of stamina, Renyu is more abundant than Chunmao, and tonight's battle, stamina should also be a factor in victory. (Changnian)

### Hoping That the Shantou Team Will Stand Out: The Veterans of the Hualian Team Are Not Old

In Group A, the Shantou team has already won three out of three matches, and its hope for this year's championship seems to be higher than that of other teams. Overwhelming the Hailu Youth team in the first match boosted their morale even further, so dealing with the Railway, Jing, and All Blacks teams was of course easy. Watching their guest appearance against Columbus the night before last, they were defeated due to the disparity in height, which was "not due to a fault in strategy." The Giants have also won four consecutive matches, but they struggled quite a bit when they fought Chunmao, and their match against Renyu was also in a precarious situation. That team also has championship ambitions, and the reporter sincerely hopes that the Shantou team will work hard and stand out. The Hualian team was the champion of the first Group A. This time, they were unfortunately defeated by Chunmao by a narrow margin of one point, which dampened their spirits, but they still have the aura of "old people are still strong." If they can take good care of themselves, hope is not lost.

### Chenyou in Group B Has Hope: Major Battle Against Green Forest Imminent

In Group B, Chenyou easily defeated Jiashen by a score of 60 to 31 the night before last. In the four matches, they have been a consistent winner, and Chenyou has the highest voice in Group B. However, Green Forest has emerged with talented people, and their ages are all in their prime. This Saturday, there will definitely be a grand spectacle. Although Huayang A was defeated by Chenyou, they are still waiting for an opportunity to act. Their hope lies entirely in subduing the "Green Forest" heroes, and they hope that Green Forest can defeat Chenyou, as they are afraid of the world being too peaceful.

### Central Bank Ordered to Collect Gold Certificates: Official Gold Price 4.8 Million: More US Dollars Collected Than Gold Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] The Central Bank's exchange rate for telegraphic transfers of US dollars has been changed to 12,000 yuan per US dollar selling price, in accordance with regulations. Based on this, the buying price per US dollar is 11,900 yuan. The exchange rate for telegraphic transfers of British pounds is 48,360 yuan per pound selling price, and 47,960 yuan buying price. Exchange rates for other countries can be calculated accordingly. Furthermore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the Central Bank's gold price was also set at 4.8 million yuan for the purchase price of each ten-tael bar. After the announcement of the price yesterday, Chinese and foreign citizens holding US dollars went to the bank to exchange them, and the situation was quite enthusiastic. The bank's Foreign Exchange Section of the Business Bureau directly collected the currencies. Each US dollar had to be deducted 3% for shipping costs, so the actual purchase price was 11,640 yuan. It is said that the total amount collected throughout the day was about 250,000 US dollars. The amount of gold collected was not as much as the US dollars, and most of it was from fellow silver and coin shops who were forced to exchange due to their position.

Furthermore, according to a report, the Central Bank announced the exchange prices for gold and US dollars at 10:00 AM yesterday, as follows: (1) Gold: 4.8 million yuan per bar; (2) US Dollars: buying price 11,900 yuan, selling price 12,000 yuan; (3) Forward Foreign Exchange: first month buying price 12,260 yuan, selling price 12,360 yuan; second month buying price 12,620 yuan, selling price 12,720 yuan; third month buying price 12,980 yuan, selling price 13,080 yuan; (4) British Pounds: buying price 47,960 yuan, selling price 48,360 yuan; (5) Hong Kong Dollars: selling price 3,022.50 yuan; (6) US Notes: buying price 11,640 yuan, selling price 12,000 yuan.

### Gold Shops and Silver Shops All Closed: Money Exchange Businesses Also Stopped Buying and Selling Gold Certificates and Foreign Currencies

Since the Central Government announced the emergency economic measures, the gold certificate market and silver shop industry in this city all closed down yesterday. The reporter interviewed responsible persons from the money exchange industry and the silver shop industry to inquire about their reactions. According to Zai Yuncheng, Chairman of the Money Exchange Industry Association, after learning of the plan announced by the Central Government yesterday morning, they immediately complied with the order to stop buying and selling all gold certificates and foreign currencies. The money exchange industry absolutely supports the government's measures, and the association has decided on two steps: (1) to wait for the government to stipulate the scope of the money exchange industry's future business and how to implement it; (2) if no measures are announced after three days, the money exchange industry plans to send representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Finance to resolve the livelihood issues of employees. Finally, Zai Yuncheng also stated that more than half of the money exchange businesses in the city still opened as usual yesterday, but they stopped trading in gold certificates or foreign currencies.

According to Yao Lianfang, the person in charge of the Silver Shop Industry Association's reorganization committee, after learning of the news, the Silver Shop Industry Association immediately convened an emergency meeting of members and decided to temporarily close all of the city's more than 200 silver shops. In the morning, they sent representatives Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, and Qiu Yunliang to visit Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, at around 10:00 AM. According to Lin, the issue of gold allocation for the silver shop industry in the future must be agreed upon by Central Bank President Bei and others before detailed measures are announced. Before these measures are announced, he hoped that the silver shop industry would maintain a calm attitude and wait for the authorities' disposition. Then, at around 11:00 AM, they visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, who had not returned from Beijing, so Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Bureau, met with them instead. He expressed sympathy for the temporary closure of the silver shop association and instructed them to visit Mayor Wu at 4:00 PM to request instructions on various issues in the future. The Silver Shop Industry Association prepared a written report and visited Mayor Wu at 4:00 PM, but Mayor Wu was too busy with official business and changed the meeting to 9:00 AM this morning. The Silver Shop Industry Association originally planned to convene a general meeting of members last night, where Wang would report on the visits to various parties and discuss various business issues in the future, but the meeting was postponed because Mayor Wu changed the meeting to today.

According to another report, a total of 158 silver shops in the city have joined the association. According to the majority of members, if the Central Bank still allocates and sells gold to the silver shop industry in the same way as before, the silver shops will continue to operate as usual, regardless of the price at which the Central Bank allocates the gold. The Gold Industry Association convened an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss future business policies. As of now, the association has more than 60 members.

### Import Licenses for Less Than 2,000 US Dollars

Designated Banks Must No Longer Issue Them

[Report from This Newspaper] The Business Bureau and the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank issued three circulars to all designated banks yesterday. The thirteenth circular of the second category stated: "In order to invite government orders, from February 17, 1947, for the goods listed in Schedules 1 and 3 (A), if their C.I.F. price does not exceed US$2,000 or equivalent currency value, the designated banks may no longer approve the import permit applications for these goods." Circular No. 81 stated that the provisions of Circulars No. 77, 79, and 80 regarding government subsidies for export trade were hereby canceled. Circular No. 82 urged the designated banks to pay attention to revising Article 19 of the Central Bank's Interim Measures for Foreign Exchange Management, namely: "Each bank shall promptly report to the Central Bank the total amount of its foreign currency deposits as of the day before the promulgation of this revised measure. Thereafter, it shall report once at the end of each month until all accounts are settled." It requested the designated banks to increase the reporting accordingly.

### Export Subsidies: Import Surcharges: Jianghai Customs Ordered: Announcement of Abolition

[Report from This Newspaper] After the abolition of the export subsidy and import surcharge system, Jianghai Customs posted Announcement No. 116 yesterday, which stated: "It has been found that imported goods, from February 6 this year, shall be subject to a surcharge of 50% ad valorem based on the customs valuation, as announced in Proclamation No. 115. Now, the Inspector General of Customs has received an order from the government that the surcharge shall be abolished from today, etc., and is ordered to comply with it, etc. Apart from complying with it, it is hereby announced for public knowledge. February 17, 36th year of the Republic of China, Tax Officer Liu Yuyi."

### China Trust Bureau Continues: Rationing of Artificial Silk

[Report from This Newspaper] The committee of the Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials and property, held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, attended by Wang Zijian, Yang Jinsheng, and others. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM. It was decided to continue rationing artificial silk, based on the rationing quota for December of last year. Yesterday, one-fifth of the quota was first allocated to the silk weaving industry, about 500 boxes. Also, one-fifth of the quota will be allocated to the ribbon weaving industry this Thursday, totaling 37 and a half boxes. The rationing price remains the same. For example, the price of 120 count Gaoshan silk is still 2.76 million yuan.

### If Raw Materials Are Not Allocated: Oil Rationing Cannot Be Restored

[Report from This Newspaper] According to a responsible person from the Oil Pressing Association, the suspension of edible oil rationing is due to unavoidable reasons. The oil mills cannot continue to maintain oil rationing while incurring large losses. Because the negotiated price of soybean oil is too low, while the price of soybeans has no limit. Currently, the asking price for soybeans has risen to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. If the price of soybean oil is still set at 180,000 yuan per load, each load will inevitably incur a loss of about 10,000 yuan. Moreover, the oil price in other ports, such as Kunshan, has risen to 270,000 to 280,000 yuan, and the price of soybeans is also between 70,000 and 80,000 yuan. Due to the relationship between cost and high interest rates, most oil mills are suffering from losses. Although the authorities have allowed the allocation of par-priced soybeans this time, the allocation date and quantity have not been determined. If par-priced soybeans cannot be allocated, the rationing of edible oil cannot be restored for the time being.

### Import Quotas for Category II Goods: February to April: Import Control Committee Announced Yesterday: Totaling US$99,675,000

[Report from This Newspaper] The Provisional Import Management Committee announced yesterday the revised quotas for Category II goods in the Interim Measures for Import and Export Trade for February to April of this year and made the following statement: "The government firmly believes that the quotas for various goods set this time are sufficient to meet the needs of domestic industry while guiding the country's foreign exchange resources into the most advantageous channels. For example, the quota for petroleum products is greater than the pre-war import volume. Because the source of coal is currently difficult, diesel is necessary for industry and shipping, and gasoline and kerosene each have their own urgent needs. The cotton quota is determined according to the importance of the textile industry and the possibility of cotton yarn exports. At the same time, in addition to trade control, the government is also striving to plan for the increased production of domestic cotton this year in order to reduce the consumption of foreign cotton. The quotas for rice, wheat, and wheat flour, which are needed for the people's livelihood, should be able to supplement the shortage of domestic food. The cigarette industry is one of the country's main sources of tax revenue, and the permitted import of tobacco leaves is closely related to maintaining national tax revenue. The quotas for jute and burlap bags are almost three times the pre-war import volume. This is because they are used to package export goods, which is of great benefit to encouraging export trade. As for the quotas for rayon, metal products, and wood, they do not include the quantities that can be obtained through barter trade with Japan. The quotas for other Category II goods are mostly determined based on the average import value in the three years before the war. The domestic production situation and the possibility of using domestic goods as substitutes have also been taken into consideration. We know that foreign prices have increased, and the quotas for some goods may not be able to meet all domestic needs, but we should be aware that the country is facing difficult times, and the use of foreign goods must be economized as much as possible. It is believed that people across the country will also be able to make joint efforts in saving the country's foreign exchange." The quota figures for Category II goods for February to April of this year are announced as follows:

(Unit: US$1,000 or equivalent foreign currency)

Name of Goods: Quota for February to April

Gasoline, Diesel, Kerosene: 12,075
Cotton: 40,000
Rice, Wheat, Wheat Flour: 20,000
Tobacco Leaves: 8,000
Jute and Burlap Bags: 1,250
Coal and Coke: 500
Metal Products: 3,750
Chemicals: 2,000
Paper (including pulp): 3,450
Wood: 1,830
Wool and Velvet Yarn: 1,400
Rayon, Indigo, Sulfurized Metanil, and Dyes: 2,275
Rubber and Products: 1,100
Lubricating Oil, Grease, Wax: 1,160
Machine Belts, Powder, Tanning Materials: 345
Ammonium Sulfate and Other Fertilizers: (Suspended)
Rayon (Raw Materials): 565
Medicines: (Suspended)
Cement: (Suspended)
Automobiles: (Suspended)
Sugar: (Suspended)
Total: 99,675

### Major Investors Want to Catch Them Off Guard: Unified Bonds Rise and Fall First

The major investors in public bonds yesterday wanted to raise the price before selling, so they rose and then fell back. As soon as Tongbing opened in the morning, there was competition to buy it. Rooms such as 604 had to cover their positions. The bulls took the opportunity to raise the price forcefully, starting from 7,200 yuan, and raised it to over 9,000 yuan before it stopped rising. They rushed to sell. Major investors such as Chengde and Room 504 were eager to sell, and it fell back to within 5,500 yuan near noon, and then began to consolidate. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu all fell by 600 yuan to 900 yuan. Tongbing fell by 1,800 yuan, with a transaction volume of 8 million yuan.

### Congestion of Goods Arriving from Various Guilds; Rice Prices Continue to Plummet; Market Prices of Cooking Oil and Miscellaneous Grains Mostly Trend Downward

Yesterday's registration of rice and grain arrivals showed 1,566.485 shi at the Southern Market and 7,896 shi at the Northern Market, totaling 9,462 shi, 4 dou, and 8.5 sheng for both markets.  The arrival of goods from various guilds is congested. This is because, after deliberation and adjustments, merchants from all routes considered it profitable and transported goods from the production areas to Shanghai.  However, coinciding with the government's adoption of emergency economic measures prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and currency, most rice merchants are also deeply wary.  General peddlers believe this price is still appropriate and are eager to sell, while rice shops are instead hesitant.  In this situation of supply exceeding demand, the market is in a slump, and the prices of all goods have fallen within the provisional price limits.  They have fallen by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to last weekend.  The future foundation of the market is still weak, and transactions within the market are completely open.  If subsequent arrivals continue, there is hope that the rice market trend will continue to fall.

Flour

In the morning, due to close inspection by the Social Affairs Bureau personnel, flour merchants and brokers avoided the limelight and did not trade.  It was not until near noon that the market slightly improved, but because rice prices continued to fall, everyone was pessimistic, few buyers came in, and there were very few transactions.  Only "Kaililang" foreign flour was traded at 72,000 yuan midway. The later market lacked buyers, and the afternoon takeover price was only 70,000 yuan. "Warship" flour was traded at 52,000 yuan, and the later market also showed weakness.  The prices of various brands of flour continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.  The decline in bran prices was slower, with a slight decrease of just over 500 yuan.  No transactions for wheat have been reported.

Cooking Oil

There was another decline. Amidst frequent reports of falling prices for various goods, the market atmosphere was uncertain, and those holding goods were eager to sell.  Therefore, the supply on the market was abundant, but the local sales were quite limited.  Crude raw oil opened at just below 10,000 yuan and closed at 220,000 yuan, with no inquirers. This was more than 20,000 yuan lower than the previous market. New and old barrelled raw oil also fell by more than 10,000 yuan accordingly.  The situation of soybean oil was also weak, falling by 13,000 to 15,000 yuan.  Our factory's clear oil followed the decline by more than 20,000 yuan, with trades at 216,000 yuan.  Small cart sesame oil fell by another 30,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Market prices mostly trended downward.  There were few transactions for soybeans, only local purchases and sales.  The prices of various goods were reduced by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.  However, the arrival of Pinghu soybeans was especially high, and the market atmosphere turned sharply downward, plummeting by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.  Sesame merchants were all helpless, and the price fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Red beans were sluggish, red sorghum was weak, corn fell by just over 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts fell by around 10,000 yuan, and soybean cakes had few customers and many suppliers, falling by 2,000 yuan.  Only broad beans were scarce and expensive, continuing to increase by 5,000 yuan. Green beans had demand from the South, and the market trend was firm.

### Floating Capital Tends Towards Chinese Stocks; Market Conditions Rotate and Rise

Chinese stocks continued to rise yesterday. Financial institutions and foreign firms had particularly strong buying appetite. Wing On Textile once approached the limit up, but the securities firms with large holdings sold when prices were high, and there were frequent pullbacks after the rise. The opening was high, and there was still competition to buy after the opening. Nos. 220, 47 bank groups entered, and Nos. 218, 199, 22, 95, and 172 bought one after another. Wing On Textile gradually rose to 1,780 yuan before struggling slightly. Nos. 76, 95, 218, 94, 105, 232, 224, and 125 bought again. China Flour, Kin Hsing, and Franco-Chinese (high price reached 60 yuan) successively hit the limit up. Wing On Textile rose to 1,950 yuan, and spot delivery reached 1,915 yuan, the limit up. Nos. 178, 105, 97, 151, and 203 sold at high prices, falling to 1,870 yuan. Spot delivery of Mei Ya and Innerwear also hit the limit up. Nos. 43 and 217 were still buying, and there was a rebound. Nos. 14, 28, 35, 186, 217, 102, 198, 36, and 91 all offered old stock, lowering Wing On Textile to 1,810 yuan. Nos. 133, 158, and 218 still took deliveries at low prices, once rebounding to 1,850 yuan. After 11 o'clock, it gradually declined. Nos. 36, 35, 91, 84, 171, and 145 sold again, seeing a low price of 1,780 yuan. Although Nos. 230, 180, 47, and 207 entered, Nos. 91, 14, 218, 100, 224, and 12 still sold down to 1,760 yuan. Nos. 177, 95, 224, 89, 22, and 188 came in at low prices, rebounding again to 1,820 yuan. The selling pressure from Nos. 198, 85, 91, and 145 was still strong, and the low price remained around 1,780 yuan. No. 224 had a healthy buying appetite, and at noon it again surpassed around 1,810 yuan. It closed slightly lower after the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textile rose slightly, China Flour, Hsin Ho, and Mei Ya rose by half a percent, Hsin Kwang, Liang Fu, and China Flour each rose by one percent. Spot delivery of Wing On Textile, Hsin Kwang, China Flour, and Ching Foo each rose by about one percent. Cold stocks of domestic goods rose by half a percent, and the rest all rose by about one percent. In the afternoon, Nos. 14, 13, 224, 223, and 211 all sold. After the opening, it gradually fell to 1,722 yuan. No. 97, 31, and 220 entered at a good price of 20 yuan. It was rumored that credit in the banking sector was extremely tight, and that some were selling gold at a reduced price to the Central Bank to cover shortfalls. People were timid. Nos. 145, 199, 84, 83, 94, 211, 213, 76, and 91 sold aggressively, and it fell to 1,700 yuan. After entering, Nos. 97, 145, 224, 102, 47, and 156 once rose to 1,770 yuan. Nos. 91, 145, 178, 198, 197, and 152 still had selling appetite, and retreated again to around 1,710 yuan. Nos. 171, 99, 76, 211, and 95 came in. Mei Ya suddenly rose sharply, and some even had a premium of more than 50 yuan, rebounding to 1,790 yuan. Nos. 14 and 12 still had supply, falling to 1,745 yuan. Nos. 95, 28, 219, 145, and 154 bought one after another. Near the close, it recovered again. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Textile and Hsin Ho rose by a strong half a percent, Hsin Kwang and Kin Hsing rose by a weak one percent, China Flour, Mei Ya, and Ching Foo each rose by one and a half percent. Spot delivery of Wing On Textile and Hsin Ho rose by a strong half a percent, Hsin Kwang rose by a weak one percent, China Flour, Ching Foo, and Mei Ya each rose by around one and a half percent. Cold stock Tung Yih was flat due to ex-dividend, Innerwear, Cement, and Wing Kung each rose by around one and a half percent, and the rest rose by between half a percent and one percent. There were no special changes in off-market stocks.

### Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Discusses the Real Situation of Foreign Rice Transportation to China

More Than One Million Dan in March

The Central News Agency reporter, concerned about the actual situation of large quantities of foreign rice arriving in China, inquired with Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, who is responsible for purchasing and transporting the rice. Director Liu kindly informed us that the Washington International Emergency Food Committee allocated a large quantity of foreign rice for our country to purchase and transport from various regions in the first half of this year. In March, our government can purchase 24,900 tons in Siam, 35,070 tons in Vietnam, and 23,600 tons in Burma, totaling 83,570 tons, equivalent to 1,050,000 dan. The amount of foreign rice purchased and transported by our government in April, May, and June is also very large and has not yet been included in the calculations. The Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to purchase and transport as much as possible and has dispatched Bi Nangli, Qing Kang, Commissioner Huang Zhaoming, Deputy Director Yue Yanglie, and others to Bangkok, Rangoon, Saigon, and other places to negotiate purchases and request assistance from local embassies, consulates, the Bank of China, and other relevant parties. Director Liu also stated that Shanghai already has a reserve of foreign rice, and with the import of the above foreign rice, the food supply for the citizens will absolutely not be a problem.

### Woolen Fabrics Are Internally Strong but Outwardly Subdued

Yesterday's trend in woolen fabrics was internally strong but outwardly subdued. Standard quotations increased in an instant, and once sold, they were often difficult to replenish. Since the foreign exchange rate was revised to 12,000 legal currency per US dollar, those in the industry have been mutually hoarding limited stocks and temporarily not opening for business. The transfer transactions of brokers have therefore become increasingly difficult. Apart from winter goods such as overcoating fabrics, all other widely-used men's and women's suits of various colors made of coarse and fine wool, as well as suit lining materials, were all in short supply.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Plunge; Few Buyers for Spinning and Weaving Listed by the Trustee

Yesterday, the yarn market became increasingly unsustainable. At the beginning of the morning, "Special Double Horse" and 42-count double-ply yarn fell by 500,000, with the latter trading at 6,500,000 and the former trading at 3,950,000 yuan. The decline in ordinary combed yarn was slightly slower, also falling by 100,000 to 200,000. Due to the sudden tightening of credit, coupled with the authorities dispatching personnel to the market for supervision, and rumors that the Garrison Command's yarn and cloth investigation team has begun auditing accounts, speculators were extremely panicked, morale was greatly weakened, and the situation was quite exhausted. By the close, "Special Double Horse" had fallen again to 3,800,000, and there were still few buyers. At 2 p.m., the Trustee for Spinning and Weaving listed yarns from private cotton mills, and the prices of various brands of yarn were similar to those in the market, but there were very few buyers.

### Foreign Stocks Weaken

Foreign stocks also initially rose and then fell yesterday, and were even weaker in the afternoon. Ewo Silk began to fall back from 16,200 yuan and ended at a low price. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Spinning and British American Tobacco each fell by half a percent, while the rest had minimal increases and decreases.

### China United Insurance Company Moves to New Address Yesterday

In the past, the insurance industry was dominated by foreign merchants with strong influence, and the outflow of benefits was regrettable. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the situation has changed. The Chinese people deeply felt the close relationship between the insurance industry and industry and commerce, and they pooled funds to operate on their own. Up to now, the business has been progressing day by day, and China United Property Insurance Company is particularly outstanding. The chairman of the company is Tang Xiaozhai, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and the General Manager is Tan Junsheng, Deputy General Manager of Nanfeng Industrial Company. The scope of business includes all types of insurance other than life insurance, such as water, fire, and property insurance. Recently, due to the increasing business, the original office space on the second floor of Jiangsu Bank was insufficient, so yesterday it moved to a new office building on the second floor of No. 33 Ningbo Road. The building has been renovated, and congratulatory guests filled the door, which was very lively.

### After the Cessation of Gold and Currency Trading, Prices of General Commodities Fell More Than They Rose; The Prospect of Long-Term Price Stability Is Hopeful

[Our Reporter] After the Supreme National Defense Council passed the resolution to have the Central Bank collect and redeem gold and American currency at the listed price, the market for gold and currency in this city completely stalled yesterday. All gold shops, money exchange shops, securities firms, etc., complied with the order and did not conduct gold and currency transactions. The market prices of other general commodities also mostly fell more than they rose.

Tight Headwinds in Business Circles

Chinese stock transactions once rose sharply, but then quickly returned to level, and transactions were not high. As for the prices of various export goods such as pig bristles and sausage casings, none were opened, and there were no transactions. Tung oil, dried egg white, and frozen eggs, etc., had prices opened, which had risen by 10% to 20% compared to last Saturday's prices, but there were also no transactions. It is generally thought that all parties are still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the new economic measures. However, since last Saturday, the market capital has been tightening. Most firms and exchanges are only receiving and not releasing. This is because the Central Trust Bureau auctioned off a large number of miscellaneous materials yesterday, and allocated rayon. The Spinning and Construction Company also sold cotton yarn on behalf of the Spinning Management Committee. The Taiwan Sugar Company is still expected to sell sugar as usual this Thursday, so it is anticipated that the future of capital will become increasingly tight. Yesterday, not a few firms and exchanges were forced by tight capital to seek redemption from the Central Bank. This is because, according to the newly promulgated Measures for the Control of Financial Business, if any firm or exchange becomes illiquid and the Central Bank stops its bill clearing, it should be ordered to suspend business immediately and have its license revoked. Therefore, all firms and exchanges are trying to be cautious to prevent any unexpected events. Although the capital clearing of various firms and exchanges at the bill clearing house was somewhat tighter than usual yesterday, no cases of grounding occurred.

Comprehensive Consideration and Considerable Initiative

[Our Reporter] Economist Yang Yinpu, at the request of our reporter, expressed his views on the emergency economic measures plan as follows: (1) The new method has two major advantages: one is that it is multifaceted, and not like the past of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts." Prices, foreign exchange rates, wage rates, etc., are all comprehensively considered. The second is that it is quite proactive, taking a step ahead of the actual situation. The adjustment of the exchange rate is one such aspect. Therefore, this plan is a relatively ideal solution at present, and I believe that prices can be stabilized for a long time. (2) The experience of the past has been that after foreign exchange adjustments, domestic prices have risen sharply, but today's situation is an exception, because floating capital has been frozen by gold, and market credit is surprisingly tight with surprisingly high underground interest rates. Wing On Textile did not stop auctions in the morning due to price increases, and there is no power to disrupt the market. After the policy of absorbing currency with gold is stopped in the future, it will be replaced by the sale of shares of state-owned factories, such as the Spinning and Construction Company, which has long had the intention of selling to private operators after two years of operation. In this way, floating capital will also have a legitimate outlet. (3) The restriction of wage rates is also a reasonable measure, because the high cost of wages is indeed a crisis for our country's industry. Now the government rations daily necessities while restricting wage increases, which is very reasonable. However, the most important point is that the implementation must be practical.

Extremely Beneficial to the Export Industry

[Our Reporter] Our reporter recently interviewed Qiu Liangying of the Import and Export Association and asked about the impact of the emergency economic measures plan on our country's export trade. Mr. Qiu answered as follows: (1) This measure is extremely beneficial to our country's export industry because it can take all aspects into consideration. If export subsidy measures are implemented, the cost of export goods will skyrocket and completely offset the government's subsidies. The current new method not only raises the exchange rate but also strictly controls domestic prices. If the cost of export goods is not high, the overseas sales market will definitely improve. (2) According to the new exchange rate, our country's main export goods, such as tung oil and pig bristles, which could not be traded in the past due to high prices, are now in a favorable position. However, competition in the international market for silk and tea is very fierce, so the outlook is not good. (3) It is not yet certain whether the situation of exporting goods from Hong Kong can be eliminated in the future. This depends on whether a black market price for foreign exchange occurs in the future. In the past, exporting via South China, with transportation by land, also had high costs. Merchants will consider whether exporting from domestic seaports is more cost-effective than exporting from Hong Kong. (4) One of the measures taken by the government this time is to restrict wage rates, with the aim of reducing costs and reducing currency issuance. For the people, this is an act of thrift. The Chairman has already requested workers to demonstrate their patriotism and frugality in today's speech.

The Import Business Will Inevitably Shrink

[Our Reporter] Zhou Jingwei, the person in charge of the city's Import and Export Industry Association, gave the following views on the emergency economic measures plan and the future of the export industry: (1) After the implementation of the new measures, if domestic prices do not rise, the increase in the exchange rate will be beneficial to our country's export industry. However, most of our country's export industry is under the control of the government, and only a small portion is privately operated. In the current process of currency inflation, the general public attaches importance to preserving goods, so even with the stimulus of the newly revised exchange rate, they may not be willing to dispose of them immediately. (2) In terms of the import industry, it will shrink in the future, because the foreign exchange quota within six months is only 200 million US dollars, and the amount allocated to each industry is very small. After the raw materials used by domestic industries that rely on foreign countries are exhausted, they will deeply feel the difficulty of continuing. (3) The government's current policy is to tighten credit and reduce the purchasing power of the market in order to avoid price fluctuations caused by the fluctuations of floating capital, and the intention is excellent. However, attention should be paid to the fact that after the people's purchasing power is weakened, it will also affect the consumption of legitimate goods, leading to commercial depression. This is quite obstructive to the government's plan to increase tax revenue.

Prices of American Goods Increased by About 10%

[Our Reporter] After the government announced the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" and prohibited the buying and selling of gold and American currency, and the official price of the US dollar was raised to 12,000 yuan, the reaction of department stores and American goods stores here was relatively calm. This is because the prices of various goods had already been adjusted according to the black market US dollar price. On the other hand, it is also because merchants are still watching the price trend. The prices of some American goods have increased by about 10%. Carnation milk powder sells for 25,000 yuan per pound, Carnation evaporated milk for 4,500 yuan, Camel brand cigarettes for 3,500 yuan, Colgate toothpaste (large size) for 15,000 yuan, Pond's cold cream for 18,000 yuan, Sullivan biscuits for 9,000 yuan per pound, and Ovaltine chocolate candy for 1,500 yuan per piece.

### Reserve Force of Huainan Coal Mine: New Developments in the Xinzhuangzi Coal Seam

— Wuhu Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Kang Feng

Following the Jinpu Railway to Bengbu, and then transferring to the Huainan Railway, I arrived at Jiulonggang, the location of the Huainan Mining Bureau.

Jiulonggang is a small village at the foot of Mount Shungeng. When the Huainan Coal Mine began drilling in 1930, there were only six households. Now, sixteen years later, the Huainan Mining Bureau has built a small world for its employees to live in, in the area between the railway and the coal mine. Those with some status within the mining bureau all live here. A spacious and exquisite guesthouse is also located in this residential area. Jiulonggang is isolated in the fields of the Huai River basin. The people from the mining bureau come from places like Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Chongqing, and Kunming; some have even recently left the urban peak of New York. Naturally, they welcome people from big cities to chat. Last August, Xie Jiarong, a geological authority with a different perspective on the existing Huainan coal mines, came from Nanjing, and was naturally welcomed by them.

Xie Jiarong himself only intended to visit this place, which currently supplies coal to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and for the transportation, industry, and power plants of the Beijing-Shanghai area, without intending to make any contribution. However, many profound figures are buried in this Jiulonggang Mining Bureau. Among them, engineer Chai Dengbang originally worked with Xie Jiarong in the Exploration Department of the Resources Committee. When the two met in Jiulonggang, they couldn't help but discuss the geological conditions of the Jiulonggang area.

They discussed the lifespan of the Huainan Coal Mine, its natural lifespan and social lifespan. Readers can imagine that these two are specialists in excavating the secrets of the Earth's crust, so they can accurately determine how long the prosperity of this mining area, which currently gathers nearly 70,000 people, will last. Similarly, they decided to resolve the doubts in their hearts through actual exploration. They hypothesized that since there is a bay-shaped coal-bearing stratum on the south bank of the Huai River, including Jiulonggang and Datong, this stratum must have its origins and destination. The two decided to investigate where the Huainan coal-bearing stratum went!

The current structure of the Huainan Mining Bureau is a mixed economy. It is neither state-owned nor purely private capital. The head office in Shanghai has a group of far-sighted commanders, while the mining area has a group of efficient executives. Since a scientist like Xie Jiarong was willing to see how the coal-bearing stratum flowed underground, the mining bureau immediately provided them with the only small jeep, painted red, for their use.

Investigating the Huainan Coal System

Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang began their investigation of the whereabouts of the Huainan coal-bearing stratum.

On the first day, from Jiulonggang to Da _, the two frequently got out of the car to study the rocks of Mount Shungeng.

On the second day, from Datong to Yabeipu, the jeep could not pass. Ahead were hills, so they abandoned the car and walked along the mountain road, passing through Sunjiagang, Cheluoshan, and Lijia'ao.

The surface of the mountain road was loess, so they dared not determine whether the coal-bearing stratum followed this path, but this area is precisely the inner edge of the basin-shaped terrain of the Huainan mining area. The coal-bearing stratum of Jiulonggang and Datong, stretching for ten kilometers, is located on the southern inner edge of the Huainan basin. Of course, if the geological conditions of the inner edges of the other three sides are the same as those of Jiulonggang and Datong, then the coal seam can be determined to be within it!

The two believed that there was no need to go further, and returned to the Jiulonggang mining area. Xie Jiarong decided to work with Chai Dengbang to find out the subsequent story of the Huainan coal seam, which does not occupy a position on the important mineral distribution map he compiled (in the "Shen Bao" 60th Anniversary China Provincial Map).

He returned to Nanjing, and soon brought a surveying team. This was a group of his old colleagues from the Resources Committee, who had followed him for eight years, knocking on the mountains and rocks with mineral deposits all over the southwest and northwest, and climbing over high mountains and deep valleys!

This exploration team joined forces with the people drawn by Chai Dengbang from the Huainan Mining Bureau, and traced the area from Caijiagang and Shanshanji past Lijia'ao. To the edge of the Huainan basin, which is separated by the Huai River. Of course, the riverbed would have eroded and separated the coal-bearing area to the north bank of the Huai River. For this reason, the Xie-Chai exploration team crossed the Huai River and wandered on the hills between Dadingjiashan and Xinzhuangzi, near the Qianjia Lake on the north bank. Drilling to explore the extension of the coal seam need not be too deep, stopping after hitting the first layer. The new boreholes for exploring the extension of the ore layer are centered on the first borehole in Xinzhuangzi, with boreholes drilled at distances of 400 meters to the southeast and 500 meters to the north and west around it. Judging from the geological topography of Xinzhuangzi, the extension of the coal seam generally runs from northwest to southeast. Therefore, it is proposed to drill to explore the extension of the coal seam within a length of 5,500 meters from northwest to southeast, with Xinzhuangzi as the midpoint (the extension of the Huainan coal seam is ten kilometers, or 10,000 meters). First, drill one borehole each in front of and behind Xinzhuangzi. The fourth borehole is planned to be drilled on the north bank of Qianjia Lake. After this decision, Xie Jiarong went to Nanjing.

Discovery of a New Coal Seam

When the reporter visited the Huainan Mining Bureau in November, the air by the Huai River was already wintry. Chai Dengbang showed me the similarities and differences between the new coal mine in Xinzhuangzi and the geology of the Huainan coal system in his home. The Huainan coal system has an inclination of over 80 degrees, while the Xinzhuangzi only has an inclination of 30 degrees. A smaller inclination means lower mining costs, so the economic value of the new mining area is greater.

Regarding the reserves of the new coal seam in Xinzhuangzi, he cautiously told me a formula for calculating reserves. The formula is:

Coal seam thickness × extension × depth × specific gravity = reserves.

Then, he assumed that the extension of the Xinzhuangzi coal seam is ten kilometers (10,000 meters) (the same as Huainan), the depth of an ordinary coal mine is 600 meters, the specific gravity is 1.2, and the thickness of the coal seam, according to the four layers of coal already drilled in Xinzhuangzi, is 6 meters. The numerical formula should be:

6 × 10,000 × 600 × 1.2 = 43,200,000 tons

43.2 million tons of bituminous coal. This is naturally a considerable figure, but this figure only accounts for 1/5000th of the 190 million tons of bituminous coal reserves listed in Xie Jiarong's national important mineral distribution map (Huainan coal has no position on Xie's map). Nevertheless, this known new mineral source is both easily accessible and served by a complete set of experienced miners, so the opening of this new _ is inevitable.

Chai Dengbang said that the preliminary exploration of the coal seam thickness will be completed in the spring of 1947.

The extension of the coal seam will be explored by the end of 1947.

Mining is planned to begin in the spring of 1948.

This is the story of the Xinzhuangzi mining exploration that occurred in the Huainan mining area after August this year. The entire exploration team lived in tents and worked in the wild for 30 days, and will continue to work for a long time. This situation is like a small team living through a war. This period of life is precisely the beginning of the growth of the future new Huainan mine. In addition to this new Xinzhuangzi mining area, Chai Deng _ and Xie Jiarong are also planning to go to Pingyishan (_ far from the junction with Fengtai, the northernmost edge of the _ Nan Basin) to see the geology. Therefore, the Huainan Wax Railway Bureau has set a one-year exploration plan with the Resources Committee, which will naturally lead to a new mining area: perhaps in three years, the new mining area will have hoisting frames and tall chimneys spewing thick black smoke, and workers will be as lively going up and down the mines in Jiulonggang and Datong as they are today. At that time, these two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, who apply the principles of geology and their own rich experience everywhere, may be braving the cold and stepping on ice and snow in the Northeast or other regions. But today, when I am writing the story of the Huainan mining area, I cannot help but emphasize the contributions of these two people!

Remember: Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai County, Anhui Province, a new coal mine with possible reserves of over 40 million tons, was explored and identified in 1946, amid the chaos of China, by two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, and their exploration team, with the support of the Resources Committee and the Huainan Mining Bureau! This is the beginning of the new mining area's decades of life. Don't forget these two scientists!

### The Xie-Chai Exploration Team Crossed the North Bank of the Huai River: Limestone is a Needle

In September, one day, the exploration team found _ _ insect limestone under the topsoil in Xinzhuangzi.

_ _ insect limestone is like a needle. The exploration team stopped to study it. In Jiulonggang and Datong, the coal seam is covered under the topsoil north of the _ _ insect limestone (Mount Shungeng is south of the Jiulonggang Datong mining area). Then, northeast of Xinzhuangzi, under the topsoil, the coal-bearing stratum of the Huainan coal system, which has been cut by the Huai River bed, must be found.

When Xie Jiarong brought the exploration team to the Huainan mining area, he also brought the Liggen-style 150 to 250 drill, which he often used from the Resources Committee. They felt that they had already found the coal-bearing stratum of the Huainan coal system on the north bank of the Huai River, but the thickness of the coal seam of this coal system is an important condition for determining whether mining will be profitable in the future. Xie and Chai decided to use a drill to drill the first borehole 200 meters east of Xinzhuangzi in order to explore the thickness of the coal seam.

On September 30, the drill entered the soil, with the intention to drill the borehole to a depth of 150 meters. For an entire month, when the Liggen-style drill had drilled to a depth of 120 meters underground, the magneto generator in the iron _ broke down, and it had to be stopped on October 29. However, the thickness record of the coal-bearing stratum at a depth of 120 meters that had already been explored rewarded the exploration team and its leaders Xie and Chai with great joy. The record is:

The first layer of coal was seen from 19.4 meters to 23 meters, with a coal thickness of over 3 meters.

The second layer of coal was seen from 62.3 meters to 63.2 meters, with a coal thickness of 0.62 meters.

The third layer of coal was seen from 65.42 meters to 66.05 meters, with a coal thickness of 0.52 meters.

The fourth layer of coal was seen from 67.24 meters to 78.47 meters, with a coal thickness of 1.85 meters.

Four layers of coal appeared in the 120-meter-deep borehole, with the first layer reaching a thickness of one zhang and the fourth layer reaching a thickness of over five chi, both above the height of a person. This rich thick coal seam determines that the mining of this new coal deposit can be very profitable (economic value is available). Even if there are no more thick coal seams below 120 meters, this coal-bearing stratum is already valuable enough, but the planned drilling to 150 meters must be done. Xie Jiarong returned to Nanjing to sort out other business and sent someone to Shanghai to buy a new magneto generator for continued exploration.

Just before Xie Jiarong returned to Nanjing, he and Chai Dengbang agreed on the next step: exploring the extension of the coal seam.

### Signs of Construction on the Xisha Islands

The Xisha Islands are located in the northern part of the South China Sea, 180 li northwest of Yulin Port on Hainan Island, 360 li northeast of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangzhou, 250 li west of Nantolun, and 540 li east of Manila in the Philippines. The situation is dangerous and is our country's gateway to Nanyang.

The sovereignty of the Xisha Islands belongs to our country, which is an undoubted fact, seen in historical books and gazetteers of past dynasties. The Sino-French Boundary Survey Treaty of 1887 also clearly pointed out that the islands belong to our country. Currently, our government has recovered the islands from the Japanese army and should strive to build and develop resources to consolidate Nanyang's national defense and promote international shipping. The following four pictures are enough to show a glimpse of the construction remains on the Xisha Islands.

Current Situation Map of the Vicinity of Huainan: Drawn by the "Shen Bao" Data Room

### Alliance Leader Jailed, the Tree Falls and the Monkeys Scatter: Wang Huisheng Forms a "Party," the Shortest-Lived Party in History: Dies After Ten Months

— Kunming Dispatch on the 6th, Special Correspondent Xu Jilian

This can also be considered a "party" - the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance." Its rise in Kunming was indeed a sensation for a time, but its decline was unexpectedly rapid.

Speaking of the rise and fall of the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," it really evokes a sense of the vicissitudes of life. It was formally established in March 1946, but announced its demise in January of this year. Including the beginning and the end, it didn't even last a year, which is probably the shortest lifespan in modern party history.

Speaking of the Alliance Leader, _ This Horse Has a Big Background

As the saying goes, "A snake cannot move without a head." To introduce the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," we naturally cannot ignore their "Alliance Leader." It's really "Speaking of This Horse, It Has a Big Background." The three words Wang Huisheng were a sensation in half of the mountain city for a time. In terms of military rank, he was a graduate of the first class of Huangpu Military Academy. In terms of official rank, he was once a two-star general. He was born in a small county in Guizhou. He had an impressive appearance, somewhat of a scholar's temperament, but with a weathered face, one could tell that he had been worn down by years of restless life!

As the leader of an alliance, he naturally had his unique strengths. At a glance, behind his tortoise shell glasses, two eyes radiated light. It goes without saying that he was capable, and he was also good at socializing, often making a stranger feel as familiar as an old friend. His voice was always so loud, with plenty of energy, and he was eloquent. He was very impatient. During the Northern Expedition, he served as a company commander, leading a valiant force, speeding between Fujian and Guangdong.

Wang Huisheng really "cannot bear to look back and talk about those years." In recent years, he had indeed been unable to realize his ambitions. He had no soldiers under his command, no power in his hands, and things were getting worse and worse. Therefore, "when one is poor, one must change; change leads to progress." When there was no way out, Wang Huisheng had a brilliant idea and organized the "China Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance."

Gang Members and Brothers Flock to Join

The alliance headquarters was located in the Kunming City Federation of Trade Unions. For a time, gang members and brothers flocked to join, and the momentum was quite impressive. The alliance had departments and offices, and appointment letters were flying everywhere. Officials, heads of departments, and section chiefs were as numerous as "crucian carp crossing the river." And some dismissed soldiers and idle _ _, were also willing to have such a place to settle down. The signboard could scare people.

The arrangement of the headquarters was not meticulous. In the center hall hung the words "Democracy and Freedom," personally inscribed by a certain general. At the time, this calligraphy could be regarded as a talisman. Many people regarded this place as a "mysterious valley."

Then they elected the executive directors and supervisors, and formally swore an oath of office, declaring that branch offices would be established in provinces such as Xikang and Sichuan. They claimed that the alliance members had reached more than 200,000 people. Their "alliance network" was "for the country and the people." The alliance flag was very unique, triangular, apricot yellow, and painted with a golden sun emblem. This bright symbol appeared once during a _ Shame National Humiliation Propaganda Week. On that occasion, a winding column of their members paraded through the entire city of Kunming in an unprecedented grand march.

Economic Problems: The Alliance Leader Finds a Way Out

It is really difficult for a nation without an economic foundation to start anew and open up a new path. Therefore, Wang Huisheng was very anxious. Although he tried to build relationships and find connections, it was ultimately a drop in the bucket.

I remember once he ran to the Kunming Garrison Commander Guan Linzheng, opened the door, and began to speak loudly, "Lao Guan! Take out some money to spend!" The Garrison Commander had no choice but to respond, and finally took out his wallet and gave him a certain amount, but how could sand and gravel fill the rivers and seas? Naturally, Brother Wang had to find another way!

Some people began to suspect their actions. However, Wang Huisheng had already left the Huangpu system, and he did not have much of a relationship with the Kuomintang in history. Therefore, outsiders could only wait and see what would happen.

Loaded with Guns and Ammunition, Heading Straight for Zhaotong

In September 1946, the Alliance Leader Wang Kensheng faced their economic crisis. Therefore, he had no time to take care of many of his brothers. He personally drove a GMC car, fully loaded with guns, ammunition, and soldiers, carrying the banner of the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," and flying the triangular apricot yellow flag, marching mightily towards Zhaotong (a large county in eastern Yunnan, the hometown of former Provincial Chairman Long Yun). Not to mention others, even the inspectors along the road could not figure out what was going on.

On the _ Dong Road, dust billowed and passage was unimpeded. Upon arrival at the edge of Zhaotong City, they stopped for inspection at the border. Wang _ Sheng took out the permit from the Garrison Headquarters, claiming to be the _ Leader of the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance," coming with great momentum, and no one could do anything about it!

That night, a new agency appeared in Zhaotong City, with guards standing at the door, fully armed, looking quite mighty. Moreover, the streets of Zhaotong were full of fully equipped armed soldiers. As a result, the local commissioner's office had to use their brains. Wang _ Sheng was also unlucky. At the same time, the Zhaotong Security Corps happened to receive a telegram from the Kunming Garrison Headquarters ordering the arrest of Wang Huisheng. So, after careful arrangement, the power plant first sounded the alarm. As a result, Wang Huisheng did not expect it and had to surrender and be arrested.

Following the arrest, Wang Huisheng was escorted back to Kunming. "The tree falls and the _ _ scatter." Without waiting for a formal dissolution order, the "Democratic Freedom Grand Alliance" had already collapsed. The "alliance members" changed their plans and looked for other ways out. The Garrison Headquarters, together with the city government and police bureau, sealed up the headquarters and seized printed matter and documents.

After several interrogations by the Security Command, Wang Huisheng was sentenced to ten years in prison for the crimes of forming a party for personal gain and plotting without fighting and was sent to the Yunnan First Prison, one person in a separate room, which seemed very comfortable.

It is said that Wang Huisheng's motivation for going to Zhaotong was purely commercial in nature and had no other political purpose. He did not expect to become a prisoner as soon as he arrived. No wonder Wang Huisheng once said to reporters: "Don't judge heroes by success or failure. This is my fate!" His tone was straightforward and quite heroic. Furthermore, there were many people among the alliance members who wanted to use this organization to engage in legitimate political activities. However, unfortunately, the leader was incompetent, and coupled with indecision, impetuosity, and arrogance, he suffered defeat and infamy, ending up in such a miserable end!

### New Scene in the World Marriage Market: Difficult to Marry, Many Divorces: Engagements are Also Rare

— Berlin Dispatch on the 3rd, Special Correspondent Hong Fu

Recalling ninety years ago, in the early years of the Tongzhi reign in our country, the people who returned after fleeing the floods of war, were full of food and warm clothing, living cheaply, and still enjoying twenty or thirty years of peace. Now it is not the same. In the new era, after the war, food shortages and money shortages have even caused panic in the marriage market, which is by no means what our ancestors dreamed of.

Former Brazilian President _ Chooses a Son-in-Law for His Daughter

Western women have long suffered from "difficulty in marrying." The United States is a paradise for women, but life in big cities is not as peaceful as in the countryside. The youth of most women, those with intelligence and beauty, are like the stars in China's music scene and theaters, flowing like water, allowing them to fade away. Those below this level are even more unbearable. South American culture is not as advanced as North America, but the difficulty of getting married is very similar. In the past, when I traveled to South America, I personally saw the four daughters of the late former President of Brazil, all of whom possessed precious gardens and villas, with large assets, brilliant reputations, and dignified manners, determined to choose a son-in-law. Unfortunately, no one asked, which was spread as a good story in diplomatic circles. When they arrived in Eastern Europe, the wounds had not yet recovered. From Austria-Hungary to the Balkan Peninsula countries, due to the impact of the First European War, there were more women than men, and men were greedy for temporary pleasure and avoided the obligations of formal couples. What women pursue, either material or spiritual, has already satisfied the other party's desires. The comfort that women have exchanged at a great price is only up to the "engagement" stage.

Today, German Women Feel the Suffering of Being Too Many

Western women's habits now often regard accepting a man's proposal as the most difficult to obtain "honor" in their lives. Germany is a war-loving country, and most of the men died in the war. To this day, women are increasingly suffering from being too many. Berlin is the capital of Germany. According to a survey in 1946, there were 192,000 unmarried young women between the ages of 20 and 30, while there were only 71,000 young men of the same age. The number of female citizens is almost three times that of men. What is even more strange is that divorces are increasing, and engagements are simply not to be seen. Therefore, the "honor" of women accepting a man's proposal has become a "dream" in Beijing, Germany.

The Number of Illegal Illegitimate Children Continues to Increase

The number of illegal illegitimate children in Germany is increasing secretly. This is because the first demand of women is to find a satisfactory husband, and the second is still to have a child. If they cannot "get a husband" now, they will take a step back and seek to "get a child." The family life of new German women no longer has a coexisting man, and the status of men in Germany is quite similar to that of the Chinese _ in the old era, only relying on "making children." The relationship between men and women in Germany is equivalent to the style of concubinage in the old era of China, secretly creating a "poly-gamy" style of polygamy. In addition, occupational competition, most of the positions are already occupied by women, unwilling to give way to men, and conflicts with each other, all of which are enough to cause concern for the community and society. This shows that the harm of warmongering is great and profound. Representatives of our country who advocate women's rights and protect public welfare, if they can take a step back like Sweden and Switzerland to protect their country's neutrality and maintain peace, and take a step forward like the British who are fond of peace and do not like war, all good hopes can be achieved in the end. This is the fundamental plan, not the followers of those who treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, talking about trivial matters.

### Pig Head Tax Becomes Corrupted, Actually Becomes Poll Tax

— Sixth of the Month Nanchang Airmail, Our Newspaper Nanchang Reporter Liu Zao

After the fiscal reform in this province, the county-level finances have land tax and business tax, each accounting for 50 percent, slaughter tax, business license tax, usage license tax, house tax, feast and entertainment tax, deed tax, and property return tax. All of the land value increment tax, and the income from public property reorganization, if various taxes are properly organized, and every bit goes to the public, the expenses of the county government and its affiliated agencies should not have any major difficulties. However, the current financial distress of the county government has reached the point of utter destitution. The Magistrate of Xingzi County went to his post without rice to cook; the first major task after taking office was to borrow thirty catties of rice to start the meals. The Magistrate of Dean County arrived at his post to find the county treasury completely empty, not a single grain. In many counties, the treasury has no money and the accounting books are blank.

Currently, county-level finances rely entirely on slaughter tax. They eat slaughter tax, wear slaughter tax, and use slaughter tax. Elementary school teachers, on the one hand, teach, and on the other hand, have to collect slaughter tax themselves. I met many county-level public educators who could readily pull out a large handful of slaughter tax tickets from their pockets, because they are not easy to collect, and they have to treat them as legal tender and carefully preserve them. Currently, the slaughter tax, according to the provincial government's regulations, is collected at 5% of the price. Before November, the weight of each pig was stipulated to be 150 catties. Now they have become "fat and strong to 200 catties," but the methods of collecting slaughter tax are full of tricks, each with its own merits.

The methods of collecting slaughter tax, in addition to the county government's security police, police局, and the armed police in township offices going door-to-door to collect it, involve the allocation and collection of tax amounts by:

(1) Direct apportionment by the county government to each township.

(2) "Explicitly entrust, secretly contract out" by the county government.

(3) Handling by the township offices, which submit it to the county government for unified collection and expenditure.

(4) Handling by the township offices to cover township expenses, without reporting to the county, nor requesting funds from the county government.

(5) Undertaking by township representatives.

How is the Jiangxi slaughter tax, collected under these diverse methods, apportioned to the common people? The sound policy of taxing according to the head of the animal has become a "poll tax." In reality, it is the poor farmers who raise pigs and the butchers who sell meat who pay the tax, while those who eat pork do not bear the obligation to pay the tax. Moreover, sometimes a pig has to bear double taxation (pigs from Village A have already paid the live pig tax, but if they are sold to Village B for slaughter, they have to pay an "exit slaughter tax"). These are the apportionment methods:

(1) The monthly slaughter tax quota for Anyi County is now 9,750 heads (previously 7,200 heads). The township offices allocate the quota to each bảo according to the population of each township. The county's current population is 66,685 people, 11,253 households. The monthly slaughter tax is apportioned at nearly one pig per household. According to provincial government regulations, each pig weighs 200 catties, and the market price per catty is calculated at 1,000 yuan, the tax levied is 10,000 yuan.

(2) In Anfu County, sows, piglets, and pigs being raised must all pay tax monthly, at 1,500 yuan per head per month.

(3) The slaughter tax in Fengxin is collected and disbursed uniformly by the county government on the orders of each township, which is considered a relatively legal method.

(4) The slaughter tax in Yongxiu County is also apportioned by township. Aicheng Town (i.e., the urban area) is charged five times the amount, and each township is charged double the county's quota. The bảo then charges double the township's quota. The township and bảo personnel then come up with a new trick, claiming "insufficient quota" and also collecting sow tax, piglet tax, and fines for not raising pigs. The tax rate for live pigs is based on the pig's weight, estimated by the collectors, and slaughter tax of 5 to 10 yuan per catty is paid.

(5) The slaughter tax in Dean County is both apportioned and collected, and the tax rate for live pigs has already risen to 100 yuan per head.

(6) The slaughter tax in Xingzi County is not only a pig head tax but also a "poll tax." Whether one raises pigs or not, the slaughter tax is uniformly apportioned and collected.

(7) A township office in Jiujiang has a monthly budget of 210,000 yuan, and the monthly slaughter tax quota is 45 heads. Calculating at 200 catties per pig, the slaughter tax collected is 450,000 yuan. This tax is neither remitted to the county, nor does the county government urge its collection.

If we look at the actual collected statistics of slaughter tax from the entire Jiangxi Province, those who do not understand the truth will surely suspect that the Jiangxi people eat the most pork in the province, while at the same time they are sallow-faced and malnourished!

### Public Buses Please Improve Quickly

Editor: The red No. 22 public buses running in this city are convenient for citizens, and the ticket sellers are conscientious in selling tickets and never cheat, which is commendable. However, this route's public buses still have a drawback, that is, the ticket sellers ring the bell and start the bus before the passengers have fully boarded, regardless of whether there are few passengers or crowded conditions, causing many passengers to climb on when the bus is already moving. At this time, the bus door is not closed, and passengers are often in danger of falling, especially women and children. For example, on the 20th of last month, a passenger fell from the bus at Zhengjia Muqiao, fortunately not fatally. In the past, Shanghai newspapers often reported on this matter, but it has not attracted the attention of the Public Utility Bureau and company authorities to improve it. Therefore, I implore your esteemed newspaper to expose it in a corner, in order to urge the authorities to correct it. (Shen Sikang)

The 54, 52, and 23 trains departing from Shanghai Station, when stopped at the station, the lights inside the carriages can be said to be completely absent. Passengers must grope in the dark. This is a good opportunity for pickpockets to show their skills. Every time I go out, I hear people losing things, especially the 51 train from Nanjing and the 62 train from Hangzhou. The sky is already dark when they are halfway there, but the lights in the carriages are never turned on. At every small station without electric lights, passengers squeeze on and off in the dark, and pickpockets are rampant. The "Four Famous Mountains" and other theft cases published in the daily newspapers show the rampant theft on trains. Please the road bureau to rectify the carriage lights, which is also a good way to prevent pickpockets. (Wang Deren)

### Guangxi's Mouth of Respiration: Wuzhou

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Wuzhou, 4th of the Month by Airmail

As spring arrives, and the pepper flowers are lightly praised, during the time of slightly drunken Tusu wine, by chance, I went to the West River and drifted to this gateway of Guangxi again.

From Guilin to Wuzhou, from northern Guangxi to eastern Guangxi, is a long journey. The reporter sat on the Guiliu section train, which had only been open for five days, comfortable and quiet, incomparably better than the noisy and chaotic Yuehan Road. Then, from Liuzhou, I took a car, enduring the "cloud-driving and fog-riding" misery on the highway, returning to the former residence of the Wing King, and then letting the 18th-century wooden boat tow me to Wuzhou.

After thirteen years of separation, the scenery of Wuzhou remains vaguely similar. Baixue Mountain stores endless river flows, morning after morning, and evening after evening, not knowing how many incoming and outgoing travelers have been sent off. Stepping onto the long embankment, looking around, it is another scene of ruined walls. Taking a closer look, it is truly "every room is broken, no house is undamaged." Each of the four major cities in Guangxi is like this, how much can one feel?

One Restaurant Every Step, One Teahouse Every Five Steps

However, Wuzhou is, after all, the mouth of respiration for Guangxi. Millions of goods roll in and out, how can one calculate it? It is said that the daily value of goods in and out totals nine figures. On the river, there are boats coming and going, bustling and difficult to count. Due to the prosperity of commerce, firms stand in rows, and food and drink are everywhere. People say that food is in Guangzhou, but with the population of Wuzhou as a proportion, I dare guarantee that the number of restaurants in Guangzhou is less than in Wuzhou. Belly-drumming merchants have money and gold bars. Naturally, they indulge in joy. Therefore, Wuzhou has good fortune in clothing and food. One restaurant every step, one teahouse every five steps, from Hedi Road straight through Danan Road to Nanhuan Road, it is all like this. Every night is the Lantern Festival, the lively scene is beyond description compared to the desolate scene of Guilin's shops closing at eight o'clock. A dilapidated building is covered with weeds, and under the weeds is a teahouse. Where else can one find such a style of Cangwu?

Goods Prices Rise Step by Step, Adventurers Laugh

Convenient transportation is the main reason for Wuzhou's liveliness. From Guangzhou, it takes two days to reach, and goods go directly to Guixian and Nanning, selling throughout the province, taking no more than three to five days. Eight or nine out of ten imported goods cannot escape the "Made in U.S.A." label, while exports are mainly mountain products, livestock, and fennel oil. Among them, checkpoints and customs lead to rising prices. A tube of toothpaste sells for 700 yuan in Wuzhou, 1,000 yuan in Liuzhou, and 1,200 yuan in Guilin. Although this big gate has a broken door frame and a collapsed threshold, the inside and outside of the gate seem to be filled with dazzling gold and silver, arousing the interest of adventurers, who are busy coming in and rushing out, enjoying themselves!

Many People, Narrow Streets, Cars Cannot Enter the City

Wuzhou's streets are built against the mountains and by the water, extremely narrow. The roads are even smaller than the sidewalks in Nanjing. There are many people and the roads are narrow, packed tightly, much like Hankou's Hualou Street. Fortunately, due to the separation of the two rivers, cars cannot cross the river and can only stop in the opposite Rongcheng, unable to enter the city. (There has never been a car in Wuzhou, not even a rickshaw.) Otherwise, I really don't know what to do!

Culture Too Barren, Chicken Ribs Fill the Hungry Stomach

The business scene talks about business. In Wuzhou, if you want to buy a decent book, sometimes you seem to have a sigh of "rising to heaven and entering the earth, both places are vast and boundless." There may be one or two bookstores, but they sell textbooks or magazines from before December. The book stalls are even more barren than the abandoned airport across the river. The reporter has traveled all over Guangxi, east, west, north, and south, and the situation is the same everywhere, and cannot help but sigh for Guangxi's culture! The local newspaper is only the Wuzhou Daily, with dull layout and content like chicken ribs. Moreover, because the citizens only like Guangzhou newspapers' "Lianxiang Ji", "Remember the Person Before You", and "Strange Articles", they don't understand anything else, so the circulation is also quite poor.

Coming and going in a hurry, three days of lodging, I don't know if Wuzhou dislikes me or I dislike Wuzhou, I simply don't want to stay for another moment. While I am scribbling quickly, the guest in the left room is laughing loudly with a prostitute, the guest in the right room is talking loudly about "transporting salt to Shaoguan to make money." The guest in the opposite room is pulling the blind singer, singing the Cantonese tune of "Sadness and sorrow, melancholy intention..." It seems that everything is in rebellion. Countless maggots have revealed their true forms in the land of happiness.

### Before Attending the Meeting

— Bao Yu

Section Chief Shi was sitting alone at his desk in the study, holding a Seven-Wolf Three-Goat hair brush in one hand and a cigarette in the other, writing his speech:

"We have now reached the atomic age, and everything must be mechanized, but our transportation is still using rickshaws. This is not only lagging behind the times, but also simply violating human rights! Rickshaw pullers..."

He wrote to this point, preparing to describe the suffering of rickshaw pullers as much as possible, but who usually pays attention to their suffering? He had to put the pen on the pen rest, the cigarette stuck to his lips, his hands in his sleeves, his eyes fixed on the green-shaded desk lamp in front of him, trying hard to think.

The ash on the cigarette had accumulated an inch, but he still hadn't thought of anything. He took the cigarette off, flicked off the ash, and then extended a finger that had been yellowed by the cigarette smoke, pressing the call bell:

"Ding..."

A chubby maid ran in:

"Section Chief, what's the matter?"

"Go and find Axi!"

"Yes!" The maid retreated.

Next to walk in was Axi, the rickshaw puller. He was wearing a broken cotton robe, a blue cloth belt tied around his waist, the hem of the robe tucked inside, the collar open, and a broken woolen cap tilted on his forehead. He was quite tall, with a slight hunchback, and many wrinkles on his face. Looking at him, you would think he was in his twenties or thirties, but in reality, he was only seventeen years old. Perhaps fearing that people would think he was too young, he now reported his age three years older.

"I have a few questions to ask you!" Section Chief Shi gently turned the swivel chair under his bottom, facing Axi, who was standing straight. His tone was very gentle, never so gentle before.

"Yes! Yes!" Axi was a little flattered.

"How old are you this year?"

"Te... oh! Twenty!"

"Oh, only twenty years old!" Section Chief Shi expressed surprise at that rather old face: "How many years have you been pulling a rickshaw?" "I've been pulling for two years. I used to pull casual rickshaws, but I've only been a full-time rickshaw puller for the past two months!"

"How much does the government pay you a month?"

"Sixty thousand yuan."

"Is that enough?" Section Chief Shi took a puff of his cigarette.

"How could that be enough? I wear out a pair of shoes a month, costing twenty thousand yuan. The remaining forty thousand yuan has to support three people. Even if I grind the money into powder, it's still not enough!"

"Oh, who is in your family?" "There's my elderly mother and a younger sister!"

"Don't you have a father?"

"Father?" Axi paused, choking up: "He was also a rickshaw puller, but one day, he injured himself in a fall, coughed up blood for several months, and he... died!"

"Oh!" Section Chief Shi turned the chair back to its original position: "You can go!"

Axi left, feeling inexplicably confused.

Section Chief Shi found the material in Axi's mouth. He wrote about the life of rickshaw pullers as painfully as cattle and horses. The conclusion was that the phenomenon of people pulling people must disappear forever.

After he finished his speech, he looked in the mirror and practiced it in advance. His eyeballs bulged, and his large mouth emitted hot air. When he spoke passionately, he made loud noises, waking up his sleeping wife and children in the next room.

Every day was the same. At eight o'clock, Axi pulled the rickshaw to send the young master and young lady to school, and then pulled the wife to the small market. After returning, around ten o'clock, he would send Section Chief Shi to the county government office.

But today's situation was a little different. When he pulled his wife back from the small market, Section Chief Shi was anxiously losing his temper at the gate.

"You're ruining my business, ruining my business!"

"Aren't you supposed to go to the office at ten o'clock every day?" his wife replied.

"Don't you know there's a meeting at nine o'clock? I have to go and give a speech!" Saying that, Section Chief Shi jumped into the rickshaw: "Pull quickly!"

A shiny black rickshaw, Section Chief Shi sat on it, wearing a leather hat, his neck shrunk into the collar of his leather coat, his right leg crossed over his left leg, revealing the shiny leather tips of his shoes.

Axi, breathing heavily and sweating, pulled quickly, running. The red and green chicken feather dusters inserted on the rickshaw were dancing.

"Faster! Pull faster! You're really useless!" Section Chief Shi was still dissatisfied, stepping on the foot bell and shouting. Axi desperately charged forward.

Section Chief Shi could already see from afar a cloth banner hanging in front of the county government: "Symposium on Abolishing Rickshaws." He coughed twice, cleared his throat, preparing to make shocking remarks at the symposium. But what he didn't know was that Axi, because he had run so many roads on an empty stomach, felt exhausted. Suddenly, he felt a burst of dizziness, his legs weakened, and he fell to the ground. The rickshaw and the person on it also fell down.

"Useless thing! Useless thing! Rickshaws must be abolished quickly! Must be abolished!..." Section Chief Shi, while scolding, climbed up, raised the shiny leather tip of his shoe, and kicked Axi's body hatefully.

As a result, Axi still struggled to get up, pulling Section Chief Shi into the county government gate.

### Warm Respect

— Translated by Chen Yin

Dickens once said that the warmest respect for his work was what he encountered one day when he passed through New York. At that time, an unknown woman recognized the great writer, reached out her hand, and said, "Mr. Dickens, would you be willing to let me shake the hand that has filled my home with so many good friends?"

### Beasts Bearing Heavy Loads

— Written by Mao Heng, Translated by Meng Nong

When you first see coolies carrying heavy loads on the road, you will find it a pleasing sight. They wear tattered blue shirts, either indigo bronze, or jade green, or milky yellow, extremely harmonious and contrasting with the natural scenery. When they walk along the rice paddy ridges or climb the green mountains in front of them, they seem to be walking very vigorously. They wear only a short shirt and trousers. Even if they initially wear a complete new garment, when it needs to be patched, they will never bother to choose a piece of cloth of the same color to repair it. They patch with whatever they have on hand. Regardless of sunny or rainy days, they always wear an old straw hat with a particularly wide and flat brim - a straw hat like a lampshade.

You can also see a line of coolies, marching one after another, each with a carrying pole on their shoulders, two large packages hanging from each end of the pole, forming a beautiful pattern. It is very interesting to see their reflections as they quickly wade through the water. When they pass before your eyes, you might as well carefully examine their faces. As long as you have not been instilled with the preconceived notion that the East is mysterious, then you must have said that their faces are kind and sincere. When you see them put down their heavy burdens and lie down beside the cool pavilion under the banyan tree, smoking or chatting happily, if you try to mention that they carry large packages for about a hundred li a day, you will naturally be shocked by their strong patience and excellent energy. But if you tell the Chinese people about your feelings, they will think it's not worth laughing at. They will also shrug their shoulders and tell you: coolies are just like livestock, and fathers pass it on to sons, and sons pass it on to grandsons. For two thousand years, they have been carrying heavy things without any change. Therefore, they are happy to do this thing, and it is not surprising. Indeed, you can see that they start doing this thing when they are young. You will meet young children, with a heavy pole on their shoulders, carrying heavy vegetable baskets, staggering by.

Years pass like flowing water, and the weather gradually warms up. The coolies take off their short shirts, baring their upper bodies and beginning to appear before people. Sometimes, he rests for a while, his heavy burden has been put down, but his carrying pole is still placed on his shoulder, so he has to slightly hunch his back. At this time, you can see how urgently the poor, weak heart is beating against his ribs; as clearly as you see the condition of a heart patient in a hospital ward. Seeing this scene is sad enough. You might as well take another look at the backs of the coolies. Year after year, day after day, the heavy pressure of the carrying pole has pressed out red, hard marks, sometimes even pressed into cracked sores, pressed out large sores without any bandages or clothing, rubbed against bamboo heads and wood chips. The most peculiar thing is: sometimes, it seems that the creator intentionally adds to the harshness of their servitude. A malformed, protruding thing forms on the shoulder, like a camel hump, allowing the carrying pole to be placed there. Regardless of the heart's rapid beating, regardless of the swelling and pain of the sores, regardless of the invasion of torrential rain, regardless of the scorching heat of the sun, they always move forward forever and ever, from morning until night, from the beginning of the year until the end of the year, from childhood until old age. You can also see those old men, without even an ounce or two of fat on their bodies, their skin as loose as if it were detached from their bones, withered and dry, their small faces wrinkled like monkeys, and their hair showing sparse whiteness. They stagger forward, under heavy loads, toward the edge of the grave that will grant them rest after a long life. However, the coolies continue to move forward, not running, nor walking, but walking quickly, their eyes constantly looking at the ground while they take steps, hurrying on their way, their faces showing tense and hurried expressions. You can no longer form the pattern of them hurrying on their way. Their strenuous situation can make you feel a sense of oppression. You cannot help but be filled with a vague sympathy.

In China, beasts bearing heavy loads are people.

"Is it not too pitiful that those who have suffered the磨折of life and hurriedly pass their entire journey without being able to proceed slowly? Endless labor, unable to enjoy its fruits while alive, only exhausting one's life and suddenly passing away, and not knowing where one's destination is—is this not a cause of suffering?" So say the philosophers of Chinese mysticism.

[Note] Mao Heng (W. Somerset Maugham), a famous modern British writer, born in 1874. He wrote the plays "The Land of Promise," "The Sacred Flame," and the essay collections "On a Chinese Screen," "Of Human Bondage," and dozens of other kinds, which are highly acclaimed. This article is the twentieth chapter of "On a Chinese Screen," written during a trip to China (1922) and is known as the best of Mao Heng's essays. It is specially translated to see a glimpse of his fine and vigorous style.

### Scenery

— De·Ke Kesui Kai

### Long Embankment

— Lin Yongquan

A long canal flows beside a long embankment.

The long embankment guides the long canal, protecting it.

The long canal is like a soft, whip-like ribbon,

Quietly nestled beside the long embankment.

The long embankment is revealed by the tall forest,

The tall forest protects the long embankment.

The roots of the tall forest are intertwined with the soil of the long embankment,

Making the long embankment firmer, and the long canal more peaceful.

In spring, the canal water is clear and bright,

The long embankment is covered with blooming flowers and lush grass.

The canal water seeps deep into the embankment soil,

Nourishing the flowers and grass, nourishing the tall forest.

The slender figures of the tall trees are reflected in the canal water;

The beautiful faces of the flowers and grass are mirrored in the canal water;

The canal water holds a beautiful picture,

And the murmuring of the water echoes the songs of the birds.

Long paths stretch along the long embankment;

Countless lively birds flit about in the tall forest;

Many arched ancient stone bridges span the long canal;

How many silent travelers pass over the stone bridges in contemplation.

Come to the long embankment,

You skilled painters, come paint the sounds and sights,

You singers, come join the choir,

You silent ones, come sit by the stone bridge.

He trails the long shadows of the tall forest as he leaves,

He carries away the scores of the birds' songs,

She departs, her love fading sadly away,

The tall forest, the long embankment, and the long canal whisper secrets to each other.

### Palace Lanterns

— Ke Ren

Those lanterns made with frames of Phoebe nanmu or bamboo, bound with deep red silk ribbons, with small and large glass panes on all four to eight sides, solemnly lit with red candles and hung up every year during the first month of the lunar new year, are called palace lanterns in my hometown.

Palace lanterns are different from wind lanterns, octagonal gauze lanterns, bright horn lanterns, wall lanterns, and such. Those are merely hung at the entrance of houses, on walls, and on ceilings, decorated with lacquered paper, gauze, or glass, serving both to embellish the holiday and to provide illumination. Palace lanterns, however, possess an air of elegance and wealth, and the significance of revering the gods and praying for blessings, and have always been properly hung in the main hall or living room.

Palace lanterns were originally items used in ancient imperial courts, but later the trend gradually spread to the common people. They entered the halls of wealthy families, and also the homes of common farmers with mud walls. Even in the thatched cottages of poor and helpless orphans and widows, they would occasionally settle without fear of appearing out of place. From then on, every family had palace lanterns; and the decoration of palace lanterns thus came to have differences in richness and simplicity. At the beginning of the year, the sight of the red glow of palace lanterns flickering on the corners of walls fills people's hearts with warmth and hope: This year's wheat will surely have full and ripe heads, and the youngest son will grow stronger and sturdier.

The crimson gauze or glass of the palace lanterns is often painted with popular folk stories from operas and novels that are well known to women and children, such as "Oath of the Peach Garden," "The Celestial Official Bestows Blessings," and "Magu Offers Longevity." Children always like red lanterns, and palace lanterns fascinate their childhood dreams. From a young age, they long for celestial officials, immortals, and heroes; although these dreams may eventually be shattered, even a passing thought of the impression palace lanterns made during childhood is still intimate and mysterious.

On nights with good moonlight, or when heavy snow falls and the fields are covered in silver, the red glow of the palace lanterns flickers, making them seem melancholic and mournful. I think of the aging, out-of-favor concubines in the imperial courts of feudal dynasties, and the countless palace women who wasted their youth, shedding tears in the moonlight, snowlight, and lamplight.

...I think.

What kind of times are we living in? I have, for no reason or purpose, brought up palace lanterns. My hometown probably no longer has families hanging and lighting palace lanterns. This is truly like "an old palace woman talking about the Kaiyuan Era," which is tiring and saddening.

### ### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 177

— Ye Jingfeng

Coincidentally, just as we were about to finish studying the plan, and this small gathering was about to end, right when we were formally beginning preparations for the sudden attack, "04's" subordinate came in with two secret telegrams, one from Tokyo and one from Shenyang. Both telegrams were replies to Tsurumi regarding the "Eight" question: The strange thing was that the content of the telegram from Shenyang was much more detailed and comprehensive than "012's" from Tokyo:

"Secret, urgent. Pingzi is Pine Group Number Eight, Xianzi is Orchid Group Number Eight, also Fangzi is Special Group Number Eight, Xizi is Plum Group Number Eight. Xizi is currently undergoing training in Tokyo and will be transferred to Shanghai next month. Fangzi is in charge of South China. The secret of 'Eight' is unknown here, Pingzi is unapproachable, act 'reluctantly', Fan, 315."

After I announced the telegram, Mr. W and Yaoqun became highly interested and asked me with a smile, "How come there are so many 'Eights'?" Little Tiger wanted to laugh upon hearing this, but tried his best to imitate the demeanor of an adult and held back his laughter.

"There are many problems!" I replied casually. Then I briefly explained the 'Eight' issue that Tsurumi and I had researched and the process.

Mr. W added some opinions to what Tsurumi had made clear about the "eight secret advance stations." He said that the Japanese always , it is assumed that the real secret spy stations were near the British heart of London, and other military ports, Washington, D.C., and Panama in the United States, and Moscow in the Soviet Union, and so on.

Qun pondered for a while, and suddenly asked Tsurumi and us: "How many large-scale secret operation stations did the Japanese have in our country when they launched this war of aggression?"

Tsurumi seemed to have suddenly found a key to open a secret vault, and immediately jumped up, pulled out a map from under a pile of books on the table, and unfolded it, counting with his mouth, one, two,... drawing circles on it with a pencil:

"Hey, at least more than thirty large stations!" Tsurumi muttered to himself, as if he was saying it to us; but immediately shouted out as if he had discovered something secret, ... "Wait!" He also pulled out his handy almanac notebook, furrowed his brow, and carefully flipped through it.

I stood aside, silently observing Tsurumi's actions and expressions, analyzing his psychology. I saw that he had two different expressions at this time; one was innocent frankness, and the other was youthful competitiveness: when he unfolded the map, counting and circling, he was completely like a child—immediately revealing what he had gained. But at this time, seeing that Qun was about to come over to help, he immediately loudly since the mathematical problem was almost solved, he didn't want anyone to help because of his competitive nature.

Yaoqun also understood Tsurumi's psychological change at this time, so after hearing him , he immediately sat back in his original position; gazing at Tsurumi with a smile, waiting for his answer. From the thick smoke that was being exhaled in puffs, I saw the smile in the corner of Mr. W's eye.

"That's right!" Tsurumi's eyes were still fixed on the small notebook, and he spat out these two words. As he spoke, he continued to draw circles and count on the map, from one all the way to eight. After counting, he carefully considered it again, as if reconsidering it.

"Everyone come and see!" Tsurumi was still staring at the map: the tone of the shout was very much like a Shandong performer of Western-style shows; only missing a set of small gongs and cymbals.

"More than thirty small districts can be merged into eight large districts." Tsurumi showed us all the large and small circles on the map.

Except for the main station in Shenyang, Tsurumi drew a circle from Tianjin to Datong, Jinan as the center, which was considered the second circle; Taiyuan as the center of a circle, Wuhan as a circle, Shanghai-Nanjing as a circle, and the rest were Guangzhou, Kunming, Yichang, and other three circles, for a total of eight major districts. Explaining the reason for the zoning, Tsurumi also read out eight names from his notebook, who were the demons in charge of these eight major districts. With this comparison, we immediately believed that this discovery was precisely revealing the "secret of the Eight" from Pingzi's mouth. Only Mr. W, I pondered for a moment, and did not seem to believe it very thoroughly.

### Aunt Zhang, Daydreaming in the Kitchen

— Zhuguang

Aunt Zhang, the young housewife who had just moved into the back wing, had come back from the vegetable market today as if possessed, staring blankly, simply daydreaming in the kitchen.

This world is truly going crazy. A few days ago, they said gold was rising, and the U.S. dollar was going up. These days, it should be stable, but daily necessities still refuse to fall in price.

The vegetable vendors in the vegetable market are all like they're possessed. Buying vegetables and meat from them is like not paying. The "rapacious" force of their anger is truly infuriating. They say that selling more means losing more, and that gold is about to reach ten million!

"Tofu is going to sell at the price of meat." In these days, tofu is practically selling at the price of gold. Usually, three to five thousand yuan could buy enough vegetables for three to five dishes, even if there wasn't much meat. Today, however, that's not the case—it's not even enough to buy a pound of meat.

Turning over the few vegetables spread thinly at the bottom of the basket, she repeatedly muttered the bustling market prices from the vegetable market just now:

Pork five thousand yuan per pound, ribbonfish two thousand yuan each, eggs three hundred and fifty, blood clams two thousand four, snails eight hundred yuan at the very least, even greens and bean sprouts have to be six hundred yuan per pound.

Not to mention the prices of oil, sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and salt, they are all the same. When gold was nine million five hundred thousand and white rice was one hundred and eighty thousand, a canteen meal was five hundred yuan, white sugar four thousand yuan, soybean oil three thousand two, but now gold and white rice have all fallen, but these things refuse to drop in price.

What makes our Aunt Zhang even more inexplicable is that the market price of fuel in these few days has not only not fallen with the price of gold, but has actually been rising. For example, coal briquettes, on the day (the day of the peak of gold and white rice) coal briquettes were twenty-five thousand per load, but today they have actually risen to thirty-three thousand, and coal, which was originally five hundred yuan per pound, has also doubled today. That day, kerosene jumped to one thousand two (per pound), and people were already surprised, but today it finally reached one thousand five.

Tingzi asked her sister-in-law, Lan, to come in with a smile, saying that cigarettes had fallen in price today, ten cigarettes of the Great Britain brand only sold for seven hundred yuan, and Qianmen (twenty cigarettes) for three thousand yuan. A few days ago, Great Britain was one thousand one, and Qianmen had to sell for four thousand and more. Tingzi Xian's sister-in-law squinted her eyes and smiled all the time, and also said: The American brand Lucky Strike used to sell for four thousand yuan, but today it is down to two thousand six.

But Aunt Zhang in the back wing is a non-smoker, so the price of cigarettes falling is irrelevant to her. She just looked at the green flame on the kerosene stove and smiled bitterly. (February 16th) She smiled bitterly at the green flame on the kerosene stove.

### Civil Servants Singing Praises of Benevolent Governance

— Xiao Kangshi

In the past week or so, the alarming rise in gold, white rice, and essential daily necessities has caused extreme panic among the salaried class, especially civil servants who are not paid according to the "cost of living index," sitting in the office in mourning; "eyes reading the newspapers" and "ears listening to the news," each one is panicking!

Speaking of civil servants' salaries, after the adjustment in December last year, it was 170,000 yuan plus 1,100 times the increment. Taking a low salary of 100 yuan as an example, the total was 280,000 yuan. At that time, this could buy five loads of rice, but according to the current rice price, it can only buy two loads, and in effect a "40% discount" has been added.

Because of this, civil servants have been thrown into extreme "grief."

The government authorities plan to "distribute in-kind" to civil servants, including six items: rice, oil, coal, sugar, salt, and cloth. At the same time, civil servants' salaries will increase to 350,000 yuan as the base amount, and the basic number will increase to 1,300 times, according to the news published in this newspaper on the 15th.

When civil servants see these two pieces of "good news," they can't help but "jump for joy," praising benevolent governance.

But thinking about it carefully, another ripple of "feeling" arises. The things "allocated" to public school teachers in the past were of poor quality and not cheap, especially since the allocation price always followed the "black market soaring." Can these "worries" be clarified in the future?

### May My Hands Be Light and My Feet Strong, May a Hundred Diseases Never Approach - Wild Jumps in the Western Medicine Market - One Can't Afford to Get Sick, Ha Ha!

— Zhu Guang

In this day and age, there is nothing more frightening than getting sick and taking medicine. Even if it is just a headache, a cold, or a minor ailment, if you want to recover quickly and seek relief from medicine, it will cost thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan, not to mention the doctor's consultation fee, let alone the bitter taste of the medicine, which is difficult to swallow!

During this gold rush, the prices that jumped the most fiercely were those of Western medicines. Not only was the increase rapid, but the prices were simply being shouted out randomly. There was no market, and the merchants holding the goods were like owners of "priceless treasures."

On the day that gold was quoted at nine million five hundred thousand and white rice rose to one hundred and eighty to ninety thousand, it was almost impossible to find even the most popular daily medicines, even at high prices. This scene was truly as if the end of the world had really arrived.

If anyone who had Bayer pharmaceutical factory products and new American medicines was willing to let go of the goods, then in a situation where "as long as Baby is willing to open his mouth," they were all snapped up, such as Bayer's Aspirin (ten tablets) fifteen thousand, Gardan (ten tablets) forty thousand, Crisalbine (per bottle) twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand, Black Lion 606 (per ampoule) fifty-five thousand to sixty thousand, Dolantin injection two hundred and eighty to three hundred thousand (per box). Other American medicines, such as Sulfathiazole (per thousand tablets) three hundred thousand, Sulfathiazole (per thousand tablets) one hundred and thirty to forty thousand, 606 per ampoule twelve thousand, Monsanto saccharin four hundred and seventy thousand per pound, and double peach quinine four hundred and fifty thousand. Being able to buy even some of the above items was considered "lucky" on that day.

Not only were foreign goods like this, but domestic new drugs were also like wild horses that had broken free of their reins, galloping madly. Taking several of the most common medicines used by ordinary citizens as an example, Universal Oil "big market" (per dozen) thirty-eight to thirty-nine thousand, retail sales when buying such a small round container, was four thousand yuan, and so were Bagua Dan and headache powder. The "good medicine for children," Partridge Cuisine, jumped to sixty-eight to seventy thousand yuan, and Xiaozhilong tablets and injections were around four thousand five to five thousand, and ointment also rose to two thousand five.

Since the government announced that it would announce emergency measures to stabilize the price of gold, and at the same time sent senior officials to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the accounts, the Western medicine market has also declined daily. In the general commodity market, Western medicine is one of the commodities that is more or less speculative, because its actual sales role is far less than the role of "chips." Therefore, the decline in market prices in these few days has been more significant and rapid than that of other commodities.

For example, all the above-mentioned drugs have generally fallen by 20 to 40 percent. The following table shows the final market price up to the government's announcement of the new exchange rate:

Aspirin eight thousand to ten thousand yuan, Gardan thirty thousand, Crisalbine twenty-two thousand, Black Lion 606 forty-three thousand, Dolantin injection one hundred and eighty to ninety thousand. American Sulfathiazole one hundred and eighty thousand, Sulfathiazole eighty thousand, 606 five thousand yuan, Monsanto saccharin three hundred and ninety thousand, double peach quinine three hundred and eighty to four hundred thousand, domestic new drug Universal Oil twenty-eight thousand per dozen, retail sales three thousand yuan, Bagua Dan fell from forty thousand to thirty thousand, headache powder also fell to twenty-two thousand, and Partridge Cuisine has fallen to less than sixty thousand yuan.

Even so, these prices are still much higher than before the gold rush. Just talking about spending three or four thousand yuan to buy a pack of Bagua Dan should be enough to make people feel burdened. As for such medicines as " , as a "small citizen" like you or me, we are fundamentally unable to try it. It is said that when it first arrived, each gram cost three to four hundred thousand, and the lowest market price a few days ago was about two hundred and fifty thousand. Although it is said to have "special effects," it may not necessarily be able to "bring back the dead," and even if it does have this "special effect," at least thirty or forty ampoules are required.

But news came that the exchange rate had been adjusted to twelve thousand to one, and the falling prices of Western medicines seem to be a flash in the pan and will rise again.

From now on, I hope to have three bowls of light rice, light hands and feet, and that even small illnesses like colds and coughs will never approach. I say, in this day and age, with Western medicine so expensive, is there anything more frightening than getting sick and taking medicine, my friend, don't you think so?!

### Shallow Words from the Marketplace

— Menglong

Recently, the price of gold and the price of goods have seen both rises and falls, but after all, the rise is more, the fall is less, the rise is fast, and the fall is slow, the rise is like jumping, and the fall is like crawling. I hope it "jumps high and falls heavily"!

Three-color terror surrounds the citizens of the country: white refers to white rice, yellow refers to gold, and the one that stirs up the wind and waves is black, which refers to all "black-hearted" speculative activities. The only countermeasure of the authorities at present is to step up the investigation of these "three-color terrorists." Soon, these hoarders who fatten themselves will have no way to escape, and they will all be suppressed until the end. This is simply "the dead ghost demands payment, they deserve it"!

The higher the price of goods rises, the more prevalent speculation becomes. Conversely, the more prevalent speculation, the more the price of goods rises in direct proportion. This is the current major economic crisis, which is aptly described as: "a paper-glued bench, you can't sit on it!"

Big speculators don't see their own mischief, but insist on saying that others are meddling, which is what is called "a foot-long lampstand, illuminating far but not near"!

### A Small Businessman Talks About Chemical Industrial Raw Materials

— Han Qin

I unintentionally met a distant cousin I hadn't seen in a few years, and he insisted on inviting me to sit in his shop for a while. Luckily, the road wasn't too far, so I went with him.

Near the Zhonghui Building, there are many chemical raw material shops, and he led me into one.

"When did you move here?" I asked, a little strangely.

"It's been several years. Ever since I and a few friends opened this raw material shop together, I've been living here."

I remembered that he used to be in the publishing business, how did he suddenly switch to chemical raw materials? I asked him, and he smiled.

"Didn't you used to study drawing? How are you now working at the exchange?"

I was left speechless by his question, but he chattered on, telling me that the business of this shop was very good when it first opened, but in the second half of the old year, the business was very slow, and he had been living off his savings for more than half a year. If there was no improvement this year, he wanted to change careers again. After I admired his business acumen, I asked him, as an outsider:

"How much business can you do in a day here?"

He laughed, "We don't rely much on retail business. These many old friends and staff would have starved to death long ago. The main thing is still large-scale imports and exports. A familiar customer calls, and we make a deal, because our capital is short, and we don't have much stock ourselves. With such high interest rates, we don't dare to import ourselves, we still act as agents to sell and buy for customers, and each transaction is quite substantial. At the end of last year, the market price of chemical raw materials suddenly moved, and at the beginning of this year, with the soaring foreign exchange, raw materials also rose. There are a few things, you won't believe me when I tell you, they have simply risen hundreds of times!"

I became worried and asked, "Is this related to people's livelihoods?"

"If you say it's related, what is not related to people's livelihoods? But the price increases are not something we, who act as agents to sell and buy for customers, can control."

"How much have they risen exactly? Tell me some things that I'm familiar with!"

"Like at the end of the old lunar year, caustic soda was only three million per barrel, yellow petrolatum was only five or six hundred yuan, baking soda was only thirty to forty thousand yuan, white oil was only ten thousand or so, and glycerin was only thirty to forty thousand yuan. Now caustic soda is six million, yellow petrolatum is one thousand yuan, baking soda is fifteen to sixteen thousand, white oil is nearly one million or so, and glycerin is over eighty thousand."

"Will this affect the cost of industrial products?"

He smiled sarcastically: "You don't need to ask me this."

"Then, what about the problem of competing with foreign goods?" I simply played the fool to the end.

"I'm not an economist."

That's right, he's just a small businessman, and he can only tell me that the market price is like this. As for issues affecting life, let us answer them ourselves.

### Cinema

— Lu

Refusing Rebuttal, Brazenly Raising Prices

The cinema refused the Social Bureau's rebuttal of the price increase and "brazenly" raised prices. The highest ticket price at one cinema is seven thousand yuan, but the black market at the entrance is quoting twelve thousand yuan.

If I had a lot of US dollars, it would be very convenient, because the official price is twelve thousand, but...

### We Are Not Cows Protesting to "Kedi" Company

— Guohua

I am a loyal consumer of "Kedi" Milk Company, and I have been for ten years, without change. But in the near future, our relationship may be interrupted.

In the most recent year, since the victory, American goods have poured in like a tide, and the dumping of Klim milk powder has threatened the milk company. Many consumers have stopped ordering and switched to milk powder, but we old customers have remained steadfast. Half of this is due to inertia, and half is due to considerable affection, hoping that this will allow the milk company to maintain itself.

We treat the company this way, but the company does not treat its consumers this way. There is no need to talk about repeated price increases, but recently, the price has suddenly increased by 50%, and prepayment is required (ordering half a pound requires paying 90,000 yuan in advance, while before the increase it was 39,000 yuan per month), otherwise you must pay daily, which is too unfair to consumers.

The milk company has never suffered bad debts from its consumers, especially us old customers. The company should not distrust us in this way, requiring us to pay a large sum in advance, or treating us as ordinary retail customers.

The milk company's view of prices also seems to be too stimulating. Gold and the US dollar do not rise in price every day, why should milk be prepared to adjust every day? We do not believe that the company is calculating the cost of living index every day, nor do we believe that the company's expenses (such as wages and feed) are also calculated and priced daily.

What the milk company should be squeezing is cows, not consumers who are loyal customers. But now the company seems to be using milking methods on us consumers.

I am unwilling to be such a cow, so I say that in the near future, I am afraid that the ten years of friendship will be cut off in one fell swoop.

My current method is to never prepay, and wait for delivery to be stopped. And I call on fellow consumers not to be cows. Because what is squeezed out of us is not milk that nourishes the masses, but huge sums of cash and interest.
