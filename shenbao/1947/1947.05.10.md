[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] The principles for adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants were decided at the Executive Yuan's political review meeting held at 10:00 AM on the 9th. The measures were also passed, but are still awaiting the Executive Yuan's Accounting Office to study and calculate the total budget after the adjustment. The Ministry of Finance will then assess the actual situation and pass it at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 13th. Therefore, the amount decided in this measure has not been disclosed by any party. After the political review meeting adjourned, only the Director of the Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, made the following public announcement: "Regarding the salaries and wages of civil and military public school teachers and workers, the Executive Yuan's review meeting proposed today to adjust them with reference to the actual situation, starting this month, and a decision will be made at the political affairs meeting next Tuesday."

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] The National Economic Commission's Price Committee is scheduled to discuss current price issues at 9:00 AM on the 10th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] It is rumored that the authorities, in order to absorb idle funds, are considering having the national bank launch short-term savings deposits with a term of one year or six months and attractive interest rates.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] It is reported that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will soon establish an Overseas Chinese Economic Bureau to encourage and assist overseas Chinese to invest in the country.

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Political Committee Member Jiang Yuntian left for Shanghai by train on the night of the 9th. The economic policy reforms advocated by Jiang have not yet been raised at the political review meeting (i.e., the special meeting referred to by Reuters) on the 9th. Jiang told reporters today that he will submit them after further study with several individuals. At the same time, Jiang used the example of taking a car to emphasize that after the abolition of foreign exchange controls, if the exchange rate is too high, cars should not be imported, and we can all walk more often.

Foreign Exchange Controls Seem Necessary; Currency Reform Is Not Yet Timely

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] An economic expert who participated in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference told reporters on the 9th that in the current situation, abolishing foreign exchange rates may cause various inconveniences and may not necessarily benefit the current economic situation. He solemnly pointed out that national foreign exchange controls are a last resort, especially in foreign trade, which is necessary; after the war, the losses were heavy, exports were difficult, and import needs increased. To seek a stable international balance of payments, one must start with foreign exchange controls. If it is allowed to proceed unchecked, not only will gold resources be lost, but funds will also flee abroad. The international balance of payments will inevitably form a reverse flow.

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Various parties are paying close attention to the issue of currency reform. When a reporter visited an authoritative economist on the 9th, he said: "Currency reform is extremely necessary, but it is not yet the time to carry out currency reform rashly at present." He pointed out that to seek currency reform, one must first have various objective conditions so that the value of the new currency can be maintained after the currency reform. It is said that before reforming the currency system, countries undergo a long period of consolidation, first seeking currency stability. Taking France as an example, the currency value has been stable since 1926, but currency reform did not begin until 1928. The situation in the United Kingdom is also the same. The country's restoration of the gold standard was also implemented after a considerable period of currency stability. When the reporter asked whether China could adopt Germany's method of using foreign loans to consolidate the currency system, he believed that the situations in the two countries could not be compared. The main difficulty Germany encountered at that time was external pressure. After a large loan was provided by a foreign country, the currency system problem could be solved. The difficulties China currently faces are that internal difficulties are greater than external pressure. Since the situations are different, the handling methods must also be different.

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] After Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan reported to the participating councilors on the 9th, Councilor Chuan Sinian first raised a question, strongly advocating severe punishment for illegal officials as a warning to others. He emphasized, "Why did the government lend money to the Shenxin Cotton Mill and buy cotton from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for 700,000 yuan per piece, but sell it for 1.5 million yuan?" Regarding the grain issue, Fu also believed that the handling in Shanghai was not satisfactory, and the allocation was not universally achieved, but was instead manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. The government should take tough and quick measures to appease the people. Subsequently, Yin Shuxian also expressed opinions on the China Grain Company's handling of people's food, believing it was inappropriate and affecting current prices. He also heard that each section chief of the company had a car and advocated that the government should conduct a thorough investigation. Zhang made a brief reply to the inquiry.

[United Press, Nanjing 9th] Premier Zhang Qun reported to the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council that the people's lives can only be properly guaranteed when the country is unified.

### The Issue of Our Surplus Salt Exported to Japan; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Discusses the Actual Situation; If There Is No Surplus for Self-Use, Exports to Japan Will Stop

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] In recent years, the industrial circles and all sectors of society in our country have attached great importance to the issue of exporting surplus salt to Japan. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently issued the following statement on this matter:

(1) Our country's salt production situation: Our country produces a lot of salt, and production has always exceeded sales. This year, the output of salt fields in various regions of the country can reach 3 million tons. In addition to supplying about 2.3 million tons for national food needs and industrial and fishery salt, there is a surplus of about 800,000 tons.

(2) All exports to Japan are surplus salt. The best use for surplus salt is for domestic industrial salt. The government strongly promotes industrial salt and currently provides it free of charge. However, the actual amount of industrial salt released nationwide last year was only over 60,000 tons, which is difficult to accommodate the surplus salt. Moreover, the surplus salt is produced by salt farmers and a way out must be found to maintain the livelihood of salt producers. Therefore, since last year, surplus salt has been exported to Japan. This year, the maximum amount of surplus salt to be exported to Japan is set at 500,000 tons for the whole year, and 150,000 tons are planned to be exported to Japan in the first half of the year. Of the 800,000 tons of surplus salt, not all is exported, and a portion is stored for domestic use.

(3) The economic benefits of Japanese salt at present: using useless surplus salt to exchange for urgently needed materials at present, such as transportation timber, mineral timber, and silk, etc., can not only maintain the livelihood of salt farmers, but also save huge amounts of foreign exchange and enrich the economy of the belly society. The benefits are very great.

(4) The recovery of Japanese industry has nothing to do with our country's export of surplus salt to Japan. Japan is currently under the control of the Allied forces. Whether its industry should be restored and to what extent it should be restored is entirely up to the Allied forces, which has nothing to do with our country's export of surplus salt to Japan. Japan has now ordered 400,000 tons of African Red Sea salt from the United Kingdom, which the United Kingdom will ship to Japan with its own ships at a price of US$15.7 per ton. This proves that even if our country does not export surplus salt to Japan, Japan can still purchase salt from other sources to revive its industry, and our country will only lose international trade opportunities and lose many economic benefits, which is a pity. Therefore, we should seize the opportunity to export surplus salt to Japan in exchange for goods.

(5) If our country's industry is developed, salt exports to Japan can be stopped. As mentioned above, all salt exports to Japan are surplus. If our country's salt industry develops and the demand for industrial salt increases, we will give priority to supplying domestic use as much as possible. If all the salt produced nationwide can be sold domestically and there is no surplus, salt exports to Japan can be stopped at any time.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The case of the traitor Ding Mocun was previously sentenced to death by the Beijing High Court on February 8th of this year. Leidi did not accept the appeal. After reviewing the most business court; "The original judgment was overturned, Ding Mocun colluded with enemy countries to plot resistance against his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all property confiscated except for necessary living expenses for family members" The main reasons are as follows: "The defendant was originally a member of the Chinese Kuomintang and once held important positions in the Central Military Commission. At a time when the War of Resistance was extremely tense and the country's safety was at stake, he merely removed his position as director of the Third Division of the Military Statistics Bureau, in anger, he forgot the big picture for trivial reasons, and small grievances overrode great principles, not hesitating to betray the party and join the enemy's puppet regime, serving in important positions in the puppet regime and acting in opposition to our side. Moreover, he attended the Puppet Central Political Committee to discuss the Puppet side's national policy and attempted to shake our country's foundation, presided over the Puppet Special Task Force Headquarters to harm our judicial talents and patriotic warriors, thereby weakening our resistance forces.

At the time when he and Wangni and others colluded, his position was high and his power was obvious, and he arbitrarily exercised his power, intending to cut off our Chinese nation and plunge it into eternal doom and then be happy. And when he saw different thoughts and transferred his energy away from his job, relying on the already formed situation of betrayal and rebellion, he helped to subvert our government. His crimes were not different from the great traitors and giants who first rebelled. If he is not placed in the canine position, it is not enough to justify the state and extend the national law. The original judgment was based on the fact that the defendant's crimes were extremely heinous and could not be forgiven. According to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, he was sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and announced the confiscation of property in accordance with the law to conform to the law and be corrected."

Commentary

### The Conscription Problem in Shanghai

— Written by Fang Qiu

Shanghai is about to implement conscription, which is still a pioneering effort in Shanghai. As a result, the conscription process has been prepared many times and delayed many times, causing anxiety among the people and social unrest. The municipal authorities and military service agencies also lack publicity and explanation of government orders. Originally, it was an ordinary administration, but it was misunderstood by a few people as harming the people, which is an unfortunate event for the country's military service administration. The household survey of eligible young men began at the beginning of this month. According to the slight conscription process, after the household survey, there will be a physical examination, lottery, and conscription. The completion of the entire conscription process is cumbersome and time-consuming and cannot be delayed any longer. If delayed, it may reduce the efficiency of military service administration; it may also cause confusion due to incomplete procedures and the discovery of errors, which will only increase social strife and public criticism. Therefore, we hope that Shanghai's first conscription should be legal and reasonable, completed on time and in the required numbers, and strive for its ideal, striving to be a demonstration for the national military service!

Military service is an important policy of the state, the foundation of building an army, and the potential strength of the country. An independent country should have its national defense, and should have its army and its military service. The constitution of any country stipulates that the people have the obligation to perform military service. Our country's constitution also has special articles. The Military Service Law is a substantial law that promotes military service and stipulates the obligation of the people to perform military service. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the frontline urgently needed more soldiers, and the Military Service Law provided a constant stream of soldiers. The Military Service Law brought us victory and protected our nation's survival and national security. The merits of the Military Service Law will last forever and will never decay. The Military Service Law was partially amended in light of the war experience and national defense goals. The revised Military Service Law was promulgated and implemented by the National Government on October 10th last year. At the same time, the National Government issued a proclamation to the people: "Since October 10th of the thirty-fifth year, the revised military service regulations will continue to be implemented. All our citizens must know that military service is the natural duty of everyone, and must encourage each other to respond enthusiastically so that the foundation of army building can be laid and national defense forces can be enriched." To assist in the implementation of the Military Service Law, the National Government promulgated and implemented the "Implementing Regulations of the Military Service Law" on February 19th of this year. From the perspective of the military service legal system, the military service legal system is largely complete. Local governments at all levels and military service agencies at all levels should proceed in an orderly manner, implement conscription according to law and procedures, train citizens, promote martial virtue, and enrich their patriotic feelings to enhance the survival potential of an independent country.

Since the promulgation and implementation of the Military Service Law, all localities in the country, except for the pacification zones and the Yellow River disaster areas, have implemented conscription in accordance with the law. Only Shanghai has been delayed. In terms of responsibilities, the Shanghai Municipal Government has a Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Civil Affairs has a Military Affairs Section dedicated to this matter; the Ministry of National Defense has also established a Division and Regiment Garrison Command in Shanghai, all of which are military service administrative agencies. In terms of expenses, the military service expenses in the Shanghai Municipal Budget for this year are 184,881,140 yuan, in addition to the defense affairs expenditure of the Division and Regiment Garrison Command. In terms of population, the population of Shanghai is more than 4 million. According to the survey conducted by the Department of Civil Affairs in October last year: there are 991,3178 men aged 18 to 20; there are 231,538 men aged 20 to 25; there are 113,550 men aged 25 to 30; there are 194,996 men aged 30 to 35; there are 179,045 men aged 35 to 40; and there are 156,791 men aged 40 to 45. Logically speaking, the conditions for implementing military service in Shanghai are very sufficient, and there are many enthusiastic and righteous people in Shanghai. If conscription is implemented, raising preferential expenses and collecting comfort supplies is also better than in other places. With these subjective and objective conditions, conscription in Shanghai should be promoted smoothly, handled in accordance with the law, and will surely be successful!

Because Shanghai's conscription has been delayed for a long time, people in neighboring provinces and counties believe that Shanghai has special circumstances and can evade military service. As a result, Shanghai's population has increased sharply in the past six months, the household registration has become chaotic, and those who evade military service are trying to obtain positions. Due to the increase in population, the lack of housing, the expansion of consumption, and the soaring prices of food and goods, the stability and order of society have been affected, affecting the control of the public security organs. If this phenomenon continues to develop, it will not be the happiness of the Shanghai society, but a hidden danger in the Shanghai society. Today's Shanghai, solving the unemployment problem and the population problem is one thing, and solving the entire society is another, and conscription must be promoted as soon as possible, and those who evade military service and concentrate in cities must be punished. This can not only assist in solving social problems, but also eliminate social chaos and anxiety. In short, in today's Shanghai, social problems and military service problems have become linked, so solving the military service problem is solving the social problem. This point, I hope the administrative authorities and social figures, must recognize, must pay attention to.

Now the household survey of eligible young men is underway, which is only the beginning of the military service process. The survey is passive, and the physical examination and lottery conscription involve legal departments and the determination of people's identity. The handling must be cautious, and the review must be in accordance with the law. Therefore, Article 33 of the Military Service Implementing Regulations stipulates that the organized Military Service Association should also be advocated by social dignitaries, from assisting military farmers to supervising military service, whether it is inspection and lottery, or review of exemption from military service, all must be fair, just, reasonable, and lawful. Shanghai is an area where Chinese and foreign people are concentrated. Everyone is paying attention to the handling of conscription. It is hoped that the evil practices of handling military service in the interior and the malpractices of promoting military service in remote areas will not occur in Shanghai.

In short, Shanghai has superior conditions for handling military service. The administrative authorities should have the responsible courage and determination to handle Shanghai's military service well, set an example for the country, and change the national atmosphere, so as to achieve the effect of moving the wind and bending the grass. The time is now. May the Shanghai Municipal Authorities and social figures work hard to achieve it!

### Acheson Advocates Effective Implementation of US Foreign Aid Plan Stabilization of the World is Truly Necessary Assisting the Revival of Germany and Japan Makes Them Work for the Interests of Europe and Asia

[Reuters, Cleveland, Mississippi, 8th] Undersecretary of State Acheson said in a speech here today: There can be no political or economic stability in the world until all countries are able to support themselves, and no one can have lasting peace and prosperity. Therefore, the United States must continue to implement its large-scale foreign aid plan for several years. Many countries will need a very long time to recover without external assistance, and feelings of disappointment and frustration will inevitably arise. Under such circumstances, freedom, democracy, and independence cannot survive for long. Those who are hungry, cold, and desperate have no choice but to take risks, so war will never disappear until the people of the world have warm clothes and enough food and have some confidence in the future. This year, US imports are only half of exports, which raises some of the most important issues in international relations. How can other countries obtain US dollars to make up for this huge trade deficit, and what does this mean for the United States and US foreign policy if similar trade deficits are likely to continue next year or even the year after? The meaning is that we Americans must take measures to minimize the gap between the world's needs and its ability to pay, and there is no room for opportunism. This is just common sense. We today have an obligation to make up for the world's budget deficit, based on our own interests. Acheson continued: When the United States provides reconstruction assistance to foreign countries, it should give priority to free nations that are able to resist internal or external totalitarian pressures in order to maintain their independent democratic systems and human freedom. Furthermore, if foreign countries continue to purchase necessities for sustaining life and economic recovery from abroad in 1948 and 1949, the United States must continue to provide emergency financial assistance. The United States must actively promote the revival of Germany and Japan, which are the major factories of Europe and Asia. The revival of both continents depends on the revival of these two countries. The harmonious cooperation of all parts of the European economy is a basic condition for European revival, and this is a basic goal of US foreign policy. Acheson also said: The Geneva trade conference must succeed, not only because of the urgent supply and financial situation in the world today, but also because the United States is the world's largest producer and creditor country, so it must be able to obtain a large number of imports in the long run. Acheson concluded: The forces that can eliminate economic collapse are not just dollar loans, but also urgently needed wheat, coal, and steel.

### US Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Likely to Pass in the House Two Amendments Have Been Rejected

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey bill is likely to pass in the House today. Supporters of the bill are confident that they have thwarted the efforts of the most determined opponents to defeat or cripple the legislation. They hope to hold a final vote in the evening.

### Supreme Court Reverses Original Judgment, Orders Retrial of Wen LantIng Case, Claims Service in Puppet Government Was Under Secret Orders, Recognizes Appellant's Allegation of Improper Original Judgment as Justified

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Wen Lanting case was previously judged by the Shanghai High Court on September 12th of last year. Wen appealed the original judgment. Now, the Supreme Court has issued a retrial, stating in the main text of the judgment: "The original judgment is revoked, and the case is returned to the Shanghai High Court for retrial." The main reasons are as follows: The original trial found the appellant guilty under Article 3 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, applying Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the same regulations, for participating in a puppet organization, relying on enemy puppet forces, and acting in a manner favorable to the enemy puppet regime and detrimental to our country. This cannot be said to be without grounds. However, the letter from the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party states: "In January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Comrade Ji Xizong secretly reported that the working environment was becoming increasingly difficult and mentioned that Wen Lanting had lived in Shanghai for many years, was familiar with the local situation, and proposed contacting him for cover. Secret orders were issued approving him to go and negotiate, to provide cover, and to facilitate intelligence gathering. To strengthen the enemy's trust, it was agreed to join the puppet Municipal Chamber of Commerce and serve as a puppet supervisor. Furthermore, in February of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], when the enemy puppet organization Shangtonghui (Trade Control Association) implemented economic control, the Bureau, upon receiving the report, secretly ordered Comrade Ji to instruct Wen Lanting to serve as the supervisor of the Shangtonghui in order to disrupt their control conspiracy. Agreed to Wen Lanting serving as the director of the puppet Cotton Control Association. In June of the 32nd year, the puppet regime forced Wen Lanting to take over as chairman of the puppet Shangtonghui, which was also agreed to by telegram." The appellant also stated during the original trial, "The matters I did were under orders from the central government, and I was not a traitor." If the appellant's service in the puppet government was under orders to infiltrate and engage in counter-espionage work, then Article 21, Paragraph 2, First Section of the Criminal Law would apply. However, this fact was not mentioned at all by the appellant during the investigations by the Military Affairs Commission's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and the original trial, whether he assumed the task of subversion and intelligence gathering after participating in the puppet government. Moreover, regarding the fact that the Rice Industry Control Association supplied the Japanese invaders with military rice, the appellant confessed, "Approximately 'two million dan' were ordered annually by the puppet Executive Yuan." It is questionable whether the appellant, as chairman of the Shangtonghui, forwarded this order to the Rice Control Association for supply. The original trial did not transfer and interrogate Ji Xizong, nor did it retrieve relevant case files and conduct a detailed investigation. The ability to conduct investigations on its own authority in the trial was, in fact, incomplete. The appellant's grounds for requesting a retrial, criticizing the original judgment as improper, cannot be said to be without reason and should be recognized as grounds for a retrial. Based on the above conclusions, a judgment should be made in accordance with the proviso of Article 22, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, as in the main text.

### Council Requests Prompt Planning and Implementation of Grain Rationing by District and Population

[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Committee of the Municipal Council held its 13th meeting yesterday, discussing several proposals. Regarding the telegram from the Wuxi County Council requesting the central government to unfreeze the cost-of-living index, the committee also resolved to recommend that the central government promptly discuss and formulate a reasonable method for unfreezing the cost-of-living index. In addition, regarding the Social Bureau's request to appoint price review committee members, it was resolved to recommend Zhang Zhongyuan to participate in the rice group, Zhou Lianze to participate in the sugar group, Huang Zenshi to participate in the flour group, Yao Baozhen to the fuel group, Shao Yongsheng to the yarn and cloth group, and Yuan Zhaoxin to the cooking oil group. Other matters requested to be handled by the Municipal Government include: (1) Promptly plan and implement a method of grain rationing by district and population, to be implemented in the shortest possible time. (2) Forward to the Executive Yuan an order instructing the Ministry of Transportation to determine the nature of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway freight business offices and improve the handling of freight business. (3) Citizens suggest immediately banning or destroying comic books to prevent harm to children's minds; please refer to the Social Bureau.

### Council Speaker Issues Statement on Rice Rationing Problems

Municipal Council Speaker Pan issued a statement to reporters yesterday, saying: In recent days, in order to understand the implementation of local self-government in various districts and the matters that should be promoted and reformed, the council has held a total of seven symposiums in various districts, inviting the chairmen of the district people's representative conferences and the heads and deputy heads of the districts. These symposiums concluded successfully yesterday. The attendees from various districts provided many opinions on the issue of people's food. In summary, they are as follows: (1) Since the Municipal Government adopted the method of purchasing subsidized rice with household registration certificates, each district has felt that the supply cannot meet the demand, which inevitably leads to repeated disputes. Therefore, they still hope that the authorities will broaden the source of supply and increase the quota for each district. (2) Regarding the new measures that the Municipal Government will take recently, it is said that it intends to prioritize the rationing of rice to workers, public school teachers, and the poor in the city. This intention is quite reasonable. Although it is still under study, all parties hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible. However, according to the opinions of various districts, it is felt that the definition of the so-called poor should have a clear scope to avoid abuses. Although most citizens in the suburbs are engaged in agriculture, the districts of Pudong, Dachang, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Longhua, except for a small portion that grows vegetables, mostly grow dry crops such as cotton and wheat and do not produce rice. Their rice supply still relies heavily on the urban area. Moreover, there is no shortage of poor people from other provinces in the suburbs. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can treat the suburbs and the urban area equally when dealing with the food problem. The above two points are both facts, and I am very sympathetic. In the face of extreme difficulties, the government's response to the food crisis, prioritizing the supply to the impoverished classes, is not unreasonable in principle. It only requires careful planning, competent personnel, and the joint cooperation of all citizens in the city for the effect to be promising. However, the fundamental solution is still for the authorities to step up efforts to broaden the city's rice supply, strictly crack down on those who obstruct transportation and hoard goods for speculation, so as to facilitate freight transportation, and for citizens to jointly maintain order so that society is stable and legitimate rice merchants have the possibility of operating their businesses. Otherwise, repeated disputes will only disturb the people and will not help to suppress rice prices at all.

### United Office Established for Subsidized Rice Sales in Putuo District

After the launch, they would go to the Social Bureau to sign a contract. Before the official rationing of subsidized rice, the district office would be responsible for investigating, publicizing, and reporting the three types of impoverished households in the district as the target for rationing. The location of the office is temporarily borrowed from the Wufufu Company on Changshou Road.

### Crowd Arrested for Rice Riot on Lude Garden Road, Venerable Monk Fenggong Houli Granted Bail

We have no rice left at home. How are we supposed to solve lunch?" Then, the crowd rushed forward and opened the doors of the rice store, resulting in the looting of twenty shi of white rice and eight shi of brown rice. The police station, upon receiving the report, went to suppress the riot and arrested He Ayuan, Tang Shenggen, Zhou Zhifang, Guo Linshi, Ma Caiying, Wu Linbao, Kuang Jinsheng, Chen Jintu, Ji Zhenhua, Shao Huangtang, Jiang Jintu, Zhang Cairong, Shi Yuanfu, Wang Wensheng, and fourteen others. The police station sent them to the District Prosecutor's Office at 5:00 PM.

The court ordered that all be temporarily released on bail pending further investigation.

### Commander Xuan Solemnly States That Conspiracies by Traitors Will Be Arrested and Dealt With According to Law

[Central News Agency] Jingbei Commander Xuan Tiewu announced to reporters yesterday afternoon that he has paid great attention to the disturbances that have occurred recently. He has received very reliable reports that since the open members of the Communist Party have withdrawn, many secret operatives remain in Shanghai. They have infiltrated agencies, schools, and factories, attempting to create incidents at any time. The government's tolerance of their stay in Shanghai was intended to show leniency. If they abide by the law and do not incite disturbances or disrupt social order, they will not be interfered with. However, they are now unwilling to abide by the law. Xuan solemnly stated that he has made the necessary considerations on how to deal with these individuals.

Xuan also answered reporters' questions regarding various aspects of public security. He said: He is trying to effectively dissuade and curb the demonstrations and petitions that have occurred in recent days. He will consult with relevant parties in the coming days and will roughly decide that the Education Bureau will be responsible for handling matters related to students, the Social Bureau will be responsible for handling matters related to workers, and the public security agencies will provide assistance. If there are traitors instigating and conspiring to expand the disturbances, they will be arrested and dealt with according to law.

He has made great contributions to the national culture. Today, the news media still relies on President Yu's continued leadership to strive towards a free and bright new China. Feng Youzhen then requested President Yu to give instructions on behalf of the banquet attendees. Qian stood up and spoke, saying that although he has only been actively engaged in the news industry for five or six years, he has been actively committed to the struggle for freedom of the press for 40 years. He continued, stating that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wrote two papers, one advocating that the "Indochina Peninsula" in Southeast Asia be renamed the "Central and Southern Peninsula," which has been approved and adopted by the academic and news circles, and the other advocating that the "Sea of Japan" be renamed the "Pacific Ocean" in order to eliminate Japan's aggressive thinking and ensure permanent peace in Asia. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won and has long been realized, the peace treaty with Japan will soon be convened. I would like to reiterate this proposal here. If you agree, I hope you will promote it more to attract the attention of relevant countries and achieve unanimous adoption. Finally, he said that although he is old, he is confident that he is still healthy and will continue to work with everyone to achieve a free and bright new China as soon as possible. Yu was vigorous and his speech was loud and powerful. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 8:00 PM.

### Fuxing Wheel Runs Aground and Slowly Sinks, All Crew Members Safe, Two-Thirds of Rice Expected to Be Salvaged

[Our Newspaper Report] The Zhongxing Shipping Company's Fuxing Wheel, carrying 6,000 tons of rice (60,000 bags, purchased by the China Trust Bureau) from Bangkok, ran aground at 1:00 AM on the 7th of this month (i.e., late on the 6th) while sailing past the waters off Xiamen, near the site where the Qianhai Min Wheel and the Fubo warship collided with each other, mistaking the channel.

### Ma Shurong and Two Other Suspects Deny Colluding with the Enemy

(1) Ma Shurong, 37 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 616, Hefei Road, is the owner of a funeral supplies store. He is accused of organizing the "Japan-China Timber Association" during the period in January of the 31st year of the Republic, when the enemy forces in Shanghai forcibly requisitioned timber. Ma joined the association as the manager of the Chinese merchant department, traveling between Shanghai and Jiangxi, transporting timber for the enemy. The Jiangxi High Prosecutor's Office transferred the case for investigation. Ma claimed that he went to Jiangxi in the 31st year and returned to Shanghai at the end of the year. From the 32nd year until the victory, he was engaged in the funeral supplies business and is currently a director of the Shanghai Timber Association. He denied joining the "Japan-China Timber Association," stating that the details can be verified with the timber association. (2) Chen Guangquan, 41 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 12, Meifang Lane, Changshu Road, was originally a Huaiyang opera performer playing male roles at the Shanghai Jiang Theater. After the victory, he introduced Miyara Yoshio, a Taiwanese, to the Zhejiang Coastal Defense Command for a position. Miyara disguised himself as a Chinese and spied on our military intelligence. After being discovered, he was arrested and executed by our army. Chen is suspected of colluding with the enemy, as reported by Zheng Tingxian. Yesterday, Chen stated that the informant, Zheng Tingxian, was unaware of the situation. Ye Gengsheng had a feud with him, stole Zheng's seal, and falsely accused him. He requested that Zheng Tingxian be summoned for questioning at the next hearing. (3) Li Jianci, the former chief of the General Affairs Section of the puppet Changshu County Government, is accused of serving as an interpreter for the enemy and leading enemy troops to burn houses in Xitan.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Wang Fuyuan from Dongtai, currently residing at No. 4, Lane 17, Hongyuan Road, Wusong Town, has a daughter named Lan Xiaozi, 23 years old. In the 32nd year of the Republic, he recruited Zhao as a live-in son-in-law through a matchmaker in his hometown. After the marriage, the family lived together, making a living by fishing. In July of last year, due to the unstable situation, they moved to Wusong. Before long, rumors about Lan Xiaozi's immoral behavior spread, making the husband angry but unable to speak out.

### Secret Revealed in Court—Paying Someone to Take the Blame
### Fraudster's Cunning Plan Fails

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Kong Xiangsen, Bian Aliu, Gao Jian Gui, and Wu Zhaoqing were previously detained for falsely using the name of the Shanghai Relief Association and forging membership forms to swindle unemployed workers out of membership fees. The prosecutor indicted them on charges of fraud. Yesterday, during the hearing at the District Court, Judge Xie Zhiying had just finished questioning Kong Xiangsen when the second defendant suddenly presented a large bundle of legal tender, telling the court, "Kong Xiangsen just gave me money, telling me to take the fall alone. I am truly innocent, and I dare not accept the money." Judge Xie was surprised and turned to question Kong. Kong denied giving the money, saying, "I am in prison, where would I get money?" Judge Xie ordered Kong to look for his family in the audience. Kong's father, Kong Bingkun, stood up, and Judge Xie immediately summoned him, advising him to tell the truth to avoid punishment. Kong Bingkun then confessed that he gave his son 220,000 legal tender when his son got off the prison van. Judge Xie ordered the bailiff to count the money, and the amount matched perfectly. The court then questioned Kong Xiangsen again. At this point, Kong could no longer deny it and silently acknowledged the truth. However, he said that the gift of money was voluntary. The court then stated that since the gift of money was voluntary, the legal tender should belong to Bian Aliu, and scolded Kong, saying, "How can you buy a lawsuit with money? If you do not repent, you will be severely punished." The fraud case was therefore delayed and rescheduled for the 16th.

Ren Yu Lost to the Expeditionary Team Today, Will Play the American Military Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In the second game of the Shanghai Ren Yu basketball team in Nanjing, they faced the Expeditionary Team of the Luoyang Expeditionary Army. The Shanghai team suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 12 to 25 due to their unfamiliarity with outdoor games, and star player Wang Huaiting was also injured. The two teams had previously met in Shanghai last year, at which time Ren Yu was victorious. Today, they met again, and the competition was even more intense, with the scores being very close. The score in the first quarter was 1 to 3, which shows how fierce the competition was. At halftime, it was 9 to 4. In the second half, the Expeditionary Team led all the way. Xu Zhongyi and Yao Wenyi performed the most outstandingly for the entire Ren Yu team, but unfortunately, their luck was not good, and many of their shots missed the mark. Otherwise, they would not have lost by so much. The final result was 25 to 12. The team will meet with the American military on the 10th.

### Chinese Stocks Continue to Plummet: Yong Yarn's Black Market Price Drops to Around 4,900

Yesterday, the atmosphere surrounding Chinese stocks was heavy with terror, and rumors of loans were even stronger. There were also reports of production loans being withdrawn. The Hong Kong exchange rate further fueled the situation. Across the board, except for one or two types, eight or nine out of ten stocks fell to their limit again.

The market opened with lingering trepidation. China Silk and American Asia immediately fell to their limit. After Yong Yarn opened, there were few buyers, and the price plummeted from 5,600 yuan to within 5,400 yuan before any transactions occurred. It was then sold down to 6,250 yuan. Yong Yarn has now fallen to its limit. However, there was some buying on the low, which allowed it to rise to over 5,500 yuan. At the same time, New Asia also fell to its limit, and there were many who sold at higher prices. However, the general sentiment was that there would be changes to the listed prices, so it rose again to 5,670 yuan. Numbers 94, 52, 145, 179, and 36 were heavily sold. Cement and Yong Yarn fell to their limit again. Near noon, it recovered to 5,300 yuan. Numbers 141, 202, and 14 continued to buy on the low, and the market closed relatively stable at noon.

Numbers 163, 180, 224, 159, and 24 were sold again. Near the close, Yong Yarn was forced down again to around 5,100 yuan before the market ended.

In the off-market trading, Dasheng and Factory 13 were stable, while the rest declined slightly, ranging from a slight decrease to a drop of more than 10%.

Foreign Stocks Continue to Fall

Foreign stocks continued to decline yesterday. Securities firms and money exchange businesses all liquidated their positions. Although the northern and Guangdong trading groups bought, it was to no avail. Banking businesses showed some favor towards shipping, British Union, Yisha, and rubber stocks. It is reported that the rubber stocks issued by Xiangmao Foreign Firm can now be transferred. Yisha gradually declined from 760,000 yuan in the early morning. In the afternoon, due to the rise of the Shanghai Electric Report, it became even more unsustainable. Yisha retreated to 555,000 yuan, British Union to 930,000 yuan, Jardine Matheson to 210,000 yuan, Telephone to 44,000 yuan, Yeguang to 33,000 yuan, Paper to 16,000 yuan, Yibei to 210,000 yuan, Shipping to 135,000 yuan, Steel to 21,000 yuan, Kaiping to 74,000 yuan, and Kenji to 22,000 yuan.

Unified Bonds Decline

Government bonds also declined from high levels yesterday. There was widespread speculation that pre-war deposits would be repaid at more than 500 times their original value. Unified Class C rose to 18,000 yuan at the start, gradually declining from 18,000 yuan. Because public and private debts should not be mixed together, both Room 360 and Room 513 sold, falling to 13,400 yuan before leveling off. As a result, compared to the previous close, Classes A, B, C, and D each fell by 3,800, and Unified Class E fell by 3,100. The transaction volume was approximately 6.7 million.

Drawing Lots for Four Types of Government Bonds

The Ministry of Finance and Economy has scheduled a lottery drawing for the redemption of the 25th Year Unified Government Bonds (Class D), the 28th Year Military Expenditure Bonds (First Series), the 30th Year Military Expenditure Bonds (Second Series), and the 32nd Year Allied Victory Bonds at 9:00 AM today at the Central Trust Bureau, 4th Floor, 74 Renji Road, Shanghai. The ministry has already sent letters to relevant agencies, requesting them to send personnel to the site to monitor and execute the lottery drawing.

### The Rice Scramble Has Not Yet Subsided: All Rice Shops in the City Remain Closed; Mayor Wu Urges Rice Merchants to Resume Trading Promptly

[Our Dispatch] The rice problem is extremely serious. Due to the rampant rice scramble in recent days, most merchants dare not trade. Yesterday, all rice shops in the city unanimously suspended business. In response, the Mayor issued a special order stating: The sale of rationed rice at each rice shop has been ordered to be properly protected by the police. If selling rationed rice at the shop is inconvenient, they can negotiate with the police bureau and district offices to borrow locations for joint distribution. All rice shops in the city must resume business as usual, and those involved in rice grabbing will be severely punished. If rice merchants have any opinions, they can be relayed through the Rice Shop Industry Association. After the Mayor's order, each rice merchant, in light of the rice-grabbing incidents that occurred yesterday, felt that their lives and property could not be guaranteed, so they still did not comply with the order to resume business.

Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Mayor Wu summoned Qu Zhenhua, the chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, at the municipal government, urging him to prioritize the maintenance of public food supply and persuade all rice merchants to operate with peace of mind. Qu conveyed the opinions of most rice merchants, requesting that the example of Chengdu and Wuxi, where rice grabbers were executed without mercy, be followed and that those involved in rice grabbing in this city be severely punished. Mayor Wu promised to detain and prosecute them. Representatives of the rice merchants also reported that the rice grabbing at Wanxing Xiji Rice Shop in Yangshupu on the afternoon of the 5th was led and initiated by Cao Hongyun, the Baozhang of the 15th Bao in the 20th District, requesting that he be severely punished. Upon hearing this, the Mayor immediately ordered Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of Civil Affairs, to investigate thoroughly.

Request to Receive Rice First and Pay After Selling Out

Rice merchants stated regarding the sale of rationed rice that most of them are currently short of funds, requesting permission to receive rice first and pay after selling it out, adding that this was also the case during the enemy-puppet period. Mayor Wu did not express any opinion on this point but promised to consider it.

According to a responsible person in the rice industry, Huang Wan, in a conversation with a reporter last night: The emotions of the rice merchants are extremely high and difficult to control. Because they feel that their lives and property are not guaranteed, many dare not open their doors for business. Currently, they urgently hope that Speaker Shen can find a way to resolve this rice rush problem.

Yesterday, trading in the northern market was completely halted, while there was slightly more activity in the southern market. The total arrival of goods was 463 shi. As usual, the Social Affairs Bureau sold 9,000 bags in the southern market. Initially, each rice merchant dared not accept the rationed amount. Later, after Mayor Wu summoned representatives of the rice merchants and promised to dispatch police to protect the sale of rationed rice at the shops, each rice merchant began to accept the rationed amount. The asking price in the market for high-quality white japonica rice was 295,000 yuan, and for medium-quality, 285,000 yuan. For high-quality thin japonica rice, it was 292,000 yuan, and for medium-quality, 284,000 yuan. For medium-quality early indica rice, it was 280,000 yuan. For medium-quality ordinary indica rice, it was 255,000 yuan. For medium-quality white glutinous rice, it was 290,000 yuan.

### Central Bank Requests Investigation and Prohibition of Speculative Exchange Arbitrage in Shanghai

Reports indicate that Hankou merchants are engaged in speculative exchange arbitrage in Shanghai, bringing large denominations of banknotes from Hankou to Guangzhou. By paying only 7.8 million yuan, they can pay 10 million yuan in Shanghai. The Central Bank attaches great importance to this matter and has sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a thorough investigation and prohibition. The bank has strictly reviewed all commercial banks' remittance applications and only approves those with legitimate uses.

### The Textile Control Committee Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Two Important Cases; The Production Cost Issue is Still Under Negotiation

[Our Dispatch] The 32nd regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held at the municipal government yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Vice-Chairman Wu, Vice-Chairman Li, Committee Members Wu Zhujing, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Yang Xiren, and Liu Wenteng, the Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, attended. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

Two important motions were discussed: (1) The Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District proposed two methods for calculating the cost of 20-count standard yarn: (A) Based on a cost of 1.8 million yuan per dan of raw cotton, excluding profit and unified tax, the cost per piece of yarn would be 8.6 million yuan. (B) Based on an average calculation of 1.8 million yuan per dan of raw cotton and 750,000 yuan per dan of cotton from the United Logistics Administration, excluding profit and unified tax, the cost per piece of yarn would be 6.6 million yuan. After discussion, it was generally believed that when Vice-Chairman Wu proposed a price of 5.5 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn at the last National Price Commission meeting, the authorities still considered it too high. Therefore, the proposed cost prices are unlikely to be approved by the authorities. However, the government's current negotiated price of 4.6 million yuan is not enough to cover costs. It was resolved that Vice-Chairman Wu would request an adjustment at this week's National Price Commission meeting.

(2) Private yarn factories requested that the government no longer purchase cotton yarn produced from cotton stockpiled at the end of last December, for two reasons: (A) Although cotton was cheap at the end of last year, the value of the legal currency was quite high at that time, which cannot be compared with the present. (B) Based on the current purchase price of 4.6 million yuan, it is not enough to cover the reproduction costs of the yarn factories. After discussion, it was resolved to wait for Vice-Chairman Wu to negotiate with the authorities before a decision is made.

[Another Report] The association is handling the registration of firms applying to transport yarn and cloth to various ports in North China and Hebei Province. So far, more than 500 firms have gone to collect registration forms. The association has scheduled the deadline for firms in this city to apply for registration to be the 12th of this month.

### Listing Four Reasons to Request Higher Prices

The China Textile Construction Corporation stated that the difference between the cotton yarn allocation price and the black market price is too large, resulting in huge losses for the company. It recently listed four major reasons, requesting the Ministry of Economy to increase the allocated yarn price. The reasons listed are as follows:

(1) In the past, the prices of yarn and cloth were determined based on the inventory on hand and the market demand, and they were 3% to 10% lower than the market price. There was no black market for yarn and cloth prices, and it was able to play a restraining role. Since the implementation of allocation prices, cotton yarn prices have been rigidly fixed, and the company has complied with government orders and dared not overstep. However, in recent times, yarn prices have soared everywhere. Taking the Shanghai market as an example, the market price is about one-half higher than the allocated price, which is a huge difference. Each time the company opens yarn for sale, it is close to 3,000 pieces. The total difference between the allocated price and the market price reaches as much as 60 to 70 billion yuan. This price suppression and sale have not actually benefited the common people but have only enriched merchants, causing the national treasury to suffer significant losses, leading to rampant black markets and failing to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices. (2) The more profit merchants earn, the more abundant floating capital becomes, and the more prices soar. The power to hoard and speculate also becomes thicker. (3) Manufacturers should sell cotton yarn at the negotiated price, but in reality, they mostly sell it on the black market and record it at the negotiated price, which reduces the government's tax revenue invisibly. (4) The current price of cotton, using 20-count raw materials as an example, has reached 1.2 million yuan per dan. The income from the company's allocated yarn price is not even enough to cover the cost of raw cotton. Other public taxes and expenses cannot be paid at all. Each time the company sells cotton yarn at allocated prices, assuming a difference of 60 billion yuan, and sells cotton cloth at allocated prices, assuming a difference of 20 billion yuan, the total difference per month is more than 130 billion yuan, and the total amount for the year will be about 1.5 trillion yuan. This is only for Shanghai, and Qingdao and the Northeast are not included. The company's surplus to be paid to the national treasury this year is budgeted at 400 billion yuan, but it is deeply feared that not only will there be no surplus to be paid to the treasury, but the company will also have to request the national treasury to subsidize it.

After receiving the report, the Ministry of Economy has telegraphed the Textile Industry Management Committee to quickly negotiate yarn prices based on the supply prices of cotton from the United Logistics Administration and has telegraphed the company to strictly abide by national policies and not pursue black market profits before the new negotiated prices for cotton yarn are determined. The Ministry of Economy has specially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government to strictly prohibit the black market in the city to stabilize the market. The municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to comply.

### Man-Made Silk Asking Prices Continue to Decline

The man-made silk market opened weak yesterday. Number 120, Kosan Yuki, initially asked for 17.2 million yuan, while the lowest asking price in the middle was 7 million yuan. Later, because some real sales customers came to absorb it, it rose back to between 7.3 million and 7.4 million yuan, hovering around. It closed at 3 million yuan at noon, with four or five boxes transacted. Asking prices did not move in the afternoon. As a result, it fell by 700,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Number 75, semi-gloss, is extremely scarce on the market, so yesterday's asking price remained unchanged.

Factory operations have been affected by tight money, and inter-company transactions are extremely rare. Even silk factories rarely purchase. Yesterday's asking prices for all grades were 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than the previous day.

Silk goods also declined along with raw materials, with quilt covers falling by 300,000 yuan and lacking transactions. The large-scale Gezi Bi, because of disputes in the market the previous day, temporarily suspended trading in the market starting yesterday. Off-market transactions were 30,000 yuan to another 500 yuan, 1,500 yuan less than the previous day. Because of the quiet trading, the remaining asking prices generally did not change much.

### Taiwan Sugar Resumes Distribution of the 14th Phase

The distribution of co-operative sugar, which had been suspended for some time, was resumed yesterday by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation in accordance with the regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, with the distribution of the 14th phase. The allocation price is calculated according to the newly adjusted prices: 350,000 yuan per market dan for Grade A granulated white sugar and 330,000 yuan per market dan for Grade B fine white sugar. The application target is mainly sugar merchants. It is reported that approximately 170,000 bags have been applied for this time. The company believes that this is inconsistent with past facts. To prevent hoarding, special regulations have been set in advance for the allocation method as follows:

(1) The allocation standard is based on the total quantity approved for purchase for each customer from the first to the thirteenth phases of this year, plus the quantity applied for in this phase (the fourteenth phase), and allocating one-fourteenth.

(2) The maximum amount applied for in this phase is limited to 500 bags of each type, half Grade A granulated sugar and half Grade B fine sugar. If it exceeds this limit, it will still be calculated as 500 bags.

(3) The minimum allocation is 15 bags of Grade A granulated sugar. The actual number of allocated units is 347 households, of which 259 households are sugar companies, and the rest are biscuit, candy, canned food, soda, and cooperative companies. The actual allocated amount is 36,000 bags, half Grade A granulated sugar and half Grade B fine sugar. Grade A granulated sugar (gunny bag) is calculated at 180 catties, and Grade B fine sugar (straw bag) is calculated at 120 catties. It is understood that each household has already received the purchase order yesterday, will pay at the Bank of China today, and will receive the warehouse receipt next Monday, with delivery the following day.

### Speaker Pan Urges Shanghai Citizens to Actively Subscribe to US Dollar Bonds

Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, broadcasted on the New Shanghai Radio Station at 6:00 PM on the 8th to encourage citizens to actively subscribe to US dollar bonds. The main points were: The current economic problems must be treated both symptomatically and fundamentally. Everyone should remain calm, not compete for purchases, and not hoard. This is a symptomatic treatment. As for the fundamental treatment, it is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, both for individuals and for the country. At present, the government authorities are working hard to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. Issuing US dollar bonds is also one of the methods. If all the citizens of Shanghai do their part, the results will be impressive. Mr. Pan also said that he is one of the members of the Bond Fund Supervisory Committee, and all the members of the committee are determined to devote all their energy to safeguarding creditworthiness and will never disappoint the purchasers. Finally, Mr. Pan pointed out that buying US dollar bonds is an expression of supporting the government's financial policies, which is sufficient to prevent inflation. In the future, banknotes will no longer be issued in increased amounts, prices will naturally stabilize, and the phenomenon of economic panic will naturally disappear.

Solicitation Committee Organizes Essay Contest for Universities and Secondary Schools

In order to encourage all Shanghai citizens to actively subscribe to bonds, the US Dollar Bond Solicitation Committee has organized an essay contest for university and secondary school students in this city. The university group's topic is "The Relationship Between the Issuance of US Dollar Bonds and the National Economy and People's Livelihood," and the secondary school group's topic is "Why Should We Buy US Dollar Bonds?" The deadline for submissions is June 15th, and the winners will be announced on July 1st. Seven winners will be selected in each group, with prizes ranging from 1 million yuan to 200,000 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### Selected Poems and Writings of Mr. Yu Youren

Poetry: On the Road to Beibei on My Birthday (1940)

Who knew my temples would gradually frost? On this long journey, I am busy and forgetful; my body is not renowned in this new era, and my heart, like an orphan, longs for its old home. Timely thunder and rain gladden all things, mountains and rivers devote their strength, and all trades are busy; frequently turning back from the Diamond Heights, how many heroes are on the battlefield.

Three Poems on Encountering Rain at Beibei Hot Springs on My Birthday

The past startles the heart, nineteen years ago; the folk tales still circulate; when Old Ruan was defeated and came west, one bath in this desolate pool shook two provinces.

The old inscriptions by the cliff of the North Spring, the green waters and green hills, and the White Bird Pavilion; I am even more delighted by the extraordinary omen today, the gentle breeze, sweet rain, and the Star of Old Age.

Let us wish that the literati's heritage will flourish for generations to come, and that even the family feasts for three generations will be commonplace; thinking of the matters before the Hall of Inquiries. Half learning from King Wen and half from King Wu.

My Heart's Appointment on My Birthday: Visiting the Nursing Home at South Tongluo Gorge (1941)

Recognizing the road along the river, watching the nursing home when the oak leaves are lush.

Birthday (1945)

The wish to cultivate and graze the rivers and mountains remains unfulfilled; crossing the river in exile, I make do with these passing years; this year I happen to encounter Labor Day, and the orphaned son of gunfire is already white-haired.

On the day of my birth, I temporarily cast aside all worries, the great legacy of Sun Yat-sen is diminished in Ryukyu; the mountain alliance rises in the cause of all humanity, not just singing praises for Asia.

Old House in Doukou Alley (1938)

The withered locust tree behind the hall puts forth flowers again, the wind is calm in front of the hall, and the shade of the trees is slanted; the three old houses are still as they were, ashamed to face the displaced and speak of destroyed homes.

Doukou Farm (1941)

Ten thousand trees tower into the sky, poplars rising like arrows, Jade Screen flies emerald, yielding to the farm; I vow to live out my life by the tomb, knowing there is no return, and with white hair, I reluctantly leave my old home.

Poems from a Journey to Wenchuan (Seven Poems)

The diligence of the sages of the past has not vanished, and beautiful tales are passed down through the distant waters; I once gazed from before the Jade Barrier Pass, the Father and Son Canal and the Husband and Wife Bridge.

Halfway up Mount Min, whiteness extends horizontally, clouds above the green mountains, trees in several layers; how many mountain people gaze and dance, plowing with the rain amidst the clouds.

Sand still flies before Stone Button Mountain, and the millet is just beginning to ripen on Kuerping; where can the vast traces be found? Treading the desolate mountains, my clothes are wet with sweat.

Only two households of Qiang people remain on the ping, and there are crumbling walls in the high places before the ping; the elders in the ping speak of the divine Yu, who cut off the dragon and descended into the wilderness.

Bitter to travel this line on Mount Min, remnants of the market are damp, and I startle frequently in my sleep; knowing how difficult it is for the people to obtain grain, I worry all night hearing the sound of guarding against trouble.

Generations are loyal and upright, and encourage each other, talents are born naturally and without selfishness; Yingying can inherit the family business, the nine-year-old boy before Mount Yu.

The bright virtue of King Yu hangs suspended from ancient to modern times, never calculating Wenchuan and Beichuan; the four seas overflow and are plunged into darkness, when will the land be leveled again?

Historical Accounts of Dunhuang (Eight Poems)

The weary old man speaks of this journey, a heavy steel city in the western frontier; even more so for the sake of the cultural relics of a thousand years, the calligrapher's home and the stone cave sutras.

Halting my horse on the sand mountain, I shed a tear, can I still wield a spear as in the past? The crescent moon above Crescent Spring is now a missing moon, particularly round for the sorrowful man.

The cultural relics of Dunhuang are scattered across the globe, collected with both rarity and exquisiteness; together, we brush off the remnants, together we read and appreciate, under the Mogao Grottoes, we celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.

Gazing at the traces of fatigue and the remaining ruins, seeing the scripts of Xixia among the discarded texts; do not laugh at me for stamping in the sand, only now in my old age do I see a glimmer of hope.

Three hundred and eighty caves of wall paintings, from the Northern Song, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties; an immeasurable ocean of national art, I wish to carry you back to the Central Plains.

Mr. Stein and Mr. Pelliot left long ago, the Eastern and Western Grottoes are also lamentable! The study of Dunhuang is already famous throughout the world, dying in service, sitting in seclusion, unaware of the passing years.

The melons are beautiful and fragrant in the tenth month, may I continue this pleasant journey for another ten years; the rock halls and wall palaces are undamaged, with my own hands, I sift through the cold ashes and examine the discarded texts.

Historical Accounts of Wanfo Gorge (Four Poems)

Raging water and wild winds interact, high cliffs become exceptionally clear at night; marking the grottoes under Mount Sanwei, writing of my journey visiting the paintings in a high carriage.

Traces of Sui ink, paintings of the Tang people, layer upon layer of Song smearing with no coverings; not understanding what the high monks say, only the Taoist priests remain guarding the flickering lamps.

Layer upon layer of Buddha paintings, mostly intact, various anecdotes unbearable to hear; two Taoist priests died within five steps, and a building of scriptures was destroyed ten years ago.

Red willows sparsely reflecting the setting sun, the leaves of the phoenix tree are yellow in old age; the water enhances the beautiful colors like a picture, the mountain is like the old and wise elder.

Historical Accounts of Qingcheng (Four Poems)

The red of the nanmu leaves extends from spring to summer, the sacred lamps illuminate the night, with both rain and clear skies; the famous mountain bears flowers, its name known for a long time, not seeing flowers, I drunkenly enjoy peace.

The emerald waves lean eastward, joining the vast expanse, how can I forget the worries before my eyes; Kongtong's cries break the island's silence, a night of anxiety like a battlefield.

I have not returned to the west in a hundred years, only the Mountain of the Medicine King remains; the foolish children offer sacrifices before the mountain, forgetting that the true man dwells here.

Ten thousand carriages go before Mount Damian, there is no way to seek the traces of immortals in the west; today, I bow before the shrine of the Yellow Emperor, only then do I recognize that Ning Feng could fly.

Miscellaneous Poems of Tianshan

Snow is like a mountain garment, going like a mountain crown; clean and repeatedly clean, allowing you to look at every side.

Crossing Tianshan, going, crossing Tianshan, returning; where is Yaochi? White clouds come and go, flying.

Reading "You Feng" Poetry at Night (1944)

The days of loss and choice are not yet in sight, why cook mallows and peel dates? The hardworking father and son diligently manage the household, and the shivering farmers pray for a good year. Even with thatched huts in the southern fields, they are still fearful, and the rain in the eastern mountains comes slowly. Without clothes or hemp, I think all day, diligently studying the people of Zhou to save them from chaos.

Sleepless Night at the Ling Mountain Taoist Temple Above Tianchi on the Twelfth Night of August in the Thirty-fifth Year

Flying back and forth across Tianshan, today I truly recognize the face of heaven; waterfalls in the clouds, snow in the ice age, Yaochi under the moon, mountains after the rain. Traveling far, I know the value of a fine steed, climbing high, I do not care about the white hair on my temples; the night is deep, and my feelings are indescribable, ten thousand trees weep and wail, there are sick fir trees.

Lyrics: Lang Tao Sha - Yellow Crane Tower (Written Before the Founding of the Republic)

The ambition to serve the country is difficult to fulfill, the kindness and grudges are vivid; forcing myself to suppress my feelings, I ascend the tower, the Yellow Crane should return and shed tears, tears filling the isles. Leaning against the great river in autumn, poetry and wine exhaust my sorrows, ancient and modern exiled officials and lyricists, may I ask who can ascend the summit? Crying bitterly for the divine land!

Three Songs of Zhe Gu Tian (Written in 1937)

Ten thousand miles of Yunnan jade have not returned, the cultural relics of my home have also turned to ash, the book owner should not mourn Longpan Village, fighting to bring back the gold seal stained with blood. Three-foot sword, a military uniform, I have seen the garden tomb five times; delaying the day of recovering the capital with troops, the people mournfully weep at the temple.

Ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains stained with blood, and after years the barbarian filth has not been cleared; with difficulty, the imperial ancestors opened the heavenly office, and with hardship, Yuan Gong broke his axe. Striving for independence, and to survive, letting you and I succeed in benevolence; for tens of millions of fine sons and daughters, how can we repay your kindness to the motherland!

Endless sincerity connects all directions, the great marshal holds the sharp sword and guards extraordinarily; the wind goes and makes saints strive to see, the thunder and rain are timely, and the night is not over. The sky rotates directly, the earth's secrets are hidden, the great wind blows across the Pacific Ocean; the goddess of freedom descends gracefully, recognizing her old home in a world stained with blood.

Jin Lü Qu - A Person from Home Describes the Beauty of Our Mountains and Rivers and Encourages Me to Return, I Write This in Response (1938)

Everything starts from scratch, count old Ruan, in his life on the lakes and seas, how many old friends remain? How many of Bao, E, Ying, Liu, and Han Zhi's friends have died in service! Today, the gate of the wind and clouds is still reliable? People say our mountains and rivers are truly magnificent, but these magnificent mountains and rivers require effort to manage; south and north, moreover, there are many ramparts. The great battle of the universe is unparalleled, ashamed am I, living under Mount Emei, in the same village as Wei Gong; not becoming a famous Confucian or a famous general, I ponder in old age; I suppose the world knows why I do this, hearing that three million have died, I am even more willing to let their blood stain the history of opening the sky; seeking peace and freedom for the country.

Su Zhong Qing - September 18th of the Thirtieth Year, Flying from Chongqing to Lanzhou with Geng You

Clouds open and reveal the plains below, today is the best day; flying over the Mountaintop Ridge, the poem is not yet finished, so I use lyrics to convey it. The lyrics are inexhaustible, writing about space, leaking into the world; the rivers and mountains are magnificent, there is no way to describe them, stroking the blue skies.

An Xiang - A Soldier at the Foot of Savage Mountain (1944)

At the foot of Savage Mountain, there are soldiers shouldering spears, their songs are adjacent; white bones in the setting sun, the abandoned ramparts, quiet and beautiful flowers bloom and wither on their own; on duty here today, I am reluctant to leave, my lonely feelings are difficult to write. I only hope to wash the rivers and passes with blood, illuminating the woods; the stars and moon are like a painting, how many times I have shed tears; thinking of the years of exile in the cold season, looking forward to the bright road, worrying about the people overlapping, heaven should be surprised, wondering when it will bestow blessings again, white clouds in the wilderness.

Huan Xi Sha - Small Garden

The clouds on the top of Gele Mountain are half-covered, the sun on Eagle Cliff is about to set; from afar, whose zither music rises? The small garden is still enchanting to the swallows, but I pity the spring rain freezing the paulownia flowers; the noble son is again at the edge of the green grass.

Self-made new lyrics, but not skillful, the clear sounds of mountains and rivers are unlike anything in the past; pondering the past even more sadly. The Yangtze River acts as a blue ribbon coiled left and right, connecting with the Jade Barrier, arching west and east, I wonder how many times the returning boat will catch the wind?

Man Jiang Hong - Level Rhyme

Unable to sleep at four o'clock on December 9th, using Bai Shi's tune to write the heart of Wu Mu, I completed this lyric.

Countless heroes rise in response to the times, vying to go to the battlefield; startling is holding a spear without self, with the motherland as the destruction; flying past the towering Himalayas, fighting back to the homeland from the Nu River front; seeing freedom flowers blooming everywhere before the horses, heaven scatters fragrance. New era, new national defense, new China, longevity without limit, putting the deep pain of a hundred years into the Pacific Ocean; world peace has a responsibility, the construction of China is even more appropriate; waiting a short time to report to the temple at Zijin Mountain, praying for a constitution.

Bai Zi Ling - Inscription on Standard Cursive Script

Cursive script literature is a tool for the self-strengthening of the Chinese nation; since the oracle bone inscriptions, seal script and clerical script have been added, each with its hanging needles and drooping dew, the Han bamboo slips flowed less, the Tang sutra stone caves, countless evolutions; the chapter script, the present script, and the wild script are deeply buried, who cares about them for a long time! May I ask the people of the world, who cherish every moment, what is the hurry? With the same time and the same hands, whose efficiency reaches the highest? The symbols are magical, the old man discovers them, and the secret is to pass them on, respectfully inviting comrades to open up the road for academics.

Huan Xi Sha - Written on the Plane Going West to Hami (1946)

I and Tianshan share white hair, reflecting each other, we are also dashing; I envy the snow water irrigating the fields. The winds, rains, worries, and sorrows have become the past, the mountains and rivers are haggard after many autumns; going in the evening, I gather in all the fragrant islands.

Tune

Inscription on the Comprehensive History of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1938)

[Duplet: Dian Qian Huan] Noisy crows, the Central Plains is full of Ming trumpets, peering at the barbarian horses along the rivers, do not sigh! See the divine land release exotic flowers, winning the battle in one fell swoop, I picture the bloody history, calling out even louder, Long live China, long live China!

Hearing that Japan is About to Surrender, Creating the Chinese Music Bureau (Ten Songs)

[Duplet: Zui Gao Ge] Ten thousand families light firecrackers at night, the light of auspiciousness dawns on humanity; let us try to open our hearts, in the mirror the old man is gradually aging.

Two

[Previous Tune] Bury the golden light mountain, place it in the heart of the Yalu River by the moon; the moon in Lugou is dark, the Great Wall is broken, the barbarian horses neigh in the wind for several years.

[Previous Tune] In those years, the fires of war flowed, who came to deliver water when they were thirsty; the fisherman casts his net, the woodcutter sleeps, all are scarlet ramparts for the military to leave.

Five

[Previous Tune] Who plays the sorrowful song of the Czech, who indulges in the lazy war flames of Poland; all the concubines are exhausted, Paris is broken, the two-faced soldiers are like the sun.

Six

[Previous Tune] The strait is a small matter of waves, the red field is vast, the moon is cold; death will turn to the mandate of heaven in an instant, the song of tomorrow draws laughter.

Eight

[Previous Tune] Sincerity is not external, selfishness does not exist, only then does truth have a beginning; meeting angels beneath the surrendered city, the path of the great way is here.

Nine

[Previous Tune] The highlands, the trees fall, the sky is wide, the homeland, the wind is gentle, the sun is warm; the singing stops beneath Dengci Temple, often causing heroes to be filled with tears.

Ten

[Previous Tune] How does freedom grow? The war has just reaped its results; the Chinese nation is vying to celebrate, the royal way, a defense city, is me.

### Portrait of Mr. Yu Youren

### Preface to the Thousand Character Classic in Standard Cursive Script with Corrections

— Yu Youren

In the twenty-first year of the Republic, I established the Standard Cursive Script Society in Shanghai, extensively seeking the legacy of cursive saints from past generations, as well as Han and Jin bamboo slips and stone tablets, engaging in the organization of cursive script. The reasons for its dedication and the ultimate hope are to make the national cultural tool of more than two thousand years simpler, easier, more enjoyable, unified, and more practical. Therefore, the selection of characters is based on being easy to recognize, easy to write, beautiful, and accurate. The materials are also sought from the authors of the Zhang, Jin, and Kuang schools, so that each can make the most of their strengths and have the opportunity for balanced development. For this reason, what can be comforting to the world at this time is that in the selection of materials and characters, we have discovered the ancestral legacy accumulated over generations, a sharp weapon for progress in the new era, so that order can be found in chaos and rebellion. What is regrettable is that the era is distant, so the materials are insufficient, and the carvings are often distorted. The era is near, so the practicality is narrow, and there are few famous works passed down. It is very difficult to create a systematic ordinance! In the past, Xu Shuozhong wrote "Shuowen", and he did not determine the characters throughout his life. Chong began to present the book to Emperor An, showing the difficulty of urgently organizing characters like burning heart. I have been governing this for only ten years, relying on the help of my colleagues, and I have achieved initial success, which is also fortunate!

In the twenty-fifth year, the Hanwen Zhengkai Publishing House printed 500 copies to rush out the book, and the explanations were incomplete. In the twenty-sixth year, the second revised edition was about to be printed, but at the same time that the War of Resistance and construction were advancing, there were things that should be done, and I should rush there. Moreover, writing is the crystallization of human culture, the connection of human life, and also the total driving force of world civilization. It is also important for hundreds of industries and tens of thousands of products, which are closely related to the survival and life of the country and the nation. The construction of a new country is even more dependent on the progress of writing to promote it and speed up its success. The strong countries of Europe and America have made scientific progress, and their writing is also simple. Printing uses regular script, and writing uses chapter script, and those who learn it all know its convenience. Our country's writing is difficult, and if we want to stand on our own in the fiercely competitive world, the result must change, or it will all fall behind. From the perspective of time, Dayu cherished every moment, and Tao Kan cherished every minute, "Time, time," is what the sages valued so much! Now we know that what we should cherish and fight for today, calculated in minutes and inches, has been miscalculated! Therefore, the foundation of the country and nation for tens of thousands of generations should start from one point, one stroke, one flicker, and one second; the strength or weakness, success or failure of people and countries is determined by the length and amount of time they have gained. Although writing reform is a matter of saving time, it is a small matter, but with its wide use, it adds up to the infinite days and months of our entire nation in the future! For several years, I have not dared to slacken, and after two consultations, I have re-edited it. In the twenty-seventh year, I handed it over to the China Printing Bureau to print 300 copies, and in the twenty-ninth year, I printed 500 copies. I planned to sell them after a review, but in the meantime, only a few copies were distributed to friends, and the rest were stranded in Hong Kong, and could not be transported back. This made those who care about cultural undertakings and know that I have devoted myself to this wait endlessly, and I am deeply uneasy.

In recent years, the national construction has been advancing by leaps and bounds, but the work of writing reform that we are responsible for cannot catch up. How regrettable! This spring, my colleagues in the club gradually gathered, and I re-selected and reviewed it once. The book is divided into two volumes, the upper volume is the Thousand Character Classic of Cursive Saints, the characters are all selected from the cursive saints of ancient dynasties, carefully making the shapes, and listing the sources; the lower volume is the Explanations of the Standard Cursive Script, which summarizes the changes in cursive script from ancient to modern times, and explains them with examples. The standard symbols are made into tables, marked "Sheng Qian", "Shi Li", mutually annotating each other. The former provides the essence of cursive writing, and the latter clarifies the secrets of calligraphy history that are not passed down.

I am deeply afraid that the principles will be correct but the use will be wrong, or that the words that the ancients created occasionally will be forced on later generations who are difficult to learn. During the selection and review, I often use pens and paper to test whether they are in line. Comrade Liu Yantao has accumulated what he has written before and after, selected and hooked them into a book, and also requested that they be printed together with the Standard Cursive Script, as a reference for those who learn the Thousand Character Classic of Cursive Saints, and to increase the interest of calligraphy learners! He has worked diligently, and his contributions to me are the most. It is extremely important that my colleagues are thinking of publicizing cursive script and liberating writing, and they are doing everything they can. In the past, a certain master practiced the cursive script of a former sage, and he did not achieve success all day long, and said with joy: "The truth is also in front of me, making people discouraged!" I feel the same way now when I write this! Fortunately, the Standard Cursive Script can be printed and completed, and the principles of symbol organization and the changes in the rules are explained in detail in a list. Today's scholars will surely be encouraged and work hard, and there will be even more amazing inventions. July in the thirty-first year, Yu Youren wrote in the mountain cave.

Wishing Mr. Yu Youren a Happy Birthday - Zhu Jingxin

Today is the sixty-ninth birthday of Mr. Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan. I remember that when Mr. Yu celebrated his sixty-seventh birthday in Chongqing in the thirty-fourth year, he wrote two poems (already seen in this publication) which can be regarded as his biography. When Mr. Yu was born, the Qing Dynasty was昏庸, the government was corrupt, and there were foreign troubles. Therefore, he had the ambition of耕牧 the rivers and mountains since childhood. In these sixty-nine years, from the revolution to the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance, he has repeatedly fought against the evil forces of violence, writing the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation. Mr. Yu can just represent the Chinese people of the firecrackers, shouting to mankind.

Mr. Yu's ancestral home is Jingyang, Shaanxi, and he lives in Sanyuan, so he was born in Xinzhuang, Sanyuan. His fluttering silver beard is the demeanor of a man from Guanzhong. He lost his mother at the age of three, and was raised by his aunt, Madam Fang. At the age of seven, he entered the school, and at the age of eleven, he studied with Mr. Mao Banxiang in Sanyuan. At the age of fourteen, he entered the county school, at the age of twenty, he supplemented the 　, and at the age of twenty-five, he passed the imperial examination. Mr. Yu was extremely dissatisfied with the corruption of the Qing Dynasty, and once printed "The Half-Crying, Half-Laughing Building Poems" to satirize the current government. The magistrate of Sanyuan County pointed him out as a revolutionary party and reported him to the governor of Shaanxi. The governor then requested to dismiss him as a juren and strictly arrest him. At that time, Mr. Yu was in Bianliang for the Ministry of Rites examination. Mr. Li Yutian, a fellow villager, sent someone to secretly inform him. Mr. Yu then went south in secret to Shanghai and entered Aurora University, studying under Mr. Ma Xiangbo.

In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Aurora University was dissolved due to the interference of foreign teachers. Mr. Yu was ordered by Mr. Ma to establish Fudan Public School in Wusong. At this time, students studying in Japan returned to China due to the ban on the tide, and they also founded China Public School in Paotai Bay. Mr. Yu was also listed as a founder and served as the national language lecturer. Soon, he and his colleagues from the two schools initiated the Shenzhou Daily. After the agreement, Mr. Yu and Mr. Shao Lizi went to Tokyo to raise shares and met with President Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo. It was at this time that he joined the Tongmenghui. Therefore, the publication of Shenzhou Daily was welcomed by the intellectual class for promoting the revolution. In less than a year, Shenzhou Daily suffered a fire, and Mr. Yu resigned and reorganized Yu Lun Daily.

In the beginning, revolutionaries founded newspapers one after another to promote nationalism, and they fell one after another, which was a brilliant era in the history of newspapers. At that time, there were newspapers advocating revolution, which were known as the three people of Jian Tian and the three people of Heng. The so-called three people of Jian were the three newspapers of Min Hu, Min Yu, and Min Li, all of which were founded by Mr. Yu. After Shenzhou Daily was burned, Mr. Yu had already left, but the idea of advocating revolution always lingered in his mind. Not long after serving as the editor of Yu Lun Daily, he founded Chang Hu Daily. In the publication notice, there was a statement for the people, which was noted by the Qing court. After the publication, the advocacy was intense, and it was even more disliked by the Qing officials. He was trapped in prison for the Gansu account incident. Although the prison was later released, the publication of the newspaper was still a condition for his release. Mr. Yu then went to Japan. The following year, he returned to Shanghai and founded Min Li Daily again. At that time, the Qing court's defense against the revolution was more serious, but the editor made progress more quickly than before. On the eve of the Wuchang Uprising, Min Li Daily became the general organ of the revolutionary army. The news of the war was announced by Min Li Daily every day, and everyone wanted to see it first. The printing machine did not stop all night, but there were still people who were unable to obtain it.

In the seventh year of the Republic, the enemy in Guanzhong was in great distress. Mr. Yu responded to the invitation of the generals of the Jingguo Army and went north to preside over the Shaanxi Jingguo Army affairs. Although the number of people was very different and the food and salary were not enough, he was still able to deal with the strong enemy for several years. This was all due to Mr. Yu's sincerity, so they all died without yielding. In particular, in the Jingguo Army District, the promotion of the doctrine, the implementation of education, and the promotion of cultural affairs were able to cooperate with military affairs and promote it, so that the people of the Northwest were able to be nurtured by the spirit of the times and become the pioneers of the revolutionary forces in the North. Until the eleventh year of the Republic, the military situation became increasingly difficult, and Mr. Yu left the army and went east, passing through Wuhan to Shanghai. The Jingguo Army affairs came to an end.

In the fifteenth year of the Republic, Liu Zhenhua led his troops into Shaanxi and surrounded the city of Chang'an. Mr. Yu wanted to help Shaanxi but the road was blocked, so he took the road to Soviet Russia, crossed Mongolia south, and arrived in Shaanxi. At that time, General Tong Kuai Xiang also returned from Soviet Russia. Wan jointly established the National Army Allied Forces and swore an oath in Wuyuan. Mr. Yu then went to Sanyuan and joined the local militias of the 2nd and 3rd armies to relieve the siege of Chang'an. At that time, Chang'an had been besieged for eight or nine months, and tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians had been killed. Mr. Yu, as the commander-in-chief and acting provincial government official, comforted the soldiers and civilians and planned to deploy troops. In less than two months, he wanted to meet the Northern Expedition army in Zhengzhou.

When Mr. Yu first went to Tokyo to meet President Sun Yat-sen, President Sun Yat-sen appointed Mr. Yu as the Grand Governor of the Yangtze River. After the founding of the Republic, President Sun Yat-sen took the position of the first President in Nanjing and appointed Mr. Yu as the Minister of Transportation. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and Mr. Yu served as a Standing Committee Member of the Party, Government, and Military Affairs. The following year, he served as the President of the Audit Yuan. In the twentieth year of the Republic, Mr. Yu took office as the President of the Control Yuan, and has been in office for sixteen years. His reputation for being upright and upright is universally recognized.

Mr. Yu's calligraphy and his silver beard are both famous throughout the country. His characters are like dragons and snakes dancing, and at first glance, they seem extremely easy, but upon closer inspection, every stroke is divine. This is due to his deep skill. Mr. Yu first followed the Northern Wei Dynasty, then studied running script in middle age, and in recent years has focused on Zhangcao. He does not adhere to one school of calligraphy, and he often imitates the famous works of ancient and modern times, one character at a time, one stroke at a time, which has reached a magical state. He often imitates the two characters of Sun Wen, which were personally signed by President Sun Yat-sen, and the character 與 written by the martyr Huang 　. Not only are they powerful, but they are also exquisitely superb. Mr. Yu's calligraphy has reached a magical realm, but he does not cherish ink like gold. Whether it is a comrade, a friend, or even a peddler, even if he has never met him, he will gladly respond. Therefore, Mr. Yu's calligraphy can be seen everywhere on the market. If you go to Lan Yuan, then all the winning plaques and signboards of the organizations, schools, temples, and shops are almost all written by Mr. Yu alone.

Mr. Yu also believes that our country's characters are anti-corrosive, and writing is time-consuming, and simplified characters violate the principles of philology. Therefore, he advocates cursive script, believing that it is convenient for writing, quite beautiful, and in line with the purpose of the ancients in creating characters. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, the Standard Cursive Script Society was founded in Shanghai, collecting cursive script steles and rubbings, and engaging in organization, from divergent to unified, from spiritual to practical. It is truly a "sharp weapon of the new era."

Mr. Yu's achievements and articles do not need to be repeated. Although he has reached the high age of sixty-nine, his spirit is still extremely strong, making young people see him and their emotions become even more excited, making old people see him and relive their youthful feelings, and making the sick and weak see him and encourage their courage to fight. His spirit is stronger than most people.

Respectfully wishing Mr. Yu to be as evergreen as pine and cypress!

Respectfully wishing the Chinese nation infinite longevity!
