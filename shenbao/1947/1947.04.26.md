[Report from the Central News Agency, Shanghai] Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of Transportation, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. He was originally scheduled to fly to Beiping yesterday afternoon with Sa Fujun, Director of the Department of Roads, and Chen Yanjiong, Chairman of the China Changchun Railway, to inspect the transportation situation in the Northeast. However, due to poor weather, the departure was temporarily postponed. When asked by reporters about the general situation of domestic transportation, he stated that the main railways in the country that have returned to normal operation include the Beijing-Shanghai, Guangdong-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou (southern section), Longhai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Beining, and China Changchun Railway (southern section). Among them, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have the most developed business, while the Guangdong-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railways are more difficult. The vehicles used are all old ones from the past, which have been repaired and put into use, unlike the two railway bureaus that have new cars available. The operating situation is also such that only the two railway bureaus have surpluses. As for the rumors that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will be double-tracked, the Ministry of Transportation has not yet considered this issue. Regarding the two derailments that occurred successively on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the Ministry has already ordered the responsible parties of the two railway bureaus to quickly prepare a report and submit it to the Ministry of Transportation for review in order to clarify the issue of responsibility. As for the establishment of railway business offices by the two railway bureaus, Ling believes that it does not conflict much with the business of forwarding agents, but can instead complement each other and promote the smooth flow of freight. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation has given earnest advice to the forwarding agents who petitioned in Nanjing against the establishment of railway business offices by the railway bureaus, hoping that they can coexist peacefully and work together to improve freight operations. Regarding civil aviation, much remains to be done in China to improve it and seek development.

[Report from the United Press, Communist-Nationalist Front Line on the Songhua River, on the 24th] At 0:32 PM on the 24th, in an isolated, dilapidated house on the plain 100 yards north of the Songhua River, the two US Embassy Army Deputy Attachés who had been captured for 55 days were released by the Communist Army. They were Major Rigg (34 years old) and Captain Collins (25 years old). The two were captured on March 1 while visiting the front line 17 miles northeast of Changchun, and have only now been freed. Their health is normal, but they are much thinner than before, with four days of unshaven beards and pale complexions, the result of being imprisoned in Harbin for eight weeks. The first to come forward to welcome them were Mr. Kleiber, the US Consul General in Changchun, and his assistant Gu Wen. Mr. Kleiber and his party walked half a mile with a white flag, through a thicket of bushes devastated by landmines, to reach their destination. At that time, there were still 20 armed communists guarding around Rigg and Collins. Mr. Kroupa stepped forward to greet them, and after a brief formality with the communist members, the group returned to the vicinity of the bridgehead position guarded by the National Army on the north bank, crossed the river by ferry, and met with Mr. Surls, the Army Attaché sent by the Nanjing Embassy. After exchanging pleasantries with the welcoming party, Rigg and Collins boasted about the souvenirs they had obtained during their adventure. Rigg showed a small silver plate, which he bought in Harbin on March 19 while being escorted by the Communist Army. Collins showed a bottle of 30-year-old brandy that he had bought.

### US Embassy Welcoming Party Waits on the Banks of the Songhua River

After being detained, Rigg and Collins were taken to Harbin for detention, where they were treated not badly, with Western meals provided twice a day. Two days later, they were allowed to exercise outdoors. The hardest part of the detention period was being completely isolated from outside news and not having the opportunity to shower or shave. On March 22, the communist authorities notified them that they could be released. On the same day, they were led by communist personnel and departed south, spending two nights on the way. On the third morning, they were escorted by armed guards on horseback or on foot.

The US Embassy Welcoming Party Waits on the Banks of the Songhua River

Rigg and Collins both rode on horseback, dismounted at the red house, and walked to the banks of the Songhua River, where they met the US welcoming party. However, Mr. Surls, the Army Attaché of the US Embassy, Mr. Zulna, the Air Force Attaché, and Captain Jin, the aide-de-camp of Sun Liren, Commander of the New First Army, climbed to a high point on the south bank and watched the drama on the communist side of the river through binoculars. Seeing that the handover was clear, they launched a boat close to the north bank to welcome Rigg and Collins safely across the river. At that time, it was very quiet within 500 yards around, with only thousands of ducks in the river flowing downstream and birds flying against the wind in the sky. They were very disappointed when they arrived on the south bank and did not see any Chinese reporters on the scene. Mr. Surls and his party will stay in Changchun tonight and be hosted by Commander Sun, and will fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning on a C-47 aircraft. Collins' wife is heavily pregnant and is waiting in Nanjing, and her first child is due on May 3.

### Huo Baoshu Reports to the Political Council: Overview of Relief Efforts in the Past Year, This Year's Expenses Require Over One Trillion Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] The Resident Committee of the National Political Council held its 21st meeting at 9 AM on the 25th, inviting Huo Baoshu, Director of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to attend and report on the overview of relief and rehabilitation efforts in the past year. Huo first reported on the organizational overview of UNRRA and CNRRA, then reported on the work of CNRRA in the past year, divided into two parts: relief and rehabilitation, and listed figures to illustrate. It is said that as of now, more than 1.8 million tons of materials from UNRRA have arrived in China, with another 7-800,000 tons to be transported by land. The original plan was to stop the transportation of materials to China by the end of June, but now the purchase date has been extended to the end of May. Approximately in August or September, the materials from the United States can all be transported, while the materials from the United Kingdom and Australia will not be fully transported until next year. Huo then reported on CNRRA's financial situation, stating that CNRRA's finances were very difficult last year, but are better this year. Last year, the government allocated more than 20 billion yuan, but the Sichuan expenses were more than 270 billion yuan, which was made up by borrowing more than 90 billion yuan and selling materials for more than 160 billion yuan. This year, if all work plans are completed, it is estimated that more than one trillion yuan will be needed. However, the government's allocation this year is only 560 billion yuan, and the shortfall can only be offset by selling materials. He also stated that CNRRA is a temporary organization, and all future work is being expedited, with plans to complete it in three phases: March, August, and November. All unfinished and continuously maintained businesses will be transferred to permanent agencies for management. Huo finally reported in detail on the relief and engineering work in the Communist-controlled areas and the Yellow River flooded areas, and answered many questions from Fu Sinian, Xue Mingjian, Zheng Kuiyi, Wu Chunwu, Fan Yusui, Luo Heng, Xi Zhenduo, Yin Shuxian, Qian Gonglai, etc., regarding the sale of relief materials, the distribution of materials, and the relief work in western Yunnan and Shandong, which lasted three hours. The meeting then proceeded to discuss proposals, and passed the proposal submitted by Wang Baoxuan and others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to the refugees in northern Jiangsu. It was resolved to send it to the government for prompt handling. It was also learned that during today's meeting, Yin Shuxian and others suggested amending Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law to add that the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the people of the whole country or to the representative body. After discussion, most political councilors believed that this was unnecessary, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was not passed.

### Chen Yi Cables Urgently: Wei Daoming to Take Up New Post at the Beginning of the Month, Candidates for Various Departments in Taiwan Can Be Announced Next Week

[Our Newspaper News] According to relevant sources: The candidates for the heads of various departments of the Taiwan Provincial Government are expected to be approved at the Executive Yuan's weekly meeting next week. Wei Daoming will go to Taiwan to take up his new post at the beginning of next month. The authorities believe that Taiwan Province has just undergone changes and the people's hearts are uneasy, so they are extremely cautious in selecting the responsible personnel. They have been carefully studying with Minister Bai, who went to Taiwan to inspect, especially the new provincial chairman. Therefore, they are paying more attention to the position of garrison commander, and have not yet made a final decision. Chen Yi decided to leave Taiwan after completing the handover and has sent a cable to the new chairman urging him to go to Taiwan as soon as possible. Regarding Chen's future whereabouts, there are many rumors. According to qualified sources, the position of Director of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters is the most likely, but it can only be decided after Chen arrives in the capital.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th dispatch] Wei Daoming stated to relevant parties on the 25th that because he had never been to Taiwan, he is now reviewing past administrative measures. Therefore, it is still difficult to announce the administrative policy for Taiwan Province for the time being. However, those who are inappropriate in the past measures will be eliminated, and the connection with local people will be strengthened to achieve "cooperation between officials and people." The cultural, economic, legal, and other standards of the people of Taiwan Province are relatively high, and it should not be difficult to achieve the level of a model province. As for the adjustment of personnel, it will be based on talent, not limited to provincial origin. As for the rumors that another deputy director will be set up and filled by local people, it is not true. Wei also expressed his willingness to go to Taiwan as soon as possible. In addition, seven groups of people from Taiwan who are traveling in Nanjing and Shanghai elected seven representatives, including Yang Zhaojia and Zhang Bangjie, to meet with Wei on the afternoon of the 25th and submitted a letter of opinions on governing Taiwan. Wei agreed to consider it and hoped that they would assist in cooperation. It is also heard that Wei will go to Shanghai on the 27th.

### Over a Thousand Japanese Factories Designated for Reparations: Our Claim: Maintain Japan's Industrial Level at the 1930 Level

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th dispatch] The reporter has learned that 1,015 factories have been designated for reparations. According to the temporary reparations plan, 30% of them will be given to relevant countries. It is predicted that after Harrison, the executor of the reparations issue, and his deputy, Meikelai, return to Japan, the plan can be vigorously promoted. Harrison and Mi have gone to the United States a week ago to discuss the reparations issue with the Washington authorities. The 1,015 factories include 93 ordnance factories, 339 aircraft factories, 227 private munitions factories, 24 shipyards, 90 machine tool factories, 28 bullet factories, 21 steel factories, 82 light metal factories, 19 soda factories, 22 sulfuric acid factories, 20 power plants, 8 synthetic rubber factories, 10 synthetic oil factories, and 32 other research institutes. 30% of them have been included in the temporary reparations plan. According to the plan, our country can get half of them. At the same time, senior officials of our delegation to Japan denied to reporters this afternoon that our government had lodged a protest with the Allied Headquarters against maintaining Japan's high industrial level. They believe that even if our government wants to protest, the protest should be made to the Far Eastern Commission, not to the Allied Headquarters, because the Far Eastern Commission is the decision-making body. They also stated that our country advocates that Japan maintain the level of 1930. Japan had not developed heavy industry in 1930.

### Editorial: After the Close of the Moscow Conference

The world-watched Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference officially announced its close yesterday, the 24th, after holding its final meeting. The delegation representatives from Britain, the United States and France hastily embarked for their return home, each going their own way. From its opening on March 10th to its close the day before yesterday, it was exactly forty-five days. During this month and a half, representatives from the four countries had exerted their best efforts, ultimately hoping that this conference could guide the world onto a path of peace. However, after continuous debate for forty-five days, the result can be described as fruitless, and this is evident from the four resolutions passed at the final meeting. These four resolutions are: (1) To establish a Four-Power Committee to hold its first meeting in Vienna on May 12th, to discuss points of disagreement between the four powers regarding the Austrian peace treaty. (2) The next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to be held in London in November of this year, to continue discussing major German economic unification issues, where the opinions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union diverge. (3) After the close of the United Nations General Assembly, a temporary Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened in New York in September. (4) The Berlin Allied Control Council should draft a plan to limit the military forces of each occupying country within Germany before June 1st, to be implemented on September 1st.

From this, it can be seen that this Foreign Ministers Conference not only failed to draft a peace treaty for Germany but also failed to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow. From whatever angle it is observed, this Foreign Ministers Conference can be described as a complete failure. Before the opening of the Moscow Conference, the world had never held great extravagant hopes, but it was still believed that the signing of the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow was without issue. However, present realities prove that the Austrian peace treaty still needs to be left to the Four-Power Committee to discuss at its meeting in Vienna on May 12th. Moreover, we know that the only reason the Austrian peace treaty could not be signed lies in the issue of German assets within Austria, which is purely an economic factor and can be said to be unrelated to politics. The dispute between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is entirely due to both sides placing too much emphasis on their own interests. Therefore, the failure to resolve the German question was originally expected by the world and is not surprising. However, the obstruction of the Austrian peace treaty, leading to its inability to be signed in Moscow, was something no one expected, inevitably making the world feel that peace is even more distant from the human world. The psychological impact is particularly serious for the development of the world political situation.

Undeniably, this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was a complete failure. The information we rely on is entirely from news agencies and newspapers, which cannot be regarded as completely reliable. American political and diplomatic figures believe that whether this Foreign Ministers Conference has yielded any results requires waiting for Secretary of State Marshall to return home and report before a judgment can be made. However, if we review the expectations that the four powers had for the Moscow Conference, we can know that the four delegations wasted their breath and did not achieve their desired wishes. Taking the United States as an example, Marshall's purpose in going to Moscow was to promote the establishment of the Four-Power Pact and the Austrian peace treaty, but he has not achieved his purpose. Even Marshall himself has expressed "deep disappointment" with the achievements of the Moscow Conference. Secondly, Britain: since the Foreign Ministers Conference has failed to achieve a reasonable arrangement for the German economy, it cannot reduce the burden on British taxpayers; moreover, there has been no significant development in the treaty revision negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin cannot help but feel depressed. As for France, her expectations for the Moscow Conference were not only numerous but also large. On the one hand, she demanded that the Saar region be economically integrated into the French system; on the other hand, she wanted to put Germany in a state of division and never be able to recover, so that it would no longer threaten French security. However, the conference did not satisfy the wishes of French Foreign Minister Bidault. As for the Soviet Union, she demanded 10 billion US dollars in reparations from Germany and wanted Austria to bear considerable responsibility for this war, and also wanted to obtain some compensation from Austria. However, as a result of the conference, the Soviet Union was unable to extract reparations from current production in western Germany.

In fact, the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference is not only disappointing to the four countries! In the rest of the world, the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference has also made them feel a sense of "vagueness and loss." Since the end of World War II, it has been nearly two years in Europe; in the Far East, it has been a year and a half. However, for two years, true peace has not yet come to the world. At times, it is felt that the god of peace is looming, only hopeful but unattainable, and there is still some hope in the heart, and there is still a glimmer of light in front of us: but after this Foreign Ministers Conference, it is felt that peace is even more distant from the world. Germany and Japan were the culprits of World War II, and the aftermath of the war should be dealt with by concluding peace treaties with Germany and Japan first; but as things stand now, there is no hope of concluding a peace treaty with Germany within this year; we assume that the next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will end successfully and be able to draft a draft peace treaty for Germany that everyone can agree on, but the German Peace Conference will still not be able to be convened within the year; since the German peace treaty is stillborn, the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty is even more distant and uncertain, at least it cannot be talked about at present. This is what disappoints us the most.

French Socialist leader Blum published an article in the People's Daily, saying that the greatest achievement of this conference was the conclusion of an agreement between Britain, the United States, and France on the issue of coal. From France's standpoint, because France urgently needs a supply of coal, it cannot be regarded as without reason, but for the interests of the entire world peace, the establishment of this agreement outside the conference is actually more harmful than beneficial. According to the news from the French news agency, Britain and the United States may immediately implement their plan to unify western Germany, and France, because the Saar issue has not yielded results, has established a coal agreement with Britain and the United States, and may also participate in the unification of western Germany. If this news is true, then the tendency of today's world to split into eastern and western worlds will be even more obvious.

In short, this Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference not only failed to lead the world onto a path of peace but also hinted to the world that peace is even more distant from the world. If the political diplomats of the great powers cannot reflect on themselves after the meeting, have a thorough understanding, catch up quickly, use their political wisdom, start from a broad perspective, first eliminate international suspicion and fear, and then establish a spirit of mutual trust and tolerance, thereby breaking the deadlock; then the future of the world will be shrouded in clouds and fog, and the sunshine of peace will never be revealed.

### After the Failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference: France Will Draw Closer to Britain and the United States; The East-West Division of Germany Will Become More Pronounced

[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures predict that after the failure of the Moscow Conference, the division between eastern and western Germany will become stronger. The six-week conference failed to reach agreements on major issues, such as: (1) the economic unification of Germany; (2) the form and scope of reparations; (3) the future political system of Germany; (4) the manner in which smaller allied nations participate in discussions on the German peace treaty; (5) the establishment of a Four-Power Treaty to prevent German aggression; (6) the completion of the Austrian treaty; Almost all major issues were unsuccessful. In addition, the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to revise the alliance treaty have also failed to achieve a concrete conclusion. The Anglo-American-French coal agreement is the only significant achievement of the six-week conference, but this agreement will cause France to further strengthen its relations with the Western occupying powers, forming a more obvious division between the East and West.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] Diplomatic figures here recently stated that it is almost certain that Britain and the United States may implement their plan to unify western Germany with the city of Frankfurt as its capital. It is only a matter of time, whether it will be implemented at this moment, or after the close of the United Nations General Assembly is still unknown. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference achieved no results on the Saar region issue, but the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, have reached an agreement on the coal issue, which is sufficient to make France agree to participate in the unification of West Germany as well.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 25th] The current Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the longest in history, has concluded today in the worst post-war stalemate between the Allies. Most Western diplomats believe that the Moscow Conference was even less fruitful than the London Conference in September 1945, when the foreign ministers first began to negotiate the treaties with Germany's satellite states, which was fraught with difficulties. The issues discussed at the Moscow Conference, such as the Four-Power Treaty for the Disarmament of Germany and the Austrian Peace Treaty, were far more important than the treaties with Germany's satellite states, and the rift between East and West is even deeper. A few people predicted that there would be much progress this time, and the Austrian Peace Treaty was a smaller issue, and an agreement could be reached, but as a result, even this most modest hope was not achieved, and the Soviet Union tore up the forty-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany proposed by the United States, which was even more unexpected. A few optimistic diplomats felt that "making the issues public" was at least a gain, but most people pointed out that most of the issues had long been exposed to the world. Each country now uses the means of bluntly demanding or firmly opposing the demands of other countries, which makes all issues even more deeply rooted. Previously, each party's position seemed to involve ambiguity, and it was still possible to find ways to compromise without having to worry about face, but now, unless one country or another makes a substantial concession, a solution cannot be achieved. The only concrete development of the Moscow Conference in diplomacy is the closer connection between France and the Western Allies. The Soviet Union's diplomatic policy toward Germany has forced France to invest in the Western countries on major issues to protect its basic security. In short, the Soviet Union's position has remained unchanged since the Lenin era, advocating a strong Germany, a central authority, and industrialization, which is what France fears most. It remains to be seen what impact Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's position on the Saar issue and his demand to establish a strong Germany will have on the French Communist Party. However, US Secretary of State Marshall's calm support of France has won the friendship of Western Europe. At the same time, his demands for the return of some eastern farmland currently ruled by Poland and his firm opposition to Soviet demands for reparations will also have their effect. Although the final value of this kind of propaganda remains to be seen, it can be asserted that it will affect hungry and restless Europe.

### The Next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Will Be Held in London in November of This Year; A Special Committee Will Be Established to Discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held its last meeting this afternoon, passing three resolutions: (1) The next Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in London in November of this year. (2) After the close of the United Nations General Assembly, a temporary Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened in New York in September. (3) The Berlin Allied Control Council must draft a plan to limit the occupying forces of Germany before June 1st, to be implemented on September 1st.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 24th] When the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held its meeting this afternoon, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke first, responding to the suggestion made yesterday by US Secretary of State Marshall to hand over the Austrian issue to the United Nations General Assembly for resolution, believing that there was no reason to adopt a different method for concluding the Austrian Peace Treaty from the method used for concluding the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. He proposed establishing a special Four-Power Committee to be responsible for discussing the Austrian issue. Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin both agreed. Foreign Secretary Bevin also said that this committee should deal with matters practically and should no longer cause disagreements on theoretical viewpoints. The Austrian government should compile a list of German assets within its territory and submit it to the Four-Power Committee for discussion. Foreign Minister Molotov also expressed his agreement in principle. In the end, it was decided to establish a special Four-Power Committee to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty issue, in order to adjust the opinions of the four powers, and it was decided to hold the first meeting in Vienna on May 12th.

### Bevin Expresses Before Leaving: The Solidarity of the Four Powers Has Increased

[United Press, Moscow, 25th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said today: The feeling he should have when leaving Moscow tonight is that "the solidarity of the four powers has increased compared to before the Moscow Conference." Bevin said: "I believe that the detailed exchange of views between countries is most beneficial to further research. I firmly believe that when people recall the Moscow Conference in the future, they will recognize it as one of the most important contributions to peace-building." Bevin also revealed that Britain had never flatly rejected the Soviet Union's request to extract reparations from Germany's existing production, only saying that there were more important issues that had to be resolved first. He believed that the more important issues were, first, to seek Germany's economic unification, second, Germany's political system, and third, Britain's investment in Germany must first be repaid.

### Americans and Soviets Resume Negotiations: Koreans Express Indifference; Syngman Rhee Says He Has No Extravagant Hopes

[Associated Press, Seoul, 24th] People in the American-occupied area of Korea have greatly divided opinions on the prospects for the resumption of negotiations by the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Right-wing newspapers and political leaders have expressed doubt about whether this move can resolve the Korean issue. The left welcomes Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal to reopen the meeting in Seoul on May 20th, believing that it is the only way to complete Korean unification. The liberal "People's Voice" newspaper commented that the resumption of negotiations can prevent the reactionaries' conspiracy to establish a separate South Korean government. Independence leader Syngman Rhee told the press that he did not think the resumption of negotiations by the US-Soviet Joint Commission was important, because we would not send representatives to participate directly. I have no extravagant hopes for future meetings. I neither oppose nor support the commission, but if the United States and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement on the current issues, the result will naturally be good, and I am prepared to abide by its decisions.

### Marshall Departs for the United States: Will Give a Broadcast After Arriving in Washington; British and French Foreign Ministers Return Home by Special Train

[Associated Press, Moscow, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall took a plane from Moscow Central Airport at 9:03 this morning (6:03 PM Shanghai time today). The delegations from the United States, Britain, and France, which participated in the Foreign Ministers Conference, will all depart today. French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin are both scheduled to leave by special train today. Those who saw Marshall off at the airport included Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the ambassadors from Britain, France, Greece, and Iran, and US Ambassador Smith. Before leaving, Marshall said at the airport: "We regret that we have not made greater progress. I believe that when we look back on the past, we will know that the work that has been completed is actually more than we realize. I plan to give a formal broadcast report to the American people immediately after returning to the United States." Marshall also expressed his gratitude to the Soviet side for their hospitality and said: "I come from a young and important country. Even if we express impatience, our purpose is very sincere, that is, to see peace come to the world and people's hearts."

[Associated Press, Berlin, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall, on his way back to the United States from the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, passed through Berlin today for a brief stop, and once again expressed his disappointment with the results of the Moscow Conference. He said: "I had hoped that an agreement could be reached on the Austrian peace treaty, but now I cannot guess when an agreement can be reached. The four foreign ministers will gather in New York in September during the United Nations General Assembly, and then hold a formal meeting in London in November. The Moscow meeting did not discuss a possible meeting between Premier Stalin, Prime Minister Attlee, and President Truman.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th Special Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall can return here on the 26th. In a few days, he will report to the people on the proceedings of the Moscow Conference. Although officials here have not confirmed that he will broadcast the results of the Foreign Ministers Conference nationwide, it is generally expected that he will follow the story of former Secretary of State Byrnes broadcasting to the nation after attending previous Four-Power Conferences.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] President Truman declined to comment on the results of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. He said: Secretary of State Marshall can personally report to the United States on the proceedings of the conference after returning home.

The dishes were exquisite, and various famous Russian wines were served to enhance the atmosphere. Conversations avoided political topics and the atmosphere was very friendly. Guests and hosts raised glasses, never mentioning the negative results of the Foreign Ministers Conference. After the banquet, they drank coffee and milk in the "Red Hall". Stalin invited the guests to watch the famous Soviet film "Stone Flower" until 0:05 AM, when Stalin bid farewell, saying "Goodbye", and Bevin replied "Thank you".

[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Soviet Premier Stalin hosted a grand banquet tonight in the "Blue Hall" of the Kremlin, entertaining the foreign ministers of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Stalin raised a glass on the spot to wish US President Truman good health, a gesture that may be the feature of the banquet. Stalin's toast was in response to US Secretary of State Marshall raising a glass to commemorate the work of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Marshall also made a speech on the spot, saying: The United States is a young country and may be impatient, "In our impatience, it may be understood that we most earnestly desire the early peace and prosperity of Europe."

### British Chiefs of Staff Conference Scheduled for Next Month; US Denies Cutting the Navy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The British Empire Chiefs of Staff Conference is scheduled to be held in May. It will be chaired by the Chief of the Army General Staff, and will discuss all issues related to the Imperial Army. Marshal Auchinleck, Commander of the British Army in India, will also participate.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Senate Armed Services Committee today questioned the Army and Navy Departments about whether there were secret plans to cut the Navy.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The French Minister of Public Works and Transport, Moch, has been in London at the invitation of British Minister of Civil Aviation Nathan, to discuss the development of air transport between Britain and France for two days, and returned to Paris today.

### British Prime Minister's Speech: Refutes Churchill

[Reuters, St Andrews, Scotland, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech today at the Scottish Trades Union Congress, in response to the speech made by Churchill yesterday. Attlee said that Churchill seemed to want to make Britain go back fifty years in India. Churchill had said that the empire had been ruined and India had been abandoned. He had been using these terms for years, neglecting the decades of the Indian self-government movement and abandoning the democratic principles he had fought for during the war. When I announced in the House of Commons that India had the right to determine its own future destiny, the opposition party did not object. I do not believe that there are any imperialists in the British Commonwealth or the United States who support Churchill. In this regard, Churchill never thinks and only acts emotionally. Churchill had also gone so far as to say that Britain was on the road to bankruptcy, but it should be known that the current difficulties actually stem from early mistakes. I still do not forget that when Churchill was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was our most unfortunate Chancellor of the Exchequer. His adoption of the gold standard was the root cause of the suffering we are suffering today.

### Wallace's Lobbying in Europe, Truman Pays Close Attention, Wallace to Form "Peace Crusade" After Returning Home

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] President Truman, when meeting with the press today, refrained from criticizing the Moscow Conference or former Vice President Wallace's lobbying in Europe. However, he stated that Wallace's 15 billion dollar aid plan for the Soviet Union would be one of the topics in the Marshall Report.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] It is learned here that after returning from his visit to Europe, Wallace will organize a "Peace Crusade" in the United States.

### Wallace in Paris, Gives a Series of Speeches

Urges France to Maintain a Republican System

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th, United Press] When Wallace made an unnamed attack on De Gaulle, citizens in three districts of Paris stood up and cheered Wallace. Wallace stated that France must forever be a republic, free from the poison of dictatorial ideas, not only for its own benefit, but also for the benefit of the world. He did not mention De Gaulle's name, but the audience knew he was referring to De Gaulle's supporters. Tonight's speech was Wallace's last in his European tour, and he will fly to America tomorrow morning.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Wallace stated in a speech to the Anglo-American Press Association today that he maintains a moderate position in politics, so he will avoid contact with the extreme right or extreme left during this European tour. Moderates today have a greater significance for the world than in the past, he said. After dining with the reporters, Wallace went to the Presidential Palace to meet with Prime Minister Ramadier. Wallace then gave a speech at the Sorbonne University at his first public gathering in Paris, stating that current world trends are leaning towards a third world war, and it is too late for politicians to save it. This trend may be rekindled by foolish events or deliberate provocations, leading to a world war. He deeply fears that the governments of various countries and professional diplomats may not be able to reverse this crisis. In short, the current world crisis is already taking effect psychologically, economically, and politically, he said.

### Huang Renlin Inspects Military Facilities in America

[United Press, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 25th] Major General Huang Renlin arrived here by plane from Oklahoma today to inspect American military facilities.

### Prediction of the Japanese House of Representatives Election, Liberal Party Expected to Win

### De Gaulle Expresses Political Views, Attempts to Re-enter the Political Stage

[United Press, Paris, 24th] De Gaulle recently declared: Since I created the new National Unity Movement, hundreds of thousands of people have joined, but I have absolutely no intention of establishing a dictatorial regime. My aim is to unite the French people above the existing political parties and create a democratic politics slightly different from the current system, so that voters can freely express their will.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Since De Gaulle's speeches in Bayeux and Strasbourg, hinting at a determination to participate in political activities, he has now indeed returned to the political stage. His remarks at today's press conference were particularly decisive steps in taking this action. His words about the difficulties currently facing French life, and the need for the French people to unite and express their opinions with a common emotion in order to exert political power, reveal his intentions. De Gaulle also strongly stated that the existing political parties have failed to allow the people to express their opinions, and that his French People's Rally (Rassemblement du Peuple Français) will undertake this important task. The impression gained by the reporters after listening to his lofty pronouncements was that De Gaulle's political views remained the same as before. De Gaulle believes that the worsening of the current situation in France is different from that of 1940, but the situation is extremely serious, and that it is his duty to intervene, he said.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The French Communist Party issued a communiqué today, reiterating its advocacy for the establishment of "security committees" throughout the country to resist the activities of reactionaries and the People's Rally led by General De Gaulle.

### China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane Forced to Land After Takeoff from Longhua, Crashes Out of Airport, Kills Three, Engine Damaged, Wheels Broken, Pilot and Passengers Safe, Dai Anguo Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate the Truth

[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Lanzhou route passenger plane flies once a week. Yesterday morning at 8:57, American pilot Moore, along with co-pilot Li Yinjie and radio operator Wen Yonghao, flew a C-47 type twin-engine aircraft No. 141, carrying five passengers and cargo, took off from Longhua Airport. Unexpectedly, five minutes after takeoff (only 10 meters above the ground), it was discovered that the plane's left engine suddenly stopped. The pilot then urgently used the right engine to turn and landed at the airport's east-west runway within five minutes. However, during landing, the brakes also failed and could not be controlled, causing it to rush out of the runway for about 300 yards, stopping at a location about 10 yards northeast of house number 4, Panjiatang, at the west end of the runway. At that time, three residents (two women and one man) of house number 4, were passing by that location, intending to go to the market to buy vegetables, and were knocked down and killed by the plane's right propeller.

Three Villagers Die Tragically

The three villagers who died tragically were: (1) Shi Shen, female, 53 years old, from Qidong, died from a nose injury and bleeding (her husband, Shi Guolin, 54 years old, is a CNAC employee, and her son, Shi Jiankang, 31 years old, is a mason). (2) Xu Lu, female, 52 years old, from Qidong, her forehead was split open. (3) Xu Yicheng, male, 26 years old, was Xu Lu's son. Three-quarters of his head was split off. He was also a CNAC employee (his father, Xu Huishan, 54 years old, is currently a teacher).

Pilot and Passengers Safe

Pilot Moore suffered a slight abrasion to his head, which was very minor, while all the other people only suffered a scare. After getting off the plane and resting briefly in the waiting room, they were sent back to their residences by company cars. It is learned that there were originally more than 20 people scheduled to take the Shanghai-Lanzhou flight, but due to the recent bad weather, only five people boarded the plane temporarily. The most fortunate thing was that the plane was carrying 700 gallons of gasoline, but it did not catch fire. Company officials and those familiar with flight technology all said that Moore's skills were very admirable. As for the damage to the plane, in addition to the engine damage, the right propeller fell off, the landing gear broke, and the fuselage was also damaged, but both wings were intact.

The passenger list is as follows: To Xi'an: Chen Rongxin, Chen Zhu Yixin (husband and wife). To Lanzhou: Liang Yueshanzhang (CNAC employee, transferred to the Hami branch). Zhang Hanxiang and American Breurer (N.F. Breurer).

Demands for Compensation

After the plane crash, Xu Linhai, the director of the Longhua Police Branch, immediately ordered section chief Lin Deming and officer Guo Zhikai to rush to the scene of the accident to maintain order and take photos for evidence. Allison, the director of CNAC's flight engineering section, Chen Hongen, the deputy director, and Gao Dajing, the business director, all went to inspect the scene. The bodies were immediately moved to the side, and later sent to the Changde Road morgue by company car. The morgue is scheduled to examine the bodies today. The families of the deceased demanded that the company provide coffins for the deceased and pay compensation.

As for the company, it has now reported the case to the local court on one hand and reported to the Ministry of Communications on the other. Regarding compensation for losses, it will be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures.

After receiving reports from various parties, the Ministry of Communications attached great importance to the matter and dispatched Dai Anguo, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to investigate the truth. Dai arrived in Shanghai by plane at 6 pm yesterday. CNAC officials have scheduled a review meeting this afternoon to review the cause of the accident.

### Illegal Hoarding Exceeding Limits, Eight Rice Shops Investigated

[Report from Our Newspaper] The police department's economic section was ordered to thoroughly investigate rice shops throughout the city yesterday morning. By 4 pm, as many as seven shops had been found to be holding goods for sale or exceeding the price limit. These included Wanchang on Jinling Middle Road, Tongxin at 105 Xikang Road, Lishungong at 567 Chengdu Road, Huasheng at 233 Weihaiwei Road, Wantun at 435 Beijing West Road, Dashenggong at 31 Yongkang Road, and Zhikang at 213 Qiaojia Road. In addition to seizing the rice in stock and selling it at the limited price in the shop, the managers of each shop were taken to the police station for interrogation. Those with serious cases have been detained.

[Another Report] Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the food section of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally led staff members to thoroughly investigate rice shops selling at illegal prices outside the city yesterday afternoon. At the Dakang Rice Shop on Hengshan Road, two sets of books were found. The one placed outside recorded the price of white polished rice as 160,000 yuan, while another neatly copied set of books recorded 168,000 yuan (the city government stipulates that the transaction price of rice shops must not exceed 160,000 yuan). The shop was suspected of concealing the truth from the government and violating the price limit. The accountant, Zhou Xueshi, was taken to the police station for investigation.

### Resolving the Heavy Burden on Workers' Lives, Seeking a Compromise Solution, Slightly Different from the Differential Subsidy System, Currently Under Detailed Study by the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from Our Newspaper] The general salaried class and industrial workers in this city are currently hoping that the government will immediately de-freeze the cost of living index, as they cannot bear the pressure of high prices. In recent days, the cotton textile industry unions in four districts, the Zhonghua Book Company, and the newspaper workers' union have separately appealed to the General Labor Union and the Social Affairs Bureau on this matter. Yesterday, the Shanghai Telephone Company workers also submitted a document to the General Labor Union requesting to de-freeze the index. When Wu Kaixian, the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, went to Beijing to attend the National Price Conference this time, Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan, inquired in detail about the price fluctuations in Shanghai. In view of the fact that ordinary workers are unable to make ends meet and maintain their lives due to the impact of rising prices, and that increasing workers' wages needs to take into account whether the capitalists can afford it, President Zhang instructed Director Wu to seek a compromise solution between the two, so that workers' income can maintain their lives, and capitalists will not be unable to survive as a result. The solution may be slightly different from the current differential subsidy system and is currently under detailed study by the Social Affairs Bureau.

[Another Report] Wu, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, who went to Beijing to attend the price conference, returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 24th. When he met with reporters yesterday, he said: This was a small group review meeting, where representatives only reported on the situation in various places and exchanged opinions with each other, and no decisions were made. The formal conference will be convened after President Zhang decides on a date.

The differential subsidy for the six major daily necessities for workers in April will be calculated by the 25th, and the municipal government will announce it on the 28th.

### Fan Danian Suspected of Being a Traitor, Trial Concluded, Sentence to be Announced on the 30th

Three Mitsui Foremen to be Sentenced on the Same Day

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fan Danian's case of suspected treason was concluded at the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentence is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 30th. Fan is a native of Shanghai, 49 years old, and graduated from Jiaotong University in his early years. He served in the Ministry of Communications and the railway for many years. Before the war, he served as the manager of the Wharf Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. He is accused of serving as the deputy section chief of the General Affairs Section of "Hengchan Company" during the fall of Shanghai (the section chief was a Japanese, Mori Shigeo). "Hengchan Company" was an organization planned by the puppet regime to build "Greater Shanghai," and occupied a large amount of farmland and British and American overseas Chinese property in Jiangwan. It also forced residents to change their British and American title deeds to Japanese title deeds, attempting to control all the houses in the city. Fan argued that although the company had this plan, it was not implemented until the victory.

Li Yanchen, Li Dengshun, and Li Dengshuang were originally foremen at Mitsui Yangxing's Pudong Wharf. They are accused of leading dock workers to rob and transport merchants' property in trucks in the Hongkou area for six days after the Pearl Harbor Incident. After being reported after the victory, the case was concluded at the High Court yesterday morning, and the sentence is also scheduled to be announced on the 30th.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The deadline for clearing accumulated coffins in this city, according to the original regulations of the Health Bureau, was the end of this month. Now, the bureau has granted an extension of six months, until the end of October this year, in view of the current inconvenient transportation and difficulties in handling.

In addition, there is a vacant lot in the American military cemetery in the Hongqiao Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. The Health Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to turn it into a cemetery area, which was approved at yesterday's municipal meeting.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Plans to Ask the Central Government to Establish a Central Guidance Agency

[Report from Our Newspaper] The pharmaceutical industry in this city believes that various government departments are already being reorganized. The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, the Shanghai Pharmacists' Association, and the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association jointly telegraphed Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Zhou Yichun, the Minister of Health, stating that the self-sufficiency of medicines, the reasonable regulation of surplus and deficiency, and the normal development of supporting pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories should all be centrally managed by a central guidance agency established by the central government. The associations believe that our country has had financial difficulties for years, and the establishment of a ministry is not permitted, but at least a temporary remedy should be to establish a pharmaceutical administration department within the Ministry of Health. A meeting was scheduled to be held at the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association this morning to discuss the matter, and representatives will be sent to Beijing to make statements to relevant parties, hoping to implement the plan.

### Haihan Ship Undergoes Minor Repairs, Scheduled to Depart for Tianjin This Morning

### District People's Representative Assemblies in Various Districts Request an Increase in Budget

The annual budget for the Shanghai Municipal District People's Representative Assemblies was originally 30 million yuan. The District People's Representative Assemblies in various districts believe that this is not enough to apply. At the Shanghai District People's Representative Assembly Chairmen's Friendship Association meeting a few days ago, Liu Jingru and others were delegated as representatives to request the Council to increase funding. Yesterday, Liu and others went to the meeting to request an additional 32.65 million yuan, totaling 35.65 million yuan, which is more than ten times the original budget. The costs include office expenses, staff expenses, employee expenses, and construction expenses. The council believes that this case is related to the municipal government's overall budget and intends to submit it to the third general meeting for discussion.

### Improving the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Most Steel Rails and Sleepers are Corroded, Replacement Planned to Start Next Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fu Jun, the Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, who was ordered to come to Shanghai to investigate the derailment accident on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, has submitted the investigation report to Beijing and is scheduled to fly to Beiping with Ling Hongxun, the Vice Minister of Communications, this morning, and then travel to the Northeast to inspect road administration. He will also travel with Chen Yanjiong, the Director of the Northeast Transportation Bureau. According to the responsible persons of the two railway bureaus, the two derailment incidents in recent days have caused heavy losses. After Director Chen Bozhuang returns to Shanghai from Beijing, a review meeting on traffic accidents will be held. He pointed out that since the bureau's restoration, it has formulated a recovery plan and a modernization plan. Due to the limitations of foreign exchange and funding, not only the modernization plan has not been realized, but also the increase in vehicles and the replacement of sleepers and steel rails in the recovery plan is beyond its ability. He added that the steel rails used on the railway are all old light-weight (85 pounds) rails from 40 years ago, and many of the sleepers are also corroded. In order to ensure traffic safety and restore express trains, the Beijing-Shanghai Line needs to replace at least 30 kilometers of steel rails and 300,000 sleepers, excluding those recently replaced. Currently, 20 kilometers of steel rails are available. The required parts can be delivered in full by the end of this month, and it is planned to start replacing the rails west from Nanxiang Station next month, which can be completed in two months.

The payment for the 100,000 sleepers ordered in Taiwan has been paid, but the payment for the 200,000 sleepers ordered in the United States and Siam has not been paid due to foreign exchange restrictions and it is difficult to transport them in the short term.

### Housing Lease Regulations Revised by the Municipal Council, If the Landlord Does Not Need to Take Back the Property, the Original Tenant Should Continue to Lease

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council recently sent the draft housing lease regulations formulated by the Legislative Yuan, along with the recommendations of the Council's political, legal, and social committees, to each councilor to solicit opinions. Municipal Councilor Zhang Yiqun told reporters that Article 9, Paragraph 6 of the original draft stipulates that "if the agreed lease term has expired," the landlord may terminate the contract. Now, the Municipal Council has revised it to "if the agreed lease term has expired and there is a definite need to take it back for their own use." This means that if the agreed lease term has expired and the landlord does not need to take back the property for their own use, the original tenant should continue to lease it. This is reasonable in law, sentiment, and reason, and I fully agree with it, he said.

The Housing Shortage is Still Serious, the Distribution Period Should be Extended

The unified distribution method for houses in this city that were once inhabited by enemy overseas Chinese but are not owned by enemies or puppets, and allocated to various agencies, will expire on April 30th. The Executive Yuan has instructed how to handle it after the expiration: (1) Houses in Shanghai that were once inhabited by enemy overseas Chinese but are not owned by enemies or puppets will be distributed until the deadline of April 30th. After the expiration, the Enemy Puppet Property Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts will verify and return them to the original owners. (2) Current residents who intend to continue leasing after the distribution period expires should directly negotiate a lease with the original owner. The responsible person of the Municipal Council recently made a statement on the issue: Since the victory and restoration of this city, the housing shortage has been serious. Last year, the Executive Yuan, in view of this, had a unified distribution method. However, for a year, the serious phenomenon of the housing shortage has not been reduced at all. Once this distribution method is abolished, if the distributees are not given the right to continue to lease and reside, tens of thousands of people from the military, public education, and cultural groups in this city will be displaced, which will inevitably cause great social disputes. Therefore, at the second general meeting in March, there was a proposal to extend the unified lease method, and the two resolutions were: (1) The original residents who are military, public education personnel, and cultural organizations who have been legally distributed and have no rent arrears, etc., are still allowed to continue to live; (2) Those who have been legally distributed and have not signed a contract so far, the original owner shall not refuse for any reason and shall sign the contract immediately. Moreover, at the first general meeting of this council, there was also a suggestion in the Finance and Land Document No. 6 on the issue of housing lease rights that "the original tenant has the right to continue to lease, but this restriction does not apply to those who violate various provisions of the Civil Code," requesting the Legislative Yuan to adopt and implement it when formulating the housing lease regulations. The purpose is also to reduce the various lease disputes caused by the housing shortage in this city. Now, the second point clearly stipulated by the Executive Yuan, once implemented, will inevitably cause various social disturbances due to the different views between the owner and the tenant. In order to eliminate these disturbances, this council has sent letters to the municipal government and the local court, requesting the administrative and judicial authorities to refer to the council's resolutions in the past and adopt them for implementation, he said.

### Economic Reconnaissance Network Holds Emergency Meeting, Strictly Investigates the Market for Food Rice, Gold, Banknotes, and Cloth

[Report from Our Newspaper] The economic reconnaissance network organized by the municipal government's garrison headquarters and other agencies held an emergency meeting at the garrison headquarters yesterday morning to discuss a plan to stabilize prices due to continuous price increases. It is learned that the following has been decided: (1) Food Rice: Starting yesterday, the limited retail price was set at 170,000 yuan, which will be strictly enforced. A large number of police officers will be dispatched to thoroughly investigate the rice market to check for refusal to sell national rice, exceeding the price limit, and adulteration of inferior products as inspection targets. (2) Gold and Banknotes: It has been decided to go to various silver shops, gold shops, and all black market trading places to investigate and severely punish in various ways, and to strictly inspect smuggling out of the country. (3) Cloth: Yesterday, the garrison headquarters' cloth group sent personnel in twelve groups to investigate factories, warehouses, cloth shops, and reproduction factories. Anyone who buys a cloth and stores it for more than a month and a half and still refuses to sell it will be charged with hoarding and forced to sell it to the government at the original price.

### Prosecutor Decides to Appeal "Foreign Tiger" Case in the Last Hour, High Court Also Accepts Maysberger's Appeal

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the court sentenced the "Foreign Tiger" case on the 14th of this month, as the defendant Maysberger was only sentenced to one year of imprisonment and the confiscation was only 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, there was considerable attention to whether the prosecutor would appeal. The original complainant also submitted a letter suggesting that the prosecutor appeal. Yesterday was the last day of the appeal period. The prosecutor in charge, Quan Tao, considered it again and again, and finally decided to appeal at 6 pm yesterday, and immediately declared to the criminal court that the reason for the appeal would be supplemented later in accordance with the law. After deciding to appeal, Prosecutor Quan told reporters that the appeal in this case could have been decided earlier, but the case involved a huge amount of US dollars and gold. As the handling agency and the informer can get 30% of the bonus after the gold and banknotes are confiscated, he was deeply afraid that the outside world would misunderstand that the prosecutor was appealing for the bonus. He was unable to make a decision until he appealed in the last hour of the appeal period. As for the confiscation of gold and banknotes, he does not intend to make a request on the number, but only to seek the accuracy of the actual number.

[Another Report] In the case of "Foreign Tiger" Dutchman Maysberger's illegal operation of foreign exchange, the court previously sentenced him to one year of imprisonment and confiscated 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars. Maysberger refused to accept the sentence and filed an appeal with the High Court. The High Court has accepted the case. The case is being handled by Judge Wang Kequan, and it is said that the trial will begin soon.

### Mrs. Yang Siqi's Tea Party Reception: Overflowing with Sino-French Cultural Exchange; She is the Founder of the Prestigious Diderot Prize; Once Traveled the World Searching for the Mystery of the Ideal Couple

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the French General Assembly held a tea party reception for the press, filled with an atmosphere of Sino-French cultural exchange. The hostess, Mrs. Yang Siqi (Madame Roube Jansky), is a representative of the French Diderot Society and the Parisian Grand Evening News, a versatile philologist, musician, and dancer. Mrs. Yang Siqi is the founder of the famous French Diderot Prize. Established in 1935, the Diderot Prize aims to promote the flow of Sino-French cultural friendship by planning to select and send a French writer or journalist to China for travel each year within ten years. After being held for two years, it was terminated due to the outbreak of the war. Now that the war is over, Mrs. Yang has decided to continue its operation and intends to expand its meaning, not only selecting and sending French writers and journalists to China, but also selecting and sending Chinese journalists and writers to France, one person from each country each year, for a period of four months. All expenses, receptions, etc., will be fully borne by her.

Everything is Ready Except for Transportation

The selection of candidates will be presided over by the Prize Committee. The person in charge on the French side is former Socialist leader Pierre Brossolette, and the person in charge on the Chinese side is Mr. Li Shizeng. The selected writers or journalists should understand a little of the other party's language so that they can delve into the people and make contact with various aspects. For this year's "exchange" affairs, Mrs. Yang Siqi has prepared everything for the French side, and the Chinese side is also almost "completely ready," but the only "east wind" missing is transportation—the problem of the airplane needed for travel. Yesterday, Mrs. Yang particularly emphasized her hope that the Chinese government would "lend a hand!"

Researching Invisible Bacteria that Destroy Marital Happiness

Another extremely interesting endeavor of Mrs. Yang Siqi is her research on the issue of male-female marriage. She feels that there is often an invisible bacterium in the marital relationship of couples that destroys each other's happiness, and she wants to investigate the cause of this. Therefore, in the past few decades, she has traveled around the world to find an ideal couple. Did she find one in the end? Mrs. Yang Siqi remained secretive yesterday, cleverly keeping this a mystery to be revealed next Wednesday (April 30th). Next Wednesday at 8:30 p.m., Mrs. Yang will perform a very special program at the Lyceum Theatre, entitled "Traveling Around the World, Searching for the Ideal Couple." She says its nature is close to a lecture, but it is accompanied by music and dance, all of which are music and dances related to marriage from the various countries she has visited. Besides French, Mrs. Yang can only speak very broken English, but she says that on the day of the performance, she will use a language that is currently kept secret, guaranteeing that every Chinese audience member will be able to understand. Let's wait and see her "ideal couple"!

### Embezzling Payment and Fleeing; Impersonating to Extort

[Our Newspaper] Lin Yingzhou, 45 years old, a local from Shanghai, the owner of De Kang Rice Shop at No. 274, Lujiabang Road in the South City, had 39,748 catties of barley in his shop. Zheng Renyi from Pao Street, who was well-acquainted with him, and another broker, Chen Zhaoming, sold the barley to the foreign company, the Ke Di Milk Shed, for a value of 22,658,600 Legal Tender. After the goods were delivered, Chen Xiangqian received the payment around 5:00 p.m. on the 23rd and handed it over to Zheng Renyi. Zheng Renyi issued a receipt as proof. Unexpectedly, after obtaining the payment, Zheng fled without a trace. The next day, he forged letters from Communist leaders Zhu De and Mao Zedong, claiming that military funds were needed and demanding that the owner of the firm borrow 50,000,000 yuan and 80,000 dan of white rice, to be delivered to the military headquarters at No. 5, Bao 2, Xietu Road within three days. After receiving the letter, Lin was terrified. Later, his wife, Mao Min, reported the information to the Penglai Branch Bureau. Director Yao of the branch bureau immediately ordered an investigation. After comparing the handwriting, it was determined that it was Zheng's doing. Therefore, the officer in charge was ordered to arrest Zheng Renyi and bring him to justice for trial.

### Two Japanese War Criminals Indicted; Forced Confessions through Torture and Murder of Martyrs; Collecting Intelligence and Inciting Rebellion

[Our Newspaper] The military tribunal yesterday indicted two more Japanese war criminals: (1) Shigenori Goto, former deputy commander of the Qingdao Kempeitai, who, starting in January of the 28th year of the Republic of China, served as the person in charge of the anti-communist system of the security police. During his tenure, he was eager to claim credit and made extraordinary efforts to suppress our underground workers, resulting in many wrongful convictions. As a result, the criminal was promoted from Kempeitai to Sergeant Major. In September of the 29th year of the Republic of China, a student named Miao Zongyi was arrested by the enemy Kempeitai in Jinan and escorted to Qingdao, where he was subjected to harsh torture to force a confession, and was eventually murdered at the end of December. In mid-November of the same year, Tan Jintao, an employee of Donglai Bank, was arrested, accused of being an anti-Japanese element, and subjected to forced confessions through torture before being transferred to Beiping for execution. In March of the 31st year, Wang Tingshun, a member of the Kuomintang, was also arrested and subjected to severe torture to extract a confession. He was once exiled to the Xinxing Coal Mine in Manchukuo to serve as a forced laborer. In the third month of the same year (lunar calendar), a man named Wang Fangping was arrested, and the criminal personally interrogated him under torture, ordering the victim's wife to watch in order to extract a confession. The victim, Wang Fangping, eventually died due to the severity of the torture. In August, more than ten members of the Youth League, including Wang Zhenhua and Zhao Zhiting, were arrested. During interrogation, the criminal incited a wolfhound to attack Zhao Zhiting, who died from his injuries on the spot. The others were either exiled to Manchukuo after being tortured, or escaped with heavy bribes. In November of the same year, eight employees of the Military Intelligence Bureau, including Deng Jiren and Ge Yufeng, were arrested, and all were interrogated by the criminal separately. Zhang Zesheng and Cui Yushan were among those who sacrificed their lives under torture. The others were transferred elsewhere, and their fate is unknown. (2) Sueki Higashimatsu, a China expert and ronin who had been engaged in espionage work throughout his life, came to China in June of the 21st year of the Republic of China and successively served in enemy Harbin intelligence agencies, the 10th Division headquarters, and the 3rd Division headquarters. He also served in intelligence agencies in Shanhaiguan, Beijing, Haizhou, and Xuzhou, and served as an advisor to the puppet Funing County government, and the head of the Huaiyin branch of the liaison department, for fifteen years. His mission was to collect intelligence, sabotage the activities of our officers and soldiers, lure our people away from their motherland, spread false information that was unfavorable to our government, and support puppets and incite rebellion. Among them, the massacre of civilians by the puppet Eastern Hebei government and the confiscation of people's property by the puppet Funing County government are the most hateful. At that time, the defendants were both guiding advisors, fueling the flames and could not shirk their responsibility.

### Mr. and Mrs. Mao Dun Arrive in Shanghai After Returning from Sightseeing in the Soviet Union

### Trademark Dispute Between Needle Manufacturers; Each Party Holds Its Own View

[Our Newspaper] Xu Rongjin, the person in charge of Dali Hang, reported to the police station on April 24th that Huachang Needle Factory was counterfeiting Dali Hang's exclusive "Lao Lihua" trademark. After receiving the report, the police station went to the address and confiscated ten small bundles of trademark paper. However, according to Cao Tao, the person in charge of the Huachang Needle Factory, the "Lao Lihua" trademark was exclusively used by the Zhonghua Nail Factory, which was founded by the Japanese. He claimed that he had purchased the enemy property through bidding in August of the 35th year, so he believed that the "Lao Lihua" trademark should also be exclusively used by him. Later, he saw that Dali Hang was also using this trademark, so he repeatedly submitted objections to the Trademark Bureau, but they were all rejected. The case was transferred by the police station to the District Procuratorate yesterday for handling according to law.

### Re-trial of the Road Bureau Corruption Case; Only Sun Xuesan Found Not Guilty

[Our Newspaper] The parts of the case involving Zhang Honggang and twelve others, in the corruption case of the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, were sent back for retrial. Judge Xie Zhiying of the District Court concluded the trial on the 18th. The verdict was announced at 10:00 a.m. yesterday: "Zhang Hongtu is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for five years for accepting bribes in the performance of his duties. Chen Jingyao, Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Xia Biwu, Xu Changgui, Li Jie, Cai Zhidao, and He Zu'en are each sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years for continuously accepting bribes in the performance of their duties. Sun Xuesan is found not guilty. The bribes obtained by Zhang Hongtu, 1,000,000 yuan; Chen Jingyao, 890,000 yuan; Zhu Biwen, 890,000 yuan; Zhang Kaiyuan, 290,000 yuan; Zhang Zelong, 1,220,000 yuan; Zhu Peizong, 890,000 yuan; Xia Biwu, 750,000 yuan; Xu Changgui, 600,000 yuan; Li Jie, 770,000 yuan; Cai Zhidao, 700,000 yuan; and He Zu'en, 600,000 yuan, are all confiscated." Cai Zhidao, who was originally released on bail, went to the District Court yesterday to report and hear the verdict and was taken into custody in court. When explaining the reasons for the verdict, Judge Xie specifically stated that Sun Xuesan's verdict was not guilty because Sun originally worked in the Audit Section and was later transferred to the Purchasing Section. He was not aware of the corrupt practices in advance. Although he also received a share of the bribes, his superiors only informed him that it was a subsidy, so he could not be held criminally liable. If the other defendants disagree with this verdict, they can still appeal.

### Middle School Graduation Examination Decided to Be Held as Scheduled

Director Cao of the Ministry of Education Delivers a Speech

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the Ministry of Education's order to various provinces and cities to restore the high school graduation examination, Cao Chou, director of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, stated in a speech: The middle school graduation examination is an excellent system. Since the Ministry of Education implemented it, it has been very effective. On the one hand, the examination can gradually improve the level of students. At the same time, all the examination papers are the most ideal reference materials for our educational research. In various courses, which ones should have their weight reduced, and which ones should have their focus shifted? We can produce a reasonable standard by statistically analyzing the results of candidates nationwide. As for the students' level, the Ministry is well aware that it has not made rapid progress due to the eight years of the War of Resistance. The examination questions set by various provinces and cities will not be excessively difficult. It is heard that schools, for the sake of their reputation, only allow students with better grades to participate in the examination. If this is true, the Ministry will urge relevant bureaus to correct it. Cao indicated that the Class A graduation examination this summer will be held as scheduled throughout the country.

### Middle School Art Curriculum; Maintaining the Original Number of Hours; Rumors of Abolition Were a Misunderstanding

Lu Fengzi and others attended the meeting, which was presided over by Cao Chou, Director of the Secondary Education Department.

### Let's See How the Hong Kong Xingdao Military Team Plays Seoul, North and South Football Stars to Meet at Yiyuan Today

The long-awaited Hong Kong Xingdao football team, due to weather conditions, repeatedly postponed its trip, and finally took off from Hong Kong on a China Airlines four-engine passenger plane at 3:45 PM yesterday. Except for team leader Hu Hao, who was unable to travel due to other commitments and will depart today, the rest of the 19-member team, led by Deputy Team Leader Shen Songfang, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 PM and landed at Jiangwan Airport. A telegram had been sent to Shanghai in advance, and because the Sports Association held a banquet at the Kangle Restaurant, to avoid back and forth trips, except for team secretary Ouyang Cheng who went to guide them, the rest waited at Kangle. After all the members got off the plane, they drove to the Jinmen Hotel to settle their luggage, and then went to Kangle for the banquet. In addition to the Xingdao and Seoul teams, the Donghua, Qingbai, Railway, Soviet, and Jewish teams, members of the Referee Association, officers of the Police Bureau of the Garrison Command, and sports reporters from various newspapers, totaling no less than 200 people, were present. The guests and hosts gathered happily and chatted until about 11:00 PM before dispersing.

After the Xingdao team arrived in Shanghai, the match against Seoul was scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM today at Yiyuan. Tickets were sold at the Municipal Stadium starting at 1:00 PM, with prices of 5,000 and 8,000 yuan. To avoid crowding, the three main gates of Yiyuan will be opened simultaneously.

The lineups of the Xingdao and Seoul teams for today's match were decided yesterday and are listed below:

Xingdao

Jin Yaode, Liu Tianshen, Hou Rongsheng, Song Lingsheng, Xu Jingcheng, Liu Songsheng, Cao Qiuting, Wen Zhi, Zhang Jinhai, Zhu Yongqiang, He Yingfen

(Reinforcements) Feng Kunsheng, Li Zhaorong, Liu Guangcai

Seoul

Che Chunzhong, Park Dachong, Park Gyujeong, Zhu Rongguang, Kim Gyuhwan, Min Byeongdae, Jeong Namshik, Jeong Gukjin, Kim Yongsik, Lim Changshik, Woo Jeonghwan

(Reinforcements) Ahn Gapsoo, Choi Seongkon, Min Byeongik

It is said that Xingdao goalkeeper Jin Yaode is famous in Hong Kong, and he will not fail his mission today. The two defenders Liu and Hou are both competent. The midfield line is even more talented, especially the left-footed king Xu Jingcheng, who is good at both offense and defense. The forwards Zou and He are skilled in dribbling, Zhu is young and strong, and fierce in attack. Zhang Jinhai leads and directs from the center forward position, and with the addition of Xiao Sanzi Cao Qiuting, it is like adding wings to a tiger. The lineup is exceptionally strong, and even though Seoul is fierce, it is difficult to be confident.

Seoul's consecutive battles in Shanghai can be described as excellent. Their fast-paced and intensive attack is enough to show their high level. They are becoming more and more brilliant in each battle, and even Donghua, the leader of the Shanghai League, has suffered at their hands. They have been preparing for several days for this battle against Xingdao, resting and recuperating, and have gained a great advantage by facing a team that has traveled far and is tired. However, Xingdao, which dominates the southern country, is not a weak team, so there will inevitably be many exciting and tense moments in this fierce battle.

### Jiao Tong University Forces a Tie with Seoul in a Friendly Match

The Seoul football team was originally scheduled to play against Xingdao at 5:00 PM yesterday, but because Xingdao failed to arrive on time, they changed to a practice match with Jiao Tong University. The match started at 3:30 PM, with Zhang Jianbing as the referee. In the first half, Seoul's offense was frequent, with more than 15 shots, but they were all saved by Jiao Tong University goalkeeper Qin Dingxin, and they gained nothing. Twenty minutes later, Jiao Tong University defender Xi Zuzhen committed a handball in the penalty area, and Woo Jeonghwan of Seoul took the penalty, but the ball bounced off Qin Dingxin's body. With five minutes remaining until the end of the half, Kim Yongsik, the center forward of Seoul, scored with a powerful shot, and Seoul took a 1-0 lead in the first half.

After changing sides, Li Yagu, the sports department advisor of Jiao Tong University, presented a banner to Seoul, which was accepted by Seoul coach Kim Yongsik. After the start of the second half, the ball still revolved in front of the Jiao Tong University goal. Qin Dingxin was very busy and overwhelmed. Jiao Tong University only sought to lose by a small margin, and the forwards all returned to defense to help defend. Seoul ultimately failed to score. In the 12th minute, Liu Longxin, the central defender of Jiao Tong University, got the ball and passed it quickly to the middle. Zheng Jingtong advanced quickly with the ball and passed it to the left wing. Wu An tricked Park Gyujeong and shot, hitting the net from the left corner, tying the score. After that, both sides had their own attacks and defenses. When the regulation time ended, Jiao Tong University forced a 1-1 tie with Seoul.

Seoul: Hong Deyong, Park Dachong, Park Gyujeong, Zhu Rongguang, Kim Gyuhwan, Min Byeongdae, Jeong Namshik, Jeong Gukjin, Kim Yongsik, Lim Changshik, Woo Jeonghwan

The Textile Control Committee's handling of permit matters could not be started immediately because the various procedures had not yet been completed, so the re-export of yarn and cloth has now disappeared.

### The Cloth Market: Overtly Slack but Covertly Tight

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw mostly spot goods being offered outside the trading floor. It was rumored that those who had completed customs procedures, such as the Guangdong and Hubei groups, had slightly increased their imports, so sellers seized the opportunity to hold firm, and the market tightened. Factories still strongly demanded plain fine cloth. Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 270,000 yuan, 20-count extra fine cloth at 220,000 yuan, and Zijin printed meta-gabardine increased from 223,000 yuan to 228,000 yuan. The limited amount of Jinjian Miaowu meta-gabardine supplied by the Textile Reconstruction Corporation the day before resulted in exceptionally high prices, reaching 230,000 yuan. Retail investors were actively buying, but towards closing, the price of yarn was said to have slightly declined, and some sold off their profits, causing the market to weaken.

### Woolen Fabric Prices Remain Firm and Outstanding

Yesterday, the market prices for woolen fabrics remained ostensibly and covertly firm and outstanding, and trading was also robust. Light-colored thin floral woolen fabrics remained popular. White canvas, hemp glue cloth, and Baifu woolen fabric used for making Hong Kong shirts saw considerable orders and transactions, with the Nanyang group continuing to load up. However, the price of Caishen brand Huada woolen fabric was uniquely flat and weak because its products were far inferior to the old stock. The new goods are thin and soft, so customers all wanted to find the old goods, but the old goods had long been out of stock, and only the new goods were circulating on the market, so their prices were not as firm as those of Xiexin and Hualun brands.

### Shaanxi Cotton Reserves Still Abundant

It is reported that this year, the amount of cotton purchased by the Textile Reconstruction Corporation in various regions has reached around 1.5 million dan. Prices have mostly risen sharply due to large-scale purchases, and recently have become even more severe, with market prices in various regions being higher than those in Shanghai, making it impossible for general cotton merchants to buy. Only in Xi'an, due to transportation difficulties, is the market price lower than in other regions, and reserves are also abundant, with a total amount estimated at over 1.5 million tons.

### Shanghai-Taiwan Remittance Limit Relaxed

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan, which handles remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan, originally had a limit of NT$100,000 per transaction, with a handling fee of 0.2%. Now, in order to facilitate commercial remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank has recently increased the limit to NT$1 million per transaction and reduced the handling fee to 0.05%.

### Foreign Trading Companies in China Registering in Hong Kong En Masse

[United Press, Hong Kong, 25th] In the past nine months, 225 foreign companies doing business in China have registered in Hong Kong. Their intention is to open a backdoor so that they can find a refuge if the economic situation in China becomes too chaotic. Most of them are well-known British and American companies that have been engaged in legitimate business in China for many years. The scope of registration is extremely broad, including various types of trading companies, all of which are related to the development of Shanghai and other Chinese commercial ports. The list is as follows: Moutai Trading Company, Jardine Matheson, Dunlop, Rubber Company, Shanghai Water and Electricity Company, Gengxing Trading Company, Jardine Matheson Textile Mill, Shanghai Gonghexiang Wharf Company, Tianjin Real Estate Co., Ltd. (transliteration), Yeguang Real Estate Co., Ltd., American International Insurance Company (transliteration), Shanghai Loan and Investment Company (translated name), Anli Trading Company, Licha Hotel, Huamao Hotel, Victoria Hotel (transliteration), Sava Khan Hotel (transliteration), Shenyang General Assembly, Hankou Racecourse General Electricity, Hongqiao Ball Game General Assembly, Shanghai General Zeng, Hankou General Assembly, Xieqiao General Assembly, Shanghai Qu Ball General Assembly, Baja Company, Qimo United Rubber Company (transliteration), Rubber Trust Company, Malai Rubber Company, Shanghai Jiading Rubber Company (transliteration), Dumin Rubber Company (translated from the past), Pada Rubber Company, Aina Taihua Rubber Company, North China Daily News, Central China Daily News (Hankou).

### Shanghai Industrial Association Held Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Allocation of Import Quotas for Raw Materials

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association, for the purposes of (1) discussing the request to transfer the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for industrial raw material imports from the Provisional Management Committee to industrial groups, (2) jointly studying economic reform plans and formulating specific measures to be submitted to the government for implementation, and (3) reporting on the process of requesting the government to establish an industrial association law, convened a symposium of representatives from various industrial trade associations yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Mei Hua Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road. Over 120 people attended, including Lin Jiyong, Wu Yunfu, and Tian Heqing. Ouyang Lun, Director of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Commissioner Chen Taosheng were also invited to attend. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunfu, Chairman of the Association. First, Director Ouyang reported on the placement of 53 demobilized officers and soldiers into 53 factories in the city. Then, member Tao Guilin reported on the process of requesting the government to establish an industrial association law, stating that the organization of industrial associations has its own characteristics and difficulties and cannot be subordinated to commercial associations. In order to achieve China's industrialization, the organization of industrial associations must be sound. Subsequently, Mr. Lin Jiyong reported on the organization of the wartime Sichuan Factory Federation, which assisted factories in solving difficulties, allowing them to focus on production work. At present, after the recovery of industry, there is even more need for such an industrial association organization. Then, discussions began on the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for industrial raw material imports. The following key points were passed: (1) The allocation of import quotas should first be submitted to various industrial trade associations to negotiate principles and values, and the original review should be jointly determined by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Industrial Association's review committee. (2) Essential industrial raw materials, accessories, materials, and production equipment that cannot be manufactured domestically should be imported as much as possible according to the actual needs of each industry in order to reduce production costs and lower prices. At the same time, the government should actively encourage the raw material industry in order to achieve self-sufficiency. (3) Finished products (except for necessities and those that cannot be manufactured domestically) should be absolutely restricted in order to protect national industry. (4) The required value of the second phase of import quotas is approximately US$68,114,000 (attached table omitted). (5) Raw materials for which payment was made before February 17 will be allowed to be imported outside the quota. These points will be submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Supreme Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Provisional Import Management Committee for consideration. It was also resolved to (1) telegraph the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Affairs to promulgate an industrial association law as soon as possible, (2) have each of the city's 60-plus industrial groups send one representative, accompanied by Wu Yunfu, Chairman of the Association, to petition the Provisional Import Management Committee this morning, (3) organize a petition group to petition in Beijing on a regular basis, (4) have each industrial association appoint a representative to regularly contact and study industrial production issues, etc., (5) have each industrial association quickly and accurately fill out and submit to the association a table detailing the amount and value of raw materials and products needed by the industry, and (6) solicit opinions from each industrial association on the industrial program departments announced by the Third Plenary Session and submit them to the Industrial Association in writing. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.

### The Edge of the Lüda Region

— Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

Shenyang, 19th (Airmail)

The Liaodong Peninsula is filled with the beautiful scenery of spring, making people coming from the north feel an infinite vitality here. However, it has played out many "historical tragedies" in the past. Today, the smoke and rain of bullets are still resounding and permeating here, and the national economy and people's livelihood are facing a desperate situation.

Most of the historical tragedies are international in nature. Eighty-seven years ago, when the British and French allied forces invaded, the British fleet once occupied it, and the name "Victoria Bay" was a sensation at the time.

During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan occupied Lüda and the Far East Peninsula. Forty-nine years ago, the Russians used their strength to lease Lüda. Forty-three years ago, Japan defeated Russia, and Lüda and the Liaodong Peninsula were once again invaded by the Japanese. The Japanese carried out more than 40 years of rule and exploitation. The old people living inside have passed away, and the young people hardly know their motherland.

Under Soviet Military Control; Cut Off from the Motherland

Two years ago, World War II ended, and the Northeast was restored. Lüda and the Liaodong Peninsula were once again cut off from the motherland under the control of the Soviet military. At the same time, the Communist army further covered this place with a layer of encirclement, causing this area to disintegrate and become even more confusing.

At present, the people of the country and people around the world are expecting that China and the Soviet Union will respect the spirit of the friendship treaty, seek a reasonable solution to unreasonable places, so that China can restore its regime, and people around the world can come and go freely. Only then will the future have vitality and be able to shine brightly.

Outside the Gate of the Alert Line; Communist Military Works in Sight

Since last year, Pulandian has become a world-famous town. It stands on the edge of the Lüda region, that is, outside the gate of the alert line of the Lushun naval base stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty.

From Pulandian to Shihe, there is a distance of 25 li from north to south, and the length from the east coast to the west coast is no more than 100 li. In this narrow area, about 100 li long and more than 20 li wide, the Communist army is active.

Walking to a small hill called "Nanshan" on the south side of Pulandian, or to "Taishan" on the north side, and looking far away, the green waters of "Yaha Bay" come into view. The "military works" made by the Communist army on the nearby mountain peaks in the southeast are clearly visible.

The Soviet military's hilltop fortress on the distant high mountains in the southwest is clearly visible. Behind that mountain foot is the famous Shihe. In addition to the Soviet army, there is also a so-called "local security team" wearing blue uniforms at the Shihe Station.

Top Generals on the First Line of China and the Soviet Union Meet Twice

When the reporter was looking out on Nanshan, Soviet planes flew over Shihe in the southwest, circled the bay, and flew back south. Nearby mountain peaks still often sounded with several rapid gunshots, or two or three rumbling artillery sounds.

The two meetings between the top generals on the first line of China and the Soviet Union in Pulandian have once again attracted the attention of many people. There may be a few more in the near future, and the location may be Shihe, where the Soviet military is stationed.

It is said that during the second meeting, our side expressed to Soviet General Charlesky that they planned to make a return visit to Shihe or Jin County. Charlesky said, "You are very welcome, but you must ask for instructions before replying. However, we cannot guarantee your safety, because we were shot at by unknown troops on the way here."

Batches of Refugees Come to Shenyang from Pulandian

The National Army and the Communist Army are confronting each other, and the Soviet army is watching from the side. Batches of refugees fleeing from Dalian, Jinzhou, and Dengshahe passed through this area and ran to Pulandian, and then went north to Shenyang.

The reporter stood at the south entrance of Pulandian and saw refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, coming north. After strict inspection by the National Army and police at the checkpoint, they walked to the reception station.

When asked why they fled, the answer was: "There is no business to do, and we can't exchange it for food, so we have no choice but to flee." They took the "family visit" passes issued by local agencies and took the train to Jinzhou.

Encountering Scattered Soviet Troops; Must Pay "Toll Money"

Refugees described the situation of fleeing as follows: After passing Jinzhou, they had to walk. When encountering scattered Soviet troops, they often had to spend some "toll money." Shihe is an obstacle. They had to set off in the middle of the night, climb mountains and ridges, bypass Shihe, grope and walk, and run in fear. After dawn, they could walk to Wulitai.

"Wulitai" is stationed with Communist troops who inspect and collect taxes before letting them pass. Because they are considered to be goods, they have to collect a tax, otherwise they are not allowed to continue north. After passing "Changdianpu," which is 15 li away from Pulandian, is "Widow Bridge."

Widow Bridge; No Man's Land; Outside Shihe; Strange Wooden Sign

"Widow Bridge" is a so-called no man's land between the National Army and the Communist Army, five or six li south of Pulandian. There are peddlers who specialize in exchanging money, and the exchange rate is 120 Red Army tickets for 100 circulating coupons. The narrow area between Pulandian and Shihe is a complex world. Not long ago, a strange wooden sign with the words "Soviet-Manchukuo Border" was erected on the northern outskirts of Shihe. It is said that the words have now been painted over.

Strive for a Complete Solution; Never Accept Piecemeal

On April 6, the top generals on the first line of China and the Soviet Union met. Because it coincided with the time when the Chinese and Soviet governments issued announcements on the Lüda issue, it aroused the attention of the world. It was learned afterward that the Soviet side was trying to gauge our side's attitude, and was also there to respond to our side's previous proposal to take over "Kongzi Store." The Soviet side stated that only a small number of Soviet troops are stationed in Wazi Store to protect the water source of Lüda. If we can guarantee that the water source will not be damaged, they are very willing to hand it over. In order to seek a complete solution to the entire Lüda issue, we are unwilling to accept it piecemeal.

Wazi Store is in the narrow area between Pulandian and Shihe. It is about 30 li southeast from Pulandian. This is a water source of Lüda.

National Army Outpost; Telephone Often Out of Order

"Tangjiafang," 10 li north of Wazi Store, is stationed with the National Army. That is our National Army's more prominent area. Our liaison with the Soviet army relies on this place.

This distance of more than 10 li is connected by a telephone line set up by China and the Soviet Union to communicate news. When the Soviet side has something to do, they shake the phone over. When we have something to do, the phone is out of order. We must take the liaison symbol to contact them, and we must have armed brothers to protect us, because there are Communist army shootings along the way.

Whether the phone is connected or not depends on the Soviet army. Because the Soviet army only connects the wires when they have something to do, and then disconnects them after they are done, how can we shake it through?

Soviet Army Welcomes Reporters; Not Responsible for Safety

The reporter and reporters from Dagong, Xinwen, Yishi, and Shenchang's "Zhongsu" and "Heping" newspapers, a total of six newspapers, planned to visit Lüda Jinzhou. The letter addressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Lushun was forwarded from here. Unfortunately, we received the reply "You are welcome to come, but the Soviet army is not responsible for safety," rejecting us from entering.

The tentacles of the Liaodong Peninsula, everything is confusing. Outside the gateway to the Lüda area, war is burning. Everyone is praying: "Let the war be extinguished, let the tentacles be revived and clear, otherwise it will be unmanageable."

Reporters from various newspapers who planned to visit Lüda took a group photo with Pan Zhe, the Magistrate of Jin County, and the person in charge of the National Army in Pulandian (the third person from the left with his hat off is reporter Han Qingtao from this newspaper, and the third person from the right is Magistrate Pan) (Photo by Xu Jilian, Special Correspondent in Kunming for this newspaper)

### Three Robberies in Kunming

— Special Correspondent, Xu Jilian

Kunming, 19th (Airmail)

Kunming has finally been quiet for a long period of time. Whether in terms of life or social order, there is a relatively stable force supporting it. Of course, prices are still climbing, but this commercial city rarely sees big storms.

So, after climbing through the winter, we saw the spring scenery again, and then summer came. However, under the circumstances of "no cold or heat in the four seasons, and a rain turns into winter," people rarely pay attention to the changes in the seasons, and it is almost impossible to detect the changes in the weather. Who has the time to pay attention to these things that are not worth discussing? Therefore, everything is proceeding according to a certain procedure, without storms, without changes. The weather is like this, and things outside the weather are also like this.

Bus Hijacked at Hot Springs; Passengers Left with Only Shirts and Pants

However, a series of terrifying events suddenly occurred in the usually tranquil city, which often disrupted social order. No more than robbery, theft, arson, and murder. In the past ten days, Kunming has unexpectedly had all of these unsettling phenomena occur, and they have been presented in a swift sequence, adding a lot of unexpected panic to the residents who have always been accustomed to a comfortable life.

The Anning Hot Springs near Kunming City are well-known. Resting, sightseeing, and taking mineral baths, the hot springs are the most suitable places. On this short highway of more than 30 kilometers, large trucks and small cars travel back and forth every day. Who would worry about the safety of travelers? However, on the 13th, someone just happened to fancy the large bus of the Anning Hot Springs Hotel, blocked the road and carried out a robbery, fired shots into the sky, and showed their power with a fierce momentum. Five bandits showed off their might to the passengers, and thoroughly carried out a "target practice." The passengers were really miserable, only left with shorts and undershirts to return to the city. The bandits left without knowing where they went.

Shocking Robbery; Showing Their Skills in the Middle of the Night

The authorities are paying attention to the whereabouts of these bandits who are openly carrying weapons and acting boldly, but they did not expect that other bandits would dare to show their skills in the downtown area. At 4:00 AM on the night of April 17, when everyone was sound asleep, an unprecedented shocking robbery occurred at the residence of Lu Jingqing at No. 2 Xiandian Lane, Zhengyi Road! (Lu Jingqing is the third younger brother of Lu Han, Chairman of Yunnan Province.)

It is really a bit unbelievable. After the incident, before the detective team had arrived to investigate, the reporter rushed to Lu's residence. At that time, Mrs. Lu was still in shock. She described the process of being robbed, which was almost like a story from "The Marvelous Adventures of Knights-Errant." She said: "On the night of the 17th, the weather was dark and gloomy. When I was drowsily falling asleep, the bandits somehow came to the bedside. The semi-Western-style suite had two spring-locked doors, but they managed to open them without anyone noticing, and called people up from the bed. And they didn't wear masks or disguise themselves. They were all middle-aged men with tall figures and clean faces, wearing neat gray suits, just like regular customers of many years. Even the three alert German Shepherds that are usually raised were quiet and silent. He taught Mrs. Lu to take off the ornaments on her body, hand over the self-defense pistol, and not allow her to speak, otherwise he would not be lenient under the gun."

Bandits Rob Gold and Cash; Forcing Mrs. Lu to Hand Over

Everything went smoothly. The strangest thing is that the bandit completely knew the amount of gold and cash hidden in Lu's residence. He was able to teach Mrs. Lu to take them out one by one. He robbed 10,000 US dollars, 100 taels of gold, 60 taels of leaf gold, 700 Vietnamese dollars, and dozens of pieces of jewelry, with a total value that was very considerable.

After the bandits succeeded, they locked the door from the outside. They stepped on the roof in one step, as light as a swallow. By the time the Lu family notified the Fifth Branch by telephone, the bandits had already disappeared. The case is quite complex, and even the detective team felt very棘手. The bandits had said during the robbery: "I personally do not need these things. I am a ×× party, and these gold and cash are used to help people." The identity of the bandit cannot be determined, so we can only investigate in order to solve the case as soon as possible.

South Screen Theater; Threats and Bombs Arrive Together

A wonderful thing happened immediately. On the evening of the 18th, an explosion suddenly occurred at Nanping, a large theater in Kunming City. It was just when the 8:00 PM show was being screened. With a loud bang, the order was disrupted for a while, and the seats flew. Among them, the MN row of seats was destroyed, and there were as many as ten serious injuries to the audience. After the incident, visitors came in an endless stream. There was a shaped earthen pit at the scene of the incident. According to the injured, before the incident, a soldier was sitting on the edge, suddenly bent over to pick up something, and then left the theater. In an instant, a tragic explosion occurred. The reporter also interviewed the person in charge of the theater. It is said that a middle-aged man wearing a white raincoat came to the theater's ticket office in the afternoon and submitted a letter. After opening it, it was found to be an anonymous threatening letter, saying that from now on, within a week, he was to place 10 million national currency on seat number 10 in row S, otherwise there would be an explosion, etc. The theater immediately notified the police station, and the police station also sent plainclothes detectives to wait, but unexpectedly, an explosion occurred that day, which was really somewhat caught off guard.

Deadline to Solve the Case; Reward of 10 Million

It is of course quite enough to pay attention to the terror incidents that have occurred without head or tail, and it is said that the Da Guangming and Kunqiao theaters have also received the same threatening letters. The air in the mountain city is a bit turbulent. In recent days, the police station has been intensifying its secret visits, and Governor Lu of the province has also ordered that the case be solved within a time limit, with a reward of 10 million yuan per case. This trend must not be allowed to grow, because this small mountain city needs a stable force.

Early summer brought new terror to the mountain city, but I hope this is just a slight summer breeze, and we will return to the peace of the past in the future.

### 南山屐痕

— By Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou, 19th.

Spring is deep. Mr. Pan Gongzhan and his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, have come to Hangzhou from Linghu. Ms. Tang is a female painter specializing in landscapes, flowers, and birds. We visited Lingyin Temple and boated on the lake, where we saw that many of the naturally lush green colors were punctuated by clusters of eye-searing crimson paint on the buildings. Ms. Tang couldn't help but sigh, and I also found it too vulgar. If this crimson color were to increase further, the entire gentle and beautiful lake and mountains would be diminished. I remembered a new writer, "Anonymous," talking to me about the beauty of West Lake. He said, "So far, the natural beauty of West Lake still surpasses the artificial carving. If West Lake is said to have a unique ingenuity and added artificial cultivation, then these magnificent golden houses towering on Gushan Mountain, as well as the neither Eastern nor Western style exhibition memorial tower in the lake, and the buildings erected freely by private enthusiasts that destroy the atmosphere, and those buildings painted blood-red, none of them show 'a point' that has been carefully designed to make West Lake more beautiful." Indeed, both garden cities and cultural cities require many elegant artists to design and plan them.

The two Mr. and Mrs. Pan and the reporter drove to Hupao Temple the next day. Ms. Tang loves to taste tea. The tea sellers in Hupao Temple brought several packages of tea. The best Mingqian Longjing sold for 90,000 yuan per catty, the second grade for 80,000 yuan per catty, and the best kind, called wild tea, for 190,000 yuan per catty. The tea sellers brewed several kinds of tea for us to taste. Wild tea is not a tea tree grown in tea gardens and is exceptionally rare. Its color is bright and beautiful, and its taste is fragrant and mellow. Combined with the spring water of Hupao, which contains minerals, a full cup of water can be added with half a cup of water without overflowing. The price seems cheaper than in the Xinshichang area, where Mingqian tea in the tea shops sells for 120,000 yuan per catty.

Further ahead, we reached the Liuhe Pagoda. The pagoda is thirteen stories high. Mr. Pan and I climbed the pagoda, but we could only reach the seventh story. The monk told us, "The seventh story is already the top, as two stories are combined into one." We didn't believe it. Looking at the height of the pagoda from the temple gate, we saw people on the ninth story. So, we carefully examined it and found that it was indeed two stories combined into one, and one story was fake. From the top of the pagoda, you can overlook the Qiantang River Bridge and the "Z" shape of the Qiantang River. The famous academic institution, Zhijiang University, is also on the lower right side of the pagoda. Coming down from Liuhe Pagoda, we went to Jiuxi Shiba Jian (Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies). We found ourselves among the green hills on both sides, seeing the mountains covered with low tea trees, and many young girls bathed in the warm sunshine, picking fresh tea leaves with their hands and placing them in baskets.

Stepping over several plank bridges, the gurgling water under the bridge struck the rocks, creating a most pleasant music. We stepped over nine flat bridges in this way and arrived at Jiuxi Tea Plantation. Here, a large sunshade was built, where tea and wine dishes were sold. Many people rested here. In a gap that had been built, three characters "Wash Feet Here" were made on a porcelain enamel sign and hung in the gap. In addition, there were several washbasins, also with porcelain enamel signs that said "Wash Face Here." Seeing these two porcelain enamel signs, I deeply felt that the owner indeed had some refined atmosphere.

Crossing Jiuxi Tea Plantation, the Shiba Jian is nestled among the mountains. Each gully has a considerable distance, but a stream connects them. The water gurgles, clear enough to see the bottom, and many rocks below the water reveal their smooth and bright colors. People must step over the stones in the gullies. Some people who love water go barefoot and wade through the gullies. Originally, the trees on both sides were dense, and the bamboo forests were lush, but now they have been almost completely cut down, making it seem more desolate than before. If the people managing the scenery do not reorganize it, then after a long time, no one will come to play in these places.

Passing Shiba Jian, we reached Longjing Village. There are some trees there, and the village is built along the stream, clean and lovely. Every household has one or two tables, covered with clean tablecloths, with many glass cups inside containing tea leaves. A red paper is pasted on the door, saying, "This household sells genuine Mingqian Longjing." Arriving at Longjing Temple, there are still many trees. Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty stayed here twice when he came to Hangzhou. From here, you can overlook West Lake. There are some rockeries, and behind the mountains is a well. The abbot monk has used cement to build a semi-circular well railing with dwarf stones in the shape of clouds from the Qing Dynasty. There are small fish in the well. The monk told us that there are only twelve imperial tea trees on Longjing Lion Peak, and the others were planted later. The higher the tea trees are in the mountains, the better they are; the worse they are in the plains. There are not many tea trees in the high mountains, so they are more expensive. I asked him, "Why is this tea not exported?"

He said, "Too little tea is produced." I think foreigners drink tea heavily and like strong-tasting beverages. We Chinese like to "savor" it. So, this precious green tea can be sold in our country, perhaps because of the different traditional philosophies between foreign countries and China?

Coming out of Longjing Temple, we climbed Longjing Wengjia Mountain to Lion Peak. The scale of selling tea here is larger than in Longjing Village. "Weng Longsheng," "Weng Longsheng," and "Weng Longsheng × Ji" all appear here. Opposite "Weng Longsheng," there is an "Weng Clan Ancestral Hall," but there are only one or two spirit tablets inside. I asked the only clerk in the store why there were so few spirit tablets. He said, "If all were placed in the hall, there wouldn't be enough space, so they were gradually cremated." The tea seller used glass cups to brew tea, and the water had a smoky taste. Ms. Tang Guanyu criticized him for not knowing how to brew tea. The clerk was not tactful at all and did business with customers stiffly. We all said that he should be more tactful and flexible.

In the Longjing scenic area, we only see that Longjing Village has some beautiful meaning, while other places have not been reorganized.

Going downhill to Yanxia Cave, there are quite a few trees. The stone carvings inside the cave are very good, especially the two Guanshiyin statues in front of the cave gate, whose hands are carved very beautifully. But I don't know who has applied rouge and lipstick to these two stone Guanyin statues. Looking from the cave gate, the trees are lush, like a mist, remaining in the eyes. We also entered the side door, where there is a tea house. Further inside, there are several rooms, architecturally very elegant, and there are many poems by scholars, but unfortunately, they have not been reorganized and have been covered by dust. Before the war, this was the most famous place to eat vegetarian food, but now it seems desolate and dilapidated due to the sparse number of tourists. Going down the steps to Shuile Cave, the towering temple here has been destroyed. The abbot of this cave is currently in a lawsuit with the abbot of Jingci Temple. The abbot of the cave said that the abbot of Jingci Temple drove him away and also said that the abbot of Jingci Temple is a traitorous monk. This cave has been artificially carved, but because they have no one to guide them, they still use some stone chimes and stone drums as a selling point, and the newly added things are very mediocre!

Going around through Manjuelong, when osmanthus is in full bloom, there is a lively scene here, but what we saw were dilapidated houses, and osmanthus branches mixed in the weeds. Arriving at Shiwu Cave, a new great hall is being built there. The small Bodhisattvas in the cave are soliciting donations to be gilded, and many Bodhisattvas have been gilded, making them "golden and brilliant."

During our short trip to Nanshan, the three of us had the same feeling. First, many famous historical sites are beginning to become desolate, and many people managing famous historical sites only pay attention to some convenient places in front of them. Second, tourists no longer have the refined interest of people in the past, climbing mountains and crossing rivers to explore the scenic spots. From this, we can see that people today are in a hurry and cannot transcend these worldly thoughts. These worldly thoughts germinate in the heart and easily turn into utilitarianism, and utilitarianism leads to strife. We people in the scenic area, especially those managing the scenery, should find ways to guide them to more remote and more elegant places to play. Perhaps the effort of stealing a few days of leisure can also eliminate some worldly thoughts.

Spring and Autumn

### Tarkington's Posthumous Work

— Zhao Yingshen

I mentioned in this publication that the American novelist Booth Tarkington had passed away. Now his posthumous work, "Show Piece," has been published.

Posthumous works are often very interesting, sometimes even unfinished drafts. This "Show Piece" is also an unfinished draft. The development of initial ideas, the refinement of structure, and the authenticity of characters cannot be achieved successfully until the story is completed. We can only get an empty skeleton of a concluding term for "Show Piece." Since the novel has not been completed, we have to be satisfied with the author's footnotes, in which he talks about how things should proceed. I believe that if he had the time, he would have revised his work well.

The so-called showpiece is Mr. Irvie Pease, whom he uses as the first-person narrator to write about. We put Pease in an antique shop, a glass case, or perhaps more appropriately, he lives in the Midwest in the summer, but usually studies in the sacred forest of Princeton. He is the only selfish person who doesn't like humor. He is applauded and praised by his doting parents and friends, so he lives in a false frenzy of success. He once wrote a play that won the praise of the locals and the love of the most esteemed woman. At this time, he had already graduated from university.

He was able to deceive everyone into praising him entirely thanks to his cousin Dan Pu, his neighbor Emma, and his loyal servant. The best scene in the play was written by Liu Pu. Emma, this poor soul, sailed a boat through the storm and saved Pease and his daughter Mary. Emma lied that she was a hero. Later, this lie was exposed by Mary, who married someone else.

This is a melancholy book, as if Tarkington has no strength to cross this century. If this book had been published earlier, it might have been a more praiseworthy and beloved work.

Shakespeare lived during England's Dark Ages, when the general nobility of England was immersed in the ascetic ideas of religion, and the people were mostly stagnant and uninspired, with very low levels of knowledge.

Later, England accepted foreign art, especially the brilliant literature of Spain, and the influence of the European Renaissance, which promoted the rise of English literature. In this way, the Elizabethan era became an indelible page in the history of English literature.

Shakespeare was the most important member of this era. His creations are full of optimism and have many aristocratic elements.

His knowledge is very broad. He is an excellent and prolific writer, and each work has his immortal value; he is a world literary master unprecedented and unparalleled.

Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564. He was the son of a farmer, and his family was very poor. He did not receive a good education. He only studied Latin for a few years in elementary school. He worked as a peddler and a lawyer's clerk. At the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years older than him.

For ten years, his life was very difficult, and he was even falsely accused of stealing and fled to London.

Although life tormented the young Shakespeare, often leaving him hungry and without a good night's sleep, he never gave up his pursuit of knowledge. By 1592, he had jumped from manual labor to being an actor in the theater.

Because of his talent and the result of his constant efforts, his acting was welcomed by most people. At this time, he was not only a famous actor but also appeared in society as a playwright.

In his twenty-four-year writing career, his achievements were astonishing. Great writers of the same era, such as Dante, Boccaccio, and Cervantes, did not catch up with him. The artistic achievement of his works can be said to have reached its peak.

His creations are based on reality and history and have a very touching power. He uses various interweavings to naturally infiltrate the darkness, joy, sorrow, hatred, beauty, and ugliness of society into his works with humorous, beautiful, exquisite, and various other methods. He is not only a master of drama, but his poems also have a unique style. In "Sonnets" and "Venus and Adonis," he uses a vivid style to depict beautiful and charming chapters. Therefore, European and American critics generally say that the beauty and immortal value of Shakespeare's works are the essence of the European Renaissance and the epitome of European literature.

On a day the same as his birth, Shakespeare died at the age of fifty-two in 1616, ending his brilliant life.

Now, both the date of his birth and death are more than three hundred years ago, but the masterpieces he left behind still radiate a different brilliance. The publication and translation of his posthumous works have spread to every corner of the world, with virtually no national or ethnic restrictions, and everyone regards them as the Bible.

Now, in Europe and the United States, exploring Shakespearean studies and researching Shakespearean studies have attracted the attention of general writers and scholars. Shakespeare societies have been established one after another and regularly publish various collections of research or reports on Shakespeare's literary legacy.

### Casual Jottings in the Mountains

— Luo Ming

Spring Rain

Spring has come to the mountain country again.

Although spring has not brought a warmth, the spring rain is continuous.

Ever since that cold winter day, I have been longing for a warm spring. I would gently hum the song of spring or ask the branches of the trees about the whereabouts of spring. I even calculated the series of frozen days. I was happy, and I believed that spring could give my life health and hope. I believed that spring was like a dignified and moving poem. There, I could hear the nobility and beauty of my youth.

Otherwise, I thought, how could I firmly believe that spring is ours?

Indeed, the seasons are so faithful to the world. Now that the season covered by ice and snow has passed, spring has arrived so happily. Although, he is so melancholy, like a shy girl, spending a long series of days in melancholy. Although, he is so undulating, like an ancient zither, playing some slight hopes and languid affection. Perhaps it's like opening the chilly windows of life.

However, spring is still spring after all...

Every day, I pursue the spring I have lost, and I sit in front of the window with a desolate mood and a hope. Here, a mountain stubbornly blocks my view. I cannot look very far and can only look at a row of pine trees by the mountain road and a patch of green seedlings on the terraces, or a cluster of towering mountains. Occasionally, I can see the gray sky, with white clouds sailing by, or a mountain mist falling heavily between the mountains. ——I am quiet, suppressing the beating of my heart.

Although I also wanted to go out of this gray house to visit the sprouting green grassland or a plane tree stretching out its arms helplessly. However, the sky is so happily raining continuously.

I have not forgotten that during this period, I lived without rain boots, so I want to comfort myself and the pedestrians in the wind and rain:

"Let the spring rain fall endlessly. When the spring flowers are not all in bloom, why must we chase the soft sunshine?"

Stream

The stream always flows so happily and loudly. Spring water is full of the four lakes. Today, it sings even more eagerly. Merging the trickling streams to become a water stream, this is a great natural project.

In winter, the stream bed exposed its chest, and the stream dried up and merged into a gurgling spring. At that time, I was like an old man with years to recall, sitting heavily in the bridge pavilion across the stream. I heard the stream flowing weakly in the wide stream bed, feeling a sense of loneliness. Now, in the spring, I sit on the bridge pavilion again, but I am encouraged by the full stream. I can see through the past and imagine the future, feeling that the stronger life is, the more powerful it is.

Continuous rain for days, a stream full of spring water. The lonely activities of the past have turned into angry torrents, and the melancholy singing of the past has also become today's joyful cheers of hope.

Every day, I walk by the stream with a hope. I feel encouraged and inspired, and I understand a sentence even more:

"Not only should there be loud words, but there should also be precise knowledge."

The stream seems to understand that after hope is shattered, it is not over by abandoning and driving it away. In addition to the continuation of days, life also has the efforts to survive to enrich it.

### Studio

— Seurat

Seurat (Georges Seurat 1859-1891) was originally a painter of the Paris Impressionist school. Seeing that Monet sometimes used pointillism to depict his works, the effect was very good, so he went on to specialize in the study of pointillism. He coincided with several people such as Signac without forming an organization. In 1886, he appeared in the Impressionist exhibition with a new look. At that time, he won social acclaim, and critics called him the "Neo-Impressionist" and "Pointillist" schools. Its characteristic is that no line or flatly painted color can be found on the entire painting. Everything is expressed in dots. The style is novel and delicate, and the forms of light and dark are particularly exquisite. The color changes are endless, and the qualities are all performed appropriately. Unfortunately, he did not live long—only lived for thirty-two years, and left few posthumous works. (Lion)

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 405

— Ye Jingfeng

"Yes," Tsurumi couldn't help but interject, "I'm puzzled, there are so many Chinese people, and their brains are much smarter than the Japanese. Why don't they want to meet the times and do it?..."

"How can you say they don't want to? ...Take these twenty or so people in our dilapidated village as an example. Isn't there a plan to prepare to go this way? In addition, there are many large and small groups. Aren't they also preparing to do it? Our government, although it is a little corrupt, is there really no one with a clear mind who is working hard in this aspect? ...But look at Japan, since annexing Korea, has it been willing to let China take a good breath? Facing the limit, the government has just swept the front of its feet clean and is preparing to start..."

"Yes, I understand. Inside and out, in short, to sum it up, they just don't want China to get better! ...Yes, Big Brother, this time I want to get that 'Seven Sealed Secrets' to expose it. The ultimate goal is also to eliminate this war. Then, China will have a chance to breathe. The government is now aware of it, and the Chinese people can develop freely; isn't it?"

"We'll see!" Shou swallowed the words below, he didn't want to dilute Tsurumi's interest.

These two young people, reunited in such a strange chance encounter, had conversations of this nature; this question led to that question, this sentence led to that sentence, and it could be said that they couldn't finish it in three days and three nights. Fortunately, just when they were talking with great interest, the phone rang.

The phone call was from the Korean leader that Tsurumi had just met: he sent a subordinate to deliver a message to Tsurumi regarding the whereabouts of Pingzi—because the person sent had not met Tsurumi, for safety's sake, the old man called first to inform him:

"A total of fifty taels of chemical raw materials have just been analyzed, and the place of origin and the type of raw materials have been found. I am now sending someone to deliver them. Although this guy is young, he is an expert. Please take a few minutes to meet him."

"Fifty" is a coded word that Tsurumi and the old man had agreed upon, "five minutes past ten," indicating the exact time of the phone call. "Raw materials" refers to the issue of Pingzi's disappearance; "place of origin" refers to the other party's background; "type" refers to the nature of the disappearance, etc. The old man was originally a medical professional, so he used local scenery to deliver the message; outsiders would not be able to suspect it.

Just as the subordinate sent by the old man arrived, Zheng Yan also brought a person with him. This person was the one who went to the Banzai Hall to speak Japanese to Tsurumi.

"Captain," Zheng Yan saluted Tsurumi in a standard manner, with a look of joy on his face, "this is a local friend who received a telegram from Peiping and specially found the captain's lodging place..."

"Very good," Tsurumi replied to Zheng Yan and immediately greeted the newcomer, stepping forward to shake hands.

"Shanghai Special Character No. 2, Li Ming, received a telegram from the Peiping General Captain at 10:00 AM. The department specially sent me to meet you. I went there once at 12:00 PM and just missed you. I went again at 2:00 PM..." He spoke fluent Japanese. This was influenced by Zheng Yan speaking Japanese.

"Sorry for not meeting you sooner, sorry for not meeting you sooner." Tsurumi introduced everyone briefly and asked them to take a seat.

### Sending Two Poems from Afar

— Zhongyuan

Azure Sky

Ten years ago, there was a period when I was madly in love with the azure sky.

I loved to lean alone at the window at dusk, listening to the breeze cutting through the silent expanse, letting the night dew sprinkle on the crimson windowsill. I gazed at the sky with bewildered eyes. I admired the stars, the moon, the white clouds, the light mist; but what made me sigh and yearn for was the touch of azure sky behind those things.

I said: "The moon is the elder sister, the stars are the younger sisters, and the drifting white clouds and hazy light mist are naughty little maids. Only that touch of azure sky is a kind mother full of true love and warmth!"

So I frantically searched for the azure sky everywhere.

I walked from the spring pond to the summer night garden. I embraced the red maple in late autumn and welcomed the white snow in cold winter. I was tired, lying by the desolate river. I was hungry, picking bitter fruits to fill my stomach. But alas! I just buried the long years in hopeless sighs.

Did I cry bitterly? Who did I hate? Was it the violent wind, heavy rain, and thunder; or was it the dense dark clouds that blocked the azure sky I was searching for?

I dare not dream of miracles appearing, dare not! I have long since dared not!

But today, let me tell you—

I finally smiled! Because outside my window, a miracle, a beautiful and shining azure sky!

Today, I want to write poems, for you—azure sky!

Forget-Me-Not

Do you remember? Not long ago, in front of a quiet lawn in the park, I pointed to a clump of small blue wildflowers on the ground and told you: "The name of these little flowers is—Forget-Me-Not!"

You smiled, turned your head and stared at me, without saying a word.

I couldn't guess what you meant, so I told you this little story again:

I said that once upon a time, a beautiful girl brought her young lover to the beach. On the sloping hillside by the sea, many small blue wildflowers were blooming. The girl asked her lover to pick those wildflowers. The lover stepped down the slope, picked a bunch of small flowers, and was about to return to the shore when suddenly the sea surged. He slipped and fell down the slope, and was swept into the bottomless sea by the terrible waves. So this unfortunate girl regretted and wailed. This poor lover and these blue wildflowers are remembered by people forever, and they are given the name "Forget-Me-Not."…

You were still smiling, still staring at me, without saying a word.

I suddenly became humble, leaning on you, trembling slightly.

"Is it too boring?" I thought.

But you finally opened your mouth, and you said, "This story is good."--

Do you remember? You said this once, with a gentle voice.

### Music Delegation in Dihua

— Ni Qiuping

In Shanghai, where popular songs are prevalent, it seems that little attention is paid to formal music. But on the other hand, there are also many people promoting it. Like the National Conservatory of Music in this city, which will add a junior class from the next semester to train talents in various musical instruments. The Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra is also actively preparing for public performances. The Chinese Music Delegation, sponsored by the Shanghai Music Association (an organization of musicians in this city), has been particularly active recently. Their representatives have visited Taiwan, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places one after another. Recently, they accompanied General Zhang Zhizhong, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, to Dihua, where they performed more than ten times at music concerts organized by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association. Those who went were Ma Enhong (violin), Wu Leyi (piano), Huang Yuanyin (tenor), Chen Liqing (soprano), Ma Sisun (piano), and manager Yu Xinzhu. They received a warm welcome from the local people.

Ma Enhong's violin has a great reputation in the Chinese music scene. He has been proficient in difficult musical pieces since he was a child. He has not reduced his ambition because people call him a child prodigy or a genius. He is still constantly working hard. This kind of talent and effort is really worthy of our praise.

Wu Leyi's piano is one of the most outstanding Chinese pianists. She has performed in symphony orchestras many times before and has been well received by Chinese and foreigners.

Huang Yuanyin and Chen Liqing's singing also have extremely high achievements. Miss Ma Sisun accompanied her brother (Ma Enhong) to play the accompaniment.

People from all walks of life in Dihua welcomed them so much that they specially launched a grand music and dance party for the music delegation when they were about to leave. It was composed of cultural groups of various ethnic groups, with various dances and music. It was performed outdoors in a Peace Square, with more than 30,000 listeners. People from the Uighur, Kazakh, Tatar, and other ethnic groups were all present. After this performance, the music delegation returned to Shanghai a week ago. They are preparing to wait for Miss Zhou Xiaoyan (singer), who is in France, to arrive in Shanghai, and then go to the United States together for a visit.

In the budding era of Chinese music, this music delegation is enough to make us excited. I hope they will bring back some good reference materials when they go abroad.

### Especially Many

— Henyue

Where it is written that it is not allowed to urinate, there are "especially many" people who urinate.

On the walls where it is written that no posters are allowed, there are "especially many" posters.

Among the personnel responsible for maintaining order, there are "especially many" people who do not obey order.

### Guarantee of Life

— Qilou

Recently, two old gentlemen passed away, one a political figure and the other a cultural figure. Their life experiences were different, but they had one thing in common, that is, the news of their death always had a postscript at the end, saying that they were desolate after their death.

The degree of desolation after death may not be the same, but its connotation always means that they did not leave much inheritance, which was not enough to support their wives or educate their children.

In addition to wanting to contribute to the crowd, people always have to take care of their own lives, the lives of their families, and the future lives of themselves and their wives and children. The so-called taking care of the future means having foresight. So, are those who are desolate after their death people without foresight? Not necessarily. Here, it is really necessary to quote an ancient saying: It is not that there is no foresight, but it is unavoidable. This means that in our society, life lacks security. Our nation has always lived on the edge of poverty, and only a few people can have some savings on weekdays to achieve the point of "saving for a rainy day." Most people can only practice "raising children to prevent old age," hoping to rely on their sons' labor to maintain their lives in their later years. If the children are not yet adults, or there are no children, or the children are not reliable, and the old man has already died, then it is inevitable that he will end up desolate after his death. This situation has always been the case before the war, and it is even more serious today after the war.

This desolation after death is the worry of most of us. In fact, not only after death, but even before death, we also have the worry of unemployment and disease. Once we are unemployed or sick, our family will have the same panic as desolation after death. This is called lack of security in life. In order to obtain this security, many people want to earn a sum of money that is far more than they can only maintain their current survival; if they cannot obtain it through legitimate means, they will take risks and do everything to embezzle and pervert the law, even to the point of becoming robbers and traitors, doing everything.

In wealthy countries (such as the United States), the common people often regard political freedom as higher than everything else, while in poor countries, the common people pay more attention to the security of life. It is generally said that poverty is the breeding ground for communism, which is this reason. After the war, Britain actively promoted the social insurance system, which is also this reason. So how will we seek this security of life for the masses?

### Words of a Rice Weevil

— Li Boshen

Rice, as long as the word rice is mentioned, a three-year-old child knows that there is a rice weevil, just like when a traitor is mentioned, everyone knows that there are Cao Cao and Qin Hui, so today the misfortune of the rice weevil can be imagined. But despite the people scolding him and cursing him, and the government severely cracking down and determined to suppress him, the rice weevil is still not discouraged, and still engages in the occupation of "one person benefits and ten thousand people suffer," which is too "shameless."

Every time the price of rice rises, the government comes out to suppress it. The result of rising and suppressing is always much higher than the original price. Especially today, when rice is considered to be leading the price increase, the government still cannot thoroughly suppress the price of rice, thus affecting other prices to rise without falling. I have a distant relative who is a genuine rice weevil. I really wanted to know some information about rice, so I took the time to ask him in detail. According to him:

"The rise and fall of the rice market is just like other businesses, which is common. Because the most basic condition in business, at present, should be the commodity balance rate. For example, the cost of a piece of cloth plus labor is equal to the selling price on the market, a book, a chair..., all have their balance rate. Rice weevils doing rice business also have this understanding. They take a stone of rice from the place of origin to Shanghai. The principle is to buy a stone of rice in the place of origin after it is sold. If this kind of handling can increase to more than one stone, then naturally it is the profit that all employees of the store rely on. Unlike a piece of cloth that is sold on the market, labor profit, etc. have been calculated in it; therefore, even if rice in Shanghai is bought for 100,000 per stone, or 50,000 per stone, they are willing to do so as long as they sell the rice in Shanghai and can replenish it in the place of origin; and the phenomenon of 'hoarding' is nothing more than because the rice weevils want to wait for the price in the place of origin to be cheaper, and replenish the same amount of goods or more in the producing area after selling out in Shanghai. It is also pitiful to say that since last year, which rice weevil can properly conform to this balance rate?

"The reason why the government is now suppressing and cracking down on rice weevils is probably due to the currency balance rate, so it is considered illegal to sell 160,000 per stone of rice in Shanghai when it costs 140,000 in the place of origin. As for the payment of fees other than rice and whether it can be replenished in the place of origin after selling, the government has not taken it into account. Why do rice weevils have to stubbornly recognize the commodity balance rate? Can't they respect the currency balance rate? I believe that people in occupations other than rice weevils have the same feeling." After hearing these words, I don't know what everyone will feel?

(Editor's note: The price of rice has been jumping for days, and the rice weevils also have reasons. Let's publish it temporarily and listen to everyone's opinions).

### Recommendation of "Favoritism"

— Lin

"Favoritism" is a three-act comedy. The content describes the ugly practices of going through the inside line and using nepotism in the current Chinese bureaucratic politics. The script is written quite simply and concisely. First, the characters are related to the concise arrangement of the plot; there are very few extra-territorial developments, and secondly, in the methods of characterization and narrative dialogue, very violent understatement is used to avoid explicit brushstrokes as much as possible, and for the audience, only "knowing smiles" are required without the feeling of "scratching the itch through boots."

The characters include the loyal and honest Chen Jiannan, the enthusiastic and capable good wife Chen Baiqi, the flattering and favored Ma Lihang, the fierce and unreasonable Mrs. Ma, the mediocre and lecherous Deng Tong, and the Mrs. Deng who spreads the net of nepotism. In addition, there are sour scholars and vulgar merchants An Minminzhong.

"Favoritism" is not without criticism of reality, and it is also a satirical comedy worth seeing quickly.

### Features of the Accompaniment Capital

— Biluo

The half-month ban on dancing has been resolved, and the four clubs of Yangtze River, United, International, and Chongqing have all opened with the sign of concert halls, and the grand occasion has not diminished in the past. It is reported that dance parties can also be held during the day. In addition to the band performances on weekends and Sundays, records are used to broadcast music on weekdays. The tea fee is 3,000, and the coffee milk is 4,000.

Many air-raid shelters were built in this city during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Now, in order to "make the best use of everything," the Chongqing Xingyuan has approved four handling methods: (1) The air-raid shelters near the city's roads will be rebuilt into steel-concrete parking rooms. (2) Those that cannot be used will be sealed with stone bars to avoid danger. (3) When funds permit, large teams will be converted into underground transportation passages. (4) Private air-raid shelters will be closed depending on the circumstances.

The vacant land on the main road in the north district has recently been resolved by the Senate to be taken over by the public and rebuilt into parks, libraries, museums, sports grounds, and swimming pools. It is currently being handled by the Urban Planning Committee together with the Land Administration Bureau.

The spring river is rising, and the wheel transportation is smoother than before. Those who plan to "return to their hometowns" are also active. Recently, "selling at reduced prices as soon as they return home" red strips have appeared at the entrances of major stores.

The Victory Memorial Monument has been under construction for several months, and the tower has been built to more than ten feet high. The work is tense all day long, and pedestrians stop and watch. In addition, the tunnel from Qixing South to Heping Road has also been mostly completed.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Feifei, let me tell you!" Old Zhu had to put down the bedding in his hand, and went over to her with a smile and said, "Aunt Jin and the others are sitting in a car, which is comfortable and fast. Because it can't hold many people, your mother asked you to go first. Doesn't Aunt Jin like you very much? What are you afraid of with her taking care of you? When you get to Chongqing, you can see your father first...!"

Old Zhu used all the touching words like writing a script. Sure enough, Feifei stopped making noise and listened quietly. Obviously, her young heart had been moved by what Old Zhu said, but the more she said, the more effective her attitude changed. She frowned and began to think carefully.

"It would be better to let my younger brother go with them first!" She looked up and said as if pleading. A naive loyalty was revealed on her small face. "My younger brother is young and can't get used to hardship. He should be made to go more comfortably.... Dad likes him the most. If he goes to Chongqing first, Dad will definitely be even happier...!"

Hearing such words from a girl who was less than eight years old, Zhu Zhaonian's heart suddenly ached, and he almost cried.

And Feifei's words also reminded Lan. Of course, she knew her family's affairs very well. Although Hu Juewen was a scholar, he couldn't be without old ideas. He did prefer Xiao Rong because he was a boy!

"Then..." Lan was about to change her plan.

"But, Feifei," Old Zhu said to Feifei again with a very serious look, "We don't have any other cars right now. Even if we do, it must be a truck, which is much harder than a car. Maybe we have to walk, you are older and your mother can't hold you, can you bear it?"

"I'm not afraid! I'm older, I'm stronger than my younger brother!" Feifei replied immediately, and at the same time raised her two chubby little arms to Old Zhu.

"Then let the younger brother go first." Lan made a decision after deliberation. "Feifei is good, I know!" Saying that, she couldn't help but reach out and gently stroke Feifei's head a few times.

Xiao Rong stood on the ground, looking up and listening to them talk. (4) (4)

### Evolution of The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank

— Du Yuesheng

This bank was founded on April 26 of the twenty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. It was founded single-handedly by the late Lord Sheng Xingxun. At that time, foreign banks had already been established in China. Lord Sheng realized that if the country was to be rich, commerce must be developed, and that if commerce was to be developed, banks must be the most important. He made a proposal, submitted a memorial to the emperor, and was ordered to recruit commercial shares to discuss the establishment. The total capital was set at 5 million taels of silver. General offices were established in Shanghai, followed by branches in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Zhenjiang, and other places, in order to achieve the effect of connecting the fountain and the government organs. His vision is admirable. This is the first bank in our country. In the beginning, all the articles of association imitated foreign banks, and Westerners were hired as managers to provide guidance. The following year, he also requested that the Ministry of Household Affairs issue an edict to all provinces and customs, stipulating that all official funds deposited and remitted should be handed over to the Bank of Communications for collection and remittance. Before long, banknotes of silver and silver yuan were issued to compete with foreign banks. In this way, business was carried out in an orderly manner, and great achievements were made. All the Westerners who were hired had retired one after another. After the Qing Dynasty collapsed and the Republic of China was founded, the atmosphere of banks was greatly opened. The government promulgated revised bank registration regulations and company law. The bank revised its original articles of association and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for approval and registration. At that time, the bank's branches were all over the country. During the years of the Republic of China, the financial industry in this port was attacked by the world financial turmoil, and many were in danger, or even closed down because of this, or were able to maintain and preserve. The government believed that the history of this bank and the Siming China Industrial Bank was longer and the scale was larger, so it tried to help them. It was found that the original share capital of the bank was 5 million taels of silver, which was converted into 7 million yuan of national currency after the abolition of taels and the change to yuan. Half of the amount, 3.5 million yuan of national currency, was collected first. After the shareholders' meeting, the capital was increased and the capital was reduced, and the board of directors was authorized to contact the Ministry of Finance to join the government shares in order to strengthen the strength. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, it was ordered that the total amount of the bank's share capital should be 4 million yuan. In addition to the original commercial shares, which were converted into 525,000 yuan of national currency, the government joined the government shares of 3,475,000 yuan of national currency. Until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in the 27th year, the four banks in the war zone of Jing, Su, Xi, and Hang first withdrew and established a joint office for the withdrawal of banks in the war zone in Shanghai. Compared with the fire of the war, the government had moved its capital to Chongqing, and I had gone to Hong Kong first. In accordance with the national policy of resisting Japan, I had to work hard in my own position. Therefore, I sent Luo Qinghua to the rear to set up a branch in Chongqing, and I also went to Chongqing to plan together. Before the establishment of the Chongqing branch of the bank, it was appropriate to drastically change the international war situation, and the internal and external response was isolated. In the end, it did not change its original intention, and worked hard to overcome all difficulties. It also went to Qin and Long in person, in order to develop the treasures of the inland. It successively established Lanzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Baoji, Pingliang, Tianshui, Chengdu, Ziliujing, WeiYuan each line. In order to complete the financial connection between the west, the north and the south, Hengyang and Guilin branches were established. It was planned to gradually spread to the southeast, and the wars in the Central Plains and Xianggui broke out at the same time. Due to the drastic changes in the military, the Zhayang Street Guizhu branches had to withdraw with the army. The financial network in the rear was fortunate to be established. I deeply felt that the central management mechanism urgently needed to be strengthened internally, so in June of the 32nd year, I submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval to abolish the general office in Shanghai, and immediately established a general office in Chongqing to supervise and guide. It is to implement the central financial policy, cooperate with the overall use of agricultural, industrial, and mining construction plans, and strive to share the important responsibilities of resisting Japan and building the country at the same time. Gu Cheng's Chongqing branch in wartime has grown, and has laid the foundation for the bank's re-creation and revitalization. It is indeed owing to the government's guidance, and the society's increased care for the bank, as well as the hardships of the internal and external colleagues during the Anti-Japanese War, one heart and one mind, gathering strength and completing the mission, which is worth a lot. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, each branch in the occupied area had withdrawn to Shanghai one after another. Due to being hijacked by the enemy and the puppet, business was invisibly suspended. In August of the 34th year, Japan surrendered and the country was restored. The bank was ordered to handle the takeover and liquidation of each branch in the recovered area. I had already arrived in Shanghai for official business. In addition to actively handling it in accordance with laws and regulations, I also announced the resumption of business of the Shanghai branch and its affiliated branches in the Shanghai area. At the same time, I presented to the Ministry of Finance to move the general office to Shanghai for management, and first resumed the branches in Beijing, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Xishang, and Tianjin. The branches and offices in the inland were considered and merged, and the branches were gradually restored in the ports of commerce. Looking back on the past, the bank has reached its 50th anniversary. The weather has been uncertain, and the world has been changing. I remember the difficulties of starting a business, and I am grateful for the unfinished service. The bank has been able to get here today thanks to the support of all walks of life. I dare not run it carefully, and I will do my best to record a small statement, briefly outlining its main points, for the purpose of commemoration.

### The Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years

Mr. Song Hanzhang has served in the banking industry for over fifty years. This time, he contributed an article titled "The Evolution of Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years" to this bank's commemorative publication, which can be described as firsthand experience and is extremely valuable. This article is the introduction to the text.

— Editor's Note —

The inception of the modern Chinese financial industry began with the China Merchant Bank. It has a history of fifty years since its establishment. This April marks the bank's 50th anniversary, which is also the 50th anniversary of the establishment of modern banks in our country. Fortunately, I have been involved in the financial industry for these fifty years, starting with serving at this bank for ten years, from which I benefited greatly. On this commemorative occasion, I follow the bank's request to write about "Chinese Finance in the Past Fifty Years," and I will briefly describe the reforms and innovations of the Chinese financial industry in the past fifty years, as a mirror to learn from the past and know the future.

The financial industry is the central hub of all economic activities, like the human body's blood circulation, which cannot be stopped. A sound financial organization can promote the sound development of the economy. Sound economic development further promotes the progress of the financial industry. The two are mutually dependent and should not be neglected. Before the opening of the five treaty ports, our country was still in a closed era, and the domestic economy only sought self-sufficiency. There was neither large-scale production nor a need for modern financial institutions. The so-called financial institutions in the past were only draft banks, money shops, and pawnshops. Their function was only to facilitate the flow of funds and had nothing to do with economic development. Since the Opium War, foreign economic forces have followed. The British-owned Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China first established a branch in Shanghai, issuing banknotes and supporting the country's merchants in trade with China. Subsequently, German, Russian, French, American, Japanese, Dutch, and Belgian foreign banks also continued to establish branches in China, resulting in the complete control of our country's financial power by foreign banks. After the founding of the Republic of China, due to the hard work and unyielding efforts of Chinese-run banks, we have today's great financial industry. Looking back on the past, I cannot help but feel infinite joy. Now, I will briefly describe the evolution of our country's financial institutions as follows.

The origin of China's financial institutions, in terms of history, began with the old-style draft banks and money shops, followed by foreign banks, starting with the Chartered Bank established in 1853. The establishment of China's modern banks began with the China Merchant Bank established in the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign. The development situation from the late Qing Dynasty to the establishment of the National Government in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China will now be described.

(A) Draft Banks and Money Shops

Draft banks and money shops were China's old-style financial industry. Their origin dates back to the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. The establishment of draft banks began with the Shanxi draft banks, followed by the Zhejiang-Shaoxing and Hefei draft banks, and so on. The Shanxi draft banks, due to their long history and strong capital, had their headquarters mostly in Shanxi. There were also branches in Shanghai, Guangdong, Shenyang, Hankou, Chongqing, Jinan, Xi'an, Zhangjiakou, and other places. In the past, the funds remitted to Beijing by the provincial treasuries were entrusted to the draft banks for remittance. The land tax and lijin collected by the provincial governor's offices, as well as the customs and salt taxes collected by various departments, were often deposited in the draft banks. Therefore, the Shanxi draft banks had a very rich source of funds and convenient remittance services. Later, the Yuanfengrun of the Zhejiang-Shaoxing group and the Yishan Yuan of the Hefei group saw that the Shanxi draft banks were making huge profits, and they also seized the opportunity, leveraging their political background, to emerge. The establishment of money shops in Shanghai was dominated by the Ningbo-Shaoxing and Suzhou groups, followed by the Zhenjiang group. Regarding the origin of money shops, it is said that it was due to the complexity of China's currency system. In the past, when people used copper coins to pay taxes, they had to be converted into silver taels according to the official price. The more conversions, the greater the profit. Therefore, people needed the establishment of exchange shops, and exchange merchants became a necessity of the times. Today's money shops are evolved from these exchange shops. Comparing these two, the draft banks have strong capital and a more prominent reputation, occupying a superior position. Although the capital of money shops is small, they are quite close to the general society. Therefore, both factions can continue to grow. However, the Shanxi draft banks focused on conservatism and self-imposed restrictions, while the Zhejiang and Anhui draft banks were close to officialdom and had smooth interpersonal skills, which was slightly different. The Xinhai Revolution brought about great changes in domestic finance. The draft banks were the first to be shaken and closed down one after another. The money shops also declined for a time. After a long period of operation, they began to recover slightly.

(B) Foreign Banks

The modern foreign banks in China began with the Chartered Bank established in 1853. Following this, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Banque de l'Indochine, Russo-Chinese Bank, Banque Sino-Belge, Citibank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Banque Industrielle de Chine, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank were established, totaling more than ten banks. At the beginning of the establishment of these banks, their purpose was to engage in trade with China and facilitate remittance. Over time, they solicited loans from the Chinese government and invested in industries in China, thus changing their original purpose. Later, due to the indemnities of the foreign powers, the surplus of customs and salt taxes had to be deposited in foreign banks, resulting in the financial and fiscal control being restricted.

(C) Modern Chinese Banks

Modern Chinese banks are established according to the operating methods of the West. The establishment of modern banks in our country began with the China Merchant Bank. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu, the Qing government, in order to reclaim its rights and interests, solicited shares to establish the bank. At that time, the total commercial shares were five million taels, with half paid up first, and ordered the bank to issue both silver tael and silver dollar banknotes to facilitate the people, in order to resist the banknotes of foreign banks. At the beginning of the bank's operation, since there were no laws or precedents to follow, the board of directors jointly formulated the articles of association, referring to the precedents and methods of Western banks and seeking strictness. They also hired Mr. Chen Shengjiao, a leader in the money industry, as the Chinese manager, and Mr. Medlen, an Englishman, as the foreign manager, to bridge the gap between the Chinese and foreign silver and money industries. This was the motivation for establishing modern commercial banks in our country. In the ninth year after the establishment of the China Merchant Bank, in the spring of the thirtieth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue奏准 to试办银行,以以为推行币制之枢纽,定名named it the Hubu Bank, and in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue was changed to the Ministry of Finance, and the Hubu Bank was also奏准 to改名 to the Daqing Bank, and the Regulations of the Daqing Bank consisting of twenty-four articles were promulgated, which was actually the embryonic form of the national bank of our country. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was originally planned to rename the Daqing Bank as the Bank of China. However, due to the government's proposal to reorganize, the Daqing Bank was closed for liquidation, and the Ministry of Finance raised capital and formulated the Regulations of the Bank of China consisting of thirty articles, adopting the joint-stock company system, as a bank jointly run by the government and merchants and concurrently enjoying the powers of a national bank. In addition, the establishment of the Bank of Communications began with the Ministry of Posts and Communications奏准 to establish it in November of the thirty-third year of Guangxu. It drafted the Articles of Association of the Bank of Communications consisting of thirty-eight articles and opened for business the following year. In addition to operating ordinary banking business, it also had the special right to manage the funds of roads, telecommunications, postal services, and shipping, and to issue exchange notes. Before the establishment of the Central Bank in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were both in the position of national banks. As for the general commercial banks established after the China Merchant Bank, the Siming Commercial Savings Bank was established in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu. Since the Republic of China, the establishment of modern commercial banks has increased year by year. In the first year of the Republic of China, fourteen new banks were established. From the third to the fifth year of the Republic of China, due to political turmoil, fewer banks were added. After the sixth year of the Republic of China, they gradually increased. From the tenth to the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the European War had just ended, and industry and commerce flourished for a time, and the government's official prices were also sorted out. During these three years, the number of banks added reached as many as eighty-nine. From the fifteenth to the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, there were large-scale military operations throughout the country, all industries were depressed, and banks declined. Therefore, only seven were added in the fifteenth year, and only two were added in the sixteenth year.

In addition, there is much to say about the rise and fall of the power of Chinese and foreign financial industries. The financial market in our country has always been centered in Shanghai. During this period, Chinese-run banks, as a result of their own efforts, have laid a deep-rooted foundation. Businesses such as deposits, loans, and issuance have developed rapidly, showing good results. A brief list is as follows:

(1) In the late Qing Dynasty, the power of foreign banks in Shanghai was extremely great. There were few modern Chinese banks, and their power was weak. The only ones that could compete with foreign banks were the money shops in our country. Silver taels were commonly used in Shanghai, and the daily silver discounts and foreign taxes were all opened by the money industry. Banks had to listen to the market. However, the financing of money shops often relied on the assistance of foreign banks, which is the so-called "discounting bills." This discounting of bills was a short-term loan from foreign banks to money shops, mostly for two days. Therefore, foreign banks at that time seemed to be in the position of central banks for our country's money shops. Later, due to the rubber stock market crash, countless money shops closed down. Foreign banks were unable to recover the discounted bills they had made, and since then they have been unwilling to discount bills again. However, since the Republic of China, our country's banks have developed very rapidly. Therefore, many of the discounted bills were made by famous banks in our country. This responsibility for providing liquidity to the market was transferred to our country's banks, and the power of our country's banks was able to expand day by day, and the relationship with the money industry also became closer.

(2) In the past, government authorities with assets mostly regarded foreign banks as the most reliable. Therefore, all cash was mostly absorbed by them. Unexpectedly, the European War broke out, and Japan seized Qingdao. The funds deposited in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank could not be withdrawn. Later, there was the collapse of the Banque Industrielle de Chine. From this, people up and down in our country realized that foreign banks were not entirely reliable, and they moved their deposits to Chinese banks. At that time, the famous Chinese banks in Shanghai, in addition to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, also included the China Merchant Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Shanghai Commercial Bank, the Jiangzhe Local Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Yanyeh Bank, and the Zhongfu Bank. They were all able to win the trust of society, so their business was booming. The safety of their loans and the seriousness of their work were almost the same as those of British and American banks. Therefore, the prestige of our country's banks increased day by day, and the fact that our country's banking group代兌钞票 for the Banque Industrielle de Chine further enhanced the reputation of our country's banking industry.

(3) In the past, the banknotes circulating in Shanghai were all issued by foreign merchants, and the banknotes of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation were the most numerous. People regarded them as almost the same as cash. Later, the banknotes of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications gained the trust of society and gradually replaced the banknotes of foreign banks. The reason for this was largely due to the fact that the Bank of China in Shanghai continued to maintain cash payment in the fifth year of the Republic of China.

### Request to Establish a Bank

September, 22nd year of Guangxu (1896)

Banks originated in the West. Their main purpose is to circulate a country's wealth to meet the supply and demand of those above and below. The legislation is better than China's draft banks and money shops, and the state has the right to protect rights and interests without interference. Therefore, it can maintain itself without decay. Since the opening of trade with various countries, the Chinese have not known how to do this. Banks from England, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan have come to China, seizing our great benefits. In recent years, Chinese and foreign scholars and officials have clearly seen the root and branch and have also proposed establishing banks. The business hub is closely related, and railways are now being built, which is a grand undertaking. Without the urgent establishment of a Chinese bank, there is no way to connect the qi and veins of Chinese merchants and prevent foreign merchants from holding us hostage. Proponents say that the national bank should issue all funds, select high officials, circulate banknotes, and be issued by the Ministry of Revenue, just like in England and France, where the finances all enter and exit the bank, which is the Ministry of Revenue's foreign treasury. However, Chinese and foreign customs are different, and the Ministry's banknotes have a recent lesson. Applying the official system and operating the trade economy, I am afraid that there will be many obstacles and abuses will accumulate. Some want to entrust important responsibilities to Westerners and obtain foreign funds. Tens of millions of gold can be raised immediately. The words are very sweet, but the power is in their hands, and the gains and losses are not easy to estimate. I believe that banks are a matter for merchants. If merchants do not trust, then their strength will not be united. If their strength is not united, then the matter will not succeed. If you want to be careful at the beginning and plan to the end, you must accumulate small things to achieve great things. I plan to request:

To select and appoint a high official, and to choose from the various provinces gentlemen and merchants who are fair, honest, and substantial, to be the general directors. To call on Chinese merchants to raise capital of five million taels of silver. First, establish the Chinese Bank in Kyoto and Shanghai. Then, branch banks will be added in the provincial capitals and ports in order. According to Western commercial practices, all management will be done by the commercial directors themselves. When I was in Shanghai, I

discussed the matter of banks with Yan Xinhou, the candidate for the office of customs official in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jianghan, and other customs areas, who was in charge of opening official silver shops. Yan Xinhou considered the overall situation and was willing to merge his independently opened silver shop into the public bank, so as to broaden its spirit. He also agreed to follow the regulations of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to use fine paper and machines to print silver notes, which would complement the cash silver. The number of notes printed would be based on the amount of silver deposited, so as to be ready for cash payment at any time. If officials in the various provinces borrow from the bank, they should follow Western precedents and submit a report to the Ministry of Revenue for approval, stating what funds will be used to repay the loan, before a contract can be agreed upon. European national debts of thousands of millions are all handled by banks, issuing bonds and collecting annual interest, which is paid by the bank. With great faith, it is easy to gather things together. In the future, funds allocated from Kyoto and abroad can be transferred through remittances to save on transfer fees. Funds for public use can be temporarily deposited to earn interest. If the silver coins manufactured by the government cannot be fully circulated and profited from, they can be transferred up and down by the bank, so that the officials can sit back and receive the profit of equality. The bank will use the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's articles of association as the standard for employing people and handling affairs, so as to unite the commercial power of the world to run the world's bank. As long as Chinese banks earn one more point of profit, they will recover one point of power from foreign banks. They will also follow Western precedents, and after there is surplus profit, they will酌量提捐 donate to the public. The established articles of association will be observed. Merchants and people will gain convenience, and the state will receive its benefits in secret. When officials and merchants trust each other in the future, and the internal and external political and legal reforms are fully profitable, then the establishment of a national bank will be planned, which will run in parallel with the commercial bank without conflict. Perhaps measures can be seen early, so as to avoid empty words without benefit. I respectfully submit this memorandum and ask for

Your Holy Majesty's guidance and instructions. I respectfully

Report.

### Sheng, Palace Guardian, Memorial

Memorial on Planning the China Merchant Bank and Gradually Opening Branches, April, 24th Year of Guangxu (1898)

Memorial, following

Imperial Command to plan the China Merchant Bank and gradually open branches. I respectfully submit this memorial for

Your Sacred Majesty's consideration. I, your servant, received the

Imperial Command to solicit merchants to establish the China Merchant Bank. I have been soliciting gentlemen and merchants, preparing sufficient capital, and referring to Western banking laws to discuss and draft articles of association. I consulted with the Princes and Ministers of the 总理衙门, and they carefully reviewed each item, reaching a consensus. I also consulted with the Minister of Beiyang and Governor-General of Zhili, your servant Wang Wenshao, and the Governor-General of Huguang, your servant Zhang Zhidong, to discuss and report on the pros and cons of the bank. The Northern and Southern Oceans investigated to protect the rights and interests. I奏奉 reported with

Royal Approval on April 26th of the twenty-third year of Guangxu. The Shanghai headquarters was opened. From summer to winter, branches in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Shantou, Yantai, Zhenjiang, and other places were gradually opened. The Beijing bank has also been opened this year. From now on, from the royal capital to the commercial docks, the泉府 mechanisms will be connected like blood vessels, so that they will not be entirely controlled by foreign merchants. The provincial capitals and cities should also gradually set up branches. In recent years, gold pounds have been expensive, and silver coins have been depressed. Prices have soared, and transportation has been stagnant. In Shanghai, the general commercial hub, silver is scarce, and the commercial situation is precarious, facing imminent danger. Fortunately, the China Merchant Bank is maintaining the market. Although silver interest is high, it is still somewhat limited, and it can barely support it. The China Bank is a large and rough vehicle, and its scale is in its initial stage. Therefore, its contributions to commerce and its effects in the evening are gradual. The establishment is based on the establishment of various foreign banks in China. The establishment of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been more than thirty years. Its momentum is strong, and its foundation is deep. Not only does it net all the funds of foreign merchants, but the China Bank cannot get a share of its profits. Even large-scale trade with Chinese merchants has been going on with Western banks for a long time, and they have deep trust in them. The new situation of the China Bank is not strong enough, and it cannot be superficially decorated to compete with Westerners. Therefore, I originally proposed to make the beginning cautious and the end good, and to accumulate small things to achieve great things as the goal. Now, the establishment has been one year, and the foundation has been laid. From now on, we will expand the commercial power of the Chinese, and recover our own rights and interests. The key lies in whether the official funds allocated from Kyoto and abroad are all transferred to the China Merchant Bank for circulation. If the official funds stored and transferred by the provinces' customs still follow the old route and are transferred to private silver shops, and are never related to the bank established by

Imperial Command, then the commercial and political system will be completely lost. Westerners will laugh, and Chinese people will become more suspicious. Which merchants in the world will be willing to trust it? It is not a small matter related to the overall commercial situation. I believe that the events of today, all of which are for the benefit of the

State. Investigating the bank, there are invisible benefits to the

State, and there are tangible benefits. Qi and blood flow, and merchants and people are convenient. The benefits are invisible, and the remaining benefits are thicker. The more that is returned to the public, the more tangible the benefits are. I have already detailed this in my original memorial. It is necessary to rely on the

State to preside over it from above, and the public and loyal governors and treasurers and customs supervisors to maintain it from below, in order to gradually reap both benefits and promote this grand plan. I request

that the Ministry of Revenue be commanded and circulated to the customs of the provinces. From now on, all official funds stored and transferred must be deposited in the China Merchant Bank for storage and remittance, where the bank is established. This will conform to the system and establish a reputation. When its effectiveness is greatly apparent, such as Zhaoxin stocks, as well as road construction and mining, all matters of soliciting shares can be modeled on Western countries and entrusted to the bank for handling, which will be free from the弊 of official solicitation and suspicion. Therefore, the states of the West and Japan all attach great importance to banks and strongly support them. If you want to enrich the country, you must engage in commerce. If you want to develop commerce, you must first value banks. However, this matter is complicated and difficult, and it is beyond my ability. All the reasons for planning the China Merchant Bank and gradually opening branches are respectfully presented in this memorial. I humbly ask for

His Majesty's Sacred Admonition and Instructions. I respectfully

Report.

### How to Manage Bank Credit

— Dai Mingli

Director Dai Ligan contributed an article titled "China's Monetary System in the Past Fifty Years" to this bank's commemorative publication, and he elaborated on the legal tender policy to the fullest extent. This article is one section of that article.

— Editor's Note —

Since the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Finance has strictly managed commercial banks. On the one hand, it has been preventing credit expansion, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and assisting in stabilizing prices. On the other hand, it has been supervising banks' investment of funds in production and construction, as well as increasing the supply of goods through production, sales, and mortgage financing. At the same time, it has been improving the banking system and laying the financial foundation. The main facilities are as follows:

1. Restricting the Establishment of New Banks For the sake of strict management, the Ministry of Finance has placed very strict restrictions on the establishment of new banks. The establishment of sub-branch banks is based on meeting the economic needs of the local area. It must be submitted to the Ministry for approval in advance before it can be established. It is necessary to make them dispersed and universal, so that the local finance can develop reasonably. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to adjust the financial economy of the recovered areas, the "Regulations on the Reestablishment of Commercial Banks in the Recovered Areas" was promulgated, which still imposed restrictions based on the actual needs of various places.

2. Depositing Reserve Requirements Commercial banks are required to deposit statutory reserve requirements, which are centrally collected by the Central Bank. This is not only to protect the rights and interests of depositors and concentrate reserves, but also to tighten the credit of commercial banks in wartime, thereby helping to stabilize prices. The "Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times" stipulate that commercial banks should deposit 20% of their deposits as reserve requirements and transfer them to any of the local Central, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, or Agricultural Bank. After the specialization of the four banks, they were changed to be centrally collected by the Central Bank. After the victory, the "Measures for Managing Banks by the Ministry of Finance" revised the reserve requirements to 10% to 20% for demand deposits and 7% to 15% for time deposits. The reserve ratio is determined by the Central Bank based on the financial market situation, after consulting with and approved by the Ministry of Finance.

3. Supervising the Use of Funds Banks should use funds in accordance with the principle of lending to production and construction projects. Direct banking business and hoarding of goods, or indirect buying and selling of goods on behalf of customers, as well as bank service personnel using bank funds to engage in commerce, are strictly prohibited in order to clarify bank business.

4. Unifying Bank Accounting Subjects The Ministry of Finance promulgated unified bank accounting subjects in December of the thirty-first year, divided into three parts: banking, savings, and trust, which were implemented in the thirty-second year. This measure not only facilitates the bank management work, but also brings significant improvements to the financial business itself.

5. Promoting Negotiable Instruments China's credit system is still in its infancy? The use of negotiable instruments is not yet widespread. In order to promote financial construction and establish a modern credit system, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for Acceptance and Discounting of Negotiable Instruments in Extraordinary Times" in April of the thirty-second year, and designated domestic important cities to implement them one after another. It also worked with the Central Bank to organize a rediscount review committee to manage rediscount business. Thus, the market credit system was established, and the short-term funds needed for production undertakings were fully supplied.

6. Stabilizing Market Interest Rates The deposit and loan interest rates in various parts of Sichuan Province are particularly high, and the collection and payment periods are concentrated, making the financial industry vulnerable to pressure. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly planned to abolish them, but because commercial habits have been practiced for a long time, it first formulated the "Measures for Controlling Deposit and Loan Funds During Specified Periods" to restrict the maximum interest rate. In January of the thirty-second year, it was actually abolished, and the Central Bank changed to listing daily discounts. On the one hand, the Ministry of Finance supervised the Banking Associations in various places to effectively stabilize market interest rates and seek their rationality in the long and short term.

7. Conducting Business Inspections In order to assess whether the banks comply with the provisions of the financial policy, the Ministry of Finance has appointed personnel to go to the banks in various places to conduct regular and irregular inspections, to check the banks' account books and warehouses, and to give instructions and corrections according to the inspection results, or to impose penalties in accordance with the law. Those with serious circumstances are ordered to suspend business, so as to crack down on illegal operations and rectify bank business.

### The Course of Our Nation's Currency System

— Chen Guangfu

Mr. Chen Guangfu wrote an article titled "Financial Affairs in the Past Fifty Years" for our bank's commemorative volume, "China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years." It is over ten thousand characters long, with elegant writing and historical allusions, making it highly valuable. This article is a section of it. —Editor's Note—

In the past, our country's common people generally used copper coins. Gold and silver ingots were not commonly seen in general transactions. The inflow of foreign silver dollars gradually increased. The common people appreciated their fine minting and were accustomed to using them, leading to their circulation spreading daily. During the late Qing Dynasty, the government itself minted silver coins. Various provinces minted silver coins weighing one tael according to the Kuping standard. Later, they specialized in minting coins of seven mace and two candareens according to the Kuping standard, with sizes similar to foreign silver dollars. However, because officials sought personal gain, the silver content varied. Coins minted in one province could only circulate within its own political sphere of influence. Going beyond that area required a premium. Because of this, the variety of currency at the time became even more complex.

In the decades from the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic of China, the types of currency at that time could be listed as follows: (1) Among silver taels, there were Shanghai taels, Beijing public taels, Tianjin trade taels, Hankou foreign taels, Nanjing "Erqibao" taels, and various other names in different places. It was almost impossible to fully describe their contents. (2) Among silver dollars, there were Spanish silver dollars, Mexican eagle dollars, Hong Kong and Japanese silver coins, and the dragon dollars minted during the Qing Dynasty. The dragon dollars were diverse, with Jiangnan, Hubei, Guangdong, Zhili, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fengtian, Jilin, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces minting coins with the province of origin marked on them. The fineness varied from 0.9003 to 0.8435. (3) Paper money included silver dollar notes, small silver notes, copper coin notes from provincial official money bureaus or state-run banks and provincial banks, as well as banknotes from various commercial banks. Even private notes could be issued in various places. (4) Subsidiary coins included various copper coins, small silver coins, and "ke" coins. Therefore, before the abolition of the tael in favor of the yuan on March 10, 1933, there was practically no fixed standard currency.

Proposals for our nation's currency system began with Hu Yuzhi, the magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture, in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign. This was followed by Sheng Xuanhuai's memorial to the throne in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign, requesting a reform of the currency system. In the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign, Yang Xuanzhi imitated the British pound. Later, in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign, Robert Hart, the Inspector-General of Customs, proposed adopting the gold exchange standard. Hu Weide suggested adopting the gold standard. In the 30th year of the Guangxu reign, American professor Jeremiah Jenks proposed a gold exchange standard plan. In the 33rd year, there was a plan to use the gold standard in the Ministry of Revenue. In the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign, a Dutch official, Mr. Vissering, proposed a gold exchange standard plan. None of these were put into practice. In the 3rd year of the Republic of China, the National Currency Ordinance was promulgated, using the silver standard. Although Cao Rulin submitted a request to adopt the gold standard in August of the 7th year, and Zhang Zuolin advocated adopting the gold standard in November of the 8th year, these were not implemented either. After the Nationalist Government's unification, it hired a committee to draft a gradual implementation of the gold standard currency system. As a result, customs duties were changed to gold units, and customs gold unit notes were issued, so that customs duties could guarantee foreign debts and reparations without suffering losses due to the depreciation of the pound. Silver coins were also unified in advance to establish a standard. In March of the 22nd year, the tael was abolished in favor of the yuan, and the Silver Standard Currency Minting Ordinance was promulgated. From then on, our nation's currency system gradually unified under the silver dollar.

When our country unified under the silver dollar standard, the United States launched a plan to purchase silver in order to maintain silver prices, causing the outflow of silver dollars and silver bars from our country. As a result, the currency became increasingly tight, and prices fell. Merchants' inventories and industrial products could not cover their costs, and the signs of panic were already emerging. Although the government implemented a silver price equalization tax to prevent the export of silver, Japan openly engaged in smuggling in North China, and the outflow of silver increased even more. At that time, bankruptcies of industrial and commercial enterprises were frequently seen, and the financial economy was in imminent danger. Seeing this situation, Britain, in order to maintain trade with China and the balance of power of the great powers in the Far East, and fearing that our country would suffer another financial collapse under Japan's gradual encroachment, sent Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China to help us complete the legal tender system on November 4 of the 24th year. It announced that silver was nationalized. The United States subsequently signed a silver agreement with us, making the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender even stronger.

The legal tender was not convertible domestically but could be used to buy and sell foreign exchange without limit at the legal price from the Central Bank, with each yuan worth one shilling and two and a half pence in British gold. This legal tender was the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China. Later, the banknotes of the Farmers Bank of China were added. The issuance of other commercial banks was transferred to the legal tender. From this point on, our currency system leapt from the silver standard to the gold exchange standard, thus breaking away from the fluctuations of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, or silver being expensive and gold being cheap.

The legal tender was successful because, first, among the foreign banks in China at that time, British banks were the most authoritative. Since the British government helped us establish the legal tender, all foreign banks in China accepted it, and even Japanese banks did not obstruct it, so it was very smooth. Second, the banknotes issued by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Commercial Bank had been circulating for a long time and had established credit. The common people were accustomed to using them and no longer redeemed them for silver. Therefore, circulation was widespread even in remote areas, and the quantity gradually increased. The silver dollars held in reserve were even more abundant. These banknotes already possessed the conditions of legal tender, were trusted by the people, and were not like the indiscriminate issuance and suspension of redemption by the warlords in various provinces, which shook the economic foundation and harmed the people. The legal tender had this important factor, so at the beginning of the reform, the common people neither experienced inconvenience nor harbored suspicion. The silver dollars remaining in the hands of the people were then gradually collected by the government. This cannot but be attributed to the appropriate measures and maintenance taken by the organizers of these banks over the years.

It is a pity that the legal tender system was established for less than a year when Japan launched a full-scale invasion of our country, and our country had no choice but to engage in a long-term war of resistance. It is said that the success of the war of resistance depended on the legal tender. Without the legal tender, the war of resistance would have been even more difficult. During the war, the issuance of legal tender was concentrated in the Central Bank by the four banks. The foreign exchange rate of the legal tender changed from an unlimited supply of foreign exchange to requiring approval, and because of the enemy and puppet regime's arbitrage, it changed to an exchange stabilization fund and foreign exchange control. The exchange rate with the US dollar has evolved from three yuan and three jiao to today's listed price of twelve thousand yuan. The domestic price of the legal tender has differed by nearly ten thousand times. Most people have suffered greatly, and their lives have become increasingly difficult. If domestic politics can be stabilized, the balance of international payments can be achieved, and the state budget's expenditures and revenues can be matched, then the value of the legal tender can be stabilized, so that people's livelihoods can gradually recover. This is the key to the current financial situation.

### Progress in the Number of Banking Institutions Over the Past Fifty Years

— Yang Yinpu

Mr. Yang Shiyong wrote an article titled "China's Banking Industry in the Past Fifty Years" for our bank's 50th anniversary commemorative book, "China's Economy in the Past Fifty Years," which is 20,000 words long. This article is one section of it. —Editor's Note—

The progress in the number of banking institutions over the past fifty years is quite obvious. It is divided into four periods: (1) the late Qing period, (2) the pre-War of Resistance period, (3) the War of Resistance period, and (4) the early post-war period. The late Qing period is counted from the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign to the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign, a total of fourteen years. The pre-War of Resistance period is counted from the 1st year of the Republic of China to the "July 7th" Incident, a total of more than twenty-five years. The War of Resistance period is counted from the 26th year of the Republic of China to the autumn of the 34th year, a total of eight years and some months. The early post-war period is from September of the 34th year to the present.

(A) Progress in the Late Qing Period: The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank was approved for establishment in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign. In the eight or nine years after that, no new banks were established. It was not until the establishment of the Ministry of Revenue Bank in the spring of the 31st year of the Guangxu reign that new banks began to appear every year. In total, seventeen banks were established one after another in the fourteen years from the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign to the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign. This was because the social and economic environment at that time did not yet show an urgent need for modern banks. At the same time, Shanxi banks and native banks were spread throughout the country and were very developed in their business. Foreign banks, with their economic power, were entrenched in major cities, all of which gave new banks an intangible obstacle. In the last six or seven years of the Qing Dynasty, as many as sixteen banks were established. Under the conditions at that time, this was already a very prosperous phenomenon.

(B) Progress Before the War of Resistance: With the founding of the Republic of China, politics was renewed, and industry and commerce were stimulated, leading to a sudden surge in vitality. The establishment of banks also became more active. In the first year of the Republic of China, as many as fourteen new banks were established. After that, new banks were established every year. By the 16th year of the Republic of China, a total of 185 banks had been established. Among them, the situation was particularly prosperous in the seven years from the 6th year to the 12th year of the Republic of China, with 131 new banks established. At that time, it coincided with the European War, and the source of foreign goods was blocked. Domestic industry and commerce made considerable progress, and the need for capital adjustment increased. The increase in the number of banks was inevitable. In addition, the Beijing government launched a large-scale domestic debt, which helped promote the rise of a large number of northern banks at that time. This was the initial boom in China's banking industry. In the following years, due to the large-scale military operations in the country, some industries and businesses were stalled, and the banking industry also entered a period of depression. At the same time, it was also implicated in the financial collapse of the Beijing government, and the crisis became increasingly serious. The wind of bank failures became increasingly fierce. This situation gradually improved after the Nationalist Government established its capital in Nanjing in the 16th year of the Republic of China.

Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, with the gradual return of politics to the right track and the gradual emergence of economic construction, the banking industry also developed along with the thriving of industry and commerce. In the 17th year, as many as fifteen new banks were established. In November of that year, the Central Bank was established. At the same time, there was also a reasonable adjustment to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The financial situation was renewed. The establishment of banks increased daily, while failures gradually decreased. From the 17th year to the 24th year, a total of 124 banks were established. During this period, on the one hand, the country encountered the "September 18th" Incident and the "January 28th" Incident. On the other hand, the country was affected by the US silver policy and the world economic panic. China's economy was extremely precarious. Fortunately, the banking industry was able to barely support itself by being self-reliant and establishing a relatively sound foundation early on. The implementation of the legal tender policy in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China enabled the national economy to recover and prosper, and the foundation of the banking industry became more stable. Although the establishment of new banks was not booming in the following two years, the foundation of the banking industry became increasingly solid, and there were signs of gradual improvement.

As of the end of June in the 25th year of the Republic of China, a total of 330 banks had been established in the country. A total of 166 had failed one after another. At that time, 164 existed. Branch institutions were established throughout the country, and at that time, there were already 1,332 units. The following is a list of the bank openings over the years as of the end of June in the 25th year:

Statistical Table of the Number of Banks Opened Each Year Since the 22nd Year of the Guangxu Reign

Source of Materials: National Bank Yearbook of the 25th Year

In the second half of the 25th year, one more bank was newly established. In the first half of the 26th year, three more were newly established. However, because banks were closed at the same time, the total number of banks as of the first half of the 26th year was still 164, and the number of branch institutions had expanded to 1,627.

At that time, commercial banks were the most numerous among the existing banks. After the 17th year, the provinces established provincial banks one after another. Agricultural and industrial banks also There is now a list of the classification of existing banks as of the end of June of the 25th Year: Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of June of the 25th Year

Source of Materials: National Bank Yearbook of the 25th Year

From the second half of the 25th year to the eve of the War of Resistance in the 26th year, there was no significant change in the situation. Only commercial banks decreased by seven, and agricultural and industrial banks increased by five. Provincial, municipal, and overseas Chinese banks each increased by one.

(C) Progress During the War of Resistance: The "July 7th" War of Resistance broke out suddenly, and Shanghai was the battlefield. The financial center was hit hard, and the banking industry was in dire straits again. Fortunately, the authorities took appropriate measures, and the period of panic was very short. In the one or two years after the war, the banking industry re-boomed due to the prosperity of industry. For a time, new banks were established like bamboo shoots after rain, especially in the Great Rear Area. According to statistics, from the "July 7th" Incident in the 26th year to the end of August in the 31st year, as many as 108 new banks were established in the five years. Among them, commercial banks were still the most numerous, accounting for 62. The next most numerous were provincial, municipal, and county banks, accounting for 19. Agricultural and industrial banks accounted for 15, and specialized banks accounted for 9. After that, although the war situation changed repeatedly, the increase in the number of banks was still in full swing. As of the eve of victory at the end of August in the 34th year, the total number of banks in the rear area had reached 415, which was a considerable increase compared with the national figure before the war. Branch institutions numbered 2,566, which was also an increase compared with before, but the area of activity was only half of that before the war. From this, we can see a glimpse of the prosperity of the banking industry during the war. The following is a list of the classified quantities of national banks as of the end of August in the 34th year:

Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of August in the 34th Year

Source of Materials: Statistics from the Business Inspection Department of Financial Institutions of the Central Bank

From the above table, it is worth noting the sharp increase in the branch institutions of state-run banks and provincial banks, as well as the increase in the establishment of county and city banks, which shows the government's efforts at that time to adjust financial institutions and develop the national economy.

As for the occupied areas, in addition to the many original commercial banks that continued to operate, there was also progress in quantity. Among the newly established banks, five major institutions were established by the enemy and puppet regime: one was the puppet "Huaxing Bank," with its headquarters in Shanghai; one was the puppet "Central Reserve Bank," with its headquarters in Nanjing; one was the puppet "China United Reserve Bank," with its headquarters in Peiping; one was the puppet "Mengjiang Bank," with its headquarters in Zhangjiakou; and one was the puppet "Central Bank of Manchuria," with its headquarters in Changchun. The number of general commercial banks also increased greatly. Taking Shanghai as an example, the total number on the eve of victory reached 193, which was more than three times the number before the war. Among these 193, in addition to a part established before the war, and more than 30 new banks established before the Pacific War in the 31st year and registered with the National Government, the remaining 120 new banks were not approved by the government. When victory came, they were ordered to be cleaned up. At that time, the number of banks in Shanghai was reduced to 73.

(D) Progress in the Early Post-War Period: With the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the banking industry inherited the prosperity of the war period, and the number continued to increase, and the proportion of its increase was higher than in any previous period. The increase in the number of these banks was generally due to the needs of the environment. After the victory in the War of Resistance, the occupied areas were restored, and the banking business in various places had to be developed rapidly. Therefore, as of the end of December in the 35th year, the total number of banks in the country had reached 574, an increase of 158 compared with the time of victory a year earlier, and an increase of 410 compared with before the war. The number of branches was 2,996, an increase of 440 compared with a year earlier, and an increase of 1,369 compared with before the war. The following is a list of all the banks in the country classified as of the end of December in the 35th year:

Statistical Table of the National Bank Classification as of the end of December in the 35th Year

Source of Materials: Statistics from the Auditing Department of the Central Bank in the 35th Year

From the table above, it can be seen that the branch institutions of state-run banks have decreased slightly in the year or so since the victory. This was originally a normal phenomenon. After the victory and restoration, the people who were scattered in the Great Rear Area during the war returned to their hometowns one after another. Due to the change in the situation, the branch institutions had to be reasonably adjusted. Furthermore, in terms of provincial and municipal banks, the number is still increasing. Compared with before the war, the branch institutions of provincial banks have increased by 733. As for county and city banks, which were originally a new system that emerged during the war, they developed very little before the war. According to the statistics of the Central Bank in the 32nd year, as of the first half of the 26th year, the total number of county banks existing in the name of peasant banks, rural banks, and local banks was only 26 in the country. Now it has increased to 356.

The increase in the number of banks is not enough to accurately represent the degree of progress of the banking industry. However, the increase in the number of banks more or less indicates the needs of the economic society and industry and commerce for financial adjustment, that is, it more or less indicates the development of the strength of the silver industry.

### A Review of Foreign Pressure on Our National Transportation

— Ye Gongchuo

Mr. Rong Yu Hu wrote an article entitled "China's Transportation in the Last Fifty Years" for this bank's commemorative publication. It is over ten thousand words long and is filled with reflections on the past and present. This article is just one section of it.

— Editor's Note —

The establishment of modern transportation in our country can be said to have been entirely dominated by foreign forces. This is because China's international status in the last hundred years has been only slightly better than that of a colony. The reason for this is admittedly self-inflicted, a fact that needs no concealment. Modern Western civilization was not easily accepted by Chinese customs. After thousands of years of isolation, once the sea was opened, China's poverty and weakness in the face of the great powers were fully revealed. However, old habits were hard to break, and there was no attempt at reform. The British built the Shanghai-Wusong Railway, but we destroyed it ourselves. Although the Tangshan-Xuge line of the Kaiping Coal Mine was built in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign, it was extended from Tianjin to Yu. The Beijing-Fengtian Railway was completed in the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign, seven years after the Boxer Protocol. Therefore, compared with other countries at that time, their material construction progressed faster, while our backwardness became even more severe. As a result, the distance between countries in terms of wealth and power naturally grew further apart, and foreign pressure deepened daily, which was inevitable. When the oppression became too great, we sought self-renewal. Is this not the principle of extreme change, or what is meant by "sorrowful times enlighten the wise"? Afterward, major lines such as the Beijing-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhengtai, Beijing-Suiyuan, Longhai, Jichang, and Guangdong-Hankou were built one after another. By the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, excluding the occupied Northeast region, the total length of domestic lines reached 11,400 kilometers. Considering the environment at the time, the progress was not slow. However, except for the Beijing-Suiyuan line, which was built entirely by domestic experts with domestic funds, the other roads built before the First World War were mostly built by borrowing foreign debt and hiring foreign engineers. Using foreign capital and talent to meet needs was not a bad practice in itself. However, the power to manage it had to be in our hands to be beneficial and harmless. However, that was not the case at the time. Because of the so-called "open door, equal opportunity" policy in diplomacy, the great powers such as Britain, France, Germany, and Japan competed for profit, relying on the coercion of unequal treaties to form a situation of so-called spheres of influence. Each took advantage of its convenience to obtain the right to invest in construction and operation. Even small and weak countries like the Netherlands and Belgium competed to get involved. Once the railway rights were ceded, borrowing funds to build a certain road had to be done from a certain country. Not only could we not change to another country, but other countries could not forcibly share the profits. The country with railway rights determined the speed of actual construction based on its own interests. Once the loan was established and the project began, the engineers were sent by that country, the materials were supplied by that country, and once the construction was completed, the transportation was operated by that country, and the profits were enjoyed by that country. Although our country appointed administrative leaders, they mostly just nodded and agreed. Only after the debt was repaid and the railway rights were redeemed could we operate independently. The conditions for repayment and redemption were harsh, to say the least. Therefore, the capital for the Beijing-Fengtian and Shanghai-Nanjing lines was borrowed from Britain, and the capital for the Beijing-Hankou line was borrowed from Belgium, which was the norm. The Tianjin-Pukou line was split into two sections. The southern section was connected to Shanghai-Nanjing, so it borrowed British funds, while the northern section was close to Qingdao and connected to the Jiaoji line, so it was contracted by the Germans. When the European War broke out, the Japanese army occupied Jiaozhou, and the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou line also fell into the hands of the Japanese along with the Jiaoji line. China's railways became property to be transferred and inherited based on the outcome of international wars. Looking back on the past, one can only feel sorrow and indignation. The First World War and the Russian Revolution left the Western European countries with no time to care about the affairs of the Far East, and Russia also had no time to look eastward. It was fortunate that it was able to maintain its rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway. The United States was still adhering to the Monroe Doctrine at that time and rarely competed with the world. Although it participated in the European War, it withdrew immediately after winning. It only engaged in peaceful commercial warfare with China and had no aggressive ambitions, which allowed the friendship to last for a long time. Japan, on the other hand, took advantage of the situation to further its ambitions to dominate Asia. With the support of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, it used the South Manchurian Railway as a base to gradually encroach on the economic interests of the three northeastern provinces. It then further aimed at North China, which gradually led to the September 18th Incident. This was indeed due to the international situation, but our domestic political problems, the missed opportunities, and the failure to establish a sound economic foundation all affected the active development of transportation. The blame cannot be entirely placed on others. China was an Allied nation in the European War and refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles in Paris, which slightly increased its international status. After the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty and the establishment of our National Government, domestic thought gradually evolved, and the international community viewed us in a new light. Taking the redemption of railway rights as an example, we were able to refute harsh conditions and successfully take over the Zhengtai Railway with a reasonable and firm attitude. Although borrowing foreign debt to build new roads involved losses due to high interest rates and high material prices, we were able to break the previous bad practices in terms of major rights. In the ten years before the Anti-Japanese War, although we cannot say that everything was satisfactory, considerable achievements were made in the renovation of old roads and the construction of new roads.

As described above, the railway construction in the past fifty years is sufficient to give a glimpse of the influence of foreign diplomacy, and the losses and suffering caused by it have been enormous. As for water transport, it can be summarized in one sentence: the loss of shipping rights has made China's entire shipping industry like an infant with bone tuberculosis, with no way to grow. Telegraph submarine cables also fell into the hands of others, and after much effort, they were finally recovered. Future development still requires effort. The postal service was always managed by foreigners. Under the circumstances of simple land and water transportation, they were able to combine new and old transportation tools to plan operations and establish systems, so that at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, there were 72,000 post offices and 584,000 kilometers of postal routes in the country (excluding the occupied Northeast region at that time). Starting from its establishment in the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, it had only been over thirty years. After being managed by the Chinese, it was able to follow the established rules and gradually develop, so that China Post could be compared with advanced countries. This is the only aspect in which foreign advisors have benefited us. As for highway and air transportation, they are emerging industries, and the international influence on them is still shallow, so I will not discuss them in detail here.

Today, after experiencing the Second World War, Germany and Japan, which were great powers in the past, have been defeated one after another. Today's great powers are working together to eliminate their aggressive thinking. China fought side by side with the world's democratic countries to resist violence, and the constraints of treaties in the past have been lifted. Whether the ideological tendencies of the major allies are left or right, they are now competing to call themselves democrats. If they are consistent in word and deed, open and honest, and trust and yield to each other to seek peace, then world security can be guaranteed, and the future of our country's construction should be bright. However, nearly two years have passed since the end of the war. Although the country's territory has been restored, looking north, there are still deep hidden worries. There have been repeated rumors of taking over Lushun and Dalian, but the facts have not been seen. The Changchun Railway has formed a joint management. Looking at the Northeast, our land, our people, our territory, and our management, is it possible to completely wipe away the past and renew the atmosphere? It is not easy to say. As for the abolition of all unfavorable treaties and the establishment of new treaties, which advocate mutual benefit and establish principles, it is indeed commendable. But how far is it from reality? Airplanes and ships come and go. Their planes have arrived, but where are our ships? Documents and books are used to enlighten the people, and new knowledge and skills are urgently needed to be imparted. What we have is not enough to benefit others, and what we need cannot be reprinted, so the source is blocked. Is this not what our people call "the phenomenon may be different, but the nature is the same"? Self-reliance and self-improvement, how can we not be vigilant? Among friendly countries, after the collapse of the Axis powers, the lessons of rise and fall cannot be ignored. The survival of the fittest, the strong survive and the weak decline, seems to be the ultimate truth. However, in terms of global nations, none are as cunning and brave as the Japanese, and none are as strong and persevering as the Germans. With their strong physique and sharp intelligence, they should have dominated the world. The battles of Stalingrad and Pearl Harbor made them think that they could control the world, but within a few years, they were on the verge of extinction. Afterward, India and Indonesia followed the Philippines in becoming independent and autonomous. The reason for this seems to be incomprehensible. Is it not because survival and freedom are the basic rights of mankind and cannot be forcibly taken away by violence? Twenty-five years ago, we said: "Whether our country will become the Balkans or not, its fate can only be decided by our country. Therefore, if our country can fight for a breath of air, it will bring infinite blessings to the world. Otherwise, the so-called Pacific problem, the Far East problem, and all kinds of problems will cause countless entanglements, and even if countless blood is shed, it will not be resolved. On the contrary, if our country can firmly establish itself, open its doors, and gather commerce and industry, the benefits enjoyed by other countries may be far greater than they are now, and the peace of the world can also be permanently maintained." Looking at the fierce international competition in recent times, these words seem to be still timely. Therefore, we hope that the people of our country can think carefully and make a clear distinction, and strive for self-renewal. We also hope that the leaders of the world's friendly countries can have a long-term vision, and with the spirit of benefiting others is benefiting oneself, cooperate and help each other to maintain world peace and share the benefits of mankind, which is not only beneficial to China's economic prosperity and transportation development.

### The Trend of Foreign Trade in the Last Fifty Years

— Shou Jingwei

Dr. Shou Yicheng wrote an article entitled "China's International Trade in the Last Fifty Years" for this bank's commemorative publication. It is rich in materials and detailed in analysis. This article is the introduction to that article. — Editor's Note —

The trend of our country's foreign trade in the last fifty years can be divided into five periods.

1.  From 1895 to 1913, the period of losing tariff sovereignty and international competition for markets. During this period, both import and export trade increased greatly. Export trade increased from 140 million customs taels to 400 million customs taels, an increase of 186 percent. Import trade increased from 170 million customs taels to 570 million customs taels, an increase of 235 percent. There were two reasons for the rapid increase in foreign trade during this period. (1) Various countries obtained the convenience of establishing factories in China in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, so the investment of Britain, France, and other countries in China increased sharply. At the same time, railway construction was at its peak during this period, and national industries were just starting, so the demand for foreign goods was very strong. (2) The number of treaty ports increased from 24 to 48 during this period. In particular, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Northeast became an important newly opened trade market in our country. The export of agricultural products from the Northeast increased greatly, and Japan gradually gained an advantage in China's trade.

2.  From the beginning of the First World War in 1914 to the outbreak of the Northeast Incident in 1931, the period of the budding of national industries and the outward expansion of trade. During this period, China's foreign trade continued to rise sharply. Export trade increased from 400 million customs taels to 900 million customs taels, an increase of 125 percent. Import trade increased from 450 million customs taels to 1.43 billion customs taels, an increase of 217 percent. The restoration of tariff autonomy was a major success after the establishment of the National Government.

3.  From the fall of the Northeast in 1932 to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, the period of rural economic panic and sharp decline in export trade. During this period, on the one hand, due to the economic panic around the world and the decline in productivity, our country's rural economy became increasingly poor. The purchasing power of the people was weak, and imports were affected. On the other hand, due to the loss of the Northeast, an important export area, exports tended to decline.

4.  From 1938 to 1945, the period of wartime trade control and trial of state-run trade. During this period, our country's foreign trade entered a wartime state, so the figures for foreign trade were actually very small and not worth mentioning. However, the active implementation of trade policies has epoch-making significance. The government completed the basic implementation in international trade and organized the Trade Commission. It established administrative agencies and formulated measures for the unified purchase and sale of export goods. It successively established the Fuhua Trading Company and the Fuxing Commercial Company. The Ministry of Economics then ordered the China Tea Company and the World Trading Company to be placed under its management to coordinate barter for materials. Advocating the state-run trade system was one of the most important aspects. On the other hand, Britain and the United States signed a new treaty with us in 1943, abandoning extraterritoriality and other rights and interests enjoyed in China, and the shackles that had been imposed on our national economy were thus removed. This is closely related to the development of postwar foreign trade.

5.  After 1946, the period of planning for postwar trade adjustment. This was the first year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Although the foreign war had ended, domestic peace had not yet been fully realized. As for export trade, due to transportation difficulties, agricultural products from the interior could not be transported to ports. Interest rates were too high, and costs were even higher, making it difficult to sell goods. Agriculture was mostly destroyed due to domestic wars, and the quantity of exported agricultural products also decreased. As for import trade, civilian goods that competed with national industries, such as paper and cotton, had particularly high import figures. The smuggling of luxury goods was even more rampant. Looking ahead, the worries are endless. The following is a table of the value of import and export trade in the last fifty years:

Statistical Table of Import and Export Trade Value in the Last Fifty Years (in millions)

Note: The figures for 1935-1946 are in national currency.

The conversion to US dollars is based on the exchange rate between customs taels or national currency and US dollars at the time. The conversion for 1946 is based on a ratio of 3350 to 1.

The national import and export figures for 1941 to 1944 were not published by the customs and could not be included.

### Prospects for Our National Finance in the Future

— Jia Shiyi

Mr. Jia Guobai wrote an article entitled "China's Finance in the Last Fifty Years" for the commemorative publication "China's Economy in the Last Fifty Years" compiled by this bank. It is 15,000 words long and is rich in materials and detailed in analysis. This article is the conclusion of that article.

— Editor's Note —

The highest goal of finance is the balance of revenue and expenditure. To achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, it is necessary to study the way of financial management. The so-called way of financial management is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The principle is simple, but how to implement it requires careful consideration. During the war, expenditure increased on the one hand and production decreased on the other hand, so it was inevitable that the balance of revenue and expenditure would be lost. Our government did its best to implement various measures to supplement the deficit, but most of them relied on currency issuance. Fortunately, China is an agricultural country, and the rear areas had bumper harvests every year. Even though there was inflation, it was still able to survive the darkest period. After the victory, due to the unstable domestic political situation, it was still difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. In addition to continuing to issue currency, other financial measures could not be put on the right track. However, it seems unfair to say that China's finance is hopeless. Based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly outline the following:

(1) Regarding revenue

A. Japan's compensation

Our country was the first country invaded by Japan and also suffered the most. Therefore, our country should have a large proportion of Japan's reparations and should have priority rights. The amount of this compensation is currently unknown, but it must be far greater than the value of enemy and puppet industries confiscated in the country. Although most of this compensation is in the form of production equipment, our country's biggest difficulty at present is still the lack of materials. If we obtain a large amount of new production equipment, we can accelerate production and solve the problem of material shortage, which can indirectly reduce the financial burden. This is one.

B. Sale of state-owned enterprises

The emergency economic measures adopted on February 17, 1947, included plans to sell state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises have a scope. If the scope of state-owned enterprises is expanded due to financial reasons, the increase in financial revenue will not be equal to the loss in the economic aspect. The economy is the lifeblood of finance. If the economy declines, finance will also shrink. Therefore, the sale of state-owned enterprises is not only a large income in finance, but also has a good impact on the entire national economy. Developing the national economy and enhancing the people's ability to pay taxes is the most reliable way to open up revenue sources. This is two.

C. Expansion of direct tax collection

Direct taxes are good taxes, and most economically advanced countries list them as the most important source of national revenue. Since the introduction of direct taxes in our country, although revenue has increased annually, the scope covered is not wide. Taking income tax as an example, it is only collected by category, and the investigation and statistics are not detailed enough, so it is still far from ideal. Direct taxes are an important source of tax revenue for our country in the future. If they can be effectively implemented and expanded, the balance of revenue and expenditure will be greatly assisted. This is three.

D. Surplus of transportation enterprises

The surplus of transportation enterprises was originally an important item in our country's annual revenue. Since the Anti-Japanese War, in order to stabilize prices, the prices of transportation enterprises have mostly been below cost, and they are difficult to maintain without subsidies. Therefore, transportation enterprises at present not only do not help the national treasury, but also are a major financial burden. However, this situation is only temporary. In the future, when the country's important railway trunk lines are completed and the economy along the line is greatly developed, the income of transportation enterprises will still be a very reliable source of national revenue. This is four.

E. Income from barter

Judging from the general trend, the complete freedom of international trade is not possible in the short term. Our country was originally an industrially backward country and suffered heavy losses in the war. The management of trade will continue. In addition to import restrictions, the government should centrally purchase and export our country's special products, which will directly increase foreign exchange income and indirectly supplement financial expenditure. This is five.

(2) Regarding expenditure

A. Abolish unnecessary institutions

During the war, due to environmental needs, many central and local institutions were added. Although some have been abolished after the end of the war, many still remain. This not only affects administrative efficiency, but also increases national expenditure. The concentration of talent in cities is even more detrimental to the development of townships. In the future, all unnecessary institutions should be abolished to save national funds.

B. Stop unnecessary projects

In addition to abolishing unnecessary institutions, the next step should be to stop unnecessary projects. In all fairness, the government has given careful consideration to many of the projects it has undertaken, but many have also been carried out in accordance with the environment and established practices. This will inevitably constitute a waste of finance. At a time when the country's finances are riddled with holes, all unnecessary projects should be completely stopped.

C. Stop expenditures that should not be borne by the national treasury

This type of expenditure, whether public or not, should be removed from the national treasury's expenditure.

(3) Regarding the application of fiscal policy

A. Coordination of fiscal policy and economic policy

It is known to everyone that finance cannot be separated from the economy. Therefore, in the future, finance should avoid depleting the pond to catch fish and destroying the tax source in terms of revenue. In terms of expenditure, it should be directly and indirectly applied to production, so that the effect of taxes becomes reproductive.

B. Coordination of fiscal policy and social policy

"Take from the people, use for the people" was the earliest theory of finance. However, from a modern point of view, this theory is not perfect. It must be that taking from the people should be based on the principle of equality, and using for the people should be based on the principle of universality. Restrict the concentration of property, so that there is no gap between rich and poor, and improve the standard of living, so that the masses can live in comfort and happiness. The way to apply fiscal policy lies in this.

### The Chinese Insurance Industry Over the Past Fifty Years

— Wang Xiaowen

Mr. Wang Xiaowen has contributed an article entitled "The Chinese Insurance Industry Over the Past Fifty Years" to our bank's commemorative publication. The content is rich and the writing elegant. The following is its introduction. – Editor’s Note –

The beginning of the Kingly Way lies in enabling the people to live well and pass away without regrets. Mencius spoke of this more than two thousand years ago. With the rise of insurance systems, a path to the Kingly Way has been opened. Human life is finite, and the world is impermanent. Only by planning for the aftermath in our remaining years can we secure funds for medical care and funerals, and prevent the lonely and widowed from being left without support. This is how life insurance can ensure a passing without regrets. Only by preparing for dangers in times of peace and prosperity can we secure ourselves against war, fire, and water damage, drawing from external resources and looking forward to recovery. This is how property insurance can ensure a life without regrets. By paying a minimal price, one obtains vast financial security. From the perspective of the insured, insurance is truly a social welfare undertaking. Insurance does not guarantee that danger will necessarily occur, nor does it guarantee that danger will necessarily not occur. It only guarantees that, should the insured object suffer economic loss due to danger, appropriate compensation will be provided. The laws of probability are inherently uncertain. Pooling idle funds from the populace and increasing substantial capital allows for investments in construction, which can enrich the nation. Confucius said, "When the people are sufficient, with whom would the ruler be insufficient?" Therefore, the development of the insurance industry is truly a primary source of the nation's capital. From the perspective of the insurance industry, insurance is deeply and profoundly connected to the national economy. In today's world, the insurance businesses of Britain and America are renowned for their robust capital. Britain is a pioneer and continues to hold the reins of the global fire insurance industry. The United States' life insurance business accounts for over 70% of the world's total. As for a new system that has captured global attention, none is more prominent than that of Soviet Russia. The scope of the Soviet insurance system is even broader than that of various capitalist nations, further demonstrating that the insurance industry is not a capitalist organization pursuing profit, but rather an institution that supports social welfare, promotes social health, strives for the well-being of the people, and assists in economic construction. Looking back at our own country, what is the situation? A review of China's insurance industry over the past fifty years is indispensable. By learning from the past, we can know the future, and perhaps this can aid in its advancement.

Did our country have what we consider an insurance system in ancient times? Books and records are scarce, and I dare not speculate to satisfy my own assumptions. Based on what can be verified, China's insurance industry began over a hundred years ago with the Union Insurance Society of Canton Ltd. in Hong Kong in 1835 (Qing Daoguang Year 15) and the Canton Insurance Office, Ltd. the following year. Regrettably, both companies were operated by British merchants, and the Chinese people had a vague understanding of the insurance business. In 1843 (Daoguang Year 20), the Treaty of Nanjing was established, and Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, Xiamen, and Fuzhou were simultaneously opened as trading ports. British merchant power grew daily, and Shanghai's city conditions gradually prospered. In 1846 (Daoguang Year 26), British merchants established the Standard and Oriental companies in Shanghai to conduct life insurance. In 1862 (Tongzhi Year 1), the North China and Yangtse companies were established to conduct fire and marine insurance. Chinese merchants were unable to compete effectively. China's insurance industry truly began in 1885 (Guangxu Year 11) with the Renhe and Jihe insurance companies (now merged into Renjihe Insurance Company), the first attempts by Chinese merchants to independently operate fire and marine insurance. However, fifty years had passed since the establishment of Union Insurance, meaning that our Chinese insurance industry had been monopolized by foreign merchants for fifty years. In this first period of fifty years, China had virtually no insurance to speak of, which is truly regrettable.

I have always believed that a nation as impoverished as ours cannot achieve wealth and power without utilizing foreign capital. However, utilizing foreign capital in productive enterprises is acceptable, while allowing our national capital to be utilized by foreigners is absolutely unacceptable. Foreign investment in productive enterprises can aid our construction and revitalize our nation, but allowing our national capital to be utilized by foreigners will ultimately have the opposite effect. The insurance business absorbs the wealth of the people. If it were entirely operated by foreigners, how could this meager national strength not drift away on foreign ships? Our nation would inevitably lament being tied to the sang tree, unable to escape. After 1885 (Guangxu Year 11), enlightened individuals in our country seemed to have recognized this. From 1885 (Guangxu Year 11) to 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), Chinese merchants did their utmost to develop and cultivate the insurance business in order to compete with foreign merchants. The following is a table listing the insurance companies established by Chinese merchants during this second period of fifty years:

According to the above statistics, 53 insurance companies were established in China during the second fifty-year period. 13 companies ceased operations, leaving 40 companies still existing as of 1936 (Republic of China Year 24). The following tables further illustrate their nature and distribution:

(A) Nature of Organization

(B) Geographical Distribution (Based on Headquarters Location)

Furthermore, regarding foreign insurance businesses, according to statistics at the end of 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), six had headquarters in Shanghai and six in Hong Kong. The number of branch offices and agencies was even greater. The following is a breakdown by nationality of all foreign insurance businesses with headquarters, branch offices, and agencies in China:

Number by Nationality

United Kingdom 76

United States 23

Japan 14

Germany 9

France 8

Netherlands 11

Australia 4

Canada 3

Switzerland 2

Italy 2

Norway 1

Denmark 1

India 1

Philippines 1

Uruguay 1

East Indies 1

Total 157. Compared to Chinese merchants, they still seem numerous and we few. Although the efforts of Chinese people in the insurance industry seem to be laying the initial foundations, even if one shortens the mountain by nine loads, or overturns only one basket of earth, we must not slacken our efforts.

### How to Utilize Government Bond Policy

— Chen Bingzhang

Mr. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, has contributed an article entitled "China's Public Debt Over the Past Fifty Years" to our bank's commemorative publication. It is over ten thousand words long, rich in content, and statistically detailed, making it a highly valuable historical record. The following section contains the conclusion of that article.

— Editor’s Note —

In reviewing the general state and achievements of China's public debt policy over the past fifty years, and in order to encourage future progress, it is necessary to conduct an objective study of how to strengthen the utilization of public debt policy in the future. I will now offer my humble opinions on the following points:

(1) Coordinating with National Fiscal and Economic Policies: The primary sources of wartime funding are nothing more than increased taxes, bond issuance, and increased currency issuance. Among these, increasing currency issuance is the most dangerous. In recent years, currency inflation and high prices have led to widespread hardship and industrial decline. Therefore, to compensate for financial shortfalls in the future, we should utilize public debt policy and not rely solely on increasing currency issuance. In particular, we should coordinate with national economic policies. Economic policy should aim to enrich the people, allowing them to accumulate wealth. Then, the government will naturally have a source of revenue. This is the fundamental solution and the true way to generate income.

(2) Establishing Government Creditworthiness: The government issues public debt to supplement its own shortcomings, taking from the people and using it for the people. However, the key lies in the word "credit." If the government acts in a way that betrays the people's trust, it will be difficult to sell public bonds and even more difficult to borrow foreign debt. Therefore, before the war of resistance, financial authorities made establishing creditworthiness their motto, and the issuance of debt proceeded smoothly. This was not an unwise measure. In the future, the government should resolve to make a fresh start with the people and gradually find ways to restore its credibility.

(3) Improving Bond Issuance Methods: The issuance of public debt should raise funds from the public to directly absorb people's savings. If the Bank of Communications provides mortgage loans, it is tantamount to increasing currency issuance, negating the meaning of issuing public debt. After the establishment of the National Government in 1927 (Republic of China Year 16), various public debts were still largely adopted through mortgage methods. Although the method of widespread public subscription was adopted during the war of resistance, it did not achieve significant results due to various obstacles. The method of apportionment was particularly prone to abuses, causing widespread complaints among the people. In the future, we should avoid bank mortgages on the one hand and improve direct sales methods to the public on the other, striving for widespread and open procedures, cultivating the habit of free public subscription, and truly achieving the goal of absorbing idle social capital.

(4) Establishing a Public Debt Market: Public debt is a type of negotiable security. In principle, it should be allowed to circulate freely. During the war of resistance, the financial center shifted to the rear, but the securities market was not fully developed, preventing bonds from being publicly and freely traded. Although the Shanghai Stock Exchange reopened last September, post-war finances have not been stable, and the Shanghai market has seen many abnormal developments. The listing of public debt requires careful consideration. In the future, when market conditions improve, the government should set a time to allow public debt to be listed and traded, establishing a public market and regulating finance.

(5) Defining the Principles and Purposes of Borrowing: Foreign borrowing should be based on the fundamental principles of equality and mutual benefit, without harming national interests. Its purpose should be limited to economic construction, especially the expenses of various undertakings stipulated in industrial plans. The purpose of domestic debt should also be clearly defined and supervised by representative bodies. It should also be determined that the Ministry of Finance is the unified agency for debt management, which is sufficient to achieve the effect of utilization and control. In the past, various ministries and commissions contacted foreign countries for loans on their own, leading to disorganized procedures and a lack of overall consideration. In the future, the Ministry of Finance should be the sole agency for foreign borrowing.

(6) Establishing a Comprehensive Plan for Foreign Loans: The Premier's industrial plan lists many things that should be done, but they cannot all be done simultaneously. They should be prioritized in order of importance and urgency. A comprehensive plan should be developed to determine which should come first and which should come later. Each agency that needs materials should prepare a business plan and a list of the types and quantities of materials needed, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for compilation and approval of the overall plan. In the future, loans should be negotiated and allocated to foreign countries by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the agencies in accordance with the plan.

(7) Control over the Use of Loans and Finances: The failure of foreign debt in the past was often due to the misuse of funds and the waste of finances, resulting in the failure of undertakings and the inability to repay debts, which harmed the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the Premier's industrial plan is implemented, it will require vast amounts of money. Therefore, strict measures must be taken to audit the use of foreign debt for each undertaking and to control financial expenditures. This should be done by the competent authorities, the Ministry of Finance, and related agencies, which should organize a financial supervision institution to carry out the responsibilities of auditing and disbursement, and to establish business ties.

The above points are the essential outline of public debt policy. If we borrow based on this policy, encouraging savings, absorbing funds, promoting construction, increasing production, stabilizing finances, balancing the budget, regulating foreign trade, and improving people's lives, then everyone will use their talents, everything will be used to its fullest extent, the land will be used to its fullest potential, and goods will flow smoothly. Thus, the source of wealth will increase daily, the national use will always be sufficient, and the use of public debt policy will be essential to the construction of China's finance and economy.

### Current Status of the Bank of Communications

— Luo Qinghua

Foreword

The Bank of Communications has been in existence for fifty years since its establishment. Regarding the history of its reforms and changes during these fifty years, Chairman Du Yuesheng has already recorded a general account. Now, I will briefly describe its current situation.

Organizational System

The organizational system of our bank is nominally a head office system, but in reality, it is a general management office system. The purpose is to adopt the advantages of both and eliminate their disadvantages. Since its trial implementation, it has achieved significant results. The internal organizational system of our bank is listed below:

According to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance in 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), our bank has seven official shareholder directors and four commercial shareholder directors; three official supervisor directors and two commercial shareholder supervisors, for a total of sixteen directors and supervisors. The current directors and supervisors are:

Branch Institutions

In the past, during Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai's leadership, the branch institutions of our bank were distributed not only throughout the country but also as far as Singapore and Hong Kong. Later, due to mismanagement by the leaders and the poor performance of the business, it only extended to the southeastern corner. Since Chairman Du Yuesheng took office in 1935 (Republic of China Year 24), he has worked diligently to govern and has shown signs of revitalization. It is expected that it will not be difficult to restore the old appearance in the short term. The current distribution of head offices and branch institutions and their responsible persons are listed below:

Personnel System

Since the restoration, our bank has been fully promoting its business. Last summer, we publicly recruited staff and students and trained them. The purpose is to enrich the knowledge and skills of staff members, improve their service ethics, and cultivate sound cadres. As a result of the examination, a total of sixty people were admitted and trained in two phases. The first phase has already been completed and assigned to positions; the second phase is currently in training.

The training method is divided into the following three categories:

A. Internship: Trainees are assigned to various internship offices in accordance with actual needs. During business hours, they are guided by the supervisors of each office and rotate through various departments to gain a concept of the following work activities: 1. Document Department (1) Receiving and dispatching (2) Drafting (3) Editing (4) Archiving; 2. Accounting Department (1) Copying and reporting (2) Recording the general ledger (3) Recording the inter-bank account and measuring funds (4) Reviewing (5) Balancing the account; 3. Business Department (1) Deposits (2) Loans (3) Remittances (4) Exchanges (5) Exchanges (6) Fellow traders; 4. Cash Department (1) Receipts (2) Payments; 5. Savings Department.

B. Academic Training: Trainees follow the prescribed time to attend lectures in the training classroom daily. The subjects are: banking business, banking accounting, commercial calculation, financial regulations, financial markets, personnel and administrative management, documentation, and commercial English.

C. Spiritual Training: Senior executives of our bank serve as lecturers, and special experts are invited to give lectures. These are held once every other week, and trainees take notes during the lectures. In addition, trainees submit a daily work diary, the content of which is limited to: 1. Internship situation, 2. Work progress, feelings and experiences, 3. Lecture summary, 4. Suggestions for improvement or enhancement, 5. Reading questions, 6. Views on financial and economic trends, etc.

Business Overview

After the victorious end of the war, the domestic and foreign financial and economic situation has instantly unfolded a new page. Due to the abnormal financial and economic conditions created by the extraordinary wartime environment, it is not easy to clear up for a while, and there are thorns ahead that need to be overcome. The unprecedented economic tide is now coming with the victory, and all industries, commerce, finance, etc. throughout the country are shaken by wind and rain, and are in danger of not being able to last for a long time! Fortunately, our bank has the long history of serving the society in the past, as well as the new spirit nurtured by the times in recent years, and it is still able to prepare for the worst and respond to the opportunity to strive hard.

The business overview of our bank since the victory is described as follows:

1. Deposits: In wartime economy, there are many special morbidities, and the psychology of general depositors has mostly changed, and idle funds are mostly not passed through the bank. Our bank adheres to its position, and the absorption of deposits is normal, and does not compete with the black market. The main countermeasure is to promote the establishment of credit and improve service efficiency. The number of deposits can still maintain a considerable level. At the end of the European war, we strengthened the replenishment of deposit reserves and fully stored cash, waiting to cope with it. Therefore, when the gold rush and the withdrawal of depositors after the victory, we were able to respond calmly and were not affected, and the deposits in each bank increased instead. In Shanghai, due to the exchange of counterfeit currency, there were also more deposits. As for savings deposits, it is not easy to absorb them due to the depression of people's livelihood after the war, but in order to promote thrift, they are still held, but the effect is not obvious.

2. Loans: In recent years, industrial and mining production has been shrinking, commercial capital has been expanding too fast, and the trend of speculation and hoarding has intensified. The use of funds in various industries has no seasonality, and the lending objects of silver and money industries have gradually lost their basis. Under the conditions of legality and safety, our bank's loans still focus on short-term, flexible, tight credit, emphasize pledges, customers strive for dispersion, and collateral is easy to sell, especially those that can be re-mortgaged and re-discounted. For example, salt blocks in Zigong, coal in Weiyuan, wool, leather, medicinal herbs, and water tobacco, which are special products of the Northwest, are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and we have devoted ourselves to supporting them. Before the situation took a sharp turn for the worse, our bank had prepared in advance to tighten loans and recover debts from old customers. Therefore, even when the market was in a state of urgency and the silver and money industries were in a state of anxiety, we did not have to worry about it in an emergency. The funds required were fully adjusted by the Chongqing and Chongqing banks, and no loans were borrowed from the central banks in various places. This shows that our bank's use of funds strives for prudence. After the victory, the market did not return to normal, and most of the industry peers were in a wait-and-see state. Our bank still selected customers with good credit and gave them loans to avoid dark consumption.

3. Remittances: Our bank is keen on operating remittances. All cash adjustments such as cash transportation, purchase and sale of foreign exchange are done to the best of our ability, and we entrust industry peers in various places to sign agency collection contracts to actively expand the remittance network. Since the victory and restoration, the price difference between Shanghai and the mainland has been huge, and funds have flowed east for a while. Our bank seized the opportunity and first applied to commercial banks to apply for remittances, which was convenient for customers. The surplus obtained from the remittances was enough to offset the losses caused by the contraction of loans and the restoration expenses after the end of the war.

4. Profit and Loss: Regarding the profit and loss situation in the last year, the income is mainly from interest, and the expenses are due to the continued rise in prices. Only the early stage of the victory was slightly stable, and the restoration expenses accounted for most of the expenses. Fortunately, we were able to work hard to save money and did not exceed the limit. The final settlement at the end of the year was still profitable.
