### The National Army in Siping Reaches Changchun; Communist Bandits Waver Around Yongji; Sixth Offensive Utterly Fails

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 2nd] After land communication between Shenyang and Changchun was completely opened on the 1st, the National Army is rapidly advancing, and the Northeast war has entered a stage of significant change. General Pan Yu-kun, commander of the New First Army, who had been stationed in Siping for a whole month to command operations, returned to Changchun by car from Fanjiatun this afternoon. Staff Officer Shi Shuo accompanied him. The people were extremely excited to see the endless stream of vehicles entering the city from the south, believing that a new phase in the Changji battle had begun. General Pan told reporters: "We welcome the communist bandits to attack strongholds." But the communist bandits really do not have the courage and strength. The battles of Dehui and Siping are major lessons they have not forgotten. General Pan, though showing signs of fatigue from the battlefield, was in high spirits. It is reported that Generals Pan and Shi flew to Shenyang and then transferred to Siping on October 2nd.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] The National Army under Pan Yu-kun, which won brilliant victories in the southern section of Chang-Shen last month, arrived in Changchun from Siping on the 2nd. The unit's seven columns, equipped with high-speed mechanized equipment, covered the 270 li distance between Siping and Changchun in 36 hours, overcoming layers of obstruction from the bandit army along the way in Caijia, Gongzhuling, Fanjiatun and other places, killing and wounding more than 2,000 bandits. (Another dispatch) After the entire Chang-Pan line was completely opened, the remnant bandits along the Ping-Mei line are expected to be cleared soon, and the Jilin war situation is becoming increasingly stable.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 2nd] The National Army, which joined forces in Fanjiatun, is sweeping up remnant bandits in the area west of Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun. When the National Army moving north from Siping attacked Gongzhuling at 3:00 AM on the 1st, the bandits were fast asleep and nearly a thousand were eliminated, with over two hundred captured alive. The bandits in Gongzhuling can be said to have been completely wiped out.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 3rd] Jilin has been besieged for eighteen days and nights since the 16th. However, last night and today, the surroundings were quiet with no major fighting. It is reported that the main force of the Second Column of bandits attacking the southwestern suburban positions has withdrawn from the battlefield and retreated towards the Daishui River. The bandit forces around all the fronts are also wavering. Our air force flew in search of bandit traces this morning before dawn, taking advantage of the moonlight, and continued throughout the day. The sounds of bombing and strafing gradually faded. Our ground forces are preparing to counterattack. It is reported that after being scattered on the Middle East Railway, the communist bandits concentrated their remaining forces to besiege Jilin, in an attempt to slightly reverse the decline. Unexpectedly, after eighteen days, they have lost 20,000 troops without gaining an inch. Thus, their sixth offensive has come to a complete and utter failure.

[Another dispatch] The Tuanshanzi position outside the trenches in the southwestern suburbs of Yongji, after thirty-one nights of fierce fighting, has been completely destroyed. After the defending troops withdrew, our air force immediately bombed the area, making it unusable by the bandits. The area has now become a vacuum. According to a military report released on the battle of Tuanshanzi: the bandits used the main force of the First Column, the 33rd, 66th, and 77th Regiments, and the Independent First Division, totaling about ten thousand men, with more than 30 mountain and field guns, launching more than ten fierce attacks on our positions from all sides from dusk onward. The fighting was unprecedentedly fierce. The defending troops fought bravely. By midnight, the ground around Tuanshanzi and the trenches were filled with bandit corpses, estimated at over three thousand. It is reported that Youshanzi is an advanced stronghold in the southwest of Jilin, with a prominent position. The defending troops, with less than two hundred men, resisted tens of thousands of bandits for days, repeatedly thwarting their fierce attacks, and injuring or killing over five thousand bandits.

[Another dispatch] The Jilin assault team launched a multi-pronged attack on the evening of the 2nd to strike at the scattered bandits fleeing from the outer perimeter of Jilin.

### Chairman Chiang Cables Encouragement to Commander Tseng Tse-sheng

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 1st] Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram to Tseng Tse-sheng, commander of the Jilin defending forces, praising him: "The stubborn bandits, with their superior numbers, have continuously attacked our Jilin fiercely. Thanks to your masterful command and the bravery of the officers and soldiers, you have inflicted a severe blow on the bandits. In particular, the defenders of Tuanshanzi, with their unwavering spirit and courage, have achieved a great victory with fewer troops against a larger enemy. I am greatly gratified. I hope you will continue to inspire your subordinates and further display our fearless spirit to annihilate the stubborn bandits."

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 2nd] Deng Baoshan arrived in Zhazake on the 1st. The Yulin defending troops recaptured the Lingxiaota position on the 30th, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 1st] Communist bandits in eastern Jilin wreak havoc around the outskirts of Jilin City, robbing, looting, raping, and killing without restraint. According to refugees who escaped from Dachangtun, the communist bandits have new ways of killing people, which are cruel and inhumane. They even killed a Jia head in the village in the manner of slaughtering a pig. The Jia head was tied to a table, his hands and feet were cut off first, then his heart and liver were dug out, and then his whole body was cut into pieces and forcibly sold to wealthy households at 5,000 yuan per catty. After purchasing it, they were forced to cook and eat it. Those who disobeyed were killed in the same way. The people hated it to the bone.

### The Issue of Training Troops in Taiwan is Not Related to US Loan Policy

[Reuters, Nanking, 2nd] Military, political, and economic officials here believe that the US Military Advisory Group's training of Chinese soldiers in Taiwan is not the beginning of US military or financial aid to China.

Furthermore, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie stated that the expansion of the US Military Advisory Group's activities to Taiwan is not related to the US loan policy toward China. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, believes that this move is not related to US financial or economic aid, or is an action taken in accordance with the newly established US military policy.

I only suggested that the ports of Nanjing and Wuhan in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River should be reopened to foreign ships, just like the current ports of Swatow, Amoy, and Shanghai." He also stated that this suggestion had not been formally presented to Chinese government officials, but was only made in response to the difficulties in inland transportation in China.

### Hu Shih Busily Lectures; After Advocating Vernacular Chinese, Discusses Merchants

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 2nd] Hu Shih has been actively lecturing recently. Yesterday, he attended two events and gave what he called "extra lectures." One was at the Peiping-Tientsin Railway Bureau, where he talked about the vernacular Chinese movement. He said that this movement originated from a discussion about old poetry with a classmate when he was studying in the United States. He stated that Chinese literature has an upper-level literature of classical Chinese and a lower-level literature of vernacular Chinese. The vernacular Chinese gradually became popular after the May Fourth Movement. He said that "Mandarin" became the national language because 90% of the country is a Mandarin-speaking area, and 75% of the population speaks Mandarin. From Harbin in the far northeast to Kunming, they all speak Mandarin. 300 million people speak one language, which is unprecedented in the world. Finally, he emphasized that official documents should also be quickly changed to vernacular Chinese. Hu Shih's other lecture was at the Merchants' Festival celebration in Peiping. Hu Shih said that his grandfather was also a merchant, so he was willing to take a stand as a descendant of merchants and advocated that merchants should strive for equality and no longer be exploited, and overthrow the Confucian traditional idea of despising merchants as "those who eat without plowing and wear without weaving." Hu Shih also cited Sima Qian's "Biographies of Money-Makers," saying that wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the creeds that merchants should believe in, and extended to say that today's merchants should have great wisdom.

### Wang Yaowu Arrives in Zhengzhou to Meet Zhu Tong and Report on Shandong Military and Political Affairs

### Shaanxi Has a Bumper Cotton Harvest This Year; Transportation and Cash Are Two Major Problems

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 2nd] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation, arrived in Xi'an by air from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 1st to inspect the cotton production situation in various places. A reporter came along. It is reported that Shaanxi Province has improved cotton seeds this year, and the area planted is as large as 3 million mu. The estimated output can reach 880,000 dan, of which 80% has already been harvested. Currently, the market price here is only about 2 million yuan per dan. The biggest difficulties at present are transportation problems and cash shortages. Taking the Textile Construction Corporation's purchase of cotton as an example, 60% of the cotton payment needs to be paid by check, and the cash discount is 10%. The market price of yarn and cloth here has been stable recently. The Shanghai New 20-count yarn is 23.5 million per piece, and the local Dahua Yanta cloth is 1.02 million per bolt. General Chennault came here weeks ago to negotiate the air transport of Shaanxi cotton and had discussions with the provincial government. It is reported that the planned plan is to dispatch one aircraft to travel between Shaanxi and Shanghai every day, which can fly from Xi'an to Shanghai four times a week, carrying 5.5 tons of cotton each time, and can transport about 88 tons per month. The return trip from Shanghai to Xi'an is loaded with daily necessities. It is heard that the contract for this air transport of materials can be signed in Shanghai within days. Furthermore, the Northwest Industrial Company of Henan Province is also in contact with the Air Transport Brigade to load daily necessities in Shanghai and fly to Zhengzhou. After unloading in Zhengzhou, the return flight flies to Xi'an to transport cotton to Shanghai.

### US Takes Aid to China Measures; Marshall Can Decide Before Going to England

[United Press, Washington, 1st] US Secretary of State Marshall will decide whether the US should continue to provide aid to China in order to strengthen its central government and curb the expansion of the Communist Party. This matter may be decided before Mr. Marshall goes to London later this month to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to official statements today, the Chinese issue is a major emergency issue. Washington has received reports that American authorities in Nanking believe that in order to save China from disaster, Chairman Chiang and his hard-fighting army must be given aid early next year. Marshall has ordered his senior staff and advisors to find ways to provide the Chinese government with limited financial and economic assistance, such as relief supplies, and to strengthen the strength of the National Army. Marshall, who previously served in China as President Truman's special envoy, has kept aid to China to a minimum since returning home, providing only a batch of bullets a few months ago. The US's limited assistance is in compliance with the so-called "no action" policy here, pending the reorganization of the National Government itself, transferring more power to the hands of the moderates that Marshall believes in. Although some of these leaders have been appointed, the impression gained by the State Department is that they have no real power. Marshall's main goal of liberating the Chinese government has not yet been achieved. In fact, the communist direction is slightly the opposite. Earlier this week, the Chinese government banned the Democratic League. What the US authorities are focusing on seems to be the only real force in China other than the Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, US policy toward China is deeply involved in the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union, which is a basic fact, but there has been no formal evidence here that the CCP is being actively supplied or directed by the Soviet Union. One point that the US is considering is to limit its aid to China in some form so as not to provoke an open struggle between the US and the Soviet Union in China. Marshall's study of the Chinese situation is largely based on the survey report recently submitted by General Mai. This report is locked in a safe in the State Department, labeled top secret, but there is no doubt in the official mind that Wei proposed that the United States give China broad assistance, or even broader than Marshall and the State Department are willing to give at this time.

Editorial

### Cautious First General Election

The elections for National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors are soon to be held successively. The Shanghai Municipal Election Committee will meet tomorrow to review the qualifications of candidates running for National Assembly representative, and the list of candidates nominated by political parties is expected to be announced on the 6th. This demonstrates the government's active preparation for the election. However, this election is the first of its kind since the National Assembly formulated the Constitution. Its gains and losses not only concern the democratic style of Chinese politics going forward, but also the future of constitutional government in China will depend on this election. As the saying goes, "Be cautious in the initial planning of a matter." This election is the first step in China's political journey toward democracy, and it must be handled with special care. When the Shanghai Municipal Council was about to close, it also passed a temporary motion to "request the government to handle the general election with special caution." When Councilor Tao Baichuan delivered a reply on behalf of all councilors, he also said: "Shanghai will soon elect representatives to the National Assembly, legislators, and supervisors. We hope that we can fulfill the task of being a flat mirror so that we can hope that they can be a microscope and telescope." Therefore, in order to enable China's politics to truly embark on the path of democracy, we cannot but hope that this general election can be handled with caution to establish a new style of democratic politics.

First, we must make the whole country, from top to bottom, cherish and love this Constitution, which was exchanged for blood and flesh. Leaving aside the constitutional movement at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the constitutional history of the early Republic of China, even from the process of the Legislative Yuan starting to draft the Constitution, the birth of this Constitution is unknown how much effort legal scholars have put in? In terms of the time experienced, it lasted for 15 years, from February 1933 to the public announcement on New Year's Day 1947, which is unmatched by the Constitution of any country. Therefore, when Chairman Chiang submitted the draft Chinese Constitution to the National Assembly for deliberation, he said: "This draft Constitution submitted today can be said to have been prepared with the blood and tears of the military and civilians of the whole country for the past 50 years." I remember that the convening of the National Assembly also went through many twists and turns. The established date of convening was also postponed repeatedly, for a total of five times. Even at the last time, it still failed to be held as scheduled and had to be postponed for another three days. From this, it can be seen that this Constitution was not easy to create. Now that we have a Constitution that has emerged from difficulties, it is not easy to deal with. Every word and sentence is hard work and effort. How can we not cherish it especially! Looking at the content of this Constitution, it was made under the meticulous and thorough research and repeated deliberation of many experts and scholars. It not only has lofty ideals, catering to the new trend of the world after the war; but also can take into account the actual situation of domestic politics and the needs of society; to be honest, this is the newest Constitution in the world after the war. How can we allow it to become a dead letter and not cherish it? However, the value of the Constitution lies in its implementation. Our love for the Constitution lies in enabling the provisions stipulated in this Constitution to be realized. The National Assembly is the only organ for implementing the Constitution. How can we not be cautious about the election of National Assembly representatives?

Second, we must enable the whole country, from top to bottom, to understand that the democratization of Chinese politics should seek progress through learning, and we are currently in the initial stage of learning. Although our country's political thought is full of democratic ideas, because the politics of past dynasties have been a kind of enlightened monarchy, there has been no democratic polity until today. Only today do we have a democratic Constitution, and only then can we implement constitutional government. Most people are not very clear about the use of democratic constitutional government, let alone use it freely; especially for elections, they do not know what it is. People with the right to vote do not know the value of the right to vote and cherish this vote: People running for election often do not know how to win the sympathy of voters with policy programs, but want to exchange money and wine for voters' votes. This phenomenon is of course unavoidable in democratic advanced countries; but we still hope that Chinese politics can catch up with the support of the production, and never let this kind of malpractice occur. However, in order to avoid this malpractice, various parties implement a party nomination system. The Kuomintang adopts the method of designating candidates for the election of party comrades, and does not allow comrades of the party to freely compete for election. According to the Kuomintang's consistent spirit, it has always adopted a system of democratic centralism. Party members can freely express their opinions and participate in discussions on the party's decisions before they are made; but after the decisions are made, party members can only obey. Recently, a few party members, dissatisfied with the state-designated method, advocated free competition. We believe that this view is wrong. The so-called democratic politics must go through the relationship of political parties to show the direction of public opinion. Taking the election of members of the US Congress as an example, people only know the party when they vote, and do not know the person. The success of the Republican candidate in the election in New York State is the victory of the Republican Party, not the personal success of the candidate. If comrades of a party are allowed to compete freely, it will not only weaken the strength of the party, but also cause disputes within the party. However, we also hope that the responsible supervisors in charge of the designation can handle affairs with an attitude of impartiality and selflessness, and separately review the candidate's qualifications and their reputation in the local area, and take this as the standard for selection. At the same time, we also hope that the supervisors can not participate in the election in principle, so as to avoid the suspicion of "designating themselves."

Third, we must make all candidates in the country aware of the current Chinese politics. The so-called "difficulties are everywhere" has indeed reached the most serious period; all future hopes are pinned on the constitutional National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan: After the general election, whether the National Assembly can start anew with the people and make the whole country look new is the responsibility of the newly elected National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors. All those who are enthusiastically participating in the election now should remain calm in their enthusiasm, and reflect on their own motives for running for election? Is it for the country and the people? Or is it only for personal prominence? We do not object to capable people participating in the election so that they can shoulder the task of nation-building, but we do not approve of participating in the election solely for personal advancement to achieve personal desires. However, from the perspective of a third party, it is difficult to distinguish their inner motives; and enthusiastically participating in the election is ultimately a good phenomenon from a democratic perspective. However, people participating in the election should have a democratic style. They must not only be able to withstand the criticism of the people, but also always adopt an attitude of concession, and not think that failure is a shame and success is an honor. If this can be done, not only will malpractices not emerge endlessly, but election disputes can also be reduced.

In short, we the people need to learn democratic politics in practice, and the government should handle the first general election with caution to avoid malpractices and establish a new style of democracy and lay the foundation for constitutional government in our country.

### British Delegation to China Hosts Journalists

(Continued from page one) Then, Lindsay, a member of the delegation, answered questions, saying: "Regarding the current situation in Northeast and North China, because I have not been to the Communist areas and battlefields, I have no understanding and cannot comment." He also avoided mentioning his remarks about suppressing the Communists in Ping. As for the government's announcement that the Democratic League is an illegal organization, they do not have a clear understanding of the Democratic League. If the Democratic League is indeed a part of the Communist Party, then it will not be able to become an independent democratic political party, and the government's measures should have sufficient reasons. Regarding the issue of the administrative efficiency of the Chinese government, he said that any government should improve its administrative efficiency at any time. Finally, Robert said that after they return to their country, they will introduce the situation in China to the British people. British agricultural implements are most suitable for small and medium-sized farming, but he does not know under what circumstances the British government can discuss with the Chinese government on how to assist in this matter. He solemnly stated that British foreign policy will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and does not want any country to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. He believes that Marshal Ma's mediation of the Chinese political struggle last year was obtained with the consent of both parties, and was definitely not an interference in internal affairs. As for the point of arms aid, whether it is suspected of interference, he refused to comment. Robert also reiterated on behalf of the delegation that this trip is a purely friendly visit, with no task of negotiating on any particular matter, nor of criticizing the foreign policy of other countries. After being in China for many days, they have been warmly received by the Chinese government and people, and are very grateful. After the press conference, the group of six went to the British Embassy to rest for a while. At 11:30, accompanied by Ambassador Stevenson and Wang Jihui, a member of the Bin Department of our country, they went to the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan to bid farewell to President Zhang and took a photo as a memento. After leaving, they went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Foreign Minister Wang and were invited to a luncheon. From 5:00 to 7:00 in the afternoon, the delegation held a cocktail party at the International Friendship Association to bid farewell to celebrities from all walks of life in our country. At 8:00 in the evening, Indian Ambassador Menon hosted a farewell banquet.

### Key Points for Handling Materials Received by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)

(Continued from page one) For the remaining relief materials of each branch office, the Ministry of Social Affairs will appoint directors of social affairs bureaus of various provinces and cities or other personnel as representatives. Within one week after the completion of the receipt, they shall register the names and quantities of the items, and report them to the Ministry, and publish them in the local newspapers. If there are any shortages, damages, mildew, or rot, they shall be noted in detail item by item. After the receipt, the director of the bureau or other receiving personnel shall be responsible for proper custody, and shall not move them. It is strictly forbidden to convert them into administrative expenses. After the receipt, a detailed distribution plan shall be formulated for the received materials within two weeks, and submitted to the Ministry for approval and distribution. Before the approval is obtained, no one shall be allowed to arbitrarily dispose of or distribute them. The aforementioned distribution plan shall be jointly considered and formulated with the local public opinion organs, local impartial persons, and relevant relief agencies and organizations, and strive for openness and rationality. The received relief materials shall be distributed to the hands of those in need of relief as soon as possible before the end of this year. Even in special circumstances, they must be completed and distributed before the Spring Festival next year. The distribution shall be carried out jointly by personnel from relevant agencies and organizations to ensure that it is effective. The distribution of materials, the amount of distribution, and the recipients of relief shall be recorded in detail, and submitted to the Ministry for verification before the end of January next year, so that they can be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, and distributed to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and published in the central and local newspapers. The Ministry will send personnel to guide and check the receipt and distribution of relief materials in various places at any time, and the results of the handling will be an important basis for the performance evaluation of the directors of the bureaus, and will be rewarded or punished accordingly. All of the above items must be strictly followed, especially items two and three, which should be given special attention. If there are any changes, shortages, or arbitrary distribution, the director of the bureau or other receiving personnel shall be fully responsible.

### Negotiations on Chinese Immigration to Siam

(Continued from page one) According to Siam, when it planned to announce the implementation of immigration quotas in April of this year, it only allowed 10,000 immigrants from China per year, and 200 from other countries. Because the Siamese side had never restricted the immigration of our people in the past, and in the past, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese entered Siam every year, in view of the actual needs and to maintain the traditional relationship between the two peoples, our Ambassador to Siam, Li, repeatedly negotiated with the Siamese side. Later, with the consent of the Siamese Prime Minister, it was tentatively decided that the immigration quota for this year, from May to the end of the year, would be 10,000 people, and the number of immigrants after next year would be discussed separately. Unexpectedly, after the implementation, the Siamese Immigration Bureau suddenly made another interpretation, saying that the immigration quota for China this year was 10,000 people. After deducting the number of people who entered Siam from January to April, the actual quota from May to the end of the year was only 6,667 people. Our government could not agree to this interpretation that did not conform to the agreement between the two parties, and the Siamese side notified us of the full quota in advance, and suddenly sent back to China the overseas Chinese who they believed to be over quota, which was even more unreasonable. Therefore, after our serious negotiations, the Siamese government has agreed not to send back the overseas Chinese who have already arrived in Siam. As for the point of which month the quota of 10,000 should be counted from, negotiations are still ongoing.

### Most of China's Exported Bristles are Smuggled to Hong Kong; US Department of Commerce Releases Trade Situation

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Department of Commerce released a report stating that the United States imported more than half of the 2,395,000 pounds of Chinese bristles exported by China in the second quarter of this year. The value of the bristles exported by China during this period was US$7,596,000. According to reports from the US consuls in Chongqing and Qingdao, many Chinese bristle exporters are evading normal foreign trade channels and smuggling bristles to Hong Kong in exchange for higher profits. The US consul in Chongqing did not sign any bristle export applications in the first half of this year, while the US consul in Qingdao signed 160 bristle export applications from January to March this year, worth approximately 65 million yuan. The Department of Commerce reported on the bristle trade in Hong Kong, stating that almost all of the bristles arriving in Hong Kong were believed to have been transported through Chinese smuggling routes. It also stated that although Hong Kong has never been an important supplier of bristles, the operation of this business in the area has increased several times compared to decades ago.

### Fuzhou Prices Rise Again; Exports of Local Products Decline

[Report from our Fuzhou Office on the 2nd] Prices in Fuzhou have risen again. Rice has risen by tens of thousands due to the reported rise in prices in the producing areas. It is sold for 621,000 per dan in retail stores, edible oil is sold for 1.67 million, and tung oil is sold for 1.8 million. In addition, the export trade of local products in Fuzhou in October has declined sharply. According to the Fuzhou branch of the Import and Export Association, the reason for this is that the difference between the black market gold notes and the market price is too far, and general exporters are hesitant to move forward. Secondly, the purchasing power of foreign markets has recently weakened, and the reputation of Chinese goods exports has not been widely established.

### Behind the Iron Curtain • Farmlands Everywhere:  The Tragedy of an Agricultural Family

— Eighth Letter from Poland, by Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

The greatest secret in the Warsaw area is undoubtedly the military cooperation between Poland and Russia. The International Propaganda Bureau of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided me with all sorts of information, with the sole exception of anything related to military affairs. They are even reluctant to fabricate a number for the current size of Poland's standing army. One thing, however, is consistently maintained by officials of all ranks in the Polish government. They say: there are no Russian troops stationed on Polish territory because Poland is a sovereign state, and they have all returned home after the war.

However, according to Baisha, the center of European rumors, everyone says that Russia is manipulating Poland. Today, Warsaw's internal affairs and diplomacy are blatantly connected to Moscow. When the Marshall Plan for European recovery was announced, Warsaw newspapers enthusiastically supported it. But the moment Molotov stormed away and left Paris, the left-wing Polish newspapers attacked the Marshall Plan with even more ferocity than Moscow, claiming that Marshall wanted to use the "gold standard" to control Europe as a tool for a white imperialist takeover of the continent. Whether these are the words that the "broad masses of people" want to say is another question. What we see is that every little move made by the Warsaw government is in line with Moscow's attitude, sometimes even "surpassing the master," shouting with a hundred times the intensity of the Russians.

The Polish Communist Party, now renamed the "Labor Party," is estimated to have less than one million members. Regardless of its history, strength, or skills, it is insufficient to completely control the 23 million Polish people. Therefore, it is very clear that behind the Polish Communist Party, there is so-called "external force" at play, which is the Russian military garrison.

A Polish Foreign Ministry official explained it to me in more detail, saying:

There are no regular Russian garrison troops stationed in Poland. The Russian soldiers that many foreign tourists see along the railway lines, and the fact that we are called a nation "behind the iron curtain," is purely due to geographical and transportation circumstances.

He said, "You, sir, came from Germany and have seen the vast Russian occupation zone within Germany. The arrival, departure, and demobilization of these large numbers of Russian troops must pass through Poland. The Polish government, out of wartime alliance and gratitude for Russia's help in Poland's restoration, naturally cannot refuse them transit. In particular, there are three main railway lines in Poland that were newly built by the Russian military."

He added, "Before the war, Russian and German railways were both 'broad gauge,' but most of Poland's were narrow gauge. To reduce the need for transshipment, the Polish government allowed Russia to build these three north-south arteries that traverse the country. Therefore, the management and station rights belong to the Russian military. That is why many people see Russian soldiers wearing red star caps."

I don't know if all of this is true, but in any case, this explanation is very reasonable. Poles, like Asians, "value face." For over nine hundred years, Polish history has been a tragedy on the European international stage. National subjugation, dependence, and flattery have caused many Poles to be unable to hold their heads high in international gatherings. However, I ultimately believe that this is not the fault of the Polish national character. The real cause of the Polish tragedy is still its agricultural economic life.

Before 1939, Hitler often sang the praises of "industrial Germany, agricultural Poland." Poland supplied Germany with raw materials, food, and all other agricultural products, and then bought industrial products from Germany, even weapons essential for national defense. Europe is the birthplace of modern civilization, which is to say, industrial civilization. Germany, in the Bismarck era, completed the industrial model. Russia, under Peter the Great, also established the path to industry. Even Czechoslovakia, separated from Poland by the Carpathian Mountains, had the latest industrial base. Only Poland has never escaped its inherent nature as an "agricultural family." Before the First World War, Russia, Prussia, and Austria divided Poland, which in reality meant that three industrial countries controlled the ancient agricultural family on the Vistula River.

On my first day in Warsaw, Bao Jinpu (Yi), the chargé d'affaires at the embassy, told me, "Poland is currently the largest agricultural country in Europe. In a time of widespread food shortages in Europe, Poland's abundant agricultural products will amaze you." For more than ten days, I have been staying at the Bristol Hotel, with an endless supply of milk, bread, eggs, and butter. Polish restaurants, both large and small, cook like the Chinese, favoring "heavy oil," with even a layer of oil floating on the surface of the dishes. In midsummer, puppies and small blankets abound. Many "ice cream" shops, which they call "Lodzi," offer banana juice, bayberry juice, peach juice—all sorts of flavors. When the U.S. State Department sent a survey team to Europe to determine U.S. agricultural aid to each country, the head of the team, Mr. Halitt, ate and drank to his heart's content in Warsaw, and was extremely satisfied. He returned to Washington and reported to the State Department: "Poland has an abundance of agricultural products and does not need U.S. agricultural aid." (Continued on page 5)

### British Municipal Election Results:  Labor Party Suffers Unprecedented Defeat; Conservative Party Demands New Parliamentary Elections

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd.  Due to the various shortcomings of the Labor government, voter dissatisfaction has clearly increased. The rightward shift in the recent municipal elections is likely due to this. The Conservative Party, led by Lord Woolton, has demanded that the government call for new parliamentary elections, a demand that the government will undoubtedly reject. Today, the government released a statement on the preliminary election results, saying that while the results are disappointing, they do not indicate a drastic shift in political trends. The Labor Party has achieved great and significant victories over the past two years, and even if five percent of the municipal council seats were to shift from Labor to the Conservative Party, it would not affect the overall situation.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Labor Party has suffered a major setback in the council elections in 400 towns and cities in England and Wales. The results of the one-day municipal elections announced this morning show: the Conservative Party gained 631 seats and lost 17; the Labor Party gained 42 seats and lost 683; the Liberal Party gained 46 seats and lost 36; the Communist Party gained none and lost 9; the Independents gained 170 seats and lost 134. Former Food Minister Lord Woolton, the current chairman of the Conservative Party, declared after the election results were announced: the rightward trend indicated by the municipal election results has only one meaning, and I believe that the government must acknowledge that the House of Commons no longer represents democratic political thought and must hold new elections. The municipal elections not only express the people's opinions on local affairs, but also their political views on national affairs. The one-sided nature of the election situation shows that the British people no longer trust a government that has broken its promises and cannot lead the country out of chaos. Many people believe that if the government could devote itself to the primary task of revitalizing the country, many of the difficulties they are currently facing could be avoided; and if national affairs could be handled by more capable people, many things, even if unpleasant, would still need to be forced upon the people. The results of the municipal elections indicate not only the people's distrust of the Labor government, but also the revitalization and the strength of the national Conservative Party organization. Note that Mr. Woolton made this formal Conservative Party response to the municipal election results in his capacity as chairman of the Conservative Party.

The Labor Party has a majority of more than 140 seats over all other parties in the House of Commons. Yesterday's municipal elections show that the power held by the Labor Party has been seized by the Conservatives. The number of voters in each district ranged from 50 to 80 percent of the total electorate, which can be considered quite enthusiastic. The most severe blow suffered by the Labor Party was the loss of power in many large cities with extensive control over local finance, industry, commerce, and municipal affairs. For example, Manchester, Britain's largest industrial center, Birmingham, another industrial center, and York, Lancaster, Leeds, and other districts, were all taken from the Labor Party by the Conservatives. Voting in Scottish cities, the largest of which are Edinburgh and Glasgow, is scheduled for Tuesday. Elections in London will not be held until next year.

### Chairman of the U.S. Republican National Committee Vigorously Criticizes Truman, Saying That He Has Yielded to Radicals

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Reese, chairman of the Republican National Committee, denounced President Truman on the 2nd for equating high prices with foreign aid in his call for a special session of Congress. Reese said: "Truman's move is another concession to radicals, attempting to strengthen his position for next year's election by gaining their support."

Reese said that Truman had assured Republican leaders that if a special session of Congress had to be called, the sole purpose would be to aid other countries. However, this is in line with the demands of radicals, who are demanding the restoration of the Office of Price Administration and other radical organizations. Therefore, when calling a special session, Truman should at least give the effort to combat domestic inflation as much importance as the emergency aid to Europe bill, if not more.

### European Countries Oppose the Establishment of Supervisory Agencies

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is reported that Sir Franks, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Committee for European Economic Cooperation, which is discussing the Marshall Plan, recently visited Acting U.S. Secretary of State Lovett and gave him an informal memorandum, expressing the hope that U.S. officials who are drafting the Marshall Plan for European aid will not impose troublesome restrictions on the use by European governments of domestic currency obtained from the sale of materials obtained from the U.S. to their own people. Franks pointed out that any restrictions would necessarily differ from country to country, and that establishing independent agencies in each country to control these funds would hinder the government's control over its economy. It is also reported that the House Foreign Aid Committee, led by Representative Herter, is considering the establishment of a five-member committee consisting of members from the U.S. and each recipient country to monitor the use of funds.

### Allow Japan to Join the United Nations After the Formal Signing of the Peace Treaty:  Straightforward Statement by Our Representative Jiang Tingfu

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 1st. United Press] United Press reporters recently asked several representatives to the Far Eastern Commission for their opinions on Japan. The Chinese representative supported accepting Japan as a formal member of the United Nations as soon as the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Philippines strongly disagreed.

The Chinese representative, Jiang Tingfu, stated frankly that Japan should be allowed to join the United Nations as soon as the peace treaty with Japan is ratified. Although China fought Japan for more than ten years, it does not harbor permanent animosity towards Japan. After Japan has fulfilled all the obligations of a defeated nation, it must be allowed to stand in the international community. The Philippine representative, Romulo, completely disagreed with Jiang, saying that Japan should only be allowed to hold "probationary" status after the end of the peace conference with Japan. Japan should be considered for international status only after several years of "probation." Other major countries refused to answer this question. The Soviet representative, Ralomiko, said: "I have nothing to say on this matter."

### Final Results of French Municipal Elections

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] The Ministry of the Interior has announced the final results of the French municipal elections. The centrist, right-wing, and Gaullist parties won a total of 45.1 percent of the municipal council seats nationwide; the Socialist Party and the Independent Socialist Party won a total of 18.7 percent; the Radical Party won 20.5 percent; the Popular Republican Movement won 8.8 percent; and the Communist Party and near-Communist parties won a total of 6.9 percent.

### Turkey's Foreign Policy:  Promoting Good Neighborliness and Jointly Safeguarding Peace; Expressing Dissatisfaction with Unreasonable Demands from the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Ankara, 1st] Turkish President Inonu addressed the hundredth session of the Grand National Assembly today, pointing to the Soviet Union's rude accusations against Turkey. He said that Turkey is dissatisfied with its relations with the Soviet Union. Turkey tried to establish good relations with the Soviet Union, but was met with unreasonable accusations from the Soviet side. The Soviet Union reviews past and present events in an incorrect and unfair manner, and even makes unfair demands on Turkey.

After stating that the sole goal of Turkey's foreign policy is to achieve world peace and to assist as much as possible in the establishment of common security that all countries yearn for, Inonu discussed Turkey's relations with other countries individually. He said that Turkey's relations with Britain are very good, and Turkey deeply understands Britain's current difficulties and believes that it will win its current struggle soon. When mentioning the United States, Inonu said that this great democratic nation's decision to provide Turkey with aid proves its continuous efforts in the pursuit of peace. Turkey's relations with France are based on a long tradition of friendship and are still being actively developed. Turkey is also willing to strengthen its ties with Italy, and is deeply pleased that the new Italy has gradually restored its international status. When discussing domestic issues, Inonu said that the defense budget accounts for the largest portion of Turkey's new budget, and in view of certain circumstances, the defense budget may still not be able to meet all needs. He also emphasized that Turkey's main concern at present is to maintain its security.

### Next Session of the UN General Assembly to Be Held in Western Europe

### UN General Assembly Passes Resolution on Southwest Africa; India's Efforts Finally Succeed

[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] After a day-long debate, the General Assembly, by a vote of 41 to 10, with 4 abstentions, condemned the Union of South Africa for its failure to place the mandated territory of Southwest Africa under the United Nations trusteeship system. Last year, the General Assembly recommended that South Africa hand over Southwest Africa to the United Nations for trusteeship, but South Africa refused to comply. During this General Assembly vote, the colonial powers were defeated by the Muslim, Slavic, and most Asian countries. India, which had opposed South Africa for a long time, finally achieved victory.

### Differences of Opinion Between the US and the Soviet Union on the Palestine Partition Plan; Difficult to Accept British Responsibility for Security Alone

[Reuters, London, 2nd] London diplomatic observers believe that Britain will reject the U.S. proposal that British troops alone be responsible for security in Palestine before July 1948. However, a Foreign Office spokesman declined to say whether this decision had been notified to the United States.

Diplomatic observers further pointed out that this new U.S. proposal has created a divergence of opinion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which had previously been in agreement. The U.S. had previously advocated enforcing the partition plan with the help of international forces, but now it is advocating that Britain alone be responsible for security before the implementation of partition. Arab countries had previously pointed out that the Soviet Union's support for the international forces proposal was because it would allow Soviet troops to reach the Mediterranean coast. However, it is expected that the Soviet Union will not agree to the proposal that British troops alone remain in Palestine to be responsible for security during the transition period. As far as Britain is concerned, it is unwilling to clearly state its position until the entire United Nations General Assembly has expressed its opinion on the partition plan and its implementation methods. As for the nature of the U.S. proposal, it is unlikely that Britain will be willing to have 100,000 British troops continue to perform a meaningless task in the Holy Land for the next eight months in order to implement a partition plan that Foreign Minister Bevin is said not to trust.

### United Nations General Assembly Rejects Trusteeship for Non-Self-Governing Territories

This recommendation required all member state governments administering non-self-governing territories to place these territories under the United Nations trusteeship system. China, India, the Muslim countries, and the Slavic countries all supported this recommendation, believing that it was the best way to promote self-government for the peoples of colonial territories. However, colonial powers such as the United States, Britain, and Belgium actively opposed it. The final vote was 24 votes for and 24 votes against, with one abstention, failing to reach the two-thirds majority required for the General Assembly to pass the recommendation.

### Rickshaw Pullers Protest Rent Increase: Over a Hundred Arrested for Blocking Vehicles: Few Vehicles Seen Near Xiaodongmen and Chujiaqiao

[Our Reporter] Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a disturbance involving rickshaw pullers suddenly occurred in the area from Xiaodongmen on South Minquan Road to Chujiaqiao on South Xizang Road. At that time, groups of rickshaw pullers who had stopped working blocked the passage of operating rickshaws, even forcibly pulling passengers off the vehicles and deflating the tires, forcing them to return the rickshaws to their owners, hoping to create a strike situation. The cause of this dispute was the recent increase in rickshaw rentals demanded by the owners. Double-seater rickshaws were raised from 50,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan per day, medium-sized rickshaws from 50,000 yuan to 58,000 yuan, and single-seater rickshaws from 40,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. At the same time, an additional deposit was required: 2,000,000 yuan for double-seater rickshaws and 1,800,000 yuan for single-seater rickshaws. The rickshaw pullers felt that this price increase was too exploitative and unbearable, so they unanimously opposed it. As a result, some rickshaw pullers spread out along the South Minquan Road to South Xizang Road area, and whenever they saw colleagues passing by, they forced them to stop working, leading to a serious dispute. All rickshaws in the surrounding area nearly disappeared. The various police precincts of Songshan, Yimiao, and Penglai ordered a large number of police officers to patrol and arrest people everywhere, and the General Bureau also dispatched motorcycle teams to the scene of the disturbance to assist in the arrests. The disturbance was thus prevented from escalating. It was learned later that from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM yesterday, the various precincts successively detained a total of over a hundred rickshaw pullers involved in the disturbance: over twenty from Penglai, twenty from Yimiao, over forty from Songshan, over ten from Changshu, over ten from Changning, nine from Xujiahui, and six from Lujiawan. After being brought to the police station for interrogation, they were sentenced to one to three days of detention for violating public order as a warning.

Rickshaw Pullers' Strike Mainly Due to Welfare Fees

[Our Reporter] According to Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, this morning some rickshaw pullers in the Nanshi area went on strike and blocked others from working along the way. The Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the report, found that the main reason for the strike was that the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society had been collecting 250 yuan per rickshaw rental as a welfare fund for the society (single-seater rickshaws converted from human-powered vehicles were also charged). The rickshaw owners collected the fees on behalf of the society and remitted them to the Municipal Bank every month, and the mutual aid society then withdrew and used the funds from the Municipal Bank. Recently, the method was changed to remit the fees every six months. The rickshaw owners had not remitted the welfare fees collected in July, August, September, and October to the Municipal Bank, and the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid society had no funds to use as a result. Some rickshaw pullers expressed dissatisfaction with this and went on strike. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched Section Chief Huang Changhan of the Seventh Section and representatives from the labor union to persuade the workers to resume work, informing them that the Social Affairs Bureau had ordered the rickshaw owners' association to notify all rickshaw owners to remit the existing four months' worth of mutual aid society welfare fees to the Municipal Bank.

Director Shen continued to state that the rickshaw rental dispute has not yet been resolved. The rickshaw owners demand that the rent be calculated based on the cost of living index, but the rickshaw pullers, due to their limited income and difficult living conditions, are asking for a discount. To this end, the Social Affairs Bureau has suggested to the Municipal Government that rickshaw rentals should be determined by a review committee jointly organized by various agencies, but the Municipal Government has not yet approved this.

### Interpretation of Whether Leased Housing Can Be Requested for Return After Expiration of the Term

[Our Reporter] After the promulgation and implementation of the revised Land Law, there is much doubt about whether the lessor of a leased house with a fixed term can request the return of the leased house after the expiration of the lease term. The Shanghai District Court submitted two points to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. It is learned that the Judicial Yuan has resolved the issue in a unified legal meeting and issued a notice to comply with it. The original text states: "Where a lease has a fixed term, Article 100 of the Land Law does not apply, as interpreted in the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3489. Therefore, when the lease term expires, if there is no provision in Article 451 of the Civil Code, the lease relationship is terminated, and the lessor may request the lessee to return the leased property."

[Our Reporter] In the Nanshi Taoshachang Guoyutang Street, at around 9:00 AM yesterday, a madman, about twenty years old, suddenly wielded a wood ax and slashed at people he encountered, causing three passersby to be injured because they could not avoid him. The young madman was then captured with a rope by Jin Abao, a rickshaw puller, and sent to the Yimiao Police Precinct. It is learned that the person who was more seriously injured was named Xu Guanjin, 17 years old, an apprentice at Zhu Fuxing Construction Factory at 831 Zhonghua Road. The other two women and children suffered minor injuries and were discharged from the hospital after receiving treatment.

### Striving Hard and Upholding Their Positions: Over Six Hundred Japanese Nationals Remaining in Shanghai: A Satire on Shanghai: Many Factories and Hospitals Rely on Their Planning

[Special Report] Eight years of turmoil, two years of victory. The shadows of Japanese aggression still remain deeply and bleakly in everyone's mind. Now, the "heroes of the Empire" have certainly disappeared with the times. However, in front of our eyes, there is still a serious satire: There are still six hundred and sixty Japanese nationals remaining in Shanghai! The technical departments of many factories, hospitals... that have "suffered a lot" still rely on these thousand-plus hands to plan and operate!

These six hundred-plus Japanese nationals probably did not participate in the war, because according to them, those who had served in the "Holy War" a few years ago had long been uneasy and rushed to return home. They are technicians. Eating is their top priority. Since the Chinese government wanted to retain them, they were naturally happy to serve. And it is said that many had already packed their bags and boarded the ship, waiting to be repatriated, but as a result, we discovered that they were technical talents and were finally firmly retained. Our generosity and warmth did indeed deeply move them, and they expressed their gratitude in their work: upholding their positions, working diligently, obeying orders, and not shying away from hard work. It is said that they have also gained a little practical understanding in the past two years: in China, they only need to use 60% of their original ability and intelligence, because our industrial level is low, our equipment is simple, and the required progress is not too high.

### Understanding Chinese Industry

The actual life experiences of working alongside us have led them to have many admirable questions about Chinese industry. A Japanese expatriate named Nakayama, a graduate of the Tongwen Academy, told reporters: China, so far, does not seem to have broken away from its agricultural-based production model. If we want to revitalize the countryside, we must first export in large quantities, using trade surpluses to exchange for the conditions for our own survival and development. He wondered why we do not first devote all our efforts to the large-scale production and processing of agricultural products and export them to countries in need. Talking about industry, he gave an example: Switzerland's natural conditions dictate that it can only produce "precision machinery," so the Swiss watch industry has occupied the world market under their country's "key production." Like China's current industrial situation, it cannot yet manufacture cars itself, mainly because it cannot manufacture car body parts. But China has coal and iron, and can refine steel, so why don't industrialists use these conditions to invest only in the research and manufacture of parts, which will be used to earn foreign exchange in the future, and then declare war on the world industrial market? He said that he has been in China for more than seventeen years, and recently participated in the actual work of a Chinese factory. From years of subtle observation, he discovered that China has many industries that have enough conditions to develop into an important part of world industry, but the results seem to be strangled by the short-sightedness of industrialists. He has a conclusion for Chinese industrialists: "Industries that produce for their own profits are not necessarily the industries that the country needs most. They probably haven't realized this yet!"

### Implementing Mutual Aid in a Planned Way

The deep and persistent character of the Japanese people is well known to us, and it is more fully revealed in their "mutual aid society." Whether it is doing things, dealing with people, living, or even activities, there is order and planning. Although the monthly income of more than 600 Japanese expatriates varies due to the different positions in the retained organizations, everyone's living standards are surprisingly uniform. They eat coarse food, wear old clothes, and there is absolutely no exception. From their limited monthly salaries, everyone helps each other and automatically donates to the "mutual aid society" to run "remedial schools for children left behind," taking turns to serve as volunteer teachers. They set up "mailboxes" and take turns sending and receiving mail. They run "bags for aiding war criminals," providing clothes and food to compatriots. As for the cleanliness of the residence and the constraints of discipline, they have reached a level of self-confidence and shared trust.

The more than 600 Japanese expatriates now only have about 1,000 family members, and most of their families are said to still be in Japan, so they feel very inconvenienced by the restrictions on mailing packages. Therefore, they also hope that the peace treaty can be signed soon. According to them: After the treaty is concluded, there is no need to set up a consulate at all, and it is most appropriate for the Chinese police to manage it. Because as long as their families are reunited and the retained organizations do not dismiss them, they will still want to apply for citizenship! A Japanese expatriate who said this had a bitter smile on his face that was almost ingratiating.

### Three Hundred Have Chinese Wives

Among the retained Japanese expatriates, 300 are married to Chinese wives. The children born to these separated couples are now studying in remedial schools for children left behind. It is said that their grades are higher than those of students in Japan. The only aspiration of these students in the future is to enter Chinese universities to continue their studies. When reporters visited this school, an old piano inside was playing Japanese songs, and two children with Chinese blood were staring blankly outside, listening attentively. The mood was melancholic and mournful. These innocent "second-generation Japanese," hopefully they will never follow in the footsteps of their parents.

Facing this group of hard-working and self-improving Japanese expatriates, we feel ironic, even though they are still immersed in the pain of failure, and others are still controlling their own destiny!

### Comforting National Troops and Aiding Refugees; Shandong Compatriots' Fundraising Conference; Stabilizing Society Based on the Principle of Self-Help and Helping Others

[This newspaper's report] Famous Shandong figures Qin Dechun, Shangguan Yunxiang, and others initiated the "Fundraising Conference to Comfort Troops Suppressing the Rebellion in Shandong and Aid Refugees in Recovered Areas." It was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road. More than 500 people attended, including heads of institutions, celebrities from all walks of life, and fellow Shandong natives. The presidium consisted of nine people: Qin Dechun, Shangguan Yunxiang, Li Jianai, Du Guangxun, Kong Lingcan, Zhang Liangchen, Wu Zuojun, Tang Xingwu, and Qu Wansen.

Displaced and in Dire Need of Relief

After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Qin Dechun delivered the opening speech, stating briefly: There are three meanings to convening this conference today: First, since the mobilization order was issued, the national troops in Shandong have been born into death and have been brave among the three armies. The bandits' lairs, such as Yimeng and Yantai, have been recovered one after another, and their achievements have been remarkable. We should express our utmost respect. Second, the communist bandits are cruel by nature, and there are countless victims. Now that the Qinglu Relief Agency has ended, relief work needs to be continued urgently. Third, there are not a few displaced young people in Shandong Province. If they are not rescued quickly, they may be coerced by the communist bandits to join them. Our strength is weak and our ability is shallow. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide strong assistance so that the suppression of the rebellion can go one step further and the great cause of national reconstruction will be realized.

Striving to Donate and Lay the Foundation for the Overall Situation

Next, Huang Bodu, Vice Minister of Social Affairs, delivered a speech on behalf of Minister Gu, saying: Suppressing the rebellion and rescuing the victims are the government's duties, but the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. The people should also adhere to the principle of self-help and helping others and work together to complete the rescue work in order to stabilize society. Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner Nie Zhuang delivered a speech, saying: North China is the source of military power, and poverty is the source of chaos. Pacifying the communist banditry in North China will stabilize China, and rescuing the refugees in Shandong Province will quell the chaos. Shanghai Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian said in his speech: Shanghai citizens live and work in peace and contentment, which is supreme happiness, but we cannot ignore our compatriots for the sake of our own safety. Shandong is located in a crucial position and has a huge impact on the Central Plains. We hope that Shanghai citizens will strive to donate and lay the foundation for the overall situation. Subsequently, Xu Hongya, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and Yang Bufei, Deputy Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, successively expressed their opinions and announced the completion of the ceremony. There were also many recreational activities after the meeting, which did not end until 5:30 PM.

### A Large Group of Thugs Arrested on Liquan Road, Xiejiao

[This newspaper's report] At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, near Yongxintang on Liquan Road, Xiejiao, a large group of workers were seen holding iron rulers and wooden sticks, seemingly intending to start a fight. After receiving a report, the Songshan Police Branch urgently dispatched dozens of armed police officers to the scene and arrested 26 people, including Hou Xinggen, Wang Mingqian, and Xu Yufa, who were all taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to Hou Xinggen, who lives at No. 24 Sujiajiao, Changning Road, West Shanghai, he and his friend Wang Mingqian went to Liquan Road the night before to collect membership fees. In the darkness, a dog jumped out and bit his leg. After being injured, he picked up a stone and threw it, but missed and instead hit a rickshaw puller on the head, causing him to bleed profusely. Many of the rickshaw puller's companions came to argue with them, and they got into a fight and beat them up. This afternoon, they gathered 40 to 50 workers and went to the South City to seek revenge. Because they could not find the rickshaw puller who committed the crime, they searched the area and were arrested. The police bureau, finding that the truth was clear, sentenced them to seven days of detention as a warning.

### Vehicle Accidents Occur Frequently; A Cart Driver Dies from Serious Injuries

[This newspaper's report] At about 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, Zhou Lide, the owner of the cart rental business at No. 305 Yangzhou Road, East Shanghai, ordered cart drivers Zhang Jinsheng and Lu Shunxiang to load three barrels of war soy sauce on a cart, weighing about 1,200 pounds. They passed the Zhapu Road Bridge, heading north from the south. Zhang was pulling the cart in front, and when they reached the top of the bridge, they suddenly lost their center of gravity. The cart wheels slipped down, and Zhang was hit against a telephone pole on the east sidewalk, injuring his internal organs. The large intestine flowed out. He was sent to the Public Benevolence Hospital by the police in a car, but treatment was ineffective, and he died yesterday morning.

At about 9:30 AM yesterday morning, a military truck with the license plate number 4713948 was driving past No. 1326 North Sichuan Road, when a streetcar No. 158 came from the opposite direction. Unable to avoid it, the truck crashed into the streetcar head and destroyed it.

At the intersection of Baoshan Road and Baoxing Road in Zhabei, at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a military truck knocked down a pedestrian, Wang Wenwu (24 years old), and injured his hands and feet.

### Trip to Northern Jiangsu: On the Tongyu Road

[This newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 1st] From Nantong in northern Jiangsu directly to Yu County, this Tongyu Highway, which is about 1,000 li long, is indeed as important militarily or economically as today's Jinpu, Qian, and Jiaoji lines. The section of the highway from Nantong via Rugao and Hai'an in Funing County to the county seat of Dongtai, which is about 240 li long, can be described as smooth. Merchant trucks transporting cotton, pigs, chickens, ducks, and chicken eggs run back and forth. Transportation is mainly for freight, supplemented by passenger transport. The fare from Tong to Dong is 93,000 yuan per person. There are no seats, so you have to squat on the cotton bales that are as tall as a zhang, or in the gaps between the chickens and pigs. If you are lucky, you can exchange for a seat next to the driver for an additional 50,000 yuan, comfortably admiring the scenery along the way.

Self-Defense Force: "Great"? Sees Bandits, Runs Away!

First, let's talk about the self-defense force. On October 25, the reporter crossed the river from Zhenjiang, passed Liuyu Yangzhou, and first arrived in Taixian County. On the Wanfu Bridge on the Yangtai Highway, he first saw the wonderful performance of the Jiangdu Self-Defense Force members in the countryside. He saw the tense scene of holding guns and stopping cars. However, the leaders of the Jiangdu County Self-Defense Force were quite law-abiding and disciplined. Finally, they accepted the reporter's advice and stopped the mischief of the people's self-defense force, making all the poor people in the car shout "Good" in unison. At the same time, in the countryside of Dongtai, the self-defense spirit of the self-defense force recently came to two wonderful performances. The time was midnight on October 20, and the location was Liang Duo, 18 li away from the east gate of Dongtai.

It is said that three days before October 20, the sentinel team of Liang Duo Valley Township had joined dozens of guns to eliminate bandits in Liangdong Township. Because the self-defense force failed to provide timely reinforcements, they suffered a big loss. Two township chiefs and more than ten young sentinel team members were killed by the bandits. This exposed the incompetence and selfishness of the Liang Duo Self-Defense Force and sentinel team. Therefore, the remaining bandits in Liangdong Township launched a surprise attack on Liang Duo itself on the night of the 20th. War is based on deception, and bandits are even more deceptive. At that time, there were two or three hundred bandits (including civilians with bare hands). The sound of the bugle blowing from all directions seemed to be from seven or eight branches. Probably, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices and to achieve the real "self-defense" mission in the future, the people's self-defense force quietly ran away in groups to a safe shelter. In this way, the bandits entered a no-man's land, opened the doors of shops on the street, robbed more than 20 loads of cloth and other materials, and kidnapped some civilians. Before leaving, they also destroyed a wooden bridge on the Tongyu Road. It was not until October 29 that it was repaired and traffic was restored. Afterwards, the people were pained and thoughtful, and had no small complaints about the people's self-defense force that did not fire a single shot. The military and the government, as well as local people in the county seat, had different views and opinions on such a bad self-defense force, but the fact was so, and they had to sigh in unison. It is said that most of the leaders of the Dongtai Self-Defense Force are sent from above. It is difficult to serve these people, and the people, guns, and funds must all be taken from the people. It is difficult to coordinate personnel, and command and management are also difficult. If it is not improved quickly, then the county magistrate who abides by the pacification rules will have to suffer for others again.

### Hope is Placed on Military Affairs; Expectation of a Peaceful Life

After the Liang Duo bandit police incident and the murder of passengers on the Taidong shipping line's 18-mile river mouth, the safety issues on both land and water added another layer of shadow to the heavy hearts of Dongtai merchants and residents. At this time, everyone's hope was placed on military affairs. On October 29, the news of the recovery of Zhoujia Duo spread, and people's hearts were slightly stabilized. Now, the suppression work in Dongtai is being actively carried out. All the merchants and residents in the city are enduring the nearly 20 million yuan of supply fees every day (the price difference for purchasing forage, pork, etc. for the army) to look forward to a peaceful life. Because everything must be done with military affairs first, this desolate and isolated city seems tense and enthusiastic. The most sensitive thing is the price. The prices in the three counties of Jiangbei, Taidong, and Xing are already catching up with those in Jiangnan because of low production, high consumption, expensive freight, and heavy miscellaneous fees. The price of rice in Dongtai hovers around 600,000 yuan, pork is 20,000 yuan per catty, burning grass is 70,000 yuan per 100 catties, and the price of coarse velvet cotton is also very chaotic. The price of seed cotton is about 1.2 million yuan per 100 catties. What farmers fear most is the scary hats and rackets. The reporter saw along the way from Dongtai to Nantong that on the highway, there were various people collecting, inspecting, and checking, all of whom could extort money from others. Almost everyone had a pair of dirty hands and a ferocious face. The most pitiful were the police. They actually collected 10,000 yuan of small vegetable money from the car merchants and cargo owners in a grand manner, and they had to wink and strike a deal.

### Yu Zisan's Suicide Was Caused by Negligence in Prevention; The Three Guards Will Be Punished According to Law

[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 2nd] The Zhejiang Security Command issued a strict notice yesterday prohibiting illegal actions, stating that if anyone disregards the overall interests of the country and the nation, they will be dealt with according to legal procedures. However, in order to protect young people and respect the opinions of the school, the authorities transferred the case to the court before the investigation was completed. As for Yu Zisan's suicide, it was caused by negligence in prevention. The Public Security Bureau has placed the three guards, Wang, Jiang, and Hua, under house arrest and will be punished according to law. It also stated that those who are instigated to threaten others by strikes, slowdowns, or market strikes will be prosecuted for obstructing property, society, and security. All labor-capital issues should be resolved through legal procedures and should not be resolved through strikes, slowdowns, or market strikes. Otherwise, they will be severely punished without leniency.

### "Whose Chickens are These? Hurry, Hurry, Bring the Money Here!"

The most popular, most profitable, most comfortable, and smartest money takers on the Tongyu Highway are none other than the tax collectors. Most of them sit in the house and do not show their faces. A few uniformed patrolmen raise red flags to stop military trucks. As long as the car merchants and cargo owners know how to behave, they will not bother to come out to inspect. The car the reporter was in had pigs, , and cotton, but because there was little cotton, the target was small, and there was less trouble. If it is a military truckload of cotton, that would be enough to make you suffer. However, even though chickens are small, there are already small tricks appearing. When this merchant military truck was parked in front of a small tax gate on the border of Dongtai, unexpectedly someone came to check the chickens. A patrolman with a mixed accent walked up to the truck in a very imposing manner and wanted to count the chickens, shouting while counting: "Whose chickens are these? Hurry, hurry," he did not shout the sentence "Bring the money here," but someone had already stuffed a roll of legal tender into his two-and-a-half-foot-long pocket. And then, the car drove off.

Each county is allowed to set up up to nine squadrons to cooperate with the local people's self-defense teams to prevent bandits from invading.

### Two County Magistrates in Anhui Province Died Resisting Bandits

[This newspaper's Bengbu dispatch, October 7th] When Liu Bocheng's communist bandit forces captured Lihuang in western Anhui, County Magistrate Li Xuan led his troops to resist, resulting in his capture. During the interrogation, he did not say a word and stood upright, and was immediately killed. When Chen Yi's forces captured Taihe in northern Anhui at the beginning of the month, County Magistrate Qiu Tianmin was ordered to lead his troops to retreat, but was overtaken by the bandit forces. He still directed the resistance. Due to the disparity in numbers, he was captured alive by the bandits and shot to death, and his body was exposed for a long time. The Anhui Provincial Government believes that the two county magistrates, Li and Qiu, died resisting bandits, and their loyalty and bravery are commendable. In addition to deciding to provide generous compensation to their families, they will also request commendation in order to encourage and motivate others.

### Xibao Chief Wang Jinbao Murdered

[This newspaper's Wuxi dispatch, 1st] Recently, banditry in rural areas has been rampant, and cases of assassination and kidnapping have emerged endlessly. The Wuxi Command Headquarters of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Area Suppression Command is strictly ordering its subordinates to carry out suppression effectively. News has come that Wang Jinbao, the Xibao chief of Daludu Village, Meicun Town, Dongting District, was personally led by Chen Xueliang, the bandit leader of eastern Wuxi (i.e., Zhao Jianping, the communist bandit county magistrate of eastern Wuxi), at about 1:00 AM on the 30th. More than a dozen bandits broke open the back door, dragged him outside, and fired five shots in a row, killing him on the spot. The situation was very tragic. The next day, the widow of the deceased and his younger brother Jin Gui reported the information to the Dongheng Police Branch and the Dongheng Suppression Command, requesting arrest. According to the family of the deceased, the bandits who attacked that day were all acquaintances, namely Chen Xueliang, Fang Juexing, Fang Xiaoniu, and Chen Xichang.

### Yellow River Ferry Crossings to be Opened

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch of October 28th] All ferry crossings north of Kaifeng on the Yellow River have been closed for the past two months due to the unpredictable movements of the communist bandits on the north bank.

Northern Henan has a large grain reserve, and after the ferry crossings are opened, a large batch of food will flow south to Kaifeng. It is generally expected that the city's grain prices will soon drop significantly.

### Suzhou Cinema Employees Go on Strike Yesterday

### Nine Merchants Tragically Strangled; Families Still Dare Not Report It

[Our Nantong Dispatch of October 28th] I recently learned from merchants coming from the south about a shocking case of robbery and murder of nine people. The incident occurred late on the night of August 14th, but it has not been publicly revealed to this day. The details of the incident are as follows:

Guo Yu'en, Guo Wenhui, Guo Shilin, Guo Maolin, Wang Laosi, and others from Xin Yang Township in the Second District of this county, as well as Li Hongkai, Li Jianlian, Guo Dabao, and Li Dunxiang from Xin Dian Township in the Seventh District of Rugao, collectively raised 60 million yuan to transport salt. On August 12th, they departed from Xin Yang Township. While passing near the Sanyou River in Dongmatang Town, Rugao County, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. All the funds were robbed, and the nine merchants were strangled and buried in ancient tombs outside the sentry post in Matang Town in an attempt to conceal the bodies and eliminate the evidence. The families of the Guos and others secretly went to the site of the incident at night and discovered that the nine victims were all placed in one pit. Their heads and bodies all had wounds from knives, a bloody and horrifying sight. The families of the Guos and others have already transported the bodies back for funeral and burial. However, the families of the deceased are still afraid of the bandits' power and fear further accidents, so they have not reported the incident to the authorities.

### Qingdao Fish Market Established

[Our Qingdao Dispatch of October 28th] The Qingdao Fish Market, after several months of preparation, is now ready. The inaugural meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 27th of this month in the meeting hall of the Municipal Council, and Diao Fengting and others were elected as supervisors. Secretary Zhu, a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Municipal Government Secretary-General Jiang Kexun, and over a hundred shareholders attended.

### The Tragedy of an Agricultural Family

(Continued from Page 2) In a previous dispatch, I mentioned this case, which later sparked many interesting debates at the foreign journalist reception of the International Propaganda Office. If I were the head of the Harrison delegation at that time, I would have felt exactly the same way. I know that after this incident, the Warsaw Municipal Government issued a new order that every Monday and Tuesday, all restaurants were banned from serving meat. A waiter at a large restaurant told me: "That's nonsense. Poland may not have much to be proud of, but it doesn't lack meat. Poland has plenty of pork, beef, and lamb. Why prohibit customers from eating meat?"

These situations are also quite endearing. Overseas Chinese friends in Warsaw, as well as those who came to see me from other small towns, gave me a lot of salted meat, sausages, ham, and large chunks of lard. They said: "Germany has everything, but lacks food. Poland doesn't have much else, but it has plenty of food." I appreciate their kindness, especially their simple and clear understanding of economics.

The economic construction of the Polish Communist Party is commendable. They are constantly launching so-called "winter plowing campaigns" and "spring plowing campaigns." Secretary Bian, who recently took office at the Polish Embassy, traveled to Warsaw by train and did not see a single acre of wasteland along the way. This is an interesting contrast to France's "everywhere is desolate." He said: Polish farmers are very simple and honest. Along the way, he saw many Polish farmers living in thatched-roof houses, with flies swarming in the summer. These characteristics unique to agricultural societies cannot be found within the territories of Germany and France.

After liberation, Poland's currency underwent a small adjustment. The currency unit is still called "Zloty." One US dollar is officially worth one hundred "Zloty," but because of foreign exchange imbalances, the black market price of a US dollar is 800 or 900. It is said that two or three months ago, it was sold for more than 1,000. In the red world behind the Iron Curtain, Warsaw's commercial freedom surprises me. The display windows of department stores on the main streets have everything, and the prices are all in the thousands and tens of thousands. People with money can enjoy whatever they want, but most Poles, or salaried workers, can only sigh while looking at the display windows!

Warsaw does not have a "rationing" system like Berlin because the housing problem is controlled by the police station. Warsaw, which had a pre-war population of two million, now has only 300,000 people left, but it is still not enough (because everything was destroyed). The police station stipulates that two people share a room. Small families who want to find ideal "suites" with bathrooms and kitchens, like in Shanghai, have to pay a "key fee," which in Europe is called "key money." Many tenants in Warsaw calculate the key money in US dollars.

Within the small circle of government civil servants, they also have their rationing system. In Warsaw, civil servants have housing, shoes, clothing materials, and food rations. I asked a municipal government official, and he said, "We receive very little salary, but there are no problems with our lives!"

After the Communist Party took over state-owned factories, the lives of workers were exactly the same as those of civil servants. The Polish authorities are now working hard to promote the industrialization movement. Especially after acquiring the eastern territories of Germany, "Silesia produces 3.1 million tons of bituminous coal and 1.7 million tons of peat annually, making Poland the fourth-largest coal-producing country in Europe." During the last Moscow conference, when the three powers discussed the issue of German reparations and reconstruction, Secretary of State Marshall said: "Germany has lost the coal resources of Silesia. How can Germany be expected to produce?" Therefore, Marshall believed that Poland should return half of the "recovered territories," which shocked the entire Polish government and public. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs hastily compiled many historical and geographical proofs, demonstrating from a theoretical standpoint, historical origins, geographical background, and even the distribution of land and population that it should be Polish territory. On the one hand, they are creating a fait accompli in fact, stepping up the expulsion of Germans and resettling Poles, to avoid a "reversal of the case" in future peace treaties with Germany.

The International Propaganda Office in Warsaw sent me many pamphlets and welcomed foreign journalists to visit their "recovered territories" and see the new policies. The current governor of the recovered territories is Communist Party Secretary Gomulka, Poland's Little Stalin.

The "recovered territories" also include most of East Prussia. Poland's biggest concern was the lack of a coastline. The only seaport, "Danzig," was always used by Hitler as an excuse for conspiracies. Now, all of Danzig has been incorporated into Polish territory. The original 140 kilometers of coastline have now increased to 550 kilometers. The Polish government has specifically designated a day called the

"Coastal Festival." At this year's Coastal Festival, President Bierut went to the seaside to inspect the Polish Navy.

It is not easy for agricultural families to engage in industrial and commercial construction. With a coastline, ships are even more necessary. Poland has a state-owned shipping company that bought three merchant ships from the United States last year, and they are now sailing in the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

### Dispute Over Reversionary and Public Property in Zhengzhou

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch of October 25th] Chen Jingzhai, the puppet chairman of Henan Province, left behind reversionary property in Mulin Road, Minggong Road, Liu Wanshun Street, and other places.

### End of the Controversy Over National Painting in Beiping; The Issue of Reinstating Dismissed Teachers Is Still Difficult to Resolve

[United Press Beiping Dispatch of the 2nd] Principal Xu Beihong of the Special School recently spoke about the current situation of the controversy over national painting up to the mediation, saying that he had received letters from friends from all sides in recent days, mentioning this matter, and that their feelings were appreciated.

To maintain the students' studies, others have been hired to fill the positions, so it is currently difficult to find an appropriate way to deal with the issue of reinstating the dismissed teachers.

### Shanghai Dental College Anniversary: Grand Celebration Held Yesterday

[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Dental College and its affiliated hospital, which have just celebrated their first anniversary of establishment and the first anniversary of the opening of their clinic, held a grand celebration in the auditorium of the college at No. 40 Fuxing West Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 150 guests from all walks of life, including Ding Wen-yuan, Chen Yi-de, Huang Ji-ping, and teachers and students of the school, attended the event. Dan Yin-sun, a councilor sent by the Ministry of Education, participated as a representative. The celebration was presided over by Principal Situ Bo, who expressed his deep gratitude to all sectors for their assistance in the development of the school over the past year. He stated that dental medicine in Europe and the United States has made rapid progress, while China is still in its infancy. Dentistry in the United States is particularly advanced, with more than 80,000 dentists today. Due to the needs of post-war reconstruction, dentistry students accounted for the largest number of those applying to colleges and universities last year. All dental colleges plan to be renamed dental universities, with the goal of completing a plan for 110,000 dentists by 1950. In Taiwan, due to years of misleading by the Japanese, there are currently 700 dentists among the six million people. In contrast, the total number of dentists in mainland China is only over 350, which is far too few. According to statistics, dental diseases account for one-third of all diseases in China, and the health of teeth is related to the overall strength of the body, which shows its importance. Principal Situ then spoke about the faculty, equipment, and school building problems since the establishment of the school a year ago, and announced his five-year plan: The first year will be spent handling the registration procedures; the second year, planning a second campus on Chongqing South Road; the third year, planning the construction of a permanent campus in Jiangwan (the school site has been purchased and is located near Fudan University and the former site of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School); the fourth year, starting the construction of the permanent campus in Jiangwan; and the fifth year, moving into the Jiangwan campus. He finally emphasized that before the school gains social trust, it will never solicit donations from the outside world and will devote all its efforts to serving society and developing the urgently needed dental medical education. Councilor Dan Yin-sun from the Ministry of Education, Li Xi-mou, Acting Director of the Education Bureau, and Zhang Wei, Director of the Health Bureau, delivered speeches. Guests Ning Yi-heng and others gave speeches, and school directors Wang Wan-bai, Cao Shou-qian, and Yan Du-yi also delivered speeches of encouragement. The celebration concluded at 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, a lunch was held for teachers and students, which was a grand occasion. Starting today, 1,000 free treatment coupons will be printed and distributed to servants and the poor as a commemoration, which can be requested by the masters of servants or obtained by the poor in person at the school to seek treatment for dental diseases.

### Father-Son Tennis Tournament Concludes: Grand Award Ceremony Held. One Hundred Million Yuan Raised in Charity Ticket Sales. Donations Divided Among Children's Police and Winter Relief Association.

The city's first father-son doubles tennis tournament concluded in a joyful and enthusiastic atmosphere yesterday. Ma Yun-bi and Jing Rong, father and son managers of Sincere Company, won the championship. Charity tickets and the auction of charity balls raised a total of 100 million yuan.

The third match was a performance by the elderly group aged 55 and above, with their (old but strong) performance being extraordinary. Finally, the finals were held between Ma Hui-bi and Jing Rong against Zhang Zi-zhen and Rong Cai. Both teams had excellent skills and were highly appreciated by the audience. The Zhang team had chances to win in both sets, but failed at the last point. The results of each match are as follows:

Auction of the Charity Ball, presided over by Director Wu, was sold for 20 million yuan. Purchased by Yu Ting, his enthusiasm for social welfare is admirable. The second auction, presided over by Director Yu, was also sold for 20 million yuan and purchased by Zhou De-lin, manager of the Greater China Trading Company. The number of charity tickets sold was 440, totaling 44 million yuan. The two charity balls totaled 40 million yuan, making a total of 84 million yuan. Zhu Min-tang and Gu Qian-lin each donated 8 million yuan to make up 100 million yuan, which was divided among the children's police and the Winter Relief Association.

### Yin Qian Cup Basketball Tournament Opens Yesterday

The fourth Basketball League opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Baxianqiao Youth Gymnasium. Many relatives and friends from all walks of life and family members attended the game, and the situation was quite lively.

### Guang Gang Rushes to Purchase Tung Oil for Smuggling Due to Hong Kong Black Market Exchange Rates. Leader in Tung Oil Export Industry Discusses Current Export Situation. Total Exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong This Year Are Approximately 50,000 Tons.

[Central News Agency, This City] According to a leader in the tung oil export industry, total tung oil exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong this year, up to now, are approximately 50,000 tons. Of these, the United States accounts for approximately 60%, the United Kingdom accounts for 15%, and various parts of Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan account for approximately 25%. Regarding overseas prices, in the United States, the market price is approximately 25 cents per pound, and the government stipulates that domestically produced goods are 27 cents per pound, with the difference being subsidized by the government, so the market price is relatively stable. Recently, due to some Hong Kong merchants selling short and failing to deliver futures contracts in October and November, totaling approximately 12,000 tons, they have been rushing to replenish their supplies in Shanghai, causing the market price to fluctuate slightly. In the United Kingdom, the current price is 205 pounds per ton, which means that goods exported from Hong Kong can still be profitable. However, after the British government lifted restrictions on tung oil, there are still 4,000 tons on hand. The country's supply office also stipulates that if merchants purchase tung oil from abroad, they must also purchase the same amount of the aforementioned inventory from their government at the above price. In other words, merchants operating in tung oil are using the average price of tung oil purchased from our country and their government as the standard. Other parts of Europe lack US dollars, so import controls are as strict as in our country.

The ratio of US dollars to British pounds in our country is 3 to 1, while the psychology of the people in Europe is more reasonable at a ratio of 4 to 1. As such, they lack US dollars and are unwilling to purchase goods from our country at the current exchange rate, coupled with the difficulty in obtaining import permits, so transactions are sluggish. The people in that region's view on the tung oil export of our country, says that following the announcement of the new exchange rate management method on August 16th, tung oil trade was able to develop; in particular, the reasonable adjustment of the exchange rate for the US dollar in the initial stage of the Stabilization Fund was able to promote tung oil exports; however, in recent months, the exchange rate has remained stable, resulting in the Shanghai tung oil price being approximately 20% higher than that of foreign countries, thus reducing exports. The domestic price is highest in Changsha, at 1.48 million yuan per tan. If it is transported to Shanghai, plus freight, its total value is approximately 10% higher than in Shanghai. The reason for this is that the black market exchange rate in Hong Kong is as much as 85% higher than the domestic official rate, thus creating smuggling by Guang Gang. Merchants are rushing to purchase goods at high prices in that area. Although customs in South China have strengthened their enforcement, the wind of smuggling is still fierce due to the wide disparity between the US dollar black market and the official rate, which is a threat to normal merchants. At the same time, according to past experience, an increase in sales in Hong Kong can affect the US market. Our country's authorities should pay attention to this. Last week, in addition to promoting exports, tung oil merchants were convened for discussions and raised discussions on this issue. Although a few merchants, in order to open up this difficulty and seek immediate benefits, intended for the government to restore the purchase policy, it is expected that the government will find it difficult to do so. This is because the opinions of most merchants and the public opinion abroad do not approve of our country's purchase policy, especially the United States, which strongly advocates free private operation in order to develop international trade. The person also said that the new oil in our country will gradually be launched in December. Although there are no accurate surveys of the total output in the past, according to the Gu Di report this year, except for slightly poor harvests in eastern Hubei, other places are good, and a total of 70,000 tons can be obtained. In addition to supplying domestic sales, the export part can reach 60,000 tons. As for how to maintain this export figure, we must first pay attention to the production cost and legal profit, which depends on the government's protection, or emulate the American method to guarantee a certain price and provide subsidies when the price falls, and then such as stipulating that each tan of tung oil is equal to a certain amount of white rice, and its price rises and falls with the price of rice, in order to encourage farmers to produce.

### Textile and Garment Adjustment Committee Denies Cancellation of Quotas for Southward Transport of Cotton Yarn and Cloth.

The Textile and Garment Adjustment Committee specifically denied the rumor that quotas for the southward transport of cotton yarn and cloth would be cancelled starting this month. It stated that this quota was cancelled last month, but because the situation in South China is special, the southward transport quota must continue to be maintained. The committee did not make any decision to cancel the quota.

### Domestically Produced Spinning Machines Shipped to Siam

The Fugyuan Textile Mill in Bangkok recently shipped four domestically produced Xin Nong-style spinning machines, totaling more than 500 spindles, from the Shanghai Xinyou Iron Factory. Zhang Guojun, a technician, has completed the installation, and it can produce 512 pounds of 20-count yarn per day. It is truly exciting news that our country has exported domestically produced spinning machines.

### Imported Raw Materials for Cigarettes Require Approximately 20 Million US Dollars Every Three Months.

The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs previously notified the factory industry association to make a report in order to understand the quantity of imported raw materials needed by various cigarette factories in the city in manufacturing and the foreign exchange required, so as to coordinate the distribution methods. It is reported that the three types of cigarette raw materials supplied by foreign countries are tobacco leaves, steel essence, and paper circles. According to the investigation, the total value of the three types needed every three months is: tobacco leaves 19,200,000, steel essence 1,350,000, paper circles 960,000, totaling 21,510,000 US dollars.

### National Cigarette Industry Federation Handles Raw Material Registration.

The National Cigarette Industry Federation convened a board meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the self-provided foreign exchange for the import of cigarette industry production raw materials. It was decided to quickly urge the industry to register, and once completed, they will petition the government and the Export Control Committee, hoping that the original price will be allocated to the industry to facilitate production. They also hope that the authorities will understand the difficulties of the business community, simplify the technology as much as possible, and promptly announce the handling methods to dispel public doubts.

### Several Banks and Businesses Found with Insufficient Deposits Amidst National Bank's Thorough Investigation of Returned Checks.

The number of returned checks in the city has been increasing recently, and the National Bank has mobilized for a thorough investigation.

### Cotton from India for Yarn and Cloth Exchange. The First Batch May Arrive at the End of the Month. The Export Sales Committee Will Handle Application and Import Procedures.

The exchange of cotton yarn and cloth with cotton from India is expected to be signed in mid-month. In the first contract, state-owned and private textile factories can apply for one-tenth of their six-month output at a time to exchange for flowers from India. The exchange ratio of cotton yarn was previously set by the Export Sales Committee as one package of 20-count yarn in exchange for 1,050 to 1,120 pounds of cotton. As for the exchange ratio of cloth, it has recently been stipulated that 24 pieces of fine cloth weighing 12 pounds will be exchanged for 1,150 pounds of cotton. After the spinning mills have been approved, all kinds of permit procedures such as applying for import and export will be handled by the Export Sales Committee to apply to the Export and Import Management Committee and the Central Bank. The Export Sales Committee has also agreed with the Indian authorities on the delivery dates for both parties, and the principle is that Indian cotton will be transported to Shanghai first. It is expected that after the contract is signed, the first batch of Indian cotton will arrive in the city at the end of this month.

### Commercial Briefs

The Municipal Paper Industry Association tea party, which was temporarily suspended due to soaring paper prices, is heard to be resuming next week.

### The "Reserve Requirement" Policy Must Be Implemented to Stop Malignant Inflation

— Lin Lin

(Editor's Note) The author of this article has studied in the United States for many years, specializing in banking and monetary economics. He has written extensively, and his specialized works can be found in well-known American publications such as the American Economic Review, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, and Free World.

Our country is currently facing a formidable enemy that is intensifying its attacks on us. Its advance is gradual but relentless, permeating every aspect of our lives. Whether people are in cities or villages, at home or abroad, they are inevitably affected. Moreover, its aggression is increasing day by day and becoming more intense over time. If we fail to stop it in time, this formidable enemy may destroy our country imperceptibly! What is this enemy? It is the "runaway inflation" formed by the vicious cycle of issuance inflation, price inflation, and fiscal deficit inflation. This runaway inflation takes the following form: Because prices are soaring, the national fiscal deficit increases; Because the national fiscal deficit increases, the issuance of banknotes increases; Because the issuance of banknotes increases, prices rise even higher; Because prices rise even higher, the national fiscal deficit doubles; Because the national fiscal deficit doubles, the issuance of banknotes doubles; Because the issuance of banknotes doubles, prices rise even higher.

We know that although the government has repeatedly adopted various price control measures, they have never achieved the desired results. Although the government has repeatedly declared its determination to balance revenues and expenditures, the fiscal deficit continues to increase unabated. As for controlling the issuance of banknotes, there has never been an effective plan. As a result, since 1940, runaway inflation has not only failed to ease but has accelerated. Frankly speaking, it has reached a point of no return. Therefore, many pessimistic observers, both Chinese and foreign, believe that our country's finances are on the verge of bankruptcy and the economy is about to collapse.

However, in the author's humble opinion, it is not too late to find a way to salvage the situation immediately. As long as we have the determination and can muster a spirit of fearless revolution, we can immediately stop the offensive of this formidable enemy of runaway inflation and avert the crisis. First, we must understand the main cause of "runaway inflation." Everyone knows that China today has the following undesirable phenomena: Shortage of goods supply; Lack of transportation; Increased production costs; Manipulation and speculation by unscrupulous merchants; Increased market demand; Increased currency circulation.

True, the above six phenomena, individually or collectively, can all cause or contribute to price increases, but they are not the main cause of "runaway inflation." They can only be considered secondary causes because current prices are continuing to rise sharply and are accelerating in geometric progression, not increasing gradually in arithmetic progression.

Take the increase in currency circulation, for example. According to one author's estimate, the amount of currency issued in China today has only increased five thousand times compared to before the war, but prices have soared thirty-five thousand times. Regardless of whether the quantitative theory of money is correct or not, we can at least say that the relationship between the current price inflation and the increase in the quantity of money has become disconnected.

What is the main cause of "runaway inflation"? Frankly speaking, it is the people's loss of faith in the legal tender.

The national legal tender system was originally the most modern system. Since its implementation in 1935, it has achieved remarkable results, especially for war financing. In the first three years of the war, the national price level was exceptionally stable, and there was no malignant inflation. Although military expenditures were enormous, the fiscal deficit did not increase excessively. This is due to the legal tender, which cannot be denied.

Unfortunately, in 1940, like a thunderbolt, China's only international transportation lifeline at the time, the Burma Road, was suddenly cut off. This shocked the whole country, and prices soared, invisibly inflicting a fatal wound on China's legal tender. From the three months after the closure of the Burma Road, the value of the legal tender plummeted, leading to the current trend of irreversible decline. This can be said to be the starting point of "runaway inflation," which is the beginning of the people's loss of confidence in the legal tender.

Since then, on the one hand, the national price soared, and war expenses suddenly increased, so expenditures continued to increase; on the other hand, the occupied areas gradually expanded, and the efficiency of tax administration decreased, so revenues also decreased day by day. Thus, expenditures exceeded revenues, and the fiscal deficit became increasingly large. In order to implement the decision to resist Japan to the end and strive for final victory, the government had to grit its teeth and resort to desperate measures, increasing issuance to cope with the situation. The above three vicious cycles of inflation were thus formed.

The government and the people originally hoped that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the fiscal deficit could be reduced, the issuance could be reduced, prices could fall, and the inflation trend would not expand. Who knew that before the surrender procedures of Japan had been completed, the communists seized the opportunity to launch a destructive war. The central authorities, pained by the people's desire for peace and the need for recuperation, had no choice but to compromise and make concessions for peace. The communist side, taking an inch and wanting a mile, used the ceasefire time to actively expand its territory, from northern Shaanxi to northern Jiangsu, from northern China to northeastern China, with a sweeping momentum. Thus, the civil war expanded, and the vicious cycle continued. Its harm became increasingly fierce. The people's trust in the legal tender only decreased, and did not increase. In addition, the erroneous sale of gold exacerbated the situation, causing the legal tender to depreciate sharply and continuously to this day, causing endless harm.

Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any price control measures will lose their effectiveness, let alone that China has a vast territory and a large population, and lacks modern control conditions. Therefore, prices continue to fluctuate, and everyone still expects them to rise every day!

Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any exchange rate will not be maintained. Since March of last year, in less than two years, the exchange rate of the US dollar has been raised four times: last March, the exchange rate of the US dollar was raised from 500 yuan to 2,020 yuan. In less than half a year, it could not be maintained, so it had to be raised again to 3,350 yuan in mid-August. However, in less than half a year, it could not be maintained again. In mid-February of this year, an emergency measure was taken to raise the US dollar to 12,000 yuan. In other words, it increased three and a half times in six months. Even so, it still could not be maintained. By mid-August of this year, it had to be adjusted again. This time, while maintaining the original official price of 12,000 yuan, a new exchange rate called the "benchmark exchange rate" was set, with an initial rate of 40,000 yuan, which invisibly raised the US dollar by three and a third times.

Once the people lose confidence in the legal tender, any government budget cannot be balanced. There are many reasons for the imbalance of national revenue and expenditure, which we cannot discuss in detail here. What we want to point out in particular is that during the "suppression of the rebellion" military period, it is an inevitable phenomenon that expenditures exceed revenues, but today's imbalance is incomparable to the imbalance of the past. In the past, the difference in imbalance was limited, at most only a few percent or tens of percent. Today's imbalance often differs by more than two hundred or three hundred percent. (Needless to say, the most important reason for the difference between now and then is not the increase in military expenditures, but the accelerated rise in prices.)

Not only that, but ordinary people dare not and are unwilling to save because they have no confidence in the legal tender. As for the wealthy, they either engage in speculative business or try to escape with their funds abroad, and naturally there is no talk of raising funds for production. Furthermore, foreign capital is hesitant to advance, and even overseas remittances cannot be absorbed. Foreign goods flood the market as before, and export trade is increasingly exhausted. Therefore, the phenomenon of international balance of payments imbalance is becoming increasingly profound and acute!

To stop inflation, we must first restore the people's faith in the legal tender. To restore the people's faith in the legal tender, we must implement the "reserve requirement" policy. The maintenance of the value of modern currency does not rely on "convertibility," but it cannot be without "reserves." Currency is a kind of credit. In the minds of the general public, the only reliable guarantee for currency credit is ultimately "cash reserves." For example, the US dollar has been a non-convertible currency since 1933; but the value of the US dollar is more stable than any other country's currency; the biggest reason for this is that half of it is due to effective regulation, and half is due to sufficient "reserves." Everyone knows that the US dollar has the world's largest gold reserves behind it. If we have "cash" as the backing for the legal tender, who would still be willing to undermine it?

The "reserve requirement" policy, simply put, is a policy of vigorously collecting cash and silver as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. In other words, the government must immediately make a major determination at this time and adopt various effective methods to purchase and store large amounts of gold and silver, and publicly seal this gold and silver as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. This cash reserve is not working capital, nor is it a foreign exchange fund. It is part of the fixed capital of the issuing bank and is the guarantee behind the legal tender. It is absolutely not allowed to be used unless the issuing bank goes out of business. At the same time, the actual amount purchased and sealed each month must be publicly inspected and announced nationwide.

There are several specific ways to purchase and store cash reserves:

Issue long-term (35 to 50 years) Class A "Gold Reserve Public Bonds" in taels, with preferential interest rates, to exchange for gold currently existing in the country. This type of bond should be sold exclusively to people or legal entities holding gold bars, and those who previously purchased government gold should be ordered to purchase as much as possible. The gold obtained should be sealed monthly. Issue long-term (25 to 50 years) Class B "Gold Reserve Public Bonds" in US dollars, with preferential interest rates, to exchange for foreign exchange. This type of bond should be sold exclusively to people holding foreign currency securities or deposits and overseas Chinese. The foreign exchange obtained should not be used for other purposes, but only for purchasing cash and silver abroad. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Sell domestic surplus materials, and use the proceeds to exchange for cash and silver at home and abroad. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Actively exploit known gold and silver mines. The cost of this business does not matter, as long as it increases the amount of gold and silver. The gold and silver obtained should be sealed monthly. Borrow "reserve" foreign debt. The amount of debt obtained should be used exclusively for purchasing foreign gold for use as a fixed reserve for the legal tender. The gold obtained should be sealed monthly. When the "reserve requirement" policy is first implemented, there will definitely be many psychological or technical difficulties and obstacles. We believe that these difficulties and obstacles are temporary; as long as we can muster a spirit of fearless revolution, what difficulties and obstacles cannot be overcome?

We firmly believe that the "reserve requirement" policy is a policy of establishing credit and is the only effective way to restore the people's faith in the legal tender.

In this way, the vicious cycle of inflation will be restrained and will no longer run wild. With the formidable enemy removed, stabilizing the currency value, reducing the fiscal deficit, and stabilizing prices can all be carried out smoothly and achieve results. Then, China will not fall into the abyss of financial bankruptcy and economic collapse. Not only will the victory of suppressing the rebellion come soon, but the great plan of national construction can also be realized soon.

Spring and Autumn

### Thoughts on an Autumn Night

— Xu Weinan

(I) Lipstick

A simple sketch of an image of Guanyin, with a circle of light ink haloed above her head, and a white lotus flower beneath her seat. On the left corner, a touch of lipstick is carefully imprinted, extraordinarily vivid, that is the writer's seal.

(II) New Dress

A glass is the new dress of fine wine. In the Tang Dynasty, the crimson wine had already donned a luminous cup. Modern champagne, lemon-like pale yellow, must wear a gorgeous long robe, a tall, conical glass. (III) Brightness

When beloved friends arrive, the whitewashed walls demand brightness, the mirror on the wardrobe demands brightness, the glass windows demand brightness, the tables and chairs must be bright, even oneself must re-groom, and adorn oneself brightly: Turn on all the lights!

### Autumn Song

— Xu Minghuai

Dusk

Several gusts of gentle wind, a burst of cool rain, the mountain country's dusk is already painted with the full flavor of autumn.

The remnant cicada drags out its hoarse, trembling voice, lamenting the loss of golden years; the night jasmine protects its last green bud, shrinking, tearfully drooping sadly. A sweet dream under the Judas tree, is the only red embellishment in gray days! The thin poet will wipe away tears on its last delicate petals, telling it that though autumn comes, though winter comes, yet afterwards comes the rainbow-like spring; telling it that though the footsteps of dusk draw near, beautiful news, on the other side of the setting sun behind the mountain, is stirring up the light dust of dawn, the crickets' low murmur trembling in the morning breeze.

As the dusky-blue sleeping robe of dusk falls, the lingering sound of cicadas has already vanished in the twilight, the crickets are chattering again at the base of the wall, as if the senile cough of an old man nearing death, the depressed sigh of a distant traveler, sobbing……

Bats, the poets of dusk donning their black evening dress are patrolling the sky, in haste, are they searching for their lost poems, dreams?

Fallen Leaves

The green leaves are already filled with a vague, longing heart, they will depart from this bustling world, embarking on another unfamiliar journey.

The benevolent baptism bestowed by Father Time has long become a thing of the past, the passionate solace and the green embellishments have also withered. Looking forward, an endless, unending road, thorns crisscrossing; how can one who has walked a smooth and warm road bear to fall into a precarious, impoverished end? Recalling the past, who can bear to see the coldness and indifference of the future? Green leaves, they will shed their green coat, abandon all that has been bestowed, starving, dry, dedicating themselves to the next generation. They are heroes in D'Annunzio's pen, generously sacrificing everything for love.

Sorrowfully bidding farewell, and tragically lost in the wind and rain. Listen to the fallen leaves sing their desolate elegy; searching, searching, cold, cold, clear, clear, miserable, miserable, wretched, wretched. As if the sobbing at Xunyang River, the sighing on the banks of the Yi River, the sobbing of the frustrated, the bleak sigh. Thinking of Baudelaire's poems:

"I tremble as I listen to each falling leaf,

Falling on the thick pile, the echo more urgent.

My mind is like a wall about to collapse,

The heavy battering still striking without pause.

This monotonous weeping, stirs my imagination,

As if someone is fastening the coffin, for whom? For the past summer, the present autumn,

And mysterious sounds, as if a funeral." (Autumn Song) A trace of sorrow arises in my heart. Recalling Paul Verlaine's poems: "I wish to go in the desolate wind,

Let it, torture me,

Here - there

Like dead leaves on the ground."

I realize that this must be a portrayal of the human heart, a realistic depiction of life. Zhang Ruoyan's Aesthetic Sense of Autumn

One dim autumn evening, I sat silently in a quiet study. I had just woken from a nap. Outside the curtain, a light rain was falling, raindrops dripping on the thick branches and tall trunks of the plane trees, a kind of melancholy and distant tone that made one feel lost! "Sparse rain drips on the plane trees," I don't know how many widows and widowers' melancholy feelings were stirred.

Autumn makes people think of red leaves, sparse forests, snowy reeds, purple crabs... A Yuan dynasty short verse says, "Wild geese cry, reed leaves age, heron shadows, lotus flowers cold," depicting the wild scenery of an autumn river. It is like a painting, stirring up my longing for autumn.

Spring is beautiful with flowers, summer with fresh leaves, but spring and summer are heavily made up, filled with an excessive amount of the atmosphere of the mundane world. But autumn is a masterpiece created by the Creator using superb skills. It is like Su Dongpo's writing, flowing smoothly without a trace. Its charm is even better than spring and summer. The clarity of autumn is like a bright moon, its gracefulness is like a deep

One deep autumn, I was walking in a village. When the setting sun was slanting, I wandered by a dried-up lake. Several rows of withered willows awaiting shearing were planted on the winding path. The lake was full of messy, tattered reeds. Suddenly, countless silvery-white egrets flew up from the reed cover, scattered across the sky like ink dots, dancing drunkenly with the reed catkins on the lake blown by the west wind, showing a tragic and desolate artistic conception. Although it was only a brief stay, it gave people a long-lasting aftertaste.

Many people think that autumn is a season of sadness. Literary figures and poets, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are particularly sensitive to it. Some people compare it to "Death's harvest season." Perhaps autumn's maturity and fullness aroused Death's jealousy, forcing it to hastily enter the tomb. The American poet Longfellow compared autumn to a helpless old man. In fact, they have all erased the glorious parts of autumn. Because autumn alone bestows upon us enough aesthetic sense to be intoxicating.

### Autumn

— Pei Yin

A cool dusk

The crickets before the steps sing the song of autumn for the first time. Last night, I heard autumn passing through the forest, caressing the fertile fields, crossing the western mountains.

Coming to my orchard, autumn has two red and long wings, scattering the breath of autumn everywhere.

The fields abandon their half-year's green, wearing a light yellow long coat. The west wind smiles at the season's abundance, plating the mountains and forests with a red coquetry...

For the sake of mankind,

Autumn brings the season's and cages.

Ripe fields

Bumper harvest of fruit

A loud laugh ripples in the countryside. Autumn

I gaze at the flowing water carrying red leaves. Listen to the west wind singing playfully.

Let the red leaves fall on my shoulders...

### Random Notes on a Clear Autumn

— Ji Yu

Autumn Mountains

On clear days, climbing mountains and wading through water, it is a pleasure to appreciate the scenery in autumn. See the maple leaves as red as a drunken old man's face, the leaves of the Chinese tallow tree dotted all over the mountains, like a young girl's rouge. And the yellow leaves have not yet begun to fall with the wind, pin a red leaf on the lapel of your clothes, as beautiful as if hot blood were sprinkled on a battle robe, on the way home one feels much younger.

Autumn Suburbs

The autumn scenery of Jiangnan is also very beautiful in the plains, with verdant trees and yellow flowers everywhere. Treading on your leisurely footsteps, linger as much as you like in this unwithering grassland. The autumn suburbs are more picturesque than poetic. Thatched cottages, plowing cattle, village women, shepherd boys, small bridges, flowing water... all are the best painting subjects. Bringing your tools, pick a quiet spot at will, draw a watercolor or sketch, it is your best harvest.

Autumn Water

Water is a symbol of tenderness, between the clear autumn lakes and mountains, sharing a boat with a few friends in conversation and laughter, letting the small boat emerge and disappear among the remnant lotus and dark bridge caves, is also the most pleasant state. If you are on Xuanwu Lake at this time, watching the setting sun hanging on the gray city walls, the lake waves are as bright as brocade, and in the distance, you can see a corner of the ancient Jiming Temple, and the two peaks of Zijin Mountain are shrouded in the vast twilight, in the nostalgic mood, you can also feel a faint sorrow.

Autumn Flowers

The deep autumn around the Double Ninth Festival makes people feel sentimental, even without wind and rain there are some sorrows, but when you enter the garden where autumn flowers are in full bloom, your eyes immediately light up, and your mood also becomes cheerful. Seeing this garden full of yellow and purple chrysanthemums, if it were not for the surrounding bleak scenery as a foil, one would undoubtedly have entered the embrace of spring.

The frost-covered autumn chrysanthemums are not only for those with a poetic interest to appreciate, even vulgar peddlers should have their enjoyment, but those who currently claim to be noble and have had spots of dirt in the past few years, I wonder if they feel ashamed in front of the flowers?

Cherish this fleeting beautiful scenery, I fear that when the autumn flowers have withered, only a lonely piece of bright autumn light will be left in Jiangnan.

### Playfully Titled Drawing Bamboo

— Zhang Yiqu

Several branches of bamboo without leaves or poles, not because of perfunctory politeness; when the price of ink is the same as the price of gold, cherishing ink like gold is truly the case.

### Green Bamboo

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"According to my estimate, it should be enough." Yaoqun seemed very confident. "In the devil's special agent headquarters, besides the four of us here, there's also Mai Shafu. In addition, there are the two good hands Xiaolaohu brought last night, and our two small leaders from outside the pass: one is the old Long, and the other is Wu Shuo. We can't do anything else, but hide in the dark and fire a few shots at them, set a few fires to draw that thing all over the place. Then we can do a concentrated shooting, which should stir him up a bit."

Yaoqun said so much about her plan, but the impression I absorbed was shallow. I pondered for a while, wanting to reorganize what Yaoqun had said in my mind. In the midst of recollection, I felt that there were still many problems that I didn't quite understand, so I had to bring them up one by one. Just as I was about to prepare to ask questions, a terrifying shadow reappeared in my mind; this was because I had been away from my temporary base camp for two or three hours; I was afraid that something unexpected had happened there. Thinking of this, I quickly made a gesture to Big Fool "04": "Please go back and take a look quickly, see if there's any news; go quickly and come back quickly!" After speaking, I watched "04" set off, and then I asked Yaoqun the questions I wanted to ask:

"Miss Ji, assuming we launch a night attack tonight, do you think all the people under my command should participate?"

After listening, Qun pondered for a while: "On this point, I think you need to decide for yourself; because I don't know how you make your appearances in this area."

"Isn't it still my old job—Crane See's personal secretary, and head of the action branch—but I'm very confused right now, and I can't decide whether the people on our side should participate." This was because I had this doubt due to thinking about the consequences of participating.

"Then…" Yaoqun pondered for a moment; "How about we come up with a compromise, what do you think?"

"What kind of compromise?" I was a little confused; so I stared blankly at Yaoqun.

"I think before the night attack, Brother Ji Hu should give you a heads up; or let Mr. Shen (i.e. 04) come here once at 8 pm, after you get the news of the night attack, you should respond to the situation at the time, consider the matter, either participate, or mix with the Japanese special agents, see what actions they have during the night attack. What do you think?"

I nodded: "This method is not bad… But you didn't know that the Japanese army would also launch an offensive at midnight tonight when you planned the night attack earlier. Now that Brother Dingyuan has obtained this information, has your plan to launch a night attack changed at all? For example…"

Qun immediately interjected, very resolutely, "I plan to move it up an hour—that is to say, the devils are preparing to attack at midnight, we will launch around eleven o'clock; in order to catch them off guard. But it is still not very certain at the moment, because I am still waiting for Mai Shafu's information from last night…"

"Um… I suddenly thought of Mai Shafu's problem. This guy has also put a knot in my brain, and I have long wanted to analyze the role she is now playing more clearly: "I am still a little unclear about Mai Shafu's actions…"

### One Gain from Writing

— Translated by Rushui

A. Trollope put down his pen almost seventy-five years ago, and even now, he is still one of the great writers. But in his own eyes at the time, he confessed to being a vocabulary factory—meaning that he first produced a large number of words and then retailed them. In his autobiography, he mentioned the mechanical method of his work, saying:

"When I start a new book, I always prepare a diary, divide it into weeks, and then decide how much work to complete in those times.

"I then immersed myself in my work, day after day, and I stipulated how many pages to write. If I had a moment of laziness, the record of my work would enlighten me, warn me, and tell me not to slack off in my work.

"Depending on the situation, I prepare to write a certain number of pages per week. On average, there are always forty pages a week, a minimum of twenty pages, and sometimes it rises directly to one hundred and twelve pages. Because the number of pages is vague, I decided that each page should have at least 250 words, and I was afraid that the writing would become more and more blurry, so I wrote and calculated at the same time.

"I do this kind of transaction with the publisher, that is, how many words are how many words, it is my own responsibility if there is one word short, but there will be no cheap things for them if they exceed the quota.

"I am used to putting the clock in front of me, and I have to write 250 words in a quarter of an hour. Later, I found that 250 words in a quarter of an hour is almost predictable."

In the first twenty years of his writing career, he wrote twenty-four books, some of which were four or five parts—at that time, he worked in the British Post Office and had no free time all day long. Therefore, whenever he had time, he would urge himself to write. He gave his servants extra remuneration every week, asking them to wake him up every day, so that he could start working at 5:30.

He trained himself to be able to write anywhere, he took advantage of the train to travel, and he carried the booklet he had designed in advance with him. After returning home, he asked his wife to proofread for him. Sitting on the boat, he did not let go of the time to hide in the small room, preparing to avoid seasickness.

He does not regard himself as a genius. He said, "In my opinion, a shoemaker should also expect his inspiration to come, isn't it too ridiculous?

He has been engaged in writing for twenty years. He has written fifty books, most of which are two to five parts each. He has not boasted of writing immortal works, nor does he intend to pass them on to future generations. He has a recognized masterpiece called Barchester Towers, and he only hopes that he will not be completely forgotten by the world in twenty-five years after publication.

### Cosmic Rays

— Yu

Atomic energy can be used by the most intelligent human beings as a weapon to end World War II. Is it possible that cosmic rays cannot be used as a new weapon in World War III?

The psychology of ordinary people is always shocked by the power of the atomic bomb and regards it as the most powerful thing in the world, but they do not know that there is such a cosmic ray in the mysterious universe that has more energy than the atomic bomb.

Cosmic rays have long been an important issue studied and explored by scientists twenty years ago. It has been proven and confirmed that cosmic rays are a kind of particle with extremely high energy. It exists in almost all parts of the universe like photons and electrons, and radiates to the vast star clusters at all times. After entering the Earth's atmosphere, it can only exist in the high sky one hundred miles above the ground, that is, the ionization layer that reflects high-frequency radio waves. Because when the particle group of cosmic rays shoots into the atmosphere at an alarming high speed, it collides with the atomic nuclei in the air and tears it apart to form ionization, which is the cause of the ionization layer. And these cosmic rays that have been collided and connected become particles with higher speeds than themselves. These particles continue to move forward and reach the ground.

This kind of high-speed particle that collides with air atoms is called Meson. Its mass is 200 times larger than that of an electron, but its life is extremely short, about one millionth of a second. Also, because the density when it reaches the ground is very small, people are not injured or painful at all, even though they are impacted or penetrated by hundreds of these intermediate particles every second. Otherwise, everything on the earth will become radioactive after being penetrated by it. What a terrible phenomenon this is. This is due to the subtlety of creation, which has already tightly surrounded our surroundings with an atmosphere, preventing cosmic rays from directly entering and reducing its density and life. Also, if a meteor rushes into the atmosphere, it will also give it resistance, causing it to ripen and burn to incandescence or even turn to ashes and fall, so it will not harm humans. So we must know that air is not only designed for us to breathe.

Now let's talk about each individual intermediate particle. The energy contained in it is 200 billion electron volts, while the energy of Gamma rays is only 2 million electron volts, so the energy of the intermediate particle is 1,000 times greater than the energy of Gamma rays. If these energies are used to make weapons, wouldn't it be 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb?

Professor Robert A. Millikan of the University of California and other scientists used experiments to confirm that cosmic rays do come from between the stars. They also discovered that cosmic rays can be bent by the Earth's magnetic field.

Recently, scientists at the General Electric Research Laboratory announced that they have been able to artificially produce intermediate particles. This is what they created with an electron accelerator that can generate 100 million volts. Then, we are getting closer to the time when we can use cosmic ray energy. At that time, we will step from the atomic energy era into the cosmic ray energy era. Scientific progress is endless!

### A Casual Talk about Dust

— Ye Lei

In a beam of sunlight coming in through a skylight, you can see countless dust particles: actively flying around; when a breeze blows, you can also see groups of dust particles, spreading like fog. Since we live in this dust, we should have a clear understanding of dust. Now let's talk about dust.

Strictly speaking, dust can be divided into two types: large dust that can be seen with the naked eye, called "dust"; small dust that cannot be seen with the naked eye, called "fine dust". According to research reports, the distribution of dust: less in rural areas than in cities; less in high altitudes than in low altitudes; less in the morning than in the evening.

Because dust contains a lot of pathogens, everyone hates it. Usually we live in it, just like a frog living in a pile of garbage, and we don't seem to feel it at all.

Although dust is harmful to humans, humans cannot do without it. Especially fine dust, it makes a great contribution to mankind.

Do you believe it? Fine dust can create a blue background for the sky. Decorate that beautiful colorful glow.

Because there are many fine dust particles floating in the sky, these fine dust particles are like mirrors, which can reflect light; the light emitted from the sun contains seven colors of light waves such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple; among them, the shorter blue light wave is most easily reflected by fine dust and reflected into our eyes, so the sky appears blue. However, it is a pity that the ultraviolet rays that are beneficial to us are also weakened as a result, which is a fly in the ointment.

When sunlight passes through fine dust with a larger density or larger particles, it also has a reflective effect on longer wavelength yellow and red light waves, especially when the sun shines obliquely, the space through which the light passes is larger, and the reflection from fine dust is also more, thus forming a beautiful glow, especially appearing in the evening and morning.

During the day, relying on the diffuse reflection of dust, every corner is brightly lit. If there is no dust, except for the places where the sun shines, I am afraid that they will all become a dark world. At the same time, strong cosmic rays will directly hit the Earth's surface, affecting the survival of living things.

When pilots fly at high altitudes, they often see the sky as dark, and the stars in the high sky are sparse in fine dust, lacking objects to reflect light to make them enter their eyes, so what they can see is a piece of darkness. Flying in this darkness is like being in the night, and of course the starlight can be seen.

Poets who travel around the mountains and rivers often read the beautiful greenness of the water in the lake. Regarding this, it was once misunderstood that it was the surface of the water reflecting the blue of the sky. Later, Kings and others, professors of physics at the University of California in the United States, discovered that water also contains a lot of fine dust when using light waves to detect submarines. Sunlight enters the water and also appears blue due to the reflection of these fine dust particles.

In addition to painting a beautiful and unpredictable picture for nature, dust also plays an important role in the formation of raindrops.

We know that when we breathe on the glass, water vapor can condense into water droplets after contacting the glass. This fact tells us that water vapor must be in contact with a colder solid before it can condense, otherwise it will not condense even if the temperature drops.

When the water vapor in the atmosphere reaches a saturated state, if the temperature drops below the dew point, it will condense into water droplets with fine dust as the center. These water droplets will slowly increase, and when they are attracted by gravity, they will fall and become "rain"; therefore, fine dust is a necessary substance for the condensation of water vapor. These fine dust particles are called "condensation nuclei".

If there is no fine dust, the water vapor in the atmosphere will condense on the surface of any solid at any time, just like in the yellow plum season, everything and our own bodies will be submerged in humidity.

At the beginning of chaos, the surface of the earth underwent a long period of weathering before there was so-called "dust holding"; later, a part of the dust slowly turned into a colloid, and this colloid may be the beginning of life. Don't you believe it? When meteoritic iron rushes into the atmosphere, it is worn down by the atmosphere and becomes tens of thousands of iron fine dust particles, suspended in the air, and then transformed into chlorophyll in plant industry by the action of sunlight, and further refined by our digestive organs, before it becomes red blood cells in the blood. In this way, dust may be the raw material for making organisms. I hope everyone will understand dust and understand its relationship with human beings.

### All Kinds of Rocket Launchers

— Chen Feng

Speaking of the history of rocket launchers, it was actually invented by our Chinese first. Because the principle of rocket launchers is the same as that of the Chinese "Gaosheng", which is to use the reaction force of the gas generated after gunpowder burns to push the object into the sky and then explode. Before rifles were invented, rocket launchers had been used in Europe, but the disadvantage was that there was no way to correct the explosion time, and the fuse was exposed to the air and was easily damp. Therefore, after the invention of rifles, the research on this problem was put aside.

Around 1930, someone in Xishan, Beiping tested rocket launchers. It is said that they could fire 4,000 feet high, but perhaps because the testers were Chinese, the government thought it was somewhat unreliable, so they did not pay attention to it.

Before 1932, there were many rocket clubs in Germany that used rocket launchers to explore high-altitude meteorology. After Hitler came to power, he put these groups under a military vehicle agency for research. From 1932 to 1938, preliminary success was achieved, but large-scale application still required many improvements.

The United States has always only had private individuals engaged in research. In 1937, an old professor conducted a public test in Shahan, but because the United States had not yet participated in the war at that time, private arms dealers thought that they could not make money, so no one paid attention to it. It was not until 1940 that there were larger-scale tests. At that time, five students (including one Canadian, one Yugoslavian, and one Chinese, Qian Weichang, who is now a professor in the Department of Aeronautics at Tsinghua University) from the Department of Aeronautics at Caltech (C.I.T.) collected tens of thousands of yuan to engage in preliminary research.

In 1942, the German V1 and V2 began to appear. V1 uses the principle of rocket launchers and aviation assistance. It had already achieved success in 1938, but the large-scale bombing by the United States hindered the mass production of V2. The success of V2, on the one hand, preserved the lives of many German Air Force personnel, and at the same time, due to its high speed (3,600 miles per hour), the British anti-aircraft guns were helpless.

The Soviet Union has been engaged in rocket launcher research since 1938. Since 1940, due to the threat of German heavy artillery, it has been engaged in the research of short-range rocket launchers (30-50 miles). Its advantage is that there is no reaction force when firing, and no heavy gun mount is required, so its mobility on the battlefield is very high. When the Soviet army launched a large-scale counterattack, it used two or three hundred rocket launchers to open a large gap ten miles wide and twenty miles deep in the German army's position.

American rocket launchers are also short-range. There is one that can shoot 7,000 meters away. Its advantage is that it is low in manufacturing cost and easy to carry. In 1943, a small rocket launcher called Private was installed on American warships, which could shoot 7-15 miles. Later, there was Private D., which could shoot 25-30 miles, which has exceeded the range of heavy artillery. Moreover, ordinary heavy artillery must be installed on battleships because of its large reaction force, but rocket launchers have no reaction force and do not need to be installed on large ships, so small warships have become the most important part of the navy.

A recent American-made rocket launcher called Wac Corporal uses liquid fuel. Its outer body is one foot in diameter and sixteen feet long, with a pointed round head and a tail that has been reduced to 500 pounds. The main purpose of this rocket is to explore high-altitude meteorology. The liquid fuel is installed in the steel combustion chamber at the tail, using fuming nitric acid as a chlorinating agent and aniline as fuel. The rocket is placed vertically on the launch pad, with the tail about half a foot off the ground. Remote control is used for launching. When the fuel comes into contact with the gasification agent, the barrel containing the fuel increases the pressure due to the generation of gas. When the temperature is 2,600 degrees Celsius and the pressure is three pounds per square inch, the gas pushes open the tail valve and pushes the rocket launcher to rise. According to estimates, the height of the projectile's ascent can reach 43 miles, and it may actually be more than that. Ordinary clouds are one mile high, and balloons can rise to twelve miles. The meteorology we currently know is all above twelve miles. To explore the height above twelve miles, we must use radar.

Rocket launchers are not necessarily killing weapons. Their development is still in its early stages. The future improvement of rocket launchers will make a considerable contribution to the exploration of high-altitude climate.

The moon revolves around the earth, standing in a position where gravity and centrifugal force are balanced. If we can launch a rocket launcher that reaches this balanced layer, then the projectile can float in the air. If we install various instruments, we can measure high-altitude meteorology. But to reach this balanced layer, it must be at least one hundred to two hundred miles above the ground. The initial velocity of this rocket launcher must be four miles per second. Under the current technical situation, it cannot be achieved, because we have not yet invented materials suitable for such high temperatures (5,200 degrees) and pressures. One day, after the successful application of atomic energy, this goal can be achieved.

### The Science of Hunger

— Sun Jialin

Hunger and pain, fear and anger, are the basic reasons that determine biological activities. "Solving hunger" is one of the most important issues in the biological world. "Sad intestines and hungry fire burn each other day by day" (Yuan Haowen) "If driven by hungry fire, how can there be no food on the flat ground." (Fan Chengda) Writing the feeling of hunger as "hungry fire" is not an exaggeration, because this ball of hungry fire can indeed drive people to run around, commit crimes and kill people, and do things they don't want to do.

People who are hungry for a long time but not hungry may generally think that the discomfort of hunger increases with time until they starve to death. However, the facts are very different from what we imagine. The feeling of hunger only lasts for a few days before it disappears, and then you no longer feel hungry.

A lawyer named Viterbi on the island of Corsica was sentenced to death for a political incident. He decided to stop eating and drinking to avoid the suffering of execution. In the last eighteen days of his life, he left a careful diary. On the third day, the feeling of hunger disappeared, and although thirst was often felt afterwards, hunger never reappeared.

The cause of hunger Everyone knows that "an empty stomach" is the cause of hunger, but an empty stomach (meaning an empty stomach) cannot explain the feeling of hunger. Within one to two hours after a stomach wash, you will not feel hungry, and at this time the stomach is of course empty.

Some people speculate that the dull pain of hunger is caused by the hydrochloric acid secreted in the empty stomach, but in fact there is no basis. The empty stomach does not secrete gastric acid when fasting; and people with Achylis Gastrica still have the feeling of hunger. So hydrochloric acid cannot explain the cause of hunger.

Some people have also created a theory: "Hunger originates from the swelling of the gastric glands. If fasting continues, hunger will disappear, because the gastric glands are completely depleted, and the abdominal distension will be restored. When the stomach receives food, the swelling of the gastric glands can be restored immediately, and hunger will be relieved." However, the swelling and contraction of the gastric glands seems too mysterious, and this theory still has no scientific basis.

The result of stomach wall contraction A hundred years ago, Weber said: "The empty stomach, the muscles around it contract strongly, so that the stomach cavity is lost, which causes part of what we call the feeling of hunger."

This statement has been proven experimentally by Washburn: Washburn passed a rubber tube through his own esophagus all the way into his stomach, and there was a large soft rubber ball attached to the lower end of the tube. During the experiment, the rubber ball was gently inflated, and connected to a pressure gauge and Float Recordey. These ingenious devices can record the movement of the stomach very sensitively.

Before Washburn felt hungry, and when the feeling of hunger had disappeared, the curve recorded by the stomach movement showed that the stomach wall did not contract. But when Washburn felt the onset of hunger, the strong contraction record of the stomach wall clearly showed it.

Washburn's experiment of seeking trouble after eating his fill of white rice finally proved the cause of hunger.

### Is Mutation a Chemical Change?

— Hao Tianhe

The difference between mutations produced by short-wave radiation or chemical reactions is due to the difference in energy applied by these two types of reactions. The energy of short-wave radiation is usually powerful enough to cause a drastic change in the structure of the gene, transforming it from one stable arrangement to another. On the other hand, the reaction of the gene with chemical drugs, because it contains less energy, can produce less drastic changes, that is, transferring the gene to a moderate and relatively stable arrangement. In fact, after treatment with chemical drugs, the gene is bound to undergo changes to some extent, causing the originally stable gene to produce a new, unstable gene.

Since the first positive results were obtained with mustard gas, the work of studying chemical mutagens has gradually developed. The substances found, whether in terms of their chemical structure or their pharmacological effects, are related to mustard gas. Mustard gas has extraordinary penetrating power and is also a protoplasmic fixative. Items with these two properties are not necessarily mutagens, so what can affect mutation is definitely not osmic acid, nor picric acid, because animals will be killed after being treated with these two acids. At the same time, it cannot be said that every powerful vesicant gas is a mutagen, because Lewisite showed completely negative results in two CIB tests. Up to now, only three kinds of chemical substances have been found that can achieve the same effect as mustard gas. They all belong to this type of nitrogen- or sulfur-containing mustard gas, and their chemical formulas are as follows: (1) O(CH2·CH2·S·CH2·CH2·CD2, (2) N(CH2·HC2·CD3, and (3) N(CH2·CH2·CD·2

Assuming that chemical mutagens can directly act on the substances in the gene, then this matter will inevitably attract attention. What is of interest is that these active compounds all contain an unsaturated atom (: sulfur or -nitrogen). This atom may be able to combine with the substances that make up the gene. The activity of this compound will change with the type of side chains of vesicant mustard gas such as CLCH2·CH2, etc. This kind of structure, together with the tendency of intramolecular cyclization, creates onion compounds. These compounds, because they contain relatively active nitrogen (...N) or sulfur (:S), assuming that the effect of mutagens is due to the reaction caused by unsaturated atoms in the gene and compound, then it can be expected that replacing sulfur (:S) and nitrogen (...N) with oxygen (:O) will not produce active substances, because the compounds formed by adding divalent oxygen are unstable in aqueous solutions. (And oxygen mustard gas: O Mustard is not a vesicant gas.) However, stable compounds must be composed of carbon-chlorine group compounds, equivalent to carbon-chlorine mustard gas (CO Mustard). Unfortunately, it has not been tested yet. As for lacrimatory gas, chloracetone and dichloracctone (compounds with CICH2——side chains, replacing CICH2·CH2—— in mustard gas) have been observed. The activity of this type of compound is very weak. In fact, very clear positive results have not been obtained, although these two compounds may contain slight mutagenic properties. Sulfur-containing compounds and chlorcthylacctone, although they also have vesicant effects, the latter may be more active. But it is still impossible to use this type of compound for testing now. (To be continued)
