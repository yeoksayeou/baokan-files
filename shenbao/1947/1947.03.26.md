### End of the Plenary Session Marks the Start of the End of One-Party Rule and the Return of Power to the People: Minister Peng's Remarks to Reporters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Third Plenary Session discussed the issue of consulting with various parties on the reorganization of the government and other political matters, and it has been decided to entrust the Standing Committee with the responsibility for handling this.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The proposals completed by the Third Plenary Session will be submitted to the Standing Committee for decision. The important proposals to be decided are: (1) Vice Chairman of the National Government, (2) National Government Committee members of the Kuomintang, (3) Candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan, and (4) Decisions on personnel of the National Government. It is heard that the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan has already been internally decided.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 5:00 PM. Minister Peng answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What is the political outlook after the Third Plenary Session? When will the government reorganization be completed?

Minister Peng replied: The Kuomintang has completed three major missions: (1) overthrowing the imperial system, (2) overthrowing the warlords, and (3) defeating the Japanese invasion. Currently, the target of the revolution is the violent terrorists who attempt to conquer the majority with the minority. On the active front, the Kuomintang aims to establish constitutional governance and enrich the people's livelihood. The theme of the Third Plenary Session is to end the politics of one-party responsibility. From today onwards, the Kuomintang will begin to return power to the people. The reorganization of the National Government Committee is expected to be completed within this month, followed by the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. However, reorganizing the government is an easy task, and the realization of democratic governance depends entirely on the responsibility and discipline of the entire nation. We should not overemphasize changes in government personnel and neglect the prerequisites for the success of democratic constitutionalism.

Question: What is the recent military situation?

Answer: In the Northeast, the Communist army is attacking Tonghua, but it is not a cause for concern. In Shandong, the National Army recovered Dongping on the 23rd and Dong'a on the 24th. In Shaanxi, the National Army is pursuing the Communist army that is retreating towards Qingjian and Suide. Soon, northern Shaanxi west of the Yellow River will be completely pacified.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Yu Youren recently submitted the following opinions to relevant parties regarding the draft organization law of the Supervisory Yuan: The name of the Audit Department should remain the same, or if it is absolutely necessary to change it, it should be changed to "Audit General Office" to distinguish it from the provincial audit offices. Another suggestion by Yu is that the Supervisory Yuan should add an Investigation Department to handle investigation cases and collect relevant information. It is also heard that the number of supervisory committee members will be increased to around 200 in the future, and the number of committees will also be increased.

### Professional Groups Strive for Quotas for National Assembly Representatives

Chen Da of the Ministry of Social Affairs Presents Opinions to the Legislative Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] As constitutional government is imminent, and the election laws for National Assembly representatives and legislators are about to be formulated and promulgated, it is rumored that the Legislative Yuan's Review Committee will reduce the quota of representatives from professional groups to the lowest proportion. This not only ignores the importance of various professional groups but also violates national policy, causing widespread anxiety. Therefore, a joint meeting was held at the Central Hotel at 9:00 AM on the 25th. Representatives from various groups, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunxu, Wang Yisheng, Zhuo Zonghai, Jiang Yiping, Xiong Guoqing, Shen Jiuxiang, and Gu Yuxiu, a total of thirty people, attended. Wang Xiaolian was elected as the chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, it was decided to go to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs to submit a telegram, stating the five major reasons why the quota of professional representatives must be equal to the quota of regional representatives. Subsequently, Minister Gu Zhenggang personally received them, expressed his acceptance, and promised to convey it to the National Defense Council, saying that the Legislative Yuan was paying attention. In the afternoon, they went to the Legislative Yuan again. As President Sun was not present, it was decided to meet and talk with him on the morning of the 26th, and to invite all legislators at 2:00 PM on the 26th to exchange opinions.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Scheduled to Hold Central Standing Committee Routine Meeting Today

Zhang Junmai's Trip to India Likely to Be Called Off

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to hold a routine meeting of the Central Standing Committee this afternoon to study concrete implementation measures for the common governance program and discuss matters such as government committee personnel.

Hu Haimen, who is currently staying in the north, also plans to come to Shanghai in the next few days. As Chairman Chiang asked Zhang Junmai to study concrete measures for the Executive Yuan to be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and many party affairs are pending decision, his trip to India to attend the Pan-Asian Conference will likely be called off.

### Garrison Headquarters Announces the Course of the Suppression of the Rebellion in Tainan

Ring Leaders like Tu Guangming Executed by Firing Squad

[Central News Agency, Tainan, 25th] The Southern Taiwan Garrison Headquarters announced the course of the suppression of the southern rebellion in the past half-month, stating: Since the 3rd of this month, rebellions have occurred successively in various places south of Chiayi. The National Army has repeatedly exercised restraint and strived for a peaceful resolution. However, in addition to arbitrarily beating mainlanders, the rioters have become even more intensified. On the evening of the 6th, the rebel leader Tu Guangming and others, hiding weapons, also coerced Kaohsiung Mayor Huang Zhongge to accompany them to the Fortress Headquarters to make various excessive demands to Commander Peng Mengji, such as taking over the arms depots and disarming the troops. Commander Peng sternly refused, and Tu and others even drew their guns. Fortunately, bystanders intervened and embraced them, and Tu and two accomplices were detained together. As the situation developed to this point, Peng also took decisive measures. He ordered the dispatch of troops to suppress the rebellion. It was not until the 8th that order was restored in the Kaohsiung urban area. Fengshan was pacified on the 7th, Pingtung on the 8th, Gangshan on the 9th, Tainan on the 10th, and Xinying on the 11th. As of now, the various units have seized civilian ammunition, which belongs to the headquarters. There are more than 480 rifles, 25 light machine guns, 7 heavy machine guns, more than 30 pistols, 120,000 rounds of ammunition, and countless military sabers (excluding Tainan and Chiayi). More than several hundred suspects have been detained. The rioter Tu and two others have been executed by firing squad.

### Compensation Measures for Teachers and Staff Killed or Injured in Taiwan Promulgated

### He Siyuan Speaks in Nanjing About the Truth of the Census in Beiping: There Is Conclusive Evidence of the Communist Party's Conspiracy to Riot

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the details of the Beiping police and security agencies' census on February 18th and the detention of several criminals, Beiping Mayor He Siyuan told reporters before returning to Beiping on the 25th: "In the week before February 18th, the Communist army had the following riotous and terrorist acts: (1) Disguised as farmers and merchants, they sneaked into Tongxian, 20 kilometers from Beiping, occupied the county seat at night, burned houses, and massacred people, and disturbed the peace 2 kilometers outside Yongdingmen in Beiping. (2) Destroyed the power plants that supply Beiping with tap water, trams, and radio station power. (3) Robbed the special express train on the Pingjin Railway and bombed railway bridges, causing the Pingjin train to be out of service for two days. (4) Declared an attack on Beiping. Communist spies were lurking in Beiping City. When the Communist army disturbed the suburbs on the 21st, they responded with gunfire, and the citizens were startled several times in one night. (5) Communist spies conspired to riot, and robberies occurred repeatedly. In addition, a U.S. military officer was shot and killed on the streets of Beiping. At that time, Beiping had fallen into a state of wartime terror. The battle near Xushui Baoding along the Pingbao line was fierce. The people of Beiping and the press requested the government to quickly seek countermeasures. The census was conducted based on this situation. On February 18th, the Beiping Police Department conducted a citywide census. A total of 1,165 cases of unreported households and 176 cases of people without national identity cards were found. They were ordered to go to the police station to complete the procedures and were released within 24 hours. There were also 114 cases of opium addicts, 5 cases of private possession of military firearms, and 181 cases of gambling. They were all released after 24 hours. A few were handed over to military agencies. Most of these criminals have been released after being punished according to law. In addition, seven people confessed to being members of the Chinese Communist Party and committing crimes of attempting to assassinate, set fire, destroy railways, and destroy water and electricity. There is conclusive evidence, and they will all be punished according to law. Among them, one person, named Wang Quan, is a Tsinghua student who admitted to participating in the Communist Party's riot conspiracy. Because he is a young student, he has been allowed to be released on bail by the school authorities. The list and punishment details can be announced after I return to Beiping if necessary. However, in a large city with a population of 1.8 million, the technical difficulties of conducting inspections are almost unavoidable. For example, Guoxue scholar Fu Dingyi, a dentist, and a female employee of the Police Relief General Administration were misunderstandings caused by technical difficulties, but once proven, they were released immediately, and I personally went to express my condolences. As for the rumors of arresting a large number of liberals, this is a common propaganda tactic of the Communist Party. If anyone can provide the name of a liberal who was arrested, I will immediately investigate and announce the truth. The situation at the time was very tense, so it was not possible to seek instructions from the central government in advance. It is the government's responsibility to impose legal sanctions on conspiracies to riot, disrupt public order, bandits, and spies, and to legally correct those who privately possess military firearms, gather for gambling, fail to report households, and impersonate and lurk. The general Communist periphery keeps silent about the Communist army's destruction of roads, digging of embankments, massacre of innocent people, riots, and disturbances, and only opposes the government's legitimate administrative actions to protect the people's lives and property, which is not the attitude that true liberals should have."

The full text of the economic reform plan passed by the Third Plenary Session will be published tomorrow.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 25th] Director Du Yuming has concluded the military meeting in Changchun, and as Dalian is about to be taken over, he returned to Shenyang by special train late at night on the day the meeting ended. Chairman Ji Liang Huasheng traveled with him for a part of the journey due to official business.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] Du Yuming returned by special train at noon on the 25th.

The troops are currently at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] It is learned that our side has appointed the mayor of Lushun, but in order to respect the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, it seems that Soviet consent is being sought. In addition, Tai Shihhui has telegraphed Dalian Mayor Pu Xueqian, urging him to come to Shenyang immediately.

### Negotiations on the Repayment of Lend-Lease Materials: China and the United States Will Begin Negotiations: Repayment to the Soviet Union Will Still Be Based on Barter Agreements

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the two foreign affairs questions asked by reporters, Minister Peng read the Foreign Ministry spokesperson's reply at the press conference on the 25th as follows:

Question: The U.S. government has proposed to begin negotiations between China and the United States regarding the repayment of lend-lease materials. What is the Chinese government's attitude? Which agency should be responsible for the negotiations?

Answer: The Chinese government will agree to begin negotiations with the U.S. government on this matter. These negotiations should be conducted through normal diplomatic channels.

Question: What is the Chinese government's position on the repayment of materials lent to China by the Soviet Union in the early stages of the war of resistance?

Answer: Regarding these wartime materials, China and the Soviet Union originally entered into barter agreements during the war of resistance. The Chinese government is implementing these agreements and has successively exported Chinese materials to repay the Soviet Union. It will continue to fulfill them in the future. The items we ship to the Soviet Union include tin, wool, tea, grain, etc.

### The Turmoil in Taiwan Is Largely Subdued: Bai Chongxi Inspects Hsinchu: Rioters Will Be Searched If They Do Not Repent

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] Bai Chongxi and his party visited Sun Moon Lake yesterday. On the morning of the 25th at 8:00, they left the lake, changed cars at Shuili Pit, and arrived in Hsinchu City for consolation at 1:40 PM. Bai first listened to the report of Mayor Chen Zhenbin, then gave instructions to the army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers stationed there. Then he spoke with representatives of various groups and public opinion organizations, and encouraged them to assist the army in pacifying the local area and restoring social stability. At 4:10, he inspected the Hsinchu County Government. At 5:15, he continued north, and returned to Taipei at 6:10 PM. Chen Yi went to the station to welcome him. Mr. Bai visited various places in Taiwan for consolation for a total of five days. He told reporters from the Central News Agency on the afternoon of the 25th: "Based on what I have seen in various places, I believe that the turmoil in Taiwan has largely been subdued. As for the small number of rioters and communists who have fled to the remote mountains, there are about 1,000 people. If they do not repent and reform themselves to the government soon, the National Army will track them down." He reiterated that "Taiwan will never have similar turmoil again in the future, and I hope that the general good compatriots and public school personnel inside and outside the province will continue to work with peace of mind." Bai said that the reform within the province and the people's elections of county magistrates and mayors can be easily resolved, but the general economic problems in Taiwan are more difficult. He also said that he attaches importance to Taiwan's police system.

### Representatives from All Walks of Life in Taipei Visit Chen Yi to Express Their Gratitude

[Another Dispatch] Speaker Zhou Jianshou of the Taipei City Council, Su Weiwu, a representative of the Taiwan Provincial Education Association, Wu Chunlin, a representative of the Taiwan Provincial Cultural Promotion Association, and five others visited Chen Yi at 4:00 PM on the 25th. They expressed that the "February 28th" incident was unfortunate, and expressed their gratitude for Governor Chen's lenient handling, especially for Chairman Chiang's concern for Taiwan. Chen said: "The incident is over. I hope that people from all walks of life will work with peace of mind and fully assist the government to bring about social stability as soon as possible." Chen also instructed them to advise young students to return to school quickly and not waste their studies, and hoped that they would solemnly tell the citizens that if anyone is hiding weapons, they must surrender them to the military and police agencies as soon as possible.

### A Major Battle Is Brewing on the Border Between Shaanxi and Shanxi: The Area Near Yan'an Is Cleared and Ansai Is Recovered: National Army of the Twelfth War Zone Enters Zuoyun

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] The Communist army near Yan'an has been completely wiped out. The National Army recovered Ansai on the 24th and is now advancing towards Anding and the Wayaobao area. The National Army, advancing eastward along the Great Wall, captured Shangchi on the 24th. The Communist army in that area fled towards Sanbian.

[Another Dispatch] The National Army on the periphery of Yan'an continued to mop up. The fighting on all lines has been very fierce for the past two days. A part of the National Army entered the county seat of Ansai, 65 li northwest of Yan'an, at 6:30 PM on the 24th and completely recovered the county seat. It is now approaching Weiyuanbao.

[Another Dispatch] After suffering an unprecedented blow, the Communist army in northern Shaanxi is now gathering remnants in Anzhai, Qingjian, Yanchang, Suide, Wayaobao, and other places, and urgently transferring troops from northwestern Shanxi to the Suide and Qingjian areas in Shaanxi, launching an offensive and still dreaming of returning to the old nest.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Another battle is brewing on the border between Shaanxi and Shanxi. Both sides are stationing troops on both sides of the Yellow River, and the prelude to the decisive battle is about to begin. The Communist army intends to defend Suide in order to cover the transportation of a large amount of materials into Shanxi. The opening of the Xianyu Highway is not far off.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 25th] At 6:00 PM on the 24th, the National Army recovered Ansai. The remaining Communists continued to retreat to the north towards Long'anzhen and other areas. As of the 25th, 1,762 residents of Yan'an had registered to return to the city. The Provincial Government Emergency Relief Team sent 200 million yuan to distribute.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] It is learned that a part of the National Army that recovered Yan'an and went north had reached the vicinity of Panlong, 90 li north of Yan'an, by the morning of the 24th. The Communist army's "Jin-Sui Military Region" has frequent military movements. The Communist airport in Baiwenzhen, northwest of Shanxi Province, is stationed with three fighter planes modified by Japanese engineers. Japanese pilots are constantly flying reconnaissance missions on both sides of the Yellow River.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 25th] The first step in the enhanced joint defense measures of the Second and Twelfth War Zones is that the National Army in Datong has moved towards Zuoyun, Youyu, and Pinglu, with a trend of gradually pushing towards the river bank to support the war in northern Shaanxi and prevent the Communist army in Shenmu and Fugu from crossing the river to threaten the Datong area. The cadres of Zuoyun and other counties have already set off with the army. Currently, except for Datong, Yingxian, Guangling, Yanggao, Tianzhen, Xinxian, and Dingxiang, all other counties in northern Shanxi are still occupied by the Communist army. One part of the main force of the Communist army that retreated from Wayaobao is attempting to counterattack at an opportune moment. There are still remnants of the Communist army in the Xujiazhuang area northeast of Yan'an. A large part of the Communist army is also gathered in the northwest of Zichang County, and the National Army will deal them a heavy blow.

[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 25th] The National Army of the Twelfth War Zone recovered Zuoyun, an important town of the Communist army in northern Zeng, on the afternoon of the 25th. The Communist army retreated to the southwest. The results of the battle are being investigated. The National Army is continuing to advance towards Youyu. The Communist army has occupied Zuoyun for a long time. The area was occupied by the Communist army during the War of Resistance. Now, the Two and Twelfth War Zones are cooperating with the National Army in northern Shaanxi to recover Zuoyun, which has dealt a great blow to the Chinese Communists attempting to protect northwestern Shanxi.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] (1) The National Army in Xiaoyi, Shanxi Province, successively recovered Gaoyangzhen, killing or wounding more than 1,000 Communist soldiers and 18 officers below the rank of major. (2) The Communist army in southern Shanxi attempted to cut off the connection between Quwo and Yicheng, and once attacked Quvucunzhen unsuccessfully.

### Legislative Yuan's 319th Regular Meeting Passes National Assembly Organization Law

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 25th] This morning, the People's Socialist Party legislators attended the Legislative Yuan regular meeting for the first time. When new legislators such as Dang Zhushi Xian, Cui Xinyi, Sun Qu, and Ji Jingxuan were introduced to the attendees, the entire hall responded with applause.

The National Assembly Organization Law proposal was passed at the Legislative Yuan's fourth session, 319th regular meeting this morning. The draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives was also discussed at the meeting. However, due to some points still needing further study, it was resolved to send it to the Constitution and Law Committee for review, to be presented at the 320th regular meeting on the 27th. President Sun chaired today's meeting. After the meeting began, the entire assembly observed a moment of silence for the recently deceased legislator Zhang Fengjiu. Then, the National Assembly Organization Law was discussed, with Liu Kezhuang, chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee, explaining that the review results were not significantly different from the original proposal from the National Defense Committee. Articles 4 and 10 were only amended in wording. Article 13 of the original proposal stipulated the establishment of one usher and two deputy ushers to maintain order in the assembly hall under the president's orders. During the review, it was argued that this could lead to improper interference and disputes, so it was proposed to cancel this provision. Article 14 (originally Article 15) stipulated that each National Assembly session should adjourn itself after completing its tasks, which was changed to "shall adjourn immediately upon completion of its tasks."

Legislator Lu then spoke, stating that constitutional laws are of great importance and that they should be studied in detail and deliberated carefully, without rushing. Sun Jiulu also expressed the same sentiment. However, Liu Kezhuang believed that according to the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, all relevant constitutional laws should be formulated within three months after the Constitution is promulgated. The meeting then decided to continue the discussion.

Legislators debated fiercely over the need to establish ushers in the National Assembly. President Sun pointed out that other countries have ushers, but this is a new concept in China. Lin Bin and others believed that if the president could exert his authority, order would not be difficult to maintain. If ushers were established and interfered improperly, it could cause disturbances. It was also argued that not establishing ushers was acceptable. Xia Erkang also believed that having ushers could make maintaining order more difficult.

Jian Guansan and others believed that it was necessary to establish ushers, pointing out that in an assembly hall with around 3,000 people, disorder was predictable without ushers. Sheng Zhenwei also believed that practicing democracy required cultivating a habit of maintaining order, and without ushers, direct conflicts would occur between the president and representatives.

Chen Guyuan and others proposed compromise solutions, suggesting that ushers be selected from among the representatives by the Discipline Committee, or that the president concurrently serve as usher. In the final vote, the review opinion was passed, and the National Assembly will not have ushers.

Another contested issue was the number of members in the presidium. Lin Bin believed that based on past experience, having too many members in the presidium was not very beneficial, but increasing the number of 25 was acceptable. Zhao Naiquan believed that increasing the number was unnecessary, and Chen Ruxuan believed that one president and one or two vice presidents were sufficient. In the vote, the original proposal was passed, and the National Assembly will have a presidium composed of 25 members elected by the attending representatives.

The Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives Has Been Sent to the Constitutional and Legal Committee for Study

Regarding whether the term of the National Assembly should be specified, Wang Yuxiang believed that it should be specified. Zhong Tianxin believed that if the organizational law stipulated matters not stipulated in the Constitution, it would inevitably be suspected of violating the Constitution. Lin Bin explained that the reasons for convening the National Assembly in the future would be inconsistent, the tasks would be different, and the terms would naturally vary. Making rigid stipulations in advance would not be appropriate. It was decided to pass the review opinion.

The draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives was then discussed. Liu Kezhuang explained the review process, pointing out that the main point of contention was the allocation of seats. Regarding the qualifications of electors and candidates in Article 5, the phrase "dereliction of duty" in the original draft was deleted after review and replaced with the second clause, "those who have been convicted of corruption while serving in public office." A new clause was added, "those who use opium or other substitutes." Article 6 involves the right to elect and be elected for naturalized citizens. The original draft did not mention the right to be elected. It is now stipulated that naturalized citizens who have been naturalized for ten years and meet the requirements have the right to be elected. Article 9 concerns the electoral roll. The original draft stipulated that there should only be one copy, which would be vulnerable to damage and forgery. During the review, it was changed to two copies, a primary and a secondary, for easy reference. Article 12 stipulates the number of nominators for candidates. The original proposal stipulated that candidates must be nominated by 100 electors. There was consideration to increase this number, but the original number was retained, with the addition of "or nominated by a political party." Chapter 3 stipulates the organization of election authorities. After the review, an election commission was added to the Central Election Office, with the chief supervisor of elections serving as chairman. Some legislators believed that after having an election commission, there was no need to have a chief supervisor, but it was decided to retain this provision for the assembly to decide.

After the report, Ke Tuzong and others spoke, raising three questions about the election regulations: (1) The Central Election Office is determined by law. How will the law stipulate it? (2) There is a chief supervisor of elections before there is an election commission. Some people worry that people may be unwilling to serve as committee members. Mr. Qu himself does not agree that the supervisor concurrently serves as chairman of the commission. Peng Shishi and others expressed disagreement with the population calculation method. Jian Zhener believed that there were many differences between the election and recall of National Assembly representatives and the election and recall of legislators. It was necessary to send it to the Law Committee for review. Finally, it was decided to send the case to the Constitutional Law Committee for study in comparison with the legislator election and recall law, and then submit it to the regular meeting on the 27th for public decision.

[Report from our Xuzhou office on the 25th] After retaking Dong'a at 2 PM on the 24th, the National Army in Western Shandong continued to pursue the retreating Communist army, crossing Wangguandian at noon on the 25th and entering Pingyin at 4 PM. The regiment advancing northeast from Dongping retook Huangshan, Putaoshan, Donghengyu on the 24th, and continued to mop up the area 18 li southwest of Feicheng on the 25th. The National Army advancing northwest from Taiwenkou has bypassed the north of Dakou and retook Caozhuang and Manzhuang on the west side of the Jinpu Railway after retaking Nanliu. They are now directly pointing at Man'an.

[Another Dispatch] The situation in Western Shandong has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The National Army north of the Dawen River has been advancing in a fan shape on the Communist army in the triangular area between the Jinpu Railway and the Yellow River. About 20,000 of Liu Bocheng's remnants in the area have been encircled. The Yellow River is now over 5 meters deep, making it impossible for the Communist army to cross the river and flee westward.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 25th] After retaking Dong'a on the 24th, the National Army in Western Shandong continued to mop up northeastward, advancing in two routes today. One route has reached Fengkongjia Village (south of Pingyin), and the other has reached near Shiliulangkou.

[Report from our Jinan office on the 25th] The Communist army on the outskirts of Jinan is now attacking the National Army positions continuously every night. The fighting on the northeast side is more intense. One division of the Communist army's main force attacked Guodian and Wang Sheren Village at 9 PM on the 24th, sending people to Guodian Railway Station to plant landmines in an attempt to blow up the National Army armored vehicles. The National Army bravely fought back and drove away the Communist army attempting to blow up the armored vehicles. Fierce fighting continued overnight in both locations. By dawn on the 25th, the Communist army had retreated in defeat. During the fighting, a Communist army force briefly charged outside the east wall of the Chengcheng County Government in Wang Sheren Village, but was repelled by the county government's security forces, averting a crisis.

[Another Dispatch] The Communist army attacking Guodian, Hancang, East and West Liujia Village on the outskirts of Jinan was repelled by a strong National Army unit by the morning of the 25th. In the afternoon of the 25th, over a thousand Communist army troops from the southeast of Sangzidian, north of the Yellow River, were repelled by the National Army's armored vehicles. Despite repeated setbacks, the Communist army is still moving frequently, and is also stockpiling large amounts of grain and ammunition in Longshan, 25 kilometers east of Jinan, in Xiaokou, 35 kilometers north of Jinan, and in Yucheng, 40 kilometers northwest of Jinan, seemingly not abandoning its attempt to besiege Jinan.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Submits Opinions on This Year's Grain Collection and Procurement, Arguing that Famine Relief Is Impossible Without Control of Actual Goods

[Report from our Hangzhou office on the 25th] Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou from Nanjing yesterday and attended the provincial government meeting today. According to Shen, the central government will continue to collect grain this year, but only in areas with convenient transportation and abundant grain production, and the rest will be collected in legal tender. The 20% of the grain collected that should go to the province and the 50% that should go to the county will be purchased by the central government at the average grain price of July, August, September of this year. The provincial government believes that this matter is of great importance and has dispatched Chen Yi, Director of the Field and Food Department, to Nanjing at 4 PM this afternoon to submit opinions to the Ministry of Food: (1) What are the standards for convenient transportation and sufficient grain production? (2) If all the actual goods obtained by the province and county are purchased by the central government, then the province and county will have no control over actual goods and will not be able to provide famine relief. (3) If the grain price in July, August, and September is low, the budgets of the province and county this year will not be balanced. How can the burden be evenly distributed among the grain-collecting counties?

According to provincial government sources, the central government also intends to revise the revenue and expenditure system, transferring the 30% of land tax that belongs to the central government and the 50% of business tax that belongs to the county to the provincial government, and the central government will no longer subsidize the province. According to this calculation, the Zhejiang provincial government can increase its revenue by 12 billion yuan, but it will still be short 24 billion yuan. Therefore, it has joined forces with the chairmen of other provincial governments and the two ministries of finance and food to request that the current practice be temporarily followed before the implementation of the Constitution, and that there be no major changes. However, the president has instructed that the 30% of land tax belonging to the central government cannot be transferred to the provincial government, so it seems that the revenue and expenditure system will not be changed immediately. The financial department has reviewed the budget of Zhejiang Province for the 36th year of the Republic, and the business tax has been tripled, calculated at 25,600 yuan per stone. Therefore, the budget can be balanced on the surface, but the Executive Yuan has not yet reviewed it. It is heard that the principle is that the central government subsidies will not be calculated according to the figures of the previous year, and subsidies will be provided if there is a shortfall in revenue and expenditure. Therefore, Minister of Finance Chen Milin and Chief Accountant Jing Tao have been instructed to stay in Nanjing and continue negotiations. The Ministry of Finance will not recognize the fictitious revenue figures. In addition, it is feared that the various project expenses originally listed by the province may be deleted, and negotiations have also been instructed to retain them. However, the central government has allowed that the increased expenditures for adjusting the living expenses of public school teachers and staff will be allocated by the central government.

### Grain Collection Conference To Reconvene Today

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 25th] The Grain Collection Conference will reconvene on the morning of the 26th to discuss ways to strengthen grain collection.

### American Businesses Invest in Guangdong Industries, Discussions Are Getting Closer

The conditions put forward by our authorities are: (1) Each project must be completed within two years after the contract is signed at the latest; (2) All plans must be approved by the Provincial Assembly and the Central Government; (3) Be responsible for training technical personnel in this province; (4) Designate the location of the factories and the period of exclusive operation, etc. It is also heard that the discussions are getting closer. If successful, it will greatly benefit the construction of the province.

If there are difficulties in funding, part of the materials can be sold as a fund. (4) Emergency relief work. All agencies are still expected to continue to handle it before the end of the Administrative Relief.

(8) Before the good rescue agency is terminated, please submit the plan to the social administration authority for review. (9) Please list the quantity of each material. (10) Transfer the amount of funds together. (11) The staff of the post-relief social welfare agency should also be listed in a list for transfer.

In the future, they should be used exclusively for welfare undertakings, including employing the poor for work relief. (2) In any future work relief work, special attention should be paid to the application of equipment. It must be matched with different work according to different abilities. The authorities responsible for managing work relief should assess each person's skills and list them separately. (3) In the future, when various ministries, committees, bureaus, and offices of the government are implementing work relief, they should first employ the poor and capable people who are in urgent need of relief, and then recruit ordinary workers if there is a surplus. (4) When implementing work relief, all agencies should directly employ workers and avoid contractors who profit from relief materials. (5) The Administrative Relief should report the experience of training work relief personnel in the past to the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies for reference in continuing to promote this work.

Editorial

### After Reading the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session

The Sixth Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held from the 15th and closed on the 24th. A declaration was issued after the meeting, the full text of which was published in yesterday's newspaper. This conference was an unprecedentedly important gathering of the Kuomintang in the past twenty years, a decisive gathering to lead the victory of the war of resistance, return to the capital, promulgate the constitution, and end political tutelage. At the opening, President Chiang pointed out that the mission of this plenary session was to redefine the relationship between the party and the government, reform the Kuomintang, and enrich the Kuomintang, so that the party could still shoulder the responsibility of national construction after the end of political tutelage. In the declaration, the plenary session further listed five major goals to encourage party members and inform the people of the key tasks for future efforts.

The Kuomintang is currently the largest party in our country. For decades of revolutionary struggle, it has consistently implemented Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. It created the Republic of China, overthrew the warlords, led the victory of the War of Resistance, abolished unequal treaties, convened the National Assembly, and completed the democratic constitution. Its contributions to the country and the nation are so glorious that they illuminate the world and last forever. However, the period of political tutelage has been prolonged, the administration has not been completely clarified, and the number of people who attach themselves to others has increased day by day, inevitably leading to a mixture of different types of people. In addition, domestic party disputes are chaotic, so those who discuss national affairs with passion also have praise and criticism of the Kuomintang. However, the Kuomintang does not seek news based on praise and criticism, but can strive to reform itself, invigorate itself, and take responsibility. If everyone can have a bright and benevolent attitude and encourage and spur the Kuomintang, it is believed that the Kuomintang will be able to work hard and complete a new China of the Three Principles of the People. Because the Kuomintang has its glorious history, stands on the land with roots and foundations, and today is related to the weight of the country, being benevolent to others can naturally be good. The ancients said: "The roots that are deep, its leaves are luxuriant; the fat that is fertile, its light is bright." Therefore, we extend ourselves and others, and have infinite enthusiasm for the country and the Kuomintang. The five points mentioned in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang are: First, complete the preparations for constitutional government and establish a national construction framework; second, eliminate obstacles to unification and consolidate the national foundation; third, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize the economic foundation; fourth, uphold international justice and dedicate ourselves to international peace; fifth, enrich educational content and cultivate the nation's vitality. After reading this declaration, we believe that the Kuomintang has a sense of responsibility. After the end of political tutelage, it can still put the country and the people first, not avoid suspicion, not be afraid, not be timid, and not retreat. Its loyalty can illuminate any demons and ghosts. However, the most correct principles and the most reasonable words are just the right thing to do, and the implementation is right: The Kuomintang is a political party that emphasizes knowing and doing, so it should focus on doing in the future. Zhu Xi said: "In terms of priority, knowledge comes first; in terms of importance, action comes first." The five points mentioned in the declaration of this Third Plenary Session are aimed at current malpractices and have their own weight, but they must be steadfastly struggled, "sincerely united, selfless and impartial, regardless of regions, regardless of parties, the more difficult, the more fierce, bravely move forward, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties, break through all obstacles, and complete the legacy of the National Father and complete the entire achievements of national construction"!

In short, after the end of political tutelage, the Kuomintang returned power to the people. The party went to the people and became an ordinary political party with other parties. The party and the people are two-in-one, or one-in-two. Therefore, the key points of the declaration of this Third Plenary Session and the motions passed by the Third Plenary Session have the voice of the people and the demands of the people. However, to make this voice new every day, not only should the Kuomintang grasp it as a policy advocacy and fight firmly in the future, but the reorganized government should also use it as a policy advocacy, so that the constitutional implementation can be expected and the national unification can be hoped for. As for the status of the Kuomintang after returning power to the people, the declaration also pointed out that "the position in which it is located, and its relationship with the government, will naturally be different from the past." However, the Kuomintang's fighting spirit, as long as it persists for a long time, the party will put the people first in the private sector, and it will be able to stand up among the people; the party will cooperate sincerely with friendly parties in the government, and it will be able to have endless friends, so-called "although nobility must be based on cheapness, although height must be based on the bottom." And constantly correcting shortcomings, distinguishing the important from the unimportant, and faithfully practicing, although the position in the future is different from the past, the vitality in the future will be more abundant than in the past.

The Third Plenary Session has closed, and the Third Plenary Session has its harvest in all aspects. This gathering is a turning point for the Kuomintang. The way to update is to create it yourself, and you have a straight road; if you still "decide but do not act" or act but derail, that is the misfortune of the party's future. The Kuomintang is now only watching the splendid and solemn bottom distant view, but this distant view is still to be hoped for but not reached. If you follow the straight road forward, you need the people as the backing and the parties as friends. Therefore, it is said that after the Kuomintang returns power to the people, it must strive for the people and strive for friends, so that it can achieve the splendor and solemnity of the future. After the Kuomintang ends political tutelage, it must be extra vigilant when it is equally pulled into political competition with other parties, and it must work extra hard to do a few things to restore the atmosphere, do a few things to boost people's hearts, and the Kuomintang can achieve the splendor and solemnity of the future in politics in the future. The declaration of the Third Plenary Session finally took "not being unworthy of the National Father and the martyrs, not being unworthy of the loyal martyrs of the War of Resistance and the compatriots who have been displaced and struggling after the war" as its own responsibility to encourage party members, and we also encouraged the Kuomintang with this!

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The U.S. State Department has released the full text of the three wartime agreements of the three powers in Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam, and announced the secret agreement of February 11, 1945, regarding the concessions of the Kuril Islands, South Sakhalin, and Northeast China in exchange for the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan. It also revealed that at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet Union agreed that if Bulgaria attacked Turkey, the Soviet Union would attack Bulgaria. At that time, the three powers also planned to make Turkey join the war. The military agreements reached at the Tehran Conference are listed as follows: (1) Supply a large amount of military equipment and other supplies to the guerrillas in Yugoslavia. (2) From a military point of view, Turkey should be made to join the war before the end of this year (1943). (3) Stalin stated that if Turkey should fight and encounter Bulgaria declaring war or attacking it, the Soviet Union would immediately attack Bulgaria. (4) The issue of Turkey's participation in the war can be proved by future negotiations (Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan on March 1, 1945). (5) The invasion of Normandy should be launched in May 1944, simultaneously with the invasion of southern France. (6) Stalin promised that the Soviet army should launch an offensive at the same time to divert the German army's target in France. (7) The three powers agreed to maintain close contact on military operations in the European plan in the future.

The agreement on the war against Japan reached at the Yalta Conference is as follows: The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreed that within two or three months after the surrender of Germany and the end of the European war, the Soviet Union should join the Allied forces and jointly fight against Japan. The conditions are as follows: (1) Outer Mongolia should remain as the Mongolian People's Republic. (2) The Soviet Union's rights destroyed by Japan in 1904 should be restored, that is, South Sakhalin and its nearby islands should be returned to the Soviet Union, Dalian should be opened as an international commercial port to protect the Soviet Union's interests in the area. Restore the lease rights of Lushun as a Soviet naval base, and the China Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway should be jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union. Protect the interests of the Soviet Union, and China can retain its entire sovereignty in the Northeast. (3) The Kuril Islands should be handed over to the Soviet Union. The agreements on Outer Mongolia, Dalian, and the railway must be approved by Chairman Chiang, and the President of the United States should accept Stalin's opinion and obtain approval on his behalf. At that time, the three powers also agreed to fulfill the Soviet Union's demands after defeating Japan. In this regard, the Soviet Union hoped to sign a Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to facilitate the military assistance of China to liberate the occupied areas of the Japanese army. This agreement was signed by Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill.

The Potsdam Agreement was signed on July 26, 1945, by Stalin, Truman, and Attlee, and an ultimatum was issued to urge Japan to surrender unconditionally. In addition, it stipulates: (1) The Montreux Convention on the Tatar Strait should be directly discussed by the three relevant governments. (2) Regarding the division of Germany, the terms of surrender should include the complete disarmament and armed forces in order to lay the foundation for future peace and security.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Mostly Grants: Clayton Reveals at Foreign Affairs Committee

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened today to discuss President Truman's proposed aid to Greece and Turkey. Secretary of the Army Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson attended to present their views. Patterson urged Congress to promptly aid Greece to prevent communist-led armed forces from gaining control. Forrestal stated that four minesweepers had already been sold to Turkey, and both Greece and Turkey had requested to purchase more warships. Patterson and Acheson assured that the president's plan would not involve sending U.S. troops to Greece and Turkey. However, Assistant Secretary of State Clayton revealed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that over half of the $400 million in support for Greece and Turkey against communism would be used for military purposes. This military expenditure would be entirely a grant rather than a loan to either country, and the majority of the remaining funds would likely be provided in the same manner. According to Acheson, only about $50 million is expected to be repaid to the United States.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Republican Congressman Dirksen recently declared to the House of Representatives that the United States should negotiate an agreement with Greece and Turkey, whereby they would lease their naval and air bases to the United States for long periods as a condition for U.S. financial aid.

Acheson requested that the Senate approve legislation to implement President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey and prevent the expansion of totalitarianism in the Middle East. He stated that India is going through a difficult period with domestic disorder, and the situation would become unmanageable if the democratic government were to fail. South Korea also needs U.S. capital investment, and a plan to aid Korea will be submitted to Congress after the Army, Navy, and State Department have finalized their opinions. The scope of the aid is not yet determined, but Korea will need U.S. capital aid in the next three years. The U.S. government has not yet been able to unify Korea because the Soviet government has failed or is unwilling to discuss the unification issue.

### Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, Claims USSR Intends to Attack U.S.: If the USSR Had the Atomic Bomb, It Would Have Already Dropped It on the U.S.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The House Un-American Activities Committee heard a report from subcommittee chairman Green today, stating that there are at least 100,000 communists within the United States, enough to form ten army divisions, with the goal of weakening the United States in the event of a final Soviet attack. Earlier, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, reported on the intentions of the Soviet Union, stating that if the Soviet Union had the atomic bomb, it would have already dropped it on the United States. The Soviet Union is not currently willing to attack, but is waiting until it has manufactured a large number of atomic bombs and feels that its air force is stronger than that of the United States. Until that time, we can comfortably tell Stalin to "stop," and if we are serious about it, Stalin will surely stop. But Stalin will never stop voluntarily, just like Hitler. Bullitt strongly suggested that the United States store a large number of atomic bombs for immediate use.

U.S. Intensifies Precautions Against Communists

A spokesperson for the American Legion agreed with the measures under discussion by the Un-American Activities Committee, which would make joining the Communist Party illegal, prohibit communists from running for office in federal or state elections, and prohibit the teaching of communism or the mailing of communist propaganda. Bullitt feared that Americans had not fully recognized the danger posed by the existence of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union's determination to conquer the United States, and did not believe that the American public would support the aforementioned severe penalties. Therefore, he proposed an alternative approach, advocating for increased funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor communist activities, so that they could be rounded up in the event of an emergency, similar to how German-American Bund members were dealt with during the war.

### Coal Industry Association Lists Five Facts, Accuses Fuel Management Committee of Malfeasance: Delegation Returns from Petitioning in Nanjing, Discusses Process, Central Government Has Sent Investigators to Shanghai for Secret Investigation

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association believes that the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has, without authorization from the Ministry, stopped allocating coal for civilian use since December 1946, causing business to cease for 296 companies in the industry. In addition to urgently cabling Chairman and President Chiang on February 5, requesting "allocation of coal resources to relieve coal merchants," a delegation consisting of Xie Hengchuang, Pan Yisan, Bao Zixiang, Mao Chunpu, Lu Yusheng, and Chen Jinrong was selected to travel to Nanjing on the 18th to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other agencies. On the 24th, Chairman Chiang personally met with Xie Hengchuang, chairman of the industry association, after the Three Principles of the People Commemoration Week, and promised to instruct the Ministry of Economic Affairs to improve the coal allocation management methods. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Dingwuyi will come to Shanghai on the 29th to discuss the aftermath.

According to Xie Hengchuang, chairman of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, who just returned from petitioning in Nanjing yesterday: after the delegation arrived in Nanjing, they immediately visited the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Secretary Fan Jichang of the Executive Yuan received them on behalf of the Premier, and Minister Wang Lingwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs personally received them, expressing acceptance of the coal industry's delegation's opinions and instructing them to provide further evidence of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's selling of allocated coal on the black market due to favoritism from December 1946 to mid-March 1947. The delegation then submitted five instances of the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal due to favoritism on the 20th, requesting investigation and handling. It is understood that the central government attaches great importance to this matter, and the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have dispatched investigators to Shanghai separately for a secret investigation.

Five Facts

The five instances of malfeasance by the Fuel Management Committee listed by the Coal Industry Association are: (1) Yongda Oil Factory, No. 21, Lane 475, Gaoyang Road, has been allocated 135 tons of coal twice, last December and this year. The Coal Industry Association learned from a confidential report that the factory uses diesel fuel. On March 4, personnel were sent to investigate the site and found 20 tons of coal stored inside. According to factory employee Li Songduan, 15 tons were borrowed and returned, and 20 tons were for personal use, but the legitimate use of the remaining coal could not be explained. They also "asked for help" from the investigators. This clearly involves favoritism and corruption. (2) Changxing Yarn Factory, No. 10, Rue Robert, was allocated 253 tons in December of this year and 300 tons this year, a total of 553 tons. Investigation revealed that the factory uses electricity and does not rely on coal as fuel. According to factory personnel, it is used for dyeing and printing. However, there are no dyeing and printing facilities inside the factory at No. 10 and No. 11 Rue Robert. This clearly involves favoritism and corruption. (3) The three companies shipping machinery and lumber, Sanhexing, Xiexingchang, and Hongxingchang, were allocated a total of 18 tons of coal this year. Separate investigations revealed that Sanhexing has not started work this year, Xiexingchang does not have coal-burning stoves, and Hongxingchang does not exist; the factory address is actually Yu Da Lumber. (4) No. 3, Lane 57, West Zhongzheng Road, was allocated coal without applying. (5) Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, No. 830, Ma Dang Road, was allocated 155 tons of coal at the end of last year and 210 tons of coal this year. Investigation revealed that the factory has four stoves, two using diesel, one using sesame cake, and only one burning coal. At most, coal usage accounts for one-fourth of the allocation, which is clearly favoritism and excessive allocation.

### Receiver of Embezzled Goods, Li Zhizhong, Escorted to Nanjing

### Rationing Prices for Daily Necessities Announced: Members of Price Evaluation Committee to Be Appointed

The rationing prices for daily necessities for public education personnel in the city have recently been set by the relevant authorities as follows: Mature rice is 66,800 yuan per picul, cooking oil is 1,800 yuan per catty, salt is 400 yuan per catty, sugar is 2,000 yuan per catty, coal briquettes are 11,000 yuan per hundred catties, white cloth is 1,700 yuan per foot, khaki cloth is 2,900 yuan per foot, blue cloth is 1,700 yuan per foot, and cotton uniform cloth is 1,300 yuan per foot.

Most of the preparations and organizational rules for the Municipal Price Evaluation Committee have been drafted. The only thing pending is the selection of committee members, which will be submitted to the municipal government for appointment after Director Wu Kaixian returns to Shanghai. The Evaluation Committee is composed of the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Police Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Bureau of Materials Supply, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Taiwan Sugar Company, the China Textile Company, the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, the General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, and other relevant agencies. Its tasks are: (1) Evaluating the prices of various important daily necessities; (2) Handling violations of agreed-upon prices, and dividing into six groups for preliminary discussions on rice, cooking oil, flour, cloth, sugar, and coal. In the future, price negotiations will be conducted separately by each group, and then submitted to the Director for approval before implementation. It is rumored that Director Wu will return to Shanghai from Nanjing today, and the first meeting of the committee will be held soon.

### Major Case of Gold Embezzlement: Investigating Tongfengyu's Account Books, District Court Refuses to Hand Them Over, Only Allows Review in a Designated Room in the Court

[Reported by This Newspaper] The account books of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, which were allocated gold by the Central Bank in the Gold Rush Case, were transferred to the District Court by the Administrative Division of the Police Bureau the day before yesterday. He Qiji of the Ministry of Finance and Fan Shiyu of the Auditing Department visited the court again yesterday morning to request to inspect the books. The court president refused, because the case of Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, Zhan Yunsheng, and others colluding in embezzlement was ordered by Chairman Chiang and handled by the Garrison Command after arresting them and handing them over to the court. Before the trial is concluded, it is not appropriate to hand over the books. Moreover, the defendant in this case is the Central Bank, so it would be inappropriate to take the case files and account books to the Central Bank for review. However, as a compromise, the court can designate a special room for personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Auditing Department to review the accounts, and the court is willing to send someone to assist. After this method was provided, He and Fan went there in the afternoon.

[Furthermore, it is learned] Two lawyers for Zhan Liansheng visited Zhan at the detention center yesterday and reportedly informed him of the Ministry of Finance's dispatch of personnel for a thorough investigation and comforted Zhan greatly.

[Furthermore, it is learned] The court has assigned Judge Wang Jiazhuo to be responsible for handling the case, and the investigative hearing is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 28th to summon relevant witnesses Feng Qing'an, Ni Zuguang, Xie Bingquan, Zhang Yuanbai, and others. Subpoenas have already been issued.

[Furthermore, it is reported] Auditor Fan of the Auditing Department returned to Nanjing yesterday and may return to Shanghai again today or tomorrow. Counselor He Qiji of the Ministry of Finance also returned to Nanjing last night and will return to Shanghai again tomorrow.

### "Haimin" Vessel Expected to Arrive This Afternoon: Sinking Ship Case to Be Handled Impartially

[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haimin" vessel, which collided with the "Fubo" warship in the sea off Guishan Island outside Xiamen, is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon and is scheduled to dock at buoys No. 8 and 9 on the Dongjiadu pier. It is understood that the left side of the bow of the ship was severely damaged and needs to be repaired after returning to Shanghai.

The "Haitian" vessel, which sailed to Calcutta, left India and returned to Shanghai last Friday. The "Haiti" vessel, which sailed to Guam, also departed from Guam last Saturday and returned to Shanghai. Both vessels have brought back a large number of surplus supplies.

[Additional report] According to a responsible person from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea have clear provisions that if two ships, A and B, meet at night, and ship B shows ship A a green sidelight on its starboard side, and ship A shows ship B a red sidelight on its port side, then ship B should be responsible for giving way to ship A, meaning ship B should turn its bow to the right to display a red light. Conversely, if ship A sees ship B displaying a green sidelight on its starboard side, then ship A should maintain its original heading. In this way, the red lights of ships A and B illuminate each other, and they meet in parallel, so there is no danger of collision. When the "Haimin" and "Fubo" met at night, the "Haimin" displayed a red light on its port side, and the "Fubo" displayed a green light on its starboard side, so the "Fubo" should have the responsibility to give way, and the "Haimin" should have maintained its original heading. If the "Fubo" warship had turned its bow to the right, displaying a red light to the "Haimin," then the red lights would illuminate each other, and they would pass in parallel, which would not have caused a major disaster. As for the issue of responsibility for this unfortunate incident, after the "Haimin" arrives in Shanghai, the joint investigation committee organized by the Naval Headquarters, the Ministry of Communications, and several nautical experts will handle the matter impartially.

### Starting Point for Salary Discounts in the Commercial Press: Labor and Management Still Need to Continue Discussions

[Reported by This Newspaper] The salaries of the Commercial Press employees used to be calculated in various ways, such as rice subsidies and calculations based on self-compiled cost of living indices. Recently, it was requested that all be changed to calculations based on the cost of living index announced by the Municipal Government to determine the base salary, ranging from 44 yuan to 600 yuan. However, the two sides are in disagreement over the starting point for discounting the base salary. The employees once implemented a "work stoppage," suspending business, and resumed work only after persuasion from the Bureau of Social Affairs. The bureau convened both parties for negotiations again the night before last. The employer stated that those with a base salary of 55 yuan or less would be paid in full, those exceeding 55 yuan to 200 yuan would have their excess portion discounted by 20%, and those exceeding 200 yuan would have their excess portion discounted by 10%. Those below 55 yuan whose income is less than before due to calculation based on the Municipal Government's cost of living index may be subsidized. The labor side is still dissatisfied with the 55 yuan discount starting point, and both parties still need to continue discussions.

### Failure to Resolve at Yuehua Factory; Labor-Management Compromise at Rongmao Factory

[Our Dispatch] A dispute arose at the Yuehua Tobacco Factory earlier due to the February pay differential and the dismissal of two female workers, Zhang Meie and Pan Zizhen. More than fifty workers had previously petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, but without success. Yesterday afternoon, 450 employees of the factory gathered again to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. It is said that the employees' salaries are supposed to be paid in two installments on the 5th and 20th of each month, but the salary for the 20th of this month has not yet been paid. The February pay differential has also not been paid according to regulations. Zhang and Pan were dismissed because they represented the employees in negotiations with the management regarding the pay differential issue. However, according to the factory, the two workers were dismissed for dereliction of duty due to errors in affixing commodity tax stamps. The matter is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Employees of the Rongmao Sawmill at 1998 Changning Road requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate the adjustment of wages. Now, both labor and management have agreed to implement the wages and working hours stipulated in the written record signed by the Shanghai Business Rongtong Rong Association and the Machine Saw This Collection Labor Union on October 30, 1946, effective immediately.

### Foreign Expert from China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Discusses Improving the Current State of Civil Aviation; Avoiding Flight Accidents Hinges on Special Care; Exhaustion Must Be Corrected

[Our Dispatch] Mr. Bond, a foreign expert from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), arrived in China from the United States at the end of last month to oversee improvements to the current state of civil aviation. Bond is one of the founding pioneers of CNAC and has served for 16 years. He came to China in 1931 and initially worked for Pan American Airways. The following year, Pan American Airways jointly established CNAC with the Chinese government, and Bond was transferred to be the director of the flight operations department. In recent years, he retired and served as a senior consultant. Last September, due to poor health, he took a six-month leave of absence to recuperate in the United States. He returned to China ahead of schedule due to frequent aircraft accidents, hoping to find ways to improve the situation. Ellison, the newly appointed director of flight operations, also came along and was a pilot during the early days of CNAC.

Yesterday, a reporter visited both of them and asked how they would proceed. Bond believes that after reviewing previous aircraft accidents, while some were due to poor equipment, the main cause was carelessness. He believes that after World War II, people around the world generally experience mental exhaustion. The recent aircraft accidents around the world may be due to the lax and uneasy state caused by this psychological condition. The global aviation industry is still in its infancy, and China's is particularly nascent, so one must never stop at the slightest setback. Of course, every effort must be made to prevent aircraft accidents in the future. Given the current state of equipment, which cannot be improved immediately due to various objective factors, the only effective method is to exercise special caution. Special caution includes meticulous inspection of machinery, responsible ground staff, avoidance of severe weather, and careful piloting by pilots. If these are followed, it is believed that flight accidents can be minimized. He also used the analogy of a child learning to walk, where stumbles are inevitable, but eventually, they will grow stronger.

### Songhu Garrison Command Directly Under the Ministry of National Defense

The Songhu Garrison Command received an order from the Ministry of National Defense the day before yesterday stating, "From the date of receipt, the Songhu Garrison Command will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense, and the defense zone will remain unchanged." Nominally, the command was originally subordinate to the Capital Garrison Command, but this change was made to simplify the handling of official documents.

### Fake District Court President Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months

[Our Dispatch] The case of Sun Shaokang, the former president of the fake Shanghai District Court, suspected of being a traitor, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday morning. Sun Shaokang was found guilty of conspiring with the enemy to resist our country and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for three years. His property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary to provide his family with living expenses. Sun was from Jilin and was 62 years old. Before the war, he served as the chief prosecutor of the Capital High Court and the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court. In 1940, Sun defected to the enemy and joined the "Shanghai District Court Comrades Research Association" organized by the fake Special Agent Headquarters. He represented the fake side in taking over the District Court and was subsequently appointed as the president of the fake Shanghai District Court.

### The Case of Two Monks from Jing'an Temple Accused of Collaboration with the Enemy; The Dersimi Trial Concluded Yesterday; Denied All Charges and Argued No Connection with the Dōbō School

[Our Dispatch] The case of Degu, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, and Miga, the supervisor, suspected of being traitors, concluded at the High Court yesterday morning and is scheduled for sentencing on April 1st. Degu is 28 years old and from Shanghai. Miga is 37 years old and from Ningbo. They were reported by Liugen, the former abbot of Jing'an Temple, Yangxi, the former supervisor, and Xie Xiqing. The defendants' crimes include co-founding the Dōbō Japanese Language School with the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple, participating in the Fake Buddhist Association and serving as an executive director, holding the Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly, the Greater East Asia Memorial Service, the Jing'an Temple Protector Association, and welcoming the Japanese monks Yūmatsu and Kuramochi. When the trial opened yesterday, the audience was filled with monks who were extremely concerned. The trial lasted for three hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The defendants argued that the Fake Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association was a religious organization formed by various temples in Shanghai. The abbots or chief officers of all major temples in the city were naturally directors or executive directors. Its purpose was to promote charitable and relief activities externally and to promote Buddhism and rectify religious rules internally, with no political, economic, or military significance whatsoever. The Dōbō Japanese Language School was forcibly borrowing two classrooms from Jing'an Elementary School for night classes. Its principal was the monk Kinoshita Bankei from Higashi Honganji Temple, and all personnel and expenses were completely unrelated to Jing'an Temple. The recruitment advertisement and wooden sign photograph of the "Buddhist Dōbō Japanese Language School" submitted by the plaintiff were forged. The Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly was held at Jing'an Temple by representatives of the Panchen Lama from Tibet. The president of the Jing'an Temple Protector Association was Li Sihao, and its purpose was purely to promote Buddhist principles, rectify religious rules, maintain temple property, and conduct public welfare activities, a Buddhist organization for Buddhist believers, with no other function. The Greater East Asia Memorial Service was hosted by the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association and held at the Jade Buddha Temple. Welcoming the Japanese monks Yūmatsu and Kuramochi to China was due to pressure from the Fake Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association and was purely a matter of etiquette. They had no further relationship with Yūmatsu and Kuramochi. After the defendant completed his statement, prosecutor Sun Xiangrong stood up and requested the court to handle the case according to law. After the defense attorneys Mi Xitong, Zhou Xiaoan, and Xi Shichang stood up and made their arguments, the presiding judge concluded that the debate in this case was over and set April 1st for sentencing.

### The Case of Huang Bohui's Attempted Assassination; The Identity of the Assassin Remains a Question; The District Attorney's Office Believes There is Insufficient Evidence Against Zheng Desheng and Others

[Our Dispatch] In the case of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao, being "assassinated," according to Huang's account, at approximately 10:00 PM on February 18th of this year, he returned to his residence at 179 Hubei Road, Fuhu Building, and found the main door wide open. He climbed the stairs and, upon reaching the second-floor landing, saw two women who looked at him and then hurried back to the third floor. At the same time, two Westerners wearing casual hats and yellow coats suddenly appeared at the entrance of the third floor, approached the corner of the staircase between the third and fourth floors, and stopped him from proceeding. When questioned, the two Westerners said, "This is the man we're looking for." One of them forcibly grabbed both of his arms, and the other Westerner on the right shot him in the forehead with a gun. He fell to the ground in extreme pain but remained conscious. He felt one of the Westerners holding his head and neck with his foot to prevent him from moving. Fearing another shot, he shouted, "I am a friend of President Roosevelt!" The two Westerners released him upon hearing this. After the assailants had gone far, he struggled to climb to Room 411 on the fourth floor, where a friend took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He claimed that Zheng Desheng, the renter of his property, harbored ill will due to a housing dispute and other debts and incited his American friend, Hess Wett, to commit murder. His wife, Zheng Pu, and daughter, Zheng Jingyan, also assisted in the conspiracy. After a thorough investigation lasting over a month by District Attorney Cao Hong, the District Attorney's Office concluded that there was insufficient evidence against the defendants Zheng Desheng, Zou Pu, Zheng Jingyan, and Hess Wett, and ordered a non-prosecution. District Attorney Cao explained the non-prosecution in three parts: (1) Regarding Zheng Desheng, Zheng Pu, and Zheng Jingyan, although it was found that Huang Bohui and Zheng Desheng had a grudge due to a housing dispute and other debts, the two parties had already entrusted lawyers to mediate, and with civil debt relations, why would Zheng Desheng resort to such a reckless measure and fall into the trap of the law? Although Hess Wett and Zheng Desheng were acquainted, they were not close friends. How could he entrust him with the serious task of murder? For Hess Wett, the relationship was not close enough to risk his life, and the punishment was severe. No one is foolish enough to take such a great risk and voluntarily subject himself to criminal detention. (2) Regarding Hess Wett, he was a second mate on the Wan Jian, a ship of the General Transport Water Transport Team, and met Zheng on a trip. They were not close friends to begin with, and he had no grudges with Huang Bohui at all. Moreover, fellow ship employees proved that Hess did not leave the ship that night. (3) The results of the on-site investigation revealed that not only were there no bullet casings, but there were also no bullet marks on the walls or within the range and angle of the gunshots. The blood splatters on the corner of the wall between the third and fourth floors were all pointed upwards, indicating that the blood had dripped onto the ground and splashed up, or that the blood on the ground had splashed due to pressure. If the injury had occurred on top of his head while he was standing, the blood splatters would have pointed downwards. Moreover, Huang's head wound was arc-shaped, further proving that it was not caused by a gunshot. At the same time, all residents of the third and fourth floors of the Fuhu Building stated that they did not hear any gunshots. Therefore, the accusations made by Huang Bohui against the defendants Zheng Desheng and others should be dismissed in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The defendant Zheng Desheng, who is currently in custody in this case, will not be released until the disposition is finalized.

### A Trivial Dispute; A Blacksmith Beats His Wife to Death

[Our Dispatch] Yin Huakun, 34 years old, a blacksmith from Changzhou living at No. 495, Lane 972, Xikang Road, Shanghai West, was married to his wife, Ms. Ma, 27 years old, for ten years and had a ten-year-old daughter. The couple had a good relationship on weekdays. Yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, after Yin Huakun got up, he planned to go to Zhabei to work and urged Ms. Ma to quickly cook breakfast. Because she complained slightly, the two had a dispute, and Yin beat Ms. Ma. Ms. Ma fell to the ground, unconscious. Yin left home. Later, her cousin, Chao Hongsheng (living in the same lane), rushed over after hearing the news and hired a car to accompany his cousin to the Municipal Third Hospital for treatment, but she had already died upon arrival. Someone reported the case to the Putuo Road Police Station. Section Chief Zhu Dingkun ordered officers Zhang Xiaolin, Zhao Yongji, and others to rush to the hospital and residence to investigate the truth and left several plainclothes officers to guard the house. Around 9:00 AM, Ma Shang, who did not know that Ms. Ma had been beaten to death, hurriedly returned home and was arrested by the officers and taken to the bureau for questioning, where he confessed to the beating. He is scheduled to be handed over to the judiciary for trial this morning.

### A Cobbler's Wife Actually Wears a Diamond Ring; Theft Exposed on Guling Road; All Perpetrators Arrested

[Our Dispatch] Wang Zhongqi, a securities businessman residing at 152 Guling Road, heard footsteps on the staircase around 4:00 AM on the 17th. He shouted to ask who it was, and someone replied, "It's me." Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately got out of bed and went downstairs to investigate. He discovered that the front and back doors were wide open, the drawers of the chest of drawers in the room were open, and the keys in the coat pocket hanging on the clothes rack were also missing. He hurriedly chased out of the lane to search, but they were already gone. He then filed a loss report, including two diamond rings, one weighing over three carats and ten points, and the other weighing one carat and sixty points, five gold bracelets, three gold rings, a ruby ring and a ruby ring, a gold ingot, three small gold bars, a pair of emerald ruby earrings, a gold pocket watch and a gold watch, over a thousand silver coins, and many other silver chopsticks and silverware.

Section Chief Ding Zhenduo of the police station in charge ordered officers Weng Yongquan, Gu Zhuobin, and Fang Shengwu to rush to the scene to investigate, but initially found nothing. Later, a discarded empty drawer from Wang's chest of drawers was found next to a garbage can in Lane 161 on Beijing West Road, indicating that the thief must have lived in this lane. Investigation revealed that Zhou Houjie, a cobbler who set up a stall at the entrance of the lane, was suspected. At the same time, it was discovered that his wife, Zhao, was wearing a diamond ring, leading to the conclusion that she was undoubtedly involved in the theft. Further investigation revealed that Gu Ada, a worker at the Xiexing Printing Factory at 169 Tonglu, was in close contact with Zhou and had recently sold gold rings and other jewelry. Gu Ada, Zhou, and Zhao were all brought to the bureau for questioning, but they all denied everything. Later, it was rumored that Zhao had taken a three-carat diamond ring to Wang Yu's residence at No. 5 Changshou Lane, Beijing West Road, to sell it, but Wang refused to accept it because the price was too low (3 million yuan). Wang was summoned to the bureau for questioning and confirmed the story. When confronted with Wang's testimony, Zhou remained silent and admitted everything. He also confessed that his husband, Zhou Junjie, along with Peng Zhenlin and Gu Ada, had placed the diamond rings and other jewelry in a drawer and brought it back from outside, but he did not know where they had stolen them from. At this time, Zhou also confessed. The police then took him to his house and recovered part of the stolen goods from under the floor and on the mezzanine. At No. 204 Yongle Lane, Shandong Road, Peng Zhenlin's home was searched, but he was not found. Until 9:00 AM yesterday, Peng voluntarily surrendered to the police station. All the perpetrators are scheduled to be handed over to the District Attorney's Office for further investigation in the coming days.

### A Den of Thieves by the Nine-Bend Bridge; Recovered Loot Piled High; The Hubei Gang Leader Arrested

[Our Dispatch] On the 23rd of this month, the Yixian Police Station solved three major and minor theft cases, one robbery case, and one drug trafficking and drug use case. Except for the drug traffickers and drug users Dong Geng and Yang Wang, who have been sent to the District Attorney's Office, the investigation of the remaining cases was completed only last night, and the recovered stolen goods exceeded 10 million yuan. Among those arrested was the notorious Hubei gang active in the French Concession, Pengmei, and Yimiao areas. Six key members, including Zhang Yulin, Chen Lingen, Zhu Na'an, Wu Shaonan, Zhou Shousheng, and Huang Guangxue, have all been apprehended.

Yimiao Branch Bureau Chief Shen Tangheng received a tip-off on the 23rd stating that a large number of well-known thieves were hiding in the shantytowns near the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City God Temple. That morning, he dispatched Section Chief Zhou Nan to lead officers Gen Shen and Sun Ziqiang to search the area. As a result, six bags of brown sugar (approximately 1,300 catties), four barrels and three boxes of e-liao, three sewing machine heads, and seventeen bolts of cloth, totaling over 100 million yuan, were found in the shantytowns. All those involved were taken to the bureau for questioning. After individual interrogations, it was discovered that Zhang Yulin and the six other leaders of the notorious Hubei gang were among them. After two days and nights of investigation, it was learned that the above-mentioned goods were stolen from No. 1 Danfeng Road, Xiyi Lane, No. 406 Fangbang Road, No. 139 Middle Zheng East Road, No. 2, Lane 45 Jishan Temple Street, and the Qujia Lane Jinxian Elementary School. The suspects are scheduled to be transferred to the District Attorney's Office today. In addition, four petty thieves, Zhu Dianfa, Zhao Atong, Gu Zhizhong, and Hu Caiquan, were arrested while committing theft in Fukang Lane, Dunjie Lane, and No. 158 Li Ma Road. Two leather suitcases, eighteen umbrellas, twenty-three washbasins, four steel pots, and one sewing machine were seized on the spot. Another robbery case was solved, involving Gu Shaofu, a robber who robbed the Yuanhe Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 25 Yunjuli Street at 9:30 PM on the 23rd. As there are still accomplices at large, an extension of the detention period has been requested for further investigation.

### Former US Military Liaison Group Personnel in Taiwan; Embezzlement of Gold Case; Non-Prosecution; Eighteen People Who Purchased the Loot Also Not Prosecuted Due to Amnesty

[Our Dispatch] The case of Lieutenant Colonel Evans, the former head of the US Military Liaison Group in Taiwan, embezzling 60 kilograms of gold from the Japanese military in Taiwan that should have been handed over to the Chinese government and selling it in the Shanghai night market for profit, was previously ordered to be investigated by the Shanghai District Attorney's Office by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. District Attorney Liu Yongzhi concluded the investigation with a non-prosecution ruling due to improper jurisdiction. According to the case file, the gold was originally intended to be shipped by the Japanese Army Ministry to supply the Japanese military in the Philippines. Due to air transport difficulties at the time, it landed in Taiwan and could not be transported further. Therefore, it was kept in custody by the Japanese military in Taiwan. After Lieutenant Colonel Evans learned of the batch of gold, he extracted it from Major Harada, a staff officer of the Japanese military post-war liaison department, in five separate occasions. Only on November 1, 1945, the second extraction of 60 kilograms of gold was divided into four wooden boxes and taken to the Taiwan Provincial Government by Harada for receipt by Secretary-General Ge Jingen. Later, the military law department of the Taiwan Garrison Command inquired with Harada, who claimed that except for the second shipment, which was directly handed over to the government, Evans personally drove a jeep to pick up the other shipments and opened the boxes on the spot, putting the gold bars into a red briefcase and taking them away.

Headquarters of the US Military in China

Sent personnel to Taiwan in May 1946 to investigate the case. In June of the same year, Huang Zaiyi, a Taiwanese businessman who handled the sale of the batch of gold entrusted by Evans, was arrested in Shanghai. According to Huang's confession, Evans came to Shanghai twice in November and December 1945 and entrusted him with the sale of 1,921 gold bars (one tael each). More than 300 of them were sold by Captain Elon Sheng, obtaining a total of US$100,000 and US$8,000. Huang Zaiyi received a referral fee of US$850. Based on Huang Zaiyi's confession, the Criminal Investigation Group of the US Military Headquarters in China recovered 1,921 original gold bars from 14 money shops and businesses in Shanghai, including Dasen and Xietai. The gold bars were engraved with the character "Fu" on the front and "24K/1000" on the back, which was completely identical to the newly received ones by the government. Therefore, the crime of embezzlement

seems to be confirmed

However, Captain Elon Sheng is an active US military officer and should be tried by a US military court according to law. Lieutenant Colonel Evans has now retired but does not have the status of a Chinese military officer or a public servant of our government. Therefore, he cannot be punished under the Anti-Corruption Statute and can only be charged with the crime of embezzlement of public funds under Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the ordinary criminal law. However, his crime occurred before December 31, 1946, and the highest principal sentence is no more than seven years of imprisonment, which meets the amnesty provisions under item A of the amnesty decree. Furthermore, Evans and Elon Sheng are far away in the United States; and there is no extradition treaty between China and the United States.

Therefore, it is still appropriate to transfer the case to the US government for its own legal decision. As for the civil compensation liability, a reasonable solution can be sought in the future through civil proceedings. Therefore, a non-prosecution ruling was issued in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 7, Subparagraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As for the part of purchasing stolen goods, the defendants Huang Zaiyi, Sun Xian, Jiang Shengtang, Jue Zongyu, Cheng Jushi, Li Zhicheng, Yang Zhichang, Xu Henian, Wang Shouzheng, Ji Jiehe, Wang Kewen, Chen Yunxi, Zhu Jinchun, Hu Yuji, Zhu Jialin, Gu Yuhong, Zhuang Shanbing, and Shi Xianglong, were also not prosecuted due to the amnesty.

### Chinese National Fine Arts Association Celebrates Arts Festival in Beijing Yesterday, Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, and Others Deliver Speeches

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] The Chinese National Fine Arts Association held this year's Arts Festival celebration and the 9th Annual Meeting at 2:00 PM on the 25th in Beijing. Over a hundred members attended. Chairman Zhang Daofang explained the meaning of art as defined by the government and the simultaneous celebrations in various branches. He also expressed the desire to promote social emphasis on art and the need for the artistic community to make creative efforts. Art should be closely integrated with the needs of people's lives and not be purely academic. Subsequently, guests gave speeches. Mr. Chen Lifu said that art best represents national characteristics and should be developed in various ways, without being mechanical. He also cited the examples of farmers, workers, and businessmen who, due to work fatigue, enjoy nature, landscapes, flowers, and birds to soothe their emotions, and music and songs to cultivate their temperament. Therefore, art, like miniature landscapes, flower and bird paintings, books, music, and songs, has long been used to nurture emotions and temperaments. Mr. Pan Gongzhan said that national construction requires art and hopes that artists will, according to Mr. Lifu's statement, adapt to the social environment and work together to move forward, based on the artistic needs of farmers, workers, and businessmen. Sun Yaofu and Yu Shangyuan also successively clarified the essence of art in cultivating national vitality.

### How to Determine the In-and-Out Price of Gold Jewelry? Silverware Industry Asks the Social Bureau for Instructions Today's Meeting to Designate a Calculation Table After the Economic and Social Bureau Decides, the Industry Will Resume

[This newspaper report] Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, and Biao Yunliang, representatives of the silverware industry in this city, visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall at around 11 a.m. yesterday, bringing a written presentation. Mayor Wu responded that the points raised were under the jurisdiction of the City Social Bureau, and instructed them to consult with the bureau. The representatives then went to the City Social Bureau at 3 p.m. Director Wu was away on business in Beijing, so Shao, the Section Chief of the Second Section of the bureau, received them. The representatives presented a written document, the main points of which were: (1) The selling price should be determined by public consultation and reported to the Social Bureau for record, in order to simplify the process. (2) If supply and demand cannot be met, customers should not be allowed to force purchases or exchanges, and the silverware industry should be allowed to request protection at any time to avoid disputes. (3) Redemption should be based on the Central Bank's price of 480,000 yuan. If supply and demand are unbalanced, the industry should consider providing a labor cost allowance to customers whose jewelry is in good condition, in order to reduce customer losses and maintain the industry's consistent reputation. (4) Before the Central Bank allocates supply, the industry relies solely on store sales and redemptions, which are difficult to balance. In order to make up for shortages and surpluses, businesses should be allowed to supply each other, with a slight handling fee, to avoid the emergence of a black market. Social Bureau Section Chief Shao stated that the Ministry of Finance's new management measures had only been seen in newspapers, and the Social Bureau had not yet received formal instructions. He would forward the representatives' requests to Director Wu and ask for instructions.

According to the representatives, a meeting will be held today to determine the price calculation table for selling gold jewelry. The table includes various items, with each tael priced at 480,000 yuan according to the Central Bank's price, plus a profit, interest, labor cost, and other expenses of 100,000 yuan. Once the table is determined, it will be submitted to the Social Bureau today. As soon as a definitive reply is received, business will resume. Representatives from Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei and other regions are also waiting for news in Shanghai and will take the same steps as the Shanghai market.

If full capacity is utilized, it can reach 19,000 cases. The current output of general factories is only about three-fifths of full capacity. The 24 factories have a total of 2,762 workers and 136 plank carts. According to the survey: the manufacturing cost of matches is similar for both large and small factories, while the selling price differs significantly. Large factories sell each case for 1.5 million yuan, while small factories sell for 500,000 yuan. Therefore, joint operation is advisable to protect the survival of small factories. The raw materials for matches, such as potassium chlorate and zinc oxide, are not sufficient domestically and are largely dependent on foreign goods. Oxhide glue can be largely supplied by the Chichang New Glue Factory in this city. Cotton poplar comes partly from Qingdao, but most is still dependent on imports. Other raw materials, such as red phosphorus, white wax, red alum, and sulfur, all rely on imports. Therefore, if the raw material problems are not resolved, the match industry in this city has no significant meaning to speak of. Those who operate match factories should first find ways to manufacture potassium chlorate, red phosphorus, and cotton poplar themselves, in order to establish the foundation of China's match industry. Currently, the only solution is to relax the supply of foreign exchange in order to maintain the status quo. The office also believes that the current counterfeit matches in this city are extremely rampant. These goods are of poor quality and harm the business of legitimate factories. The industry hopes that the government will prohibit them. The industry also believes that matches are daily necessities, and a tax of 20% seems too high. They plan to ask the government to reduce the tax to benefit business.

### Nanjing Silverware Industry Asks for Lenient Treatment on Prohibition of Gold Bullion Redemption

[This newspaper's Nanjing, 25th special dispatch] Yan Chunrong, chairman of the Nanjing Silverware Industry Association, said that the industry was originally scheduled to resume business uniformly today, but during a resumption symposium held yesterday afternoon, some members believed that Article 5 of the "Management Measures for the Redemption and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by the Silverware Industry" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, which stipulates that the silverware industry shall not redeem gold bullion, would further cut off the supply of raw gold. They requested that the competent authorities interpret the regulation and ask for lenient treatment. Therefore, this morning, except for a few stores such as Lao Tian Dou on Zhonghua Road in Nanjing, which had already started business, the rest continued to suspend operations. This morning at 11 o'clock, the industry sent four representatives, including Yan Chunrong, to the Social Bureau to petition, requesting that the prohibition of gold redemption by the silverware industry be relaxed. Because the bureau had no power to change government laws and regulations, it agreed to convey the industry's difficulties to the government authorities.

### Export Groups Hold Separate Meetings

[This newspaper report] The textile, knitwear, and cotton groups of the Export Promotion Council held their first meeting at the Textile Construction Company at 2 p.m. yesterday. Yang Xiren, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Wang Yangxian, and Zhang Silu attended. Several issues were discussed: (1) The current difference between the buying and selling price of British pound exchange rate at the Central Bank is 8,000 yuan. This is very disadvantageous for cotton textiles exported to the British pound group. It is proposed that the maximum difference between the buying and selling price of the British pound exchange rate should not exceed 5%. (2) The export of Chinese cotton yarn is currently being negotiated and promoted in Rangoon, Saigon, and Siam. In Hong Kong, the second batch of cotton yarn requires 32-count and 42-count fine yarn, so the export will be delayed until the beginning of next month. (3) The current market price of cotton yarn in this city is balanced, so the export volume of cotton yarn from this city will generally expand to one-tenth of the total production each month.

The straw hat whip and straw hat group also held their first meeting at the Central Trust Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday. Shen Xirui, Feng Jimin, Yu Langxi, Lin Jinfu, Sun Deyou, and Yuan Jialin attended. The following issues were discussed: (1) It is hoped that the customs can facilitate the import of raw materials for straw hat whips, and the government can provide subsidies in terms of collecting export taxes in the future. (2) It is hoped that loan funds for the industry can be directly lent to manufacturers.

The opinions discussed at the recent meetings of various groups will be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council, which will be held this Thursday, for discussion and final decision.

### Yarn Prices Stabilize

Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable again. There was a slight demand from Jiangxi merchants. Industry insiders had firm intentions due to increased costs. Although Tianjin and Guangdong merchants were watching and not moving, there were still those who bought at low prices, so the price rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Tea Market Lingering on a Weak Path

The foreign tea market has remained weak. Generally, cargo owners are keen to sell their current stock in light of new tea from this year about to come into production, resulting in an abundance of existing product. Although buyers are taking advantage of the low prices, it is still a buyer's market. Prices are unlikely to rise. Yesterday, 同孚 foreign firm bought more than 100 cases of 卅四年份　源抽珍 at a price as low as 550,000 yuan per dan. Other grades, such as Zhen Mei and needle 届, were purchased by 大德昌 and 午昌 tea companies, with prices on a downward trend. As for red and green tea for domestic sales, the situation is quiet and unremarkable.

### Wool Raw Material Quota Allocation Committee Asks the Import Management Committee to Relax Standards

[This newspaper report] The Wool Raw Material Quota Allocation Committee held a meeting at the address of the Wool Textile, Finishing and Dyeing Industry Association of this city on the afternoon of the 24th at 4 p.m. Committee members Cheng Nianpeng, Wang Yuncheng, Zhang Silu, Tang Weizhang, Wu Shanlou, Hua Yinchun, Chen Bingheng, Ye Fucang, Tang Junyuan, Zheng Shuzhang, Chen Yuanqing, Lao Peishen, and Kai Dun attended. The meeting lasted until about 7 p.m. The discussion process and resolutions are listed below:

(1) Based on each factory's equipment and operating spindles, report the quota that each factory should receive to the quota allocation office of the Import Management Committee, which will be decided by the allocation office. (2) The raw materials needed for spinning construction spindles will be calculated at 60 pence. (3) Shanghai Wool, Anle, Zhenfeng, and other factories have proposed that a large amount of raw materials are needed for woolen yarn and coarse spinning spindles. It has been decided that the standards set by the association are actually far from sufficient and should be corrected. Resolution: Still according to the original plan, but it should be explained in detail when reporting. (4) The wool raw material quota for this industry from February to April is only 1.4 million US dollars, which is too small. According to actual needs, it is only 15% of the required amount. It is proposed to request the allocation office to find other ways to meet the foreign exchange needs of state-owned factories, not within the above-mentioned scope, in order to solve the immediate crisis and maintain work. (5) The industry needs about 3.5 million US dollars in foreign exchange per month. Currently, there are only more than 400,000 US dollars. It is impossible to cook without rice. A way must be found. The Import Management Committee should be asked to relax the scale in order to be responsible for the situation.

### Three Associations Resubmit to the Executive Yuan to Request the Return of Robbed Yarn and Cloth

The movement to recover the robbed yarn and cloth launched by the three trade associations of dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth shops, and cotton yarn shops has lasted for a year and a half. In the end, it was rejected after initially being approved due to the Executive Yuan's concept of financial relief. The three associations then filed an administrative lawsuit, but it did not yield any results. Since the departure of Mr. Song and the concurrent appointment of Chairman Chiang as the head of the Executive Yuan, society has been refreshed. The three industries have held several meetings to discuss and decided to prepare a document and resubmit it to the Executive Yuan to make an earnest appeal. According to the spokesperson of the three associations: Since the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the central government has repeatedly stated that the priority should be to restore national credibility. Whether this case can be resolved fairly will also be a testament to whether national credibility can be re-established.

### Dyes Turn from Bad to Good, Sulfide Prices Rise

[This newspaper report] The dye market, which has been flat for a long time, saw active sales yesterday. MK sulfide cost 5 million yuan per unit, and 693 sulfide cost 6.5 million yuan per dan, up 500,000 yuan from the previous week. The prices of other dyes remained the same, but the prices were fairly firm.

### Textile Construction Company Reports on the Work in 1946

[This newspaper report] The Textile Construction Company yesterday released a report on its work in 1946, stating briefly: Since the company was formally established on December 4, 1945, it was ordered to take over enemy-owned textile factories in China. The head office began operating in Shanghai on November 2, 1946, and the Tianjin and Qingdao branch offices were also established at the beginning of January. In addition, in order to facilitate cotton collection and sales, offices were established in Chongqing, Xi'an, Shashi, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nantong, Hangzhou, Shantou, and Zhengzhou. In August, the Northeast branch office and various offices were added. Regarding industrial affairs, after actively engaging in reorganization, the company currently has 18 cotton textile factories, 6 printing and dyeing factories, 5 woolen mills, 2 hemp manufacturing and machinery factories, and 1 silk spinning, yarn tape, and knitting factory each in Shanghai. Tianjin currently has 7 cotton textile factories, and 1 machinery silk weaving, woolen mill, hemp spinning, and printing and dyeing factory each. Qingdao has 8 cotton textile factories, and 1 machinery, spool, printing, bleaching, knitting, and textile-related chemical factory each. The Northeast currently has 5 cotton textile and printing and dyeing factories each. In total, there are 1,758,480 yarn spindles, 330,256 thread spindles, and 28,591 looms. The Northeast Dalian and Jinzhou are still being taken over and are not included. As for the production process, the manufacturing cost is 20% lower than that of private factories. At the same time, the average output per yarn spindle is 0.989, which has reached the pre-war standard. Regarding business strategy, an agreement has recently been reached with the Hong Kong government to supply cotton yarn worth 2 million pounds. In addition, negotiations are also underway with Vietnam, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and other regions. If one-tenth of the annual production can be exported, there may not be any problems with domestic supply. In the coming year, it is estimated that foreign exchange of 75 million to 100 million US dollars can be earned to offset the country's trade deficit. In 1946, the company applied for more than 26,079,000 US dollars in foreign exchange and ordered more than 804,000 dan of foreign cotton (more than 162,000 dan have not been received). For the cotton needed in 1947, more than 900,000 dan of domestic cotton have been purchased by the end of last year, and another 300,000 dan will be purchased. The insufficient amount will be supplemented by foreign cotton. In terms of finance, the government allocated 1 billion yuan in initial capital and 5 billion yuan in working capital, and the value of the enemy-owned raw materials taken over was estimated at 19.5 billion yuan. After painstaking management, not only were the debts to banks and the head office cleared, but also 80 billion yuan was paid to the national treasury, and more than 100 billion yuan in unrecorded military yarn and cloth. The total net profit was more than 577.6 billion yuan, including depreciation reserves and the stored raw cotton, wool, dyes, and finished products. If estimated at the current market value, the total net profit would be around 1 trillion yuan.

### Japanese Cedar and Western Pine are Stagnant

In the timber market, Japanese cedar and Western pine are weak, but camphorwood and cypress are priced firmly because of limited arrivals from Taiwan.

### Recent National Wool Textile Industry Spindle and Loom Statistics

[This newspaper report] According to a survey by the Wool Textile Finishing and Dyeing Industry Association of this city, the detailed number of all spindles and looms in the national wool textile industry is as follows:

### Newsprint Continues to Weaken

[This newspaper report] In recent days, the newsprint market has been weak and unable to recover. 30×42 Canadian white newsprint has fallen to 98,000 yuan per ream, 38-pound woodfree paper is 240,000 yuan per ream, 36-pound kraft paper is 240,000 yuan per ream, and white transparent paper is 1,070,000 yuan per ream. The market is still weak, and transactions are extremely sluggish. Incense paper prices have risen because the Qingming Festival is approaching and sales are increasing.

### Grained Leather Market Softens Again, High Price of Buffalo Hide Unsustainable

[This newspaper report] The grained leather market, which was briefly strong last week, has softened again today. American Tree brand grained leather is quoted at 26,000 yuan per foot, but there are no buyers. The price of raw buffalo hide, which had risen sharply before, increasing by more than 100,000 yuan per dan, is also unsustainable at a high price today. It is quoted at 420,000 yuan per dan, but there are few actual sales, and transactions are very sparse.

### Cotton Cloth Sales are Slow

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, the Textile Construction Company opened sales of cloth as usual. Plain grey cloth, Blue Phoenix fine cloth was listed at 141,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen twill, Golden Seal opened at 156,000 yuan, Jumping Carp grey light twill at 77,000 yuan.

### The Cradle of the Chinese Navy: A Visit to Mawei

— Fuzhou Dispatch, 18th. Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu

Mawei—the birthplace of the Chinese navy, has an inseparable relationship with the history of the Chinese navy. Tracing back to the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign (1866), the Qing court, awed by the powerful ships and cannons of foreigners, initiated the Westernization Movement. Governor-General of Zhejiang and Fujian, Zuo Zongtang, proposed establishing a naval shipyard in Mawei, Fuzhou. The Qing court approved, and the following year, ordered Jiangxi Governor Shen Baozhen to Fujian to oversee and plan everything, writing the first chapter of the Chinese naval history. China, a country with over nine thousand miles of coastline, needs a navy for its establishment. Mentioning the Chinese navy inevitably brings to mind Mawei, nestled on the northern bank of the Min River estuary. Despite being a small town, it boasts a glorious history.

The Gateway to Fujian: A Strategically Important Area

Mawei is located 25 kilometers southeast of Fuzhou, protruding into the Min River, serving as the gateway to Fuzhou. Surrounded by mountains outside the harbor, it forms a natural barrier. Inside the harbor, the water is deep and the waves are calm, making it convenient for ships to dock. The Luoxing Pagoda stands in the middle of the stream, indeed controlling the strategic location. All sea transport heading to Fuzhou moors here, and then smaller boats transport goods to the city, making it the outer port of the provincial capital.

From a military perspective, below Mawei, mountains flank both sides, narrowing the river passage, with the Min'an Gate guarding the front, creating a natural defense. Holding this corner is sufficient to defend the provincial capital and eastern Fujian, truly a strategic area for maritime defense. Moreover, Mawei Port has deep waters and solid ground, with winding harbors suitable for naval training. The Chinese navy's origin in Mawei is indeed based on its geographical advantages.

Training Soldiers and Building Ships: A Time of Great Prosperity

Mawei was originally a desolate village, but later prospered following the development of the Chinese navy. Houses lined up closely, with a dense population, resembling a small city. From the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1866-1937), Mawei had become a central hub of naval activity for eighty years. Since Shen Baozhen managed naval affairs, Mawei established a shipyard and a naval academy, with the front academy specializing in navigation technology and the rear academy specializing in marine engines. Naval veterans such as Sa Zhenbing and Yang Shuzhuang graduated from here, nurturing many talents for the initial construction of the Chinese navy. After the founding of the Republic of China, the front and rear academies were renamed Naval Academy, and schools for flying submarines, an arts academy, an aircraft manufacturing plant, an ammunition factory, and training camps were established. Defense organizations such as the Kejing Weiying, Xunfang Ying, Shuishi Ying, the port headquarters, coastal defense marine corps, and the Min River Estuary Defense Headquarters were stationed here successively. The shipyard at its peak had thirteen factories, employing over 4,500 workers. The scale was vast, and the equipment was complete, capable of building small warships, gunboats, transport ships, and various types of shells. The buildings were magnificent and imposing, lined up closely, resembling a naval stronghold. It was once extremely prosperous.

Naval Training Camp: The Only Surviving Remnant

Mawei presents a desolate scene after the baptism of artillery fire. The naval shipyard has been shut down, and the river defense agencies have also been dismantled. Only personnel from the Naval Headquarters Custodial Group remain to preserve the remaining equipment and ammunition that cannot be easily moved. The Naval Academy moved west to Guiyang in the early stages of the War of Resistance and has now relocated to Shanghai, renamed the Central Naval Officer School. The only surviving remnant is the Naval Second Training Camp. The training camp was originally renamed from the Lianyong School in the late Qing Dynasty and moved to Mawei from Lushunkou in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926). Founded over fifty years ago, it has cultivated many cadres for the navy. Today, the majority of naval officers are graduates of the Mawei Naval Academy and the Training Camp. When Fuzhou fell, the camp retreated to Meilie in Sanyuan County, and last year it moved back to Mawei to repair the barracks and was ordered to expand. In September of the same year, the Naval Headquarters added the First and Third Training Camps, located in Jiangyin and Fuxing Island, Shanghai, respectively. The one in Mawei was renamed the Second Training Camp.

Recruiting Youths to Defend the Seas

When the reporter arrived at the Naval Second Training Camp, Camp Commander Colonel Ye Keyu greeted and led the tour. The camp covers an area of over fifty acres, with ample space, situated against the mountain and facing the water, in a commanding position. The grounds are planted with flowers and trees, verdant and fragrant, refreshing the mind. The American-style barracks stand high on the mountain, overlooking the clear stream, with picturesque scenery. There are currently over a thousand trainees and 130 officers. The trainees are recruited from children of primary and junior high school graduates from coastal provinces and counties along the Min River. Each year, a large number of applicants are eager to join, demonstrating the coastal youths' determination to serve on the maritime frontier. However, the physical examinations are extremely strict, with standards such as a height of 160 centimeters, a weight of 48 kilograms, a chest circumference of 75 centimeters, a breathing difference of 7 centimeters, eyesight of 1.5 or above in both eyes on the international eye chart, a maximum blood pressure of 140, a pulse of 85, and the ability to return to normal five minutes after exercise. Those with color blindness, trachoma, otitis, hearing impairment, venereal disease, hemorrhoids, and skin diseases are all eliminated. Therefore, the general physical standards of the trainees are quite high, worthy of being called strong men. Their training is divided into two major departments: navigation and marine engines, with classes in driving, engines, guns, sails, torpedoes, communications, signals, military music, etc. The curriculum is very heavy, and there is a practical workshop at the Luoxing Pagoda, but there is a shortage of machinery and instruments. The training period is now shortened to six months and nine months depending on the complexity of the curriculum, in response to national defense needs. It is reported that the camp has trained over 120 teams, numbering over ten thousand people, some of whom have been assigned to various ships and vessels, some have been sent to the Qingdao Naval Training Corps for further training, and some have been sent abroad for advanced studies.

Learning from Pain and Rebuilding the Navy

After visiting the training camp, the reporter had a frank discussion with Camp Commander Ye on issues concerning naval construction and the future of Mawei. The navy is a product of the peak of modern scientific development, encompassing scientific principles such as meteorology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and optics, with complex content. Building a navy is not easy, requiring a spirit of precise organization and rigorous military management. During our country's current War of Resistance, the gateway was wide open, and merchants drove straight in, suffering from the lack of a navy. In 1941, Britain's survival against Germany was due to its powerful naval forces, which serves as a warning. Learning from the pain, we must immerse ourselves in rebuilding the navy to protect our seas. Ye spoke earnestly to the reporter, expressing his fervent hope for the future construction of the navy. He studied naval affairs from a young age, graduated from the Yantai Naval Academy, and was sent to Japan by the central government in the 19th year of the Republic (1930) to specialize in naval affairs. He served as captain of ships such as the Jing'an and Yingrui. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, he commanded the Madang artillery team, defending the fortress. Later, he was ordered to lay mines in the inland rivers of Zhejiang and Jiangxi to prevent the enemy from penetrating deeply, achieving remarkable merits. He is of imposing stature, with a loud voice, articulate, amiable, and strict in military discipline, highly respected by his subordinates. Regarding the future of Mawei, he stated that the shipyard has a well-established foundation, and the existing facilities are intact. In the future, if construction can be carried out on the existing foundation, repairing the remaining machinery, it would not be difficult to restore the old appearance and engage in repairing and building ships, which is also an important plan for establishing the navy. After returning, the reporter looked through

Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" plan to build Fuzhou into a second-class good port, renovating the Min River Estuary waterway below Mawei to a depth of over thirty feet, so that large ships can dock, Mawei is essential for the progress of building the new China.

Water and Electricity Deposit Regulations Have Set Standards

Reader Chen Dajun sent a letter appealing about the French-owned Tram and Electric Light Company's collection of deposits. We have received a letter from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau stating: "Regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's method of collecting water usage deposits (i.e., meter deposits), this bureau has submitted to the Municipal Government for revision and approval at the 51st Municipal Conference in October of last year. The regulations stipulate that 'The amount of deposit paid by old users shall be based on twice the average monthly water fee for the previous twelve months.' Also, the method of collecting electricity usage deposits by the electric companies in the city has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and has been implemented since May 1946. The regulations stipulate that 'If the company discovers that the deposit paid by the user is less than one and a half times the highest monthly electricity bill in the most recent four months, the company may collect additional fees from the user.' According to the above two regulations, the number of fees previously collected should be calculated as well. Furthermore, the company's standard for collecting electricity deposits from new users is based on the number of lamps installed by the user, and old users will not be charged additional fees for the time being. When transferring the account, the number to be increased will be based on one times the highest electricity bill in the most recent four months. If the company is found to be overcharging water and electricity deposits, or canceling previous fees without counting payments, please send the actual evidence to the bureau for investigation." Respectfully.

Diesel Fuel Should Not Be Piled Up on the Roadside

Next to a certain glass factory bordering Yanping Road and Yaoqiao Lane in Shude Village, a large amount of diesel fuel, several hundred huge barrels, is piled up on the road in front of the door. Nearby residents are uneasy. Given the frequent fires in the city, it is not appropriate to pile up flammable items in the open air. It is hoped that the authorities will order the factory to move them quickly to ensure safety. (Zhou Yuting)

Extend Route 11 Bus Rights

Editor: I have seen the Route 11 bus stop signs already nailed up on the roadside, indicating that the Route 11 bus will soon be meeting us. Its terminus is on the Bund on Edward Road. From the location of the ticket booth, I have nine humble suggestions to contribute to the relevant authorities, hoping that the route can be extended to Xiaodongmen. First, Xiaodongmen is where the Pudong ferry is located, and if it can be extended there, it can facilitate many people from Pudong. Second, it is where the Route 1 bus circles, which can connect and prosper the Nanshi area, encourage citizens to move to Nanshi, reduce the housing shortage, third the intersection of Edward Road is the end for French route 22, and it is place for many foreign vehicles, and the loading and unloading of cargo at the pier is already very crowded. If vehicles are added to turn around and stop here, it will increase the risk of blockage, and there are many places near Xiaodongmen that can be used as terminals, such as the original Waitan Road, etc., which can achieve multiple goals. I wonder if the authorities would be willing to adopt them? (Wang Yongye)

Please Pay Attention to the Security of Guhe Town

Editor: Guhe Town is a base area for the War of Resistance in eastern Anhui and has been stable for the past eight years. Recently, bandits have been looting the surrounding villages, such as the residents of the Dawang Temple in the town, and the home of Geng Boping in Youfangji Xianzong, have been repeatedly looted by bandits. Although the Ninth District Commissioner's Office has been reported to suppress the bandits, there is no effective solution, causing the people to be uneasy. Therefore, please disclose this to urge the Anhui military and political authorities to take measures to protect security. (Luo Yengeng, a resident of Guhe Town, Quanjiao)

Spring and Autumn

### I Became a Village Representative

— Tan Zhengbi

At this time of heightened calls for constitutional government, I have also become a village representative. After various contacts, many feelings have arisen. Because these are feelings, I will write them down and publish them here.

A village representative is the public opinion body of a village, equivalent to a county councilor in a county, and a provincial or municipal councilor in a province or city. Therefore, the village representative assembly is the lowest-level organization of the democratic structure, but it is the most capable of directly representing public opinion. But sadly, when most village representatives are elected, they do not know what this thing is, and they think that it is only used to represent the villagers in electing county councilors and to carry chairs for people. So everyone is a little annoyed at taking on this title. I think: It's not just our village that is like this, I'm afraid 99% of the towns and villages across the country are like this! Moreover, it's sad to say that not to mention the average representatives, who have all experienced the period of political tutelage and still cannot understand what their responsibilities are, even I, who graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts degree and used to be a university lecturer, and usually pay attention to all laws, did not fully understand what a village representative was at first. It was only after being elected that I studied the relevant laws and suddenly realized.

Therefore, I think: Suppose the village representatives of a village are elected and the village representative assembly is established. If these representatives do not know what they should do and blindly listen to the instructions of the village administrative organs, then the village administrative organs will ask you to pass a motion and you will pass whatever motion they want. In this way, many things that were originally the responsibility of the village administrative organs can now be pushed onto you. Not only can you not represent public opinion, and fail to live up to the villagers' selection, but you are taking the heat for the village administrative organs. You have become a puppet, being used without even knowing it. This is a very dangerous thing in the period of constitutional government.

There is also another situation. Some representatives, although they don't know what they should do, but some who know a little bit think that the village representative assembly is the highest authority in the village, and the village representatives are special people in the village, with special powers. Then they use the name and power of the representative to arbitrarily bully the villagers and inherit the behavior of the local tyrants and evil gentry of the past. This is not my doomsaying, I have already heard of such people among the county councilors, so I dare not say that there are definitely none among the village representatives. This situation is as unfavorable to the implementation of constitutional government as the aforementioned situation, and this is obvious at a glance.

Therefore, I have a humble opinion that village representatives are not like county, provincial, or municipal councilors, because their level of knowledge only needs to be at the level of primary school graduation. Therefore, after being elected, they should be trained by the higher authorities. At least, they must be made to understand what kind of position they are in, what they should do, and what their relationship with the village administrative organs is. Then they can be taught to exercise their powers, become a truly public opinion body, and promote the realization of constitutional government.

This time, when I became a village representative to participate in the first representative meeting, I was elected chairman by everyone. I immediately stated two points to all the representatives without any reservation: (1) Do not think that it is not worth doing because it is only a basic village representative and does not bear the prominent responsibilities of county and municipal councilors, because this is the lowest-level organization of the public opinion body, the most direct public opinion body, and the most direct representative of public opinion. (2) We are here to represent the opinions of all the villagers and to supervise the village administrative organs. We are in an opposing position to the village administrative organs. Therefore, if we cannot supervise the village administrative organs, or if the village administrative organs have made mistakes and we do not correct them, and we do not exercise all the powers prescribed by law that we should do, then we are derelict in our duties and fail to live up to the entrustment of all the villagers. Then I roughly explained some of the powers prescribed by law that we should exercise.

Who knew that after I said this, the people who had no interest in this position and this meeting suddenly became excited, so that the meeting could continue without being lonely. Moreover, even after the meeting, everyone was still chatting, and they felt that my explanation of the powers that we could exercise was not clear and detailed enough, and that it would be best if I could explain it in more detail so that everyone could do it within this scope. Moreover, they also had an opinion that most of the representatives came from rural villages, and they had never dared to offend the village administrative personnel who were accustomed to acting arbitrarily. Although I had also explained to them that we can be immune to external responsibility for what we say in the meeting, they were still reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. The biggest reason, however, was that the village administrative personnel were also in attendance because they were invited to attend the meeting to report and listen to inquiries. Therefore, it affected them from saying many things that they were embarrassed to say in front of them. In this way, it is difficult to file a case of impeachment of wrongdoing.

The meeting is still going on, but in addition to the various situations mentioned above, I think that there may be other unexpected things that will be discovered. Although I am busy writing for a living now, I am very happy to spare some time to do this thing well with everyone. Because this is not a matter of fame or profit, but a responsibility that every citizen should fulfill. This is something that people with more knowledge disdain to do, but I think that every intellectual should do it if they have such an opportunity. Because this is the only way to truly be close to the people and know the true suffering of the people!

Because this is an article of feelings, it is written in a very messy way, please forgive me!

### Looking Up

— Meng Nong

A friend was holding a paintbrush, standing in front of an easel, as if pondering something.

I approached him and walked onto the high platform where he was standing. Looking closely, everything on the canvas was finished! In the foreground, there was a lush lawn, a winding lakeshore, rippled lake water, and willow branches almost hanging to the shore. In the midground, visible through the countless willow branches, was a wandering young man with a weather-beaten face, wearing a maroon-colored sweater, sitting quietly on the other side of the small lake, raising his powerless head, seemingly not moving or making a sound. In the background, there was a vast expanse of sky.

The entire scene was filled with new green, tender yellow, azure, maroon, and light gray. The brushstrokes appeared soft and lively, and the colors were extremely bright and full of vitality.

"Friend, almost finished, right?" I interrupted his thoughts.

"Finished? Not so easy! You see, the most difficult part to complete, and also the most important part, has not yet been completed!"

"What does that mean?" I asked, puzzled, showing my lack of understanding of his composition and design.

"I have not yet expressed the core of life in this painting. What I want to express is the melancholy mood of that wandering young man. Don't you see, he is intently looking up—at the clouds—at the ten incredible clouds?"

"Oh, haven't the delicate weeping willows already expressed the world that has been isolated in the heart of that wandering young man? Do you know the truth that 'only clouds cannot speak'? Clouds, as you like to say, are originally incredible! Clouds, sometimes, are as majestic as high mountains, sometimes, they fly like phoenixes, sometimes, they gallop like celestial horses. Their lives are constantly changing, with endless transformations. Just when you are about to capture them, they disappear without a trace. Just when you think you have painted them well, you don't expect that they are no longer what they were, because their very being is scattered!"

"Oh!" He put down his paintbrush and fell back into thought. "Then, let this young man always lift his head and look up at something!"

"Good! Let this never-finished masterpiece be titled 'Looking Up'!" I immediately responded in agreement.

### Leo Tolstoy Quotes

— Translated by Jin Ning

In his life, people face the truth, standing in the light of the truth reflected before him, walking from darkness to light. If he cannot see the light of truth, nor can he see the road he has walked, he has already fallen back into darkness. But if he can find the illumination of truth where he is, he can still freely choose the road on this side or that side.

### Colors (Three Chapters)

— Qingguo

Red

I am afraid of the dark.

And for me, the human world is unfamiliar, and the night road is even more unfamiliar.

But a strong belief compels me to continue forward. I have no reason to stop my footsteps.

Groping on a dilapidated and cold, rugged and steep night road, how desperately I need a lamp!

That red lamp, that lamp with leaping red flames.

The lamp lit with the eyes burning with the light of truth, with the lips exploding with the songs of battle, is the reddest and brightest.

Because such a flickering red lamp, like a flower, like the sun, is always smiling at me in my heart, I do not know what difficulties and terrors, fears and timidities are.

I run, I run happily.

On this vast and boundless dark plain, there are dim green will-o'-the-wisps, sharp wind sounds, and arranged abysses, crisscrossed with thorns.

I run, I run boldly and proudly.

I need a lamp, a lamp with a leaping red flame!

Green

I am very thirsty.

Passion scorches me, passion puts me in the bitter state of thirst.

Therefore, sometimes I also want to pour a glass or two of wine into my stomach.

I have many hopes, too many ideals. And a brave passion often adds to the fuel. - But I am becoming more and more thirsty.

I need wine! I need green wine!

Wine brewed with the lives of young girls and the dreams of children is very green; it is intoxicatingly green.

Besides green wine, I also like green grasses, green leaves, green buds, green pools, and green curtains.

Towards this raging prairie fire, who does not have a desire for hope and ideals? I hope that the giant bell of this era is filled with green wine, so that we can drink to our heart's content.

Yes, isn't green the color of hope and ideals? And I am intoxicated with many hopes and too many ideals.

I need green wine!

Blue

Wouldn't it be nice if I had a bottle of such ink!

Deep blue, deep blue, dissolved with youth, with love, with tears.

However, I cannot find them, I cannot find them all.

The bottle of my soul is forever empty, and the tip of my imagination's pen is forever rusted.

I know that this human world lacks youth, love, and tears!

Now, all kinds of brands of ink are very light. When you write on paper, you cannot see clearly. After the erosion of time, it becomes blurred and fades. And the ink seller is still incessantly nagging to customers: That is very good ink, deep blue, deep blue.

How can I not feel annoyed? This era wants me to learn, wants me to learn to create poems!

But I cannot use the ink that is as light as gray,

I urgently need a bottle of such ink, deep blue, deep blue, dissolved with youth, with love, with tears. (March, Suzhou.)

### An Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Feng

Crane—I just can’t remember… could it be that “what secret?”

Ping—(Laughing) Elder Brother, I think you are the biggest trickster.

Crane—No trickery, I swear!

Ping—Alright, alright, stop flipping through. You wouldn't have noted this down in your handbook. (Probably Crane is up to some trick again, pretending to flip through the handbook.) But it's just that "eight" character! (Hearing this, we all looked at each other excitedly.)

Crane—Tch! … "The secret of eight, I remember it. But I don't think there's any secret…

Ping—Can't say that, Elder Brother, this is very important. Just before setting off, Teacher Aoki repeatedly instructed that this secret is only known to two or three people; he told me to tell you, asking you and me to work together to sabotage this secret operation!

Crane—So, does that mean I probably don’t know the content either?

Ping—Of course… I don’t think you would know. They didn't use telegrams, because they wanted to keep it strictly confidential. The plan was personally delivered by Sakaki Toichi to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Now, in just over thirty hours, the second step will be launched.

Crane—Second step?

Ping—Yes! The first step has already been launched, but it was not successful. That was the Shanghai aspect. The second step is about to be launched, and it seems to have been successful. But we haven't received confirmation yet.

Crane—Just the two of us can sabotage it?

Ping—Yes, we can; Teacher Aoki said that it's guaranteed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to China.

Crane—What exactly is going on, so serious?

Ping—Regarding the northern war, the military believes they have a good grasp and can conclude it. Unfortunately, the young officers have great ambitions and are unwilling to wait another three or four months; that is the second large-scale invasion of China. A few days ago, they secretly resolved in a military meeting this "eight" secret—to have the "eight" numbered special agent team launch provocative battles at the "eight" advance secret headquarters, triggering the Shanghai prelude battle on August 1; the Nanjing riot battle on August 8; the Guangzhou landing nerve war on August 18; and simultaneously launching a terrible tragedy in Hankou on August 18, echoing each other. They anticipate that on August 28, the Jinpu and Pinghan armies can be connected, or even united. Then this August 28th may be the day of "China's subjugation" signing. So the military called this resolution the "eight" secret.

Crane—Ha, very interesting!

Ping—Elder Brother, this is not an interesting matter, we must rush to Tianjin tonight, and before dawn, we must take a seaplane to Shanghai. Today is the 29th, with only over thirty hours left, we must sabotage this plan.

### Beethoven's Deafness

— Wu Xianqi

Beethoven, born with a passionate and energetic temperament, was easily influenced by all the social changes. Misled by quack doctors and repeatedly deceived by the hope of a cure, year after year, he was ultimately forced to endure the pain of lingering deafness and lead a lonely life. His hearing, which had previously maintained a high degree of sensitivity—a sensitivity that even his fellow musicians did not possess or had never enjoyed—now, in the company of his peers, he had lost the joy of music, the elegance of conversation, and the flow of ideas. When he absolutely could not avoid attending social gatherings, he was almost forced to sit like an outcast; when he approached people, he would immediately feel a burning and anxious emotion, leading people to think or assert that he was a misanthrope.

In his letters to his brother Karl, he once said: "How shameful it is that when others stand beside me and hear the distant flute, I hear nothing, or when others hear the shepherd's song from afar, I hear nothing at all. These encounters have almost driven me to despair. Sometimes, I think I am standing on the edge of suicide—but art has held my hand. Oh! It seems that unless I offer all the melodies surging in my heart, I cannot leave this world. So I continue this miserable life—miserable, to be sure, that a person so sensitive should end up being transformed from beauty to ugliness by a sudden change. People tell me that I must use patience as a guide. In fact, I have already endured—. I still hope to resolve to endure further."

Nevertheless, his love for humanity and his desire for progress remained within his heart. Art encouraged him not to force a career change—he had attempted to change his career to that of a philosopher—and virtue simultaneously prevented him from committing suicide, urging him to struggle unyieldingly. Despite nature placing many obstacles on his life's journey, he relied on his own strength to accomplish all his endeavors and join the ranks of outstanding artists and great figures.

Listen to his loud and moving words: "Let everything be as it is! I am happy to eagerly face death. If it comes before I have the opportunity to develop all my artistic talents, even if my fate is bad, it would be too hasty. I hope it comes later—but if the end comes swiftly, I am also happy, because does it not escort me out of endless suffering? Whenever you wish to come, then come! I will bravely face you."

How tragic and magnificent this is! Beethoven's life is a solemn and majestic symphony. He not only nourished future generations with the milk and sweat of music, but also overcame death with his fearless spirit.

Death is but a kind of rest, but art is eternal life.

### The "Don't Understand" Foreign Tiger

— Chang Chu

After the promulgation of the economic emergency measures plan, the first to be arrested was a foreign tiger, whose crime was illegally buying and selling foreign exchange, deliberately violating the emergency measures plan, continuing to engage in this business after February 17, and whose inflow and outflow of US dollars did not comply with the official price of 12,000 yuan, violating Article 7 of the emergency measures plan.

A few days ago, this foreign tiger was tried for the first time. According to his own confession, all the illegal acts were due to not understanding Chinese regulations, leading him to fall into the legal net. This is an excuse, but behind the excuse is a serious psychological background.

Not understanding Chinese regulations has three interpretations. The first is confusion. We see that this tiger, who is the foreign exchange manager of a foreign firm, is already old and definitely not confused. The second is due to the habit of entering China without asking about Chinese prohibitions, always believing that foreign businessmen in China, especially in Shanghai, are in a "civilization outside" status, and can ignore Chinese law and only do what is beneficial to themselves. Although the Netherlands, to which the tiger belonged, signed a treaty with China as early as the 20th year of the Republic of China, abolishing the enjoyment of consular jurisdiction over overseas Chinese in China, the accumulated habits are difficult to reverse, and they always jump outside the circle of Chinese law to a greater or lesser extent. Habit becomes nature, and it has not changed to this day, so they neglect Chinese regulations.

The third interpretation is that they clearly know they are violating the law, but are blinded by profit, and vainly attempt to do some muddy water fishing in a turbulent market. Perhaps they saw that many people had done a lot of illegal things and were still at large, or perhaps they had been doing this all along and had never encountered any obstacles, and seeing many Chinese officials and businessmen who regarded the law as nothing, making a fortune through speculation, they hardened their hearts and started doing it; this third interpretation is the most likely.

In other words, the "don't understand" of the foreign tiger is actually seeing too clearly. The few foreigners who do evil in China are all those who have read this "old doctor" of China too thoroughly.

But now this foreign tiger is pretending to be confused and saying that he doesn't understand. The only way to deal with him is to make him understand greatly.

But it must be said that it is probably not enough for just one foreign tiger to understand.

### "Prohibition of Dancing"

— Qing Hong

Attending a meeting inevitably involves making a speech or proposal, but speaking and proposing are by no means easy tasks. The truth cannot be told, and even if it is, it is not welcome. If one accidentally stings someone else, the consequences will be even greater. But keeping silent seems to be a disservice to this esteemed member status.

So clever people have invented a set of speaking logic. For thousands of years, the ancient Chinese country has emphasized "embellishment" and focused on "appearance." The saying goes, "Family ugliness should not be exposed." Based on this, one can find articles to write, such as a certain public treaty's "proposal to strictly prohibit dancing businesses."

Prohibiting dancing has the effect of saving resources, one; prohibiting dancing can rectify customs, two; prohibiting dancing can eliminate urban crime, three; … In addition, not only is there no need to worry about "consequences," but it can also greatly demonstrate the solemn appearance of a moral guardian, truly achieving multiple gains with one action.

As for the unemployed dancing girls becoming prostitutes, they deserve it—blame themselves for not being ambitious. And prostitution is a "closed-door affair," which is more reasonable than "openly" playing with dancing girls in dance halls. As for the convenience for those overly "well-fed" figures, they can simply fill the ranks with concubines, enjoying practical benefits while still adhering to the principle of not "exposing" it.

### Suggestions to the Post Office

— Hong Yu

Recently, the postal authorities have been actively rectifying their operations. In addition to establishing five special mailboxes for receiving night-shift mail and the special train postal service for delivering mail along the Beijing-Shanghai line, they are also preparing to implement district delivery in this city to achieve special speed. Therefore, these days, the letters we receive all have a postal publicity item with different colored "Quick, Quick, Quick" stickers on the back of the envelope. This impresses upon people's minds the good concept of a state-run enterprise that is not at all careless.

The postal authorities are also planning a super-speed delivery process. They will organize visiting groups to consult with newspapers, schools, government agencies, social organizations, and individuals to seek opinions as a reference for further improvement. The humility and the spirit of striving to gather wisdom of the authorities truly shows they are not just going through the motions.

I am a person who sends and receives a lot of letters. Seeing that small mailboxes are sold in the newspapers, I bought one from a nearby post office. The style is indeed convenient, and the material is also very sturdy. However, there is a shortcoming: printed materials such as books and newspapers cannot be inserted into it. I think the entrance of the box can be enlarged a bit by digging a hole at the top, so that printed materials can also be inserted. If it remains unchanged, a lead cylinder can be installed on the side, so that printed materials can be attached to the side. Also, installing this mailbox is only convenient for inserting mail, but not for sending it out. While the postal authorities are soliciting opinions, I would like to offer the following suggestion: For households that have a small mailbox installed, another mailbox for sending mail should be attached. All ordinary letters and printed materials can be placed inside by the sender, and mail carriers or collectors should collect them several times a day. This would be convenient and fast, and more people would definitely install small mailboxes. And the speed of mutual delivery will definitely be improved.

### Praise for Success

— Hulu

In the Kunming parliamentary election, a certain gentleman sold a house and a coffin he had prepared, earning 20 million to use for activities.

Enthusiastic about the election, the glory of a parliamentarian! How to win depends on relationships; winning over people depends on money. Scratching head, touching ear: "What should I do?"

Buying a house and buying a coffin, the energy is shocking, the title is so good, life and death are light! Rather sleep without a coffin, just wanting a false name! Success is guaranteed, everything is about money!

### "Give Me Liberty"

— Xingyun

Among anti-Nazi films, this is an excellent work. It recounts the story of seven German political prisoners who escaped from a concentration camp in 1936. These seven people included a novelist, a musician, a worker, a professor... In the end, six of them were captured, taken back to the concentration camp, and executed, hung on crosses. Only George survived, enduring danger and escaping with the help of underground comrades, fleeing to the Netherlands.

The screenplay and directing are both highly skilled and concise. The film's atmosphere, the exquisite use of the director's lens, and the rich human touch of many scenes create a vivid and powerful historical record of anti-Nazism!

Look at the use of several shots, how moving: George, exhausted and hungry, lies in a church, the image of the Virgin Mary transforming into his past lover, his past life; Nazi police rush over, George dodges, the police rush past, and then a few flashbacks show George injuring his hand by climbing over the wall and grasping sharp pieces of glass; this can be used as an example for us.

Other scenes, such as Paul being released after being arrested; Paul smiling bitterly as he emerges from behind a curtain, his wife sitting alone there, seeing her husband, crying sincerely and joyfully, a smile and a cry, perfectly capture the joy and sorrow of a young couple with anti-Nazi sentiments.

Also, the scene of the musician being hunted down; the crosses in the misty concentration camp; all appear so tragic.

Spencer Tracy plays George with depth and simplicity, proving himself to be a successful and experienced actor.

The female lead, Signe Hasso, has too few scenes.

It seems impossible that George's close friend Paul would be released after being arrested. I wonder if the screenwriter wanted to add a bit of comedic atmosphere?

In short, this is a good anti-Nazi film after "My Land and My People," worth watching.

### "Drunkenness Tester"

— Zhong Guang

—People who are drunk will not be allowed to drive cars.

The number of car accidents in the United States each year is truly alarming, and the number of accidents caused by drunk driving is increasing. Recently, Michigan has begun to equip each patrol car with a "drunkenness tester."

The "drunkenness tester" is extremely simple in construction. It is a specially designed toy balloon. When the police encounter a driver suspected of being excessively drunk, they immediately order him to stop, and then order him to blow air into this balloon. The chemicals stored in the jacket can then automatically record the amount of alcohol contained in his lungs and blood.

Medical theory says: When the alcohol content in the human body is less than 0.02%, it can be considered sober. When the concentration is between 0.05% and 0.15%, the person is no longer suitable to drive. If it is above 0.15%, then he is completely in a state of muddy drunkenness.

The "drunkenness tester" was invented by a doctor named Glenn C. Forrester based on the above theory. Inside the balloon is a glass test tube. It is filled with glass particles, mixed with a small amount of purple oxidizing agent. From the point where the purple color fades, it can be determined on the spot how much alcohol the driver suspected of being excessively drunk had consumed beforehand, because the more alcohol the breath contains, the faster the purple color disappears.

### Wine-Blood and Lamb-Fat

— Chen Desheng

With nothing to do, I casually flipped through old books and read, "Full cup of fine wine, the blood of a thousand people, finely cut fat lamb, the grease of ten thousand people." I recalled the two lines in my humble work "Candle tears fall, the tears of the people fall; songs are high, the cries of resentment are high," which appropriately coincide with the above! But excessive drinking of fine wine and excessive greed for fat lamb will surely bring disaster to the mouth and belly. I ask those who drink fine wine in the morning and eat fat lamb in the evening, do you think I am right?

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Xiao Shen also walked out of the dining room, his face showing concern, taking the opportunity to greedily gaze at Lan's face, and even her entire body.

"Tell Ah Shi to go look!" Fat Xu leaned back on the wicker chair, saying casually. In his life, he only believed that goods and banknotes were the most important things. What did a relative's daughter matter?

Lan had already rushed out, shouting "Ah Shi" all the way.

Suddenly, the air raid siren also went off.

Fat Xu and the old man could not help but change color, and together they left the dining table.

"That's not right!" Xiao Shen said very vigilantly, "The Japanese air force must have used Hengyang's airport, so they came so quickly. Tonight may really be bombed!"

Everyone immediately became flustered. Fat Xu rushed upstairs to pack important things, preparing to take them and hide from the air raid.

"Where do we hide from air raids here, is it in Lao Jun Cave?" Old Zhuo asked, following Xiao Shen. He had only been in Guilin for a short time, and of course he could not be as calm about air raids as the old residents of Guilin.

Xiao Shen did not pay much attention to him, just nodded, and then rushed inside; he meant to find Lan, to see if there was an opportunity to show some attentiveness.

But Lan and Ah Shi had already rushed out.

"...Can't go anywhere! Either in the Wang family's house in the east, or in the small shop in the back..." Ah Shi walked along, muttering to himself; it was like talking to himself, and like comforting Lan.

"Ah Shi! Ah Shi! Come and get the boxes!" Xu Shaoming shouted at the top of the stairs.

The sound of commotion gradually arose on the streets outside. People with more sensitive hearing could also hear a buzzing sound coming from the distant sky.

Ah Shi looked a little embarrassed, not knowing whether he should first take the master's relative out to find the child or go upstairs to carry the boxes for the master; but time did not allow him to consider, and Xu Shaoming called him again upstairs. This time, he even stomped his feet hard on the floorboards, obviously anxious.

"But, Cousin Ming...!" Lan cried, wanting to argue with Xu Shaoming.

But Ah Shi had already gone upstairs.

Zhu Zhaonian, who had not spoken for a long time, suddenly pushed away the Zhuo Assistant and Xiao Shen who were blocking him, and ran outside, jumping and running.

"Don't be afraid! Lan, even without Ah Shi, I will find Fei Fei back alone!" He said without turning his head. (2)(5)
