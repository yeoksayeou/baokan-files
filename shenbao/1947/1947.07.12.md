Chairman Zhang Qun presided, and the implementation methods of the general mobilization plan were discussed at length. It was resolved that the political commissars of the non-ministerial departments would draft the implementation outline of the general mobilization. It was also decided to base the draft on the overall leadership of the wartime general mobilization, with the key points being: to concentrate the will of the military and civilians nationwide, mobilize national strength, intensify the suppression of the rebellion, and actively promote reconstruction to remove obstacles to constitutional government and achieve the goals of peaceful nation-building, strengthen economic construction, renovate local politics, mobilize manpower and resources, improve grain administration and conscription, maintain social security, alleviate the suffering of the people, protect the legitimate rights of the people, practice thrift in consumption, increase agricultural and industrial production, and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 107th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th to discuss how supervisory work should be coordinated with the general mobilization plan. Supervisors He Hanwen and Zhang Lu each put forward a proposal, which was discussed in combination. It was decided: (1) to intensify supervisory work in the pacification areas; (2) to intensify the inspection of the work of central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments to see if they are in line with the mobilization plan; (3) for supervisory commissions in various regions to intensify the reporting of corruption; (4) for the Supervisory Yuan to send supervisors to various regions to inspect the actual situation of mobilization; and (5) to strengthen supervisory work over military organs. The proposal is currently being revised and finalized. The meeting, personally chaired by the President of the Yuan, did not end until after 12:00 noon. In addition, the Yuan is also closely monitoring financial controls and speculators manipulating the market.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Refugees from eastern Hebei sent a telegram supporting the general mobilization order, stating that after reading Chairman’s "July 7th" broadcast, they learned of the government's determination to suppress the bandits and seek unity in the suppression of the Communists. The people pledge to follow the general mobilization order and fight to the death with the Communist bandits.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] All sectors of society in the Jiangsu provincial capital convened a meeting on the 11th to discuss the campaign to suppress the bandit rebellion and decided to hold a grand meeting on the 20th to support the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion and save the nation.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 11th] Shanxi-native Senators Li Peide, Liu Jie, Wu Shipeng, and Zhang Yishan recently sent a telegram to the Chairman supporting the "July 7th" instruction and expressed their willingness to awaken the people of Shanxi to accomplish the entire task of suppressing the rebellion.

### At the Resident Committee Meeting of the Senate, Minister Bai Reports on Military Affairs, Emphasizing the Importance of Strengthening Local Armed Forces

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Resident Committee of the Senate held its second meeting at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on the 11th. After Chairman Mo Dehui and the Secretariat made their reports, Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi was invited to report on the recent military and political situation. According to the report: After the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, the main focus of military and political plans is to strengthen the front-line troops and build up the second-line reserves. At the same time, with regard to the treatment of officers and soldiers, a reasonable adjustment is sought, and the Executive Yuan has in principle decided to increase it. "Well-fed soldiers and horses" will allow for an early completion of the military suppression of the bandits. However, military and political plans must be coordinated with civil administration in order to achieve the desired results. Although the army can achieve control over points and lines in combat, grasping the overall situation depends entirely on the entire population. If the entire population can intensify organization and training, local armed forces can be strengthened, and national financial and material resources can be mobilized at the same time, then the current national general mobilization will not be in vain. Minister Bai elaborated on the importance of organizing and training the people and his personal experience in organizing and training the people in Guangxi, saying: Based on my past experience, I am not only very interested in this, but almost believe that people's armed forces can overcome everything.

### Senate Passes Proposals to Request Disaster Relief for the Guangdong Floods

After Minister Bai finished his report, the Senators asked some questions and then proceeded to discuss the proposals. The following were passed: (1) The proposal by Senator Juan Ying and others requesting the government to quickly rescue displaced youth and children in the north was passed and sent to the government for consideration and implementation. (2) The proposal by Senator Qian and others requesting the government to designate Nanjing as a national education demonstration area was passed and sent to the government for practical implementation. (3) The proposal by Senator Fang Shaoyun and others requesting the government to quickly send a senior official to Guangdong to supervise disaster relief in order to provide substantial assistance was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. (4) The proposal by Senator Lin Zhong and others requesting the government to allocate large sums of money to relieve the flood disaster in central Taiwan was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. (5) The proposal requesting the government to quickly complete the Yellow River breach closure project to prevent floods and protect people's lives was passed and sent to the government for prompt implementation. Those present at the meeting today included Chairman Mo Dehui, Jiang Yong, Wu Yifang, Senators Zheng Kuiyi, Wang Juan Ying, Peng Gechen, Zong Heng, Zhang Qianhua, Yu Bin, Yin Shuxian, Lin Zhong, Fan Yusui, Wu Chunwu, Chen Shaoxian, Lu Qian, Zhou Qianchong, Xue Mingjian, Fang Shaoyun, Pan Chaoying, Cai Zhisheng, Yu Nanqiu, Huang Yanpei, and Secretary-Generals Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen.

### Senators Advocate for Investigating Leaks of Confidential News

[Another Dispatch] The issue of leaking confidential news from the Resident Committee meetings of the Senate, raised by Senator Peng Gechen at the second meeting of the committee on the 11th, has aroused great attention among all participating senators. They believe that the heads of various government agencies are invited to attend the committee meetings to report on the matters that have been, are being, or will be handled by their respective agencies, and these reports contain detailed information, some of which is confidential and only for reference, not for publication. Now that some news has been leaked, it not only affects the credibility of the Resident Committee and makes government heads hesitant to speak freely when attending future reports, but also the leaker himself is responsible morally and legally. In particular, during the first meeting of the Resident Committee, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie repeatedly requested that his report not be disclosed, but as a result, several foreign newspapers published it, and it differed from Foreign Minister Wang's original report, adding to many diplomatic difficulties. Therefore, all senators advocate investigating the leakage of this news.

### Yishui Recovered in Southern Shandong; Tightening Encirclement of Qingdao

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th, 11:00 PM] The National Army advancing east from Motiangling entered the city of Yishui at 3:00 AM on the 11th and has completely recovered the city.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 11th] More than 10,000 Communist troops from the 4th Column have been moving in different directions to raid Zaozhuang and Yixian in recent days. The National Army has cut off their retreat route and is concentrating on annihilating them.

[Our Newspaper, Linyi, 11th] The annihilation battle launched by the National Army in southern Shandong has achieved local victories. The remaining main force of the Communist troops has been breaking through and fleeing north. After recovering important strongholds such as Heyang, Tangtou, Qingtuo, and Jiehu, the National Army, together with the National Army in Yishui and Mengyin, is pursuing the remaining bandits in all directions. Casualties are estimated to be at least between 60,000 and 80,000.

[Our Newspaper, Yanzhou, 11th] The fighting north of Tai'an has extended to the Wandebichunpu area on the 11th, and the Communist troops have suffered heavy casualties. The Jiaoji Railway area of Longshan and the Sangzidian area on the north bank of the Yellow River are calm, but the Communist troop strength around Jimo on the outskirts of Qingdao has suddenly increased, and their movements have intensified.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] Communist troops on the outskirts of Weixian attacked the Daweihe and Xiaoweihe strongholds yesterday and carried a large number of explosive packages to bomb the railway bridges of Daweihe and Xiaoweihe, but were repelled. Fangzi and Weixian are safe. The Communist troops appear to be fleeing back east. The Communist troops gathered in the southeast area of Jinan have reached more than 40,000 people and have three column numbers, so there is an attempt to take Jinan.

[Our Newspaper, Dongtai, 11th] The National Army's mobile units are currently launching a mopping-up operation in the area east of Dongtai. Fighting is taking place near Xiaohai. According to relevant sources, the National Army is taking the initiative to search for and annihilate the main force of the Communist troops.

### Communist Bandits Discovered in Northern Chahar; Still Attempting to Open the Northeast Corridor

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Currently, two brigade numbers of Communist troops have been newly discovered in northern Chahar, and it seems they have not forgotten their attempt to open the corridor from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan to the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 11th] Communist bandits on the Jilin-Shenyang Railway are retreating steadily. The Communist bandits entrenched near Panshi have completely retreated to the south, and the main force of the Communist bandits in the Chaoyangzhen-Hailong area is also fleeing to the Zhuliu River.

### Women's Groups Gather to Fight for National Assembly Seats; Plan to Request the Government to Consider Increasing the Number

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] National women's groups hosted the press at 4:00 PM on the 11th to make a report. Lü Xiaodao reported on the Legislative Yuan's reduction of the number of women's National Assembly delegates and decided on three points: (1) The government should be asked to reconsider increasing the number of national women's group representatives. (2) The deprivation of the right to vote for national women's groups without branches should be protested to the Legislative Yuan. (3) If the provisions of the election law conflict with the current laws of the government, the government should ask the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. It was decided that each women's group would send one representative to petition the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Government, and the Legislative Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 14th.

### Pingbao Railway Ready for Traffic

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The Pingbao Railway will soon be open to traffic. A person from Zhangjiakou said that more than 70 bridges destroyed on the Ping-Sui Railway can be repaired, and traffic can return to normal speed. The more than 70 detours next to the bridges on the Pingbao Line have not been dismantled to prevent the Communist troops from destroying the bridges at any time. Keeping the detours is equivalent to having double tracks. Also, surveying of the Bao-Ning Line has now begun, and construction can be expected.

### Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Qingdao

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] Kong Xiangxi flew from Beiping to Qingdao at 5:00 PM on the 11th and is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 13th.

### Reorganization of the Coastal Defense Fleet; Decision to Establish the First and Second Fleets; Liu Cunjun and Li Guosi Appointed Commanders

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] The Chinese Coastal Defense Fleet will be reorganized into the First and Second Fleets. It has been announced that the current Commander of the Coastal Defense Fleet, Liu Cunjun, will be the Commander of the First Fleet, and Li Guosi will be the Commander of the Second Fleet. Liu is currently training in Nanjing and will return to Qingdao soon. The two will take office at the same time. During Liu's training, fleet deployment will be temporarily directed by the Commander of the Second Base. The fleet on its southern patrol mission is directly commanded by the Ministry of the Navy. The organization of the fleet is an important adjustment to the naval organization system.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] An important figure in naval circles answered reporters' questions, saying: If the Chinese government is not constrained by considerations, it can take decisive measures and declare a certain territorial waters area as a pacification zone, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. In fact, the government has already prohibited domestic ships from sailing to Yantai, Weihai, and other areas, but for foreign ships, based on normal international friendly relations and understanding, such a ban is not necessary. Judging from the current situation, if the ban is issued, our Coastal Defense Fleet will take decisive action, which may cause serious conflicts, but our country cannot be held responsible. The government has announced that the Communist Party is a rebel. The domestic situation has been clarified. As for countries that cooperate with the rebels, they have lost the meaning of normal international friendship. If a ban is issued, it will be very important for clarifying the international situation, but the time for its implementation has not yet arrived.

### Compensation for Wounded and Sick Soldiers Adjusted from June

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The lump-sum compensation for wounded and sick soldiers in combat was originally set at 100,000 yuan for wounded generals, 50,000 yuan for colonels, 30,000 yuan for lieutenants, and 10,000 yuan for soldiers. Sick officers and soldiers were given one-quarter of the wounded rate. It has been implemented for more than half a year since September of last year. Chief of Staff Chen believes that local prices have been rising sharply recently, so he has specially requested the Chairman to increase the compensation from June to 200,000 yuan for wounded generals, 150,000 yuan for colonels, 100,000 yuan for lieutenants, and 50,000 yuan for soldiers. Sick generals will receive 100,000 yuan, colonels 50,000 yuan, lieutenants 30,000 yuan, and soldiers 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the Chairman has approved it and the Ministry of National Defense has notified the commanders of all units and the news agencies at all levels of the ministry to be responsible for handling it together.

### Chief of Staff Chen to Fly to Shenyang Today to Boost Morale; to Hold Medal Conferral on Behalf of the Chairman; Attended Military Conference at the Headquarters in Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng listened to reports from Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baoding Pacification Office, and senior generals at the Diplomatic Building last night until 10:30 PM. He attended the military conference of the Beiping Headquarters on the morning of the 11th. Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong also attended. He summoned party and group cadres for instruction at the city party headquarters in the afternoon and met with Fu Zuoyi, who came to Beiping in the afternoon, in the evening. Chief of Staff Chen is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 12th to boost morale. Whether he will go to Siping and Changchun will be decided after arriving in Shenyang. During this trip, he will bring many medals, awards, and morale-boosting items that the Chairman awarded to Chen Mingren, Liu Handong, and others. After arriving in the Northeast, he will hold a medal conferral ceremony on behalf of the Chairman. Chen said in a meeting with reporters on the 11th: After the promulgation of the mobilization order to suppress the rebellion, the work of suppressing the rebellion can be carried out effectively. In the past year, we have been fighting a "black war," not daring to conscript soldiers or grain. It can be said that we have suffered losses everywhere, so the work of suppressing the rebellion has often not been able to proceed according to the planned schedule. Regarding the Shandong war situation, he said: The National Army has achieved great success in Shandong. The Communist nest, the mountains of southern Shandong, is already in the deep control of the National Army in the 12th. Donglidian and Nanma have been recovered. In Nanma alone, there are three factories. When reporters asked whether the war situation in central and western Shandong had an impact on the results of the war in the mountains of southern Shandong, Chen said that the National Army will consolidate the recovered Communist nest in southern Shandong. As for the Communist troops fleeing in central and western Shandong, the government will order troops to intercept them.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 11th] Important party, government, and military figures in Tianjin, including Uang Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Pacification Office, Lin Weiliao, Commander of the Second Army, Du Jianshi, Mayor, and Li Yaolin, Acting Secretary-General of the Party Headquarters, went to Beiping on the 11th to participate in important meetings.

### Du Yuming Says He Has Not Heard About the Establishment of Two Pacification Offices in the Northeast

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] It is rumored here that Chen Chief of Staff's trip to the Northeast is related to the adjustment of the Northeast military organization, and there are rumors that after the establishment of two Pacification Offices in the Northeast (with Sun Liren and Zheng Dongguo as directors respectively), they will be directly under the Northeast Headquarters and the Northeast Security Commander's Office will be abolished.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] Du Yuming's leg disease is gradually recovering, and his spirits are improving. He has grown a short mustache and met with reporters on his sickbed. Regarding the establishment of two Pacification Offices in the Northeast, he said he had not heard of it.

### Huang Shaohong Speaks, Advocating Restoring Wartime Austerity

[Our Newspaper Report] Huang Shaohong, Deputy President of the Control Yuan, recently expressed his views on the current situation, saying that after the victory of the War of Resistance, we should not have immediately demobilized. To restore national strength, we still need to maintain the hard life of wartime. For example, Britain has shown this spirit, so the implementation of today's general mobilization is not only of military significance, but also of nation-building significance. As for the economic way out for our country, I have two views: one is that economic policy should be for the majority of people, and the interests of the few should be appropriately limited for the sake of the majority. However, in our country today, the private interests of the few hinder the interests of the majority. The second is that there has been too much waste after the war, and wartime austerity should be restored. When asked about his views on the Communist Party issue, Huang said: Because he is not responsible for military affairs, he does not fully understand the actual situation, but from a fundamental point of view, if the lives of the majority of the people are solved, the Communist Party's power will inevitably decline. Huang said that the work of the Control Yuan is of great importance to the difficulty of carrying out the orders and advocated restoring the method of control committee inspections. As for improving the treatment of civil servants, the government should not only consider the capacity of the finances to bear it, but also promote social understanding, as this move will inevitably increase the burden on the people.

### Walter Robertson Delayed in Honolulu; Pawley to Come to the Far East Soon

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Walter Robertson, Minister of the US Embassy in China, is currently delayed in Honolulu and is expected to arrive here this weekend. Robertson plans to submit a report to Marshall on the 14th. The State Department has no indication that it will send a new ambassador to China to replace Stuart.

[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 10th, United Press] Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, William Averell Harriman is passing through here on his way to China. He said that his trip to the Far East is a private one and does not represent the government. He will go to China to observe the situation.

### Refuting False and Evasive Replies, We Protest to Outer Mongolia Again; Mongolian Troops Invading Xinjiang Should Withdraw Immediately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] According to diplomatic circles, the Outer Mongolian government replied to our country's protest regarding the Beitashan incident on June 22, making various false and evasive statements. Then, on June 27, it sent a letter falsely accusing our army of shooting across the border on June 17. It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the facts, telegraphed Ambassador Fu twice on July 8 and 10 (July 10 and 11), lodging a serious protest with Outer Mongolia. The main points of the two notes are: (1) When the Chinese government recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia, it declared that Outer Mongolia should take the then-existing boundary as the boundary. The meaning of this is that the boundary of Outer Mongolia after independence should be the border of Outer Mongolia that was delineated by the Chinese central government before Outer Mongolia's independence. Beitashan is located within Xinjiang Province, and the Xinjiang authorities had police and local garrison outposts there both before and after the recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence. (2) The Outer Mongolian army's deep penetration into Chinese territory for more than 200 kilometers to attack the Chinese garrison at Beitashan should not be regarded as an ordinary border dispute. (3) Even if the events of June 5 originated from the so-called "border dispute," why did the Outer Mongolian government not follow international practice or the current United Nations Charter to seek a peaceful resolution, but instead send an ultimatum to the local Chinese garrison with a 48-hour deadline, and then use armed forces to attack the garrison? This behavior shows that the Outer Mongolian government has no respect for international peace and the conventions jointly observed by the international community. (4) From June 6 to June 30, Outer Mongolian armed forces continued to cross the border to attack Chinese garrisons, and aircraft continued to intrude into Chinese Xinjiang to reconnoiter, bomb, and strafe. (5) In addition to demanding that the perpetrators be punished, guaranteeing that there will be no similar actions, and reserving the right to demand compensation, the Outer Mongolian government should immediately order its troops invading Xinjiang to withdraw.

### We Inform the Soviet Union to Maintain Our Original Protest

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the Beitashan incident, the Soviet government informed our government, denying that Soviet aircraft participated. It is learned that our government has repeatedly investigated the matter in detail and has again sent a note to the Soviet side, maintaining our original protest.

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] TASS announced today that the Soviet government has never opposed the establishment of Chinese administrative agencies and the stationing of Chinese troops in Lushun and Dalian, and solemnly denied the Chinese Foreign Ministry's claim that the Soviet Union opposed the Chinese government's previous request. TASS also said that the rumor that the Soviet Union has allowed the Chinese Communists to organize troops near Lushun and Dalian is also unfounded.

### Fu Zuoyi Talks About Arriving in Beiping: Suppressing the Communists Is Like Catching Rats; the Army Can Attack and Defeat Their Main Force

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] Fu Zuoyi took a special plane to meet him in Beiping on the 11th and flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM. He met with Chief of Staff Chen that night. Fu holds an optimistic attitude towards the current military situation. He told our reporter: Currently, people in the community should correct a wrong strategic and tactical concept. People in the community are shaken in their confidence in the government's military strength because the Communist troops are running around everywhere. In fact, at present, the National Army can defeat the main force of the Communist troops and make the Communist troops weaker and weaker, but it cannot fundamentally prevent the Communist troops from running around. For example, even if we have a few people in the house, we may not be able to catch the rat. Since the Republic of China, not to mention the "White Wolf," which ran around for thousands of miles, even small bandits in Suiyuan, such as Yang Houxiao, were suppressed for many years before they were eliminated. Fu also said: The border between Suiyuan and Mongolia and Outer Mongolia is still stable. He does not consider stationing troops on the border. His policy on the border is to seek stability with stability, with less suspicion and avoiding stimulation.

### Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations Announces Completion of Basic Policy Toward Japan; China Will Receive the Largest Share of Reparations

[United Press Washington, 11th] The Far Eastern Commission announced on the 11th that the "Policy Toward Japan After Surrender" has been finalized. This makes it possible to extract reparations from Japan's current and future production. The policy will provide the largest amount to China.

[Central News Agency Washington, 10th] The Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations today passed the basic principles regarding policies toward Japan after its surrender. The policy was decided on June 19th of this year and will be implemented after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Based on this policy, the Commission also resolved to send instructions to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo for revision. The preamble to the general policy declares that Japan cannot be allowed to control its own destiny until it is determined to completely abandon militarism, is willing to coexist peacefully with other countries, and has established democratic principles in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

The "ultimate goals" of the Allied Powers after Japan's surrender are (1) to ensure that Japan no longer becomes a threat to world peace and prosperity, and to establish a democratic and peaceful government capable of fulfilling its international responsibilities, respecting the rights of other countries, and supporting the goals of the United Nations. The establishment of this government must be in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.

(2) The above goals can be achieved by limiting Japan's sovereignty to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other outlying islands to be determined; disarming Japan and abolishing military administration; encouraging democratic institutions; implementing industrial restrictions to support its economy; and allowing fair reparations to be extracted. Measures that could lead to Japan's rearmament and engagement in war will not be followed. Japan will eventually be allowed to participate in the World Trade Organization. Under the name of the "Allied Organization," the former consulate will be placed under the Supreme Commander appointed by the United States. The Emperor and the Japanese government should also obey the Supreme Commander, who, if necessary, may dismiss the heads of various provinces of the Japanese government and appoint new people to fill the vacancies. The Supreme Commander will protect the rights and interests of the member states of the United Nations in Japan. The progress of the occupation will be fully publicized to the world. The Committee also instructed to actively disarm Japan and abolish military administration.

No Military Research Allowed

Japan will have no army, navy, air force, secret police organization, civil aviation agency, or military police, but only a suitable civil police force. Senior officers of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and staff leaders of extreme nationalist and militarist organizations will be arrested and dealt with further. All war criminals should be subjected to strict trials, including those guilty of cruel treatment of Allied prisoners of war. Freedom of belief will be expressly proclaimed and guaranteed. The desire for individual freedom and democratic progress will be encouraged. All laws or regulations that discriminate against race, nationality, religion, or political beliefs will be abolished. The Committee also instructed that the existing economic foundations of Japan's war machine should be destroyed. Japan is not allowed to produce goods aimed at maintaining military forces or military facilities; Japan cannot engage in any research that is conducive to the development of military forces. Japan will limit its industry to a level that maintains economic living standards and standards, in accordance with the principles of the Committee and the Potsdam Declaration. Its labor, industrial, and agricultural institutions should be based on history and should not be believed to be able to guide Japan's economic efforts. Those who are not conducive to peaceful and democratic purposes will be prohibited by the Supreme Commander from resuming important positions. (2) Plans for the liberation of large industrial and banking conglomerates should be formulated, and other organizations should be substituted on a broader basis of control and ownership. Japan should also supply goods and services to meet the needs of the Allied occupation forces, to the extent that the Supreme Commander deems not to cause famine, widespread disease, and extreme physical suffering. The responsibility of Japanese officials is, first, to avoid severe economic disasters, and second, to ensure the fair and impartial distribution of supplies.

Stipulations for Reparation Materials

(3) Explain the necessary conditions for submitting reparations. (4) Engage in reserves to meet the needs of the Japanese people. Regarding reparations and restitution, the Far Eastern Commission instructed that reparations will be extracted from Japan's existing funds and equipment, and from existing and future production in Japan. These reparations will be used to replenish reparation materials in accordance with the principles set by the Far Eastern Commission and the terms of reference of the Commission. The share of each country in the amount of reparations from Japan will be determined on a broad basis. The destruction of materials and lives and the losses suffered by each country requiring reparations as a result of Japan's preparation and implementation of aggression will be taken into account, as well as each country's contribution to the defeat of Japan and the extent and duration of its resistance to Japanese aggression. All property that has been looted, transferred, seized, or compensated with worthless currency must be fully and actively restored. Japan's domestic financial, monetary, and credit policies must be approved by the Supreme Commander. During the occupation period, Japan will be allowed to purchase raw materials from abroad for peaceful purposes and may export goods to pay for approved imports. All imports, exports, foreign trade, and financial transactions will be kept under control. The Commission will formulate policies governing Japan's imports and exports. All commercial organizations of the United Nations member states will be given equal opportunities for trade and commerce with Japan.

Editorial

### Japan's Interim Reparations Should Be Implemented with Priority

General MacArthur's Headquarters in Tokyo informally announced on the 9th of this month that Japan's first batch of reparations goods would soon be distributed to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, India, Burma, and Malaya, and that each country should submit applications immediately. The reparations goods include machine tools, metallurgical machinery from former arsenals, and synthetic rubber equipment, all of which are not needed by Japan's peacetime industry. According to news from Washington, MacArthur announced that the first batch of Japanese reparations goods would be distributed in accordance with the "Interim Reparations Plan," as MacArthur implemented the policy of the Far Eastern Commission. MacArthur has full power to implement this plan and distribute goods to the five countries including China and the Philippines. The allocation rate for this batch of reparations goods is estimated to be 15% for China, 5% each for the Philippines and the Netherlands Indies, and 5% combined for Burma and Malaya, totaling 30% of the entire reparations. This is a rapid measure taken by MacArthur to implement Japan's Interim Reparations Plan, and it is a precursor to the successful decision of the Far Eastern Commission to prioritize reparations. At a time when the entire reparations issue is difficult to resolve, we should express our approval of MacArthur's measure.

Originally, the so-called "reparations" are the obligations of a defeated country to the victorious countries. They have long existed in international law and are seen in international war practices. Regarding Japan's reparations after its defeat, the Potsdam Declaration had already stipulated: "Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those industries which would enable her to re-arm for war." Based on this spirit, the United States announced its initial policy toward Japan in October 1945, stipulating that Japan's reparations for its acts of aggression should be carried out in the following ways: (A) All Japanese property outside the territory permitted to be retained by Japan shall be transferred for reparations in accordance with the instructions of the Allied authorities; (B) All goods or existing capital equipment not necessary for Japan's peaceful economy or the supply of the occupying forces shall be transferred for reparations. As for items looted by Japan, if they can be identified now, they should be returned in full immediately. According to the initial US policy towards Japan, Japanese reparations included three principles: (1) Japan's overseas assets should be completely transferred for reparations as part of the compensation for the victorious countries; (2) Japan's domestic assets, except for the part of industry retained according to the peaceful economic level, should be used for reparations; (3) All items looted by Japan should be returned. If the Allies cooperate seamlessly, the above principles should be unambiguous. The entire Japanese reparations issue would not have been delayed until today without resolution.

The occurrence of doubts is a regret for the Allied countries themselves. First of all, regarding the retention of Japan's peaceful economic level, the United States' two reports and the Far Eastern Commission's retention of Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934 have virtually protected Japan's existing industry, while reducing the proportion of Japan's resources to be used for reparations. Secondly, the Soviet Union dismantled Japanese factory equipment and materials in the Northeast, which the Soviet Union considered "war trophies." Not only did it refuse to return them, but it also did not agree to include them in the reparations already received by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Far Eastern Commission felt that the entire issue was difficult to resolve; while China and the Philippines were in dire need of reparations to compensate for the huge losses during the war. Thus, since May 1946, the Far Eastern Commission gradually approved the temporary retention quota for Japan's twelve industries, which is the so-called "Interim Reparations Plan." In accordance with the Moscow Resolution of December 1945, it stipulated that the United States did not need to seek the consent of the Far Eastern Commission when implementing "emergency" plans, and authorized MacArthur to handle the entire plan. After accepting the instructions from Washington, the Allied Headquarters began to study the dismantling of Japan's military industry and the types of reparations to be made. MacArthur also proposed a compromise plan for the entire reparations this year. According to US reports, the amount of the entire reparations compromise plan is only equivalent to 60% to 65% of the Pauley Plan. The United States can obtain 30% of the reparations, China can obtain 45%, and the Soviet Union can obtain about 10%. However, the Soviet Union's acquisition of Japanese domestic assets does not exceed 2%. Obviously, the Soviet Union opposes this plan, and it holds the veto power of the Far Eastern Commission and can hinder the entire Japanese reparations plan at any time. Can the victorious countries not regret "abandoning" their rights?

China and the Philippines are the countries that suffered the most from the war and are in dire need of a resolution to the reparations issue, and they have no intention of giving up their own rights. Therefore, in April of this year, the Far Eastern Commission weighed the priorities and decided that the interim reparations plan should allocate the initial 30% to China and the Philippines with priority. MacArthur's handling of this priority reparations was flexible and thoughtful. Before implementing this plan, he allocated 92 Japanese warships to China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union by drawing lots, and the first batch of 32 ships was successfully completed on June 28. Immediately following that, on July 1st, he announced that 30% of the first batch of Japanese reparations goods would be allocated to China and the Philippines. Looking at the situation, if the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have no doubts, it will not be difficult to establish the remaining 70% after this 30% is allocated. Because the differences in the entire reparations issue are now only a matter of principle. The 30% principle is implemented with priority, and the subsequent methods should be very smooth. We agree with MacArthur's measure, and we advocate that China and the Philippines submit applications quickly and distribute reparations as soon as possible, which is based on this principle.

What kind of materials and how much do the 30% priority reparations under the interim reparations plan include? These are issues that deserve attention. According to reports from Tokyo, the 30% priority reparations, calculated by tonnage, is 1.56 million tons. China has half of the priority, totaling 780,000 tons, but it is not yet confirmed. As for the types of materials, they are machine tools and military equipment, which are almost entirely dismantled from Japan's military industry. Originally, these military heavy industries would not be of great benefit to China's construction after they are obtained; but in order to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism, we also agree that this priority reparations can be successfully completed as soon as possible, and at the same time, we hope to exchange this for the resolution of the entire Japanese reparations issue. Now, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Japanese reparations issue is quite silent, but there are many strange voices in Japan. Old Congressman Yukio Ozaki has also recently issued arrogant remarks about the reparations issue. Therefore, it is believed that the Allied Headquarters' control of Japan's policies should not be lenient, and the reparations issue should not be lenient in particular.

As for the disposal of this batch of reparations materials, there are many technical issues, such as dismantling, shipping, warehousing, installation, and distribution. The Reparations Committee of our Executive Yuan should carefully stipulate and propose a detailed plan for the types of reparations materials. It is heard that the government plans to sell the reparations materials that can be operated by private enterprises in advance for a price, instead of adopting direct compensation for public and private losses in various places. This principle is feasible. However, when submitting the plan to MacArthur's headquarters, we must pay attention to the types of materials and many technical issues. After obtaining this priority reparations, we hope that our government will put forward concrete opinions on the entire Japanese reparations issue and the return of materials looted by Japan, and must not lag behind in everything and miss the opportunity!

### The United Nations and World Government

We have just commemorated the second anniversary of the birth of the United Nations Charter. However, according to telegrams from the United States, ten senators have submitted a proposal to the Senate, advocating convening a conference to amend the United Nations Charter and reorganize the United Nations organization, possibly excluding the Soviet Union as a member state. According to the opinion of one of these ten senators, the United Nations organization should be reorganized into a world government, empowered to formulate, interpret, and enforce laws. If the Soviet Union does not cooperate, it should be excluded. We are not surprised by the transmission of this report; however, since the United Nations organization is an international organization, it does not seem possible to change its charter based on the decision of the US Senate, and whether this proposal can become a resolution is still a question. What deserves our attention is that at least some people in the United States have already felt the need to organize a world government. This means that they are preparing to transfer part of the sovereignty of the United States to a strong international organization. We still remember when the San Francisco Conference was convened to draft the United Nations Charter, our Chinese representatives made a call to transfer part of national sovereignty at the conference, but unfortunately, this call is still just an ideal. We certainly hope that the power of the United Nations, this international organization, can be strengthened, but how to strengthen the power of this organization, it seems better to strengthen cooperation with each other under the existing charter, rather than starting with amending the charter. The charter is just a document, and what should be valued is the spirit embodied in this document.

### European Conference Opens Today; Czechoslovakia Changes Its Mind Midway and Refuses to Participate; All Eastern European Countries Under Soviet Control Do Not Attend

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The European Economic Recovery Conference opened on the 12th in the grand dining hall of the French Foreign Ministry, amidst the division between Eastern and Western Europe.

[United Press, Prague, 10th] Czechoslovakia, which had originally decided to accept the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan, suddenly changed its mind today, proving that it could not participate to avoid being misunderstood as opposing the Soviet Union and other European countries. The Czechoslovak cabinet received instructions by telephone and telegram from Prime Minister Gottwald from Moscow, which led to this decision. As a result, none of the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe participated in the Paris Conference, and the situation has almost been determined. Czechoslovak Communist Prime Minister Gottwald met with Soviet Prime Minister Stalin in Moscow last night, and immediately telephoned the news to convene an emergency meeting, which lasted six hours. All parties in the National Front then unanimously agreed to withdraw the original proposal. They immediately notified the embassies of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, stating that Czechoslovakia's "situation" made it difficult to accept the invitation from Britain and France. According to the French Foreign Ministry's announcement, it has received replies from Poland, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Finland, stating that they declined to participate. The countries that formally replied accepting the invitation included Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. With Czechoslovakia's withdrawal, there are only fourteen countries left.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] US diplomats stated today that Czechoslovakia's announcement of its withdrawal from the Paris Conference was "the most blatant expression" of Soviet control over Eastern European governments.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 11th Broadcast: According to Czech political circles, the Soviet Union's note to Czechoslovakia to withdraw from the Paris Conference is tantamount to "slapping the Czech Communist Party in the face." The reason is that Czechoslovakia's initial decision to participate in the conference must first obtain the approval of the ten Communist Party cabinet members. However, Czech Communist leaders said that the acceptance of the invitation had been agreed upon by the Soviet Union in advance. Later, after learning that other countries were dissatisfied with Czechoslovakia's attitude, they might revise their attitude accordingly.

[United Press, London, 10th] Moscow Radio broadcasted today that Finland had declined the invitation from Britain and France and decided not to participate in the Paris Conference. Moscow Radio said: "It has been announced in the Finnish capital that the country's government unanimously decided yesterday to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference."

[Reuters, London, 10th] Moscow Radio announced tonight that the Albanian government has refused the invitation to attend the Paris Conference to discuss Marshall's aid to Europe plan.

[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] Senior US officials warned on the evening of the 9th that the European Recovery Conference, which will open in Paris on the 12th, will be the last chance for Europe to ask the United States for assistance. Countries that do not participate at present will have no hope of obtaining economic assistance in the future.

### British Foreign Minister Arrives in Paris by Plane; Will Deliver Opening Speech to European Conference

[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 11th Broadcast: Bevin arrived here by plane tonight and was smiling when he got off the plane. Another message: As a result of Soviet diplomatic pressure, all Eastern European countries have refused to participate in the Marshall European Plan. So far, the Soviet Union has won the first round.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Officials announced that Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the British delegation to Paris tonight to participate in the European Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that efforts will be made to inform the Soviet government about the progress of the Paris Conference. He pointed out that this conference has no political nature, so the door will remain open to the Soviet Union and other European countries, hoping that they will participate at any time. It is expected here that Bevin will emphasize the purely economic nature of this conference in his opening speech to the conference. London also expects that by Monday next week, the proposed cooperation committee and the four subcommittees on food and agriculture, fuel and electricity, steel, and transportation can be established. Bevin will return to London on Monday evening, and Sir Franks will lead the British delegation to participate in the discussion of the specific matters of the conference. Those who accompanied Bevin to Paris included Bathsu, Deputy Under-Secretary of State of the Foreign Office, and economic experts. Bathsu will return to London with Bevin on Monday, and the remaining British representatives who will continue to stay in Paris to participate in the conference include Stevens, Director of the Economics Department of the Foreign Office, Harris, former Economic Counselor of the Embassy in the United States, and experts and advisors from the departments of finance, commerce, food, agriculture, transportation, and fuel.

### European Conference Discusses German Reparations Issue

Chairman of the Allied Reparations Management Council said

[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] Rueff, Chairman of the Allied Reparations Management Council, said today that the German reparations issue should be considered in the Paris Conference discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. The use of industrial equipment in western Germany as reparations would be a powerful contribution to Europe's efforts to restore the classics and is closely related to any plan that the Paris Conference will draft.

### Truman and Experts Discuss US Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] President Truman held a meeting this morning with Edwin Nourse, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and several members to discuss what the United States can do for the issue of European recovery. Afterwards, President Truman met with the press and declined to comment on the countries that refused to accept the invitations from Britain and France. He only said that congressional leaders are scheduled to hold a meeting at the White House next week to discuss the issue of European exiles. The Marshall Secretary of State's plan for aid to Europe and several issues related to Europe will also be discussed. In addition, it has not yet been decided whether I will go to the Brazilian capital to attend the Pan-American Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting tomorrow, at which Secretary of State Marshall will deliver a speech reporting on the United States' plan for economic aid to Europe.

### US Congress Passes Presidential Succession Act

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The House of Representatives passed the Presidential Succession Act on the 10th by a vote of 365 to 11 and sent it to President Truman for approval.

### British and American to Begin Negotiations on Ruhr Coal Production

[Reuters, London, 10th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that Britain has decided to accept the invitation from the US government to send personnel to Washington to discuss the issue of coal production in the Ruhr region with the US government. The British representatives have not yet been announced and are expected to be senior officials and experts from the British authorities in Germany. According to a statement by Deputy Minister Mayhew in the House of Commons on Monday, the British policy of nationalizing the Ruhr coal mines will not change, and the US authorities believe that the ownership of the coal mines in the Soviet-occupied zone should be exercised by a trustee within five years. At the same time, Harriman, the US businessman who had just inspected the Ruhr region, stated that the United States hopes to understand the reasons that hinder the increase in Ruhr coal production. From this point of view, it can be seen that the United States' invitation to Britain to send personnel to the United States for talks is related to the state of disagreement between Britain and the United States on the ownership and economic issues of the Ruhr coal mines.

### Soviet Union Accuses Western Countries of Attempting to Divide Germany

[Associated Press, Geneva, 10th] Zorin, the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia and head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said at a plenary session of the Commission that Western countries are trying to divide Germany, violating the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, and want to prevent Germany from restoring democracy. To know that to deal with German events, if the various issues related to its unification are not resolved, then everything will be difficult to resolve satisfactorily.

### Soviet Union May Take New Actions to Counter the Marshall Plan; East-West Economic Split Seems Inevitable

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union now appears prepared to engage in a fierce battle against the Marshall Plan for European recovery, using political, economic, and propaganda weapons. The division of Europe has become a reality, and the United States and the Soviet Union will conduct several tests of strength. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall began a series of semi-secret meetings today with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and will use his speech at the Harvard University alumni meeting on May 5 as a basis to strengthen the bipartisan foreign policy to deal with the delicate situation in the coming months.

U.S. officials believe that as the Marshall Plan progresses, the Soviet Union will launch a propaganda offensive against each of its components, and instigate Western European communist parties to attack simultaneously. The communist parties in France and Italy will forcefully use political strikes and other destructive means to prevent its passage during discussions, or to prevent its implementation after passage. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also faces various difficulties: (1) The Soviet Union is now clearly in a position to oppose American aid for European recovery. (2) The extent to which the Soviet Union controls the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia is exposed or may be too early. (3) The Soviet Union has made it impossible for countless people to enjoy assistance in restoring their industry and commerce, and the political forces against this situation will inevitably be strong. (4) The Soviet Union has also placed Western European communist parties in a political dilemma. For the French Communist Party, will it adopt Moscow's opposition line or the French government's support line? The choice is difficult and the result may make its situation more difficult, or even lose its power. Diplomats here also speculate that after Czech Communist Prime Minister Gottwald spoke with Stalin, he used extraordinary means to overturn the foreign policy decided by the Czech cabinet. In that case, will Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk remain in office?

### French Civil Servants Brewing a Major Strike

[United Press, Paris, 11th] On the eve of the opening of the Paris Conference, France faces the threat of an unprecedented major strike in history.

Representatives of 1.5 million public utility workers nationwide recently stated that civil servants will launch a full and indefinite strike. They continued to secretly study LeMaire's final solution late into the night of the 10th. Until 4 a.m. on the 11th, the strike committee issued a public statement saying, "The committee has been responsible for studying the government's proposals and has asked all its members to await orders and maintain discipline." The committee will meet again at 2 p.m. and will issue its decision after the meeting. If the strike committee decides to strike, all postal, telegraph, telephone, and radio communications to and from France will be cut off. The French cabinet met from 9 p.m. last night to 1 a.m. this morning, and LeMaire convened another cabinet meeting at 9 a.m. this morning to seek a solution. [United Press, Athens, 10th] Despite the increasing tension in the disturbed areas, the Greek Minister of Public Security recently stated that martial law will not be declared in the city of Athens. Regarding the rumors circulating in Thessaloniki that "international columns" have entered Greek territory and that the Communist Party has formed a new government, the Prime Minister stated that he was unaware of them. Although under intense criticism from all levels of the left wing, the Greek government continued its sweep of Communist conspiracies on the 10th.

### Stalin Breaks Precedent and Receives Czech Prime Minister on the Same Night; Soviet Union Attaches Great Importance to the Visit of Czech Leaders

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Marshal Stalin, after Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk arrived here on the 9th, unusually received them on the same night at the Kremlin and held talks with them. Stalin had never received foreign dignitaries on the same day before, so everyone believes that the Soviet Union now attaches great importance to the visit of the Czech leaders. A lengthy meeting was held at that time, but the content of the conversation is unknown. It is reported that the Czech Prime Minister and his party will continue to hold talks with Soviet leaders today, and it is learned that the economic delegation is drafting a supplementary commercial agreement, hoping that the Soviet Union will provide food and other supplies to the Czech Republic.

### United Nations Organs Become Political Battlegrounds; U.S. and Soviet Blocs Confront Each Other; No Agreements Reached on Major Agenda Items in the Security Council

[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] Representatives of several small countries and United Nations officials here are increasingly fearing that the United States and the Soviet Union are using United Nations organs as arenas for power politics, gradually destroying the United Nations system. Although they have not publicly expressed this view, it is not difficult to find this subconsciousness in the United Nations conference rooms and corridors, that is, both the United States and the Soviet Union are committing the mistake of using the United Nations as a political battlefield. Regarding atomic energy control, universal disarmament, and the Balkan issue, the United States and the Soviet Union seem to be merely performing before a world audience in a posture of guns and knives, without any intention of reaching an agreement. The Balkan issue is approaching a "showdown" stage under the insistence of the United States, which has caused great anxiety among the small countries. The United States stated that it would be difficult for the United States to accept the proposal for a semi-permanent border patrol team in the United Nations if it were weakened, and Soviet representative Gromyko seems to be about to use his veto power against this proposal. If so, it will trigger more intense retaliation from the Western powers. The small countries now believe that the spirit of the United Nations Charter has been repeatedly violated by the United States and the Soviet Union in the four discussions of the Balkan issue in the Security Council. If the great powers continue to use the United Nations as a political battlefield, the United Nations will eventually be crippled.

[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] The Security Council held three meetings today, with the following results:

Soviet Union Opposes Austria's Application for Membership

(1) Regarding the "issue of Austria's application for membership," Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his opposition on the grounds that the Austrian peace treaty had not yet been signed. U.S. representative Johnson indirectly accused the Soviet Union of delaying the Austrian peace treaty. Finally, a vote was taken, and the decision to include Austria's application on the agenda passed with a vote of nine to zero. The Soviet Union and Australia abstained.

Soviet Union Protects Numbers for International Police Force

(2) Regarding the "issue of establishing an international police force," Gromyko continued to refuse to submit the Soviet Union's preliminary estimate of the number of troops for the police force. The United States, Britain, and France had already submitted their estimates last week. The Soviet Union believes that the issue of jurisdiction should be decided in principle first.

(3) No agreement was reached on the "issue of the selection of the administrative director of the Port of Trieste," which was handed over to a three-nation group consisting of Poland, Australia, and Colombia for discussion.

Arabs Demand End to Trusteeship of Holy Land

[United Press, Success Lake, 10th] Saudi Arabia led the Arab countries on the 10th to make a new demand, requesting the United Nations General Assembly to grant Palestine its independence immediately. Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Faquel, has formally requested that this request be included on the agenda of the September General Assembly, demanding that the United Nations "end the mandate of Palestine and recognize it as an independent state." My Country Requests Two Million Tons of Food

### International Food Conference; Qian Tai Speaks

My Country Requests Two Million Tons of Food

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The International Food Conference continued its meeting today. Chinese Ambassador to France Qian Tai delivered a speech, stating that the root cause of the current food shortage is that importing countries must increase production to overcome it. The food that China currently requests is already the minimum limit. Although China still lacks as much as 5.4 million tons of rice and grain in the coming year, we are only requesting 10,000 tons. Although China's own food supply situation is not satisfactory, it is still willing to export soybeans and other vegetable oils to foreign countries to meet the needs of other countries. We urgently need a large amount of fertilizer, especially Taiwan, which needs fertilizer the most, because the local farmers are accustomed to using fertilizer. Our production methods have been destroyed by the war. If they can be reused, we will be able to become self-sufficient.

### Group of American Journalists Fly East from Honolulu

[United Press, Honolulu, 10th] Ten editors of American newspapers and magazines, invited by the Department of the Army, flew to the Far East for inspection today, departing from here for Tokyo.

### Soviet Union Protests U.S. Economic Aid to Austria at Control Council Meeting; Accuses it of Contradicting Allied Agreements

[United Press, Vienna, 10th] Soviet military commissioner in Austria, General Kolasolov, formally read his statement at the Allied Control Council meeting, condemning the United States for attempting to control Austria's internal economy through the conditions of the U.S.-Austria Economic Assistance Agreement. He stated that these conditions contradict Allied agreements, so the Soviet Union insists that they should be cancelled.

[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] The Soviet Union today protested to the Allied Control Council the United States' decision to pay for occupation costs in Austria in U.S. dollars. The U.S. plan is to use U.S. dollars to purchase Austrian currency needed for the U.S. military stationed in Austria. The U.S. State Department pointed out that this move can reduce the burden of occupation before the peace treaty takes effect, and the U.S. dollars obtained by Austria will help its economic recovery. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, London is surprised by the Soviet Union's protest and has not yet understood the reasons for its protest. The U.S. plan has been implemented since July 1st, and the Austrian government welcomes it very much. The Austrian Minister of Interior has also called on the other occupying powers, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to take the same steps. Britain's position is that the British government is very willing to take the same steps, but is unable to do so due to its own financial difficulties.

### "Fake Phoenix, False Dragon" Trial Screening Storm; Barber Locks Down the Grand Theater; Li Lihua and Shi Hui Make Funny Faces; Guests Suffer Innocent Disaster; Perpetrator Taken Away by Officials

[Report from Our Newspaper] "Fake Phoenix, False Dragon," starring Shi Hui and Li Lihua, was recently completed by Wenhua Film Company and had a trial screening at the Grand Theater at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The company had been promoting it for a long time beforehand and had issued many invitations, so despite the hot weather yesterday morning, the number of people attending the screening was exceptionally high, no less than a thousand.

Unexpectedly, as the audience flocked to the theater, the Grand Theater was surrounded by more than 800 members of the city's barber trade union and industry association. All entrances were guarded, and any audience members presenting invitations were blocked from entering. For a time, the audience was baffled, as if they were lost in a fog.

The reason for the barbers' dissatisfaction was that the film's comedic plot depicted Shi Hui, a barber, disguising himself as an overseas Chinese businessman to apply for a marriage advertisement from a widow named Wen Jun. The barbers felt this was satirical and highly inappropriate. They were also very dissatisfied with Shi Hui's use of the Subei dialect to say "Guai Guai" (goody goody) and the scene where he pretended to commit suicide with a razor during the marriage proposal.

### Shanghai Military Service Association Decides: 4 Million Yuan in Settlement Allowance Per Person; Pan Gongzhan Publicly Elected to Continue as Chairman

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Military Service Association held its first meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium. Speaker Pan Gongzhan presided, and more than ten people attended, including Wu Guozhen, Du Yuesheng, Fang Zhi, Zhang Xiaosong, Xu Jiyin, and Wang Xianqing. The following resolutions were made: (1) Chairman Du Yuesheng resigned due to illness, and Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as Chairman. (2) Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xianqing were elected as executive directors. (3) It was decided to hold a regular meeting every three months. (4) Wang Xianqing and Zhang Xiaosong were assigned to draft the detailed rules for the Military Service Association. (5) The Shanghai conscription law was decided to be drafted by the Standing Committee. (6) The plan to establish a factory for the dependents of conscripts in this city was approved in principle. (7) The interim measures for collecting preferential treatment fees from conscripts were decided to be revised.

Crowds Gathered in Front of the Door; Leaflets Distributed

The association had raised several points for correction a week earlier. It had even requested the Bureau of Social Affairs to ban the film's performance, but to no avail. When they learned yesterday morning that the film was officially being screened, they gathered members of the barber trade from all over the city in front of the Grand Theater, vehemently obstructing the screening. At the same time, they distributed a "Respectful Notice to Ladies and Gentlemen of All Circles in This City," listing eight reasons and four articles for opposition.

At that time, the company was caught off guard. Although they tried to explain to the representatives of the workers, they achieved nothing due to the large number of people and their varied opinions. Because some of the barbers were emotional, a student from Guangdong named Miao Guanqing, who was unaware of the situation, insisted on entering the theater and was beaten by several barbers guarding the door. Upon hearing the news, the Xincheng Police Station dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order. When they saw the beating incident, they immediately arrested the perpetrator, Hang Rongkun (34 years old, from Yangzhou, residing at 255 Yuyuan Road).

Wooden Sign Hung Up; Trial Screening Temporarily Suspended

The situation had escalated to an uncontrollable point, and most of the guests who had been invited to watch the screening, fearing disaster, scattered. At the same time, the police, fearing that the situation would escalate, advised the company to temporarily suspend the screening. After discussions between various parties, a wooden sign was hung up stating, "Negotiations Are Not Complete; Trial Screening Temporarily Suspended." The members of the barber trade union, believing that their goal had been achieved, gradually dispersed, by which time it was already past 11:00 a.m.

Advertisements on Billboards; Faces Unrecognizable

While the barbers were obstructing the screening at the Grand Theater, some barbers carried ladders and buckets of paint of various colors and successively smeared all the "Fake Phoenix, False Dragon" advertisements on billboards near the Sin Wah Theater and the Huangpo Road intersection with red, blue, and white paint. The faces of Shi Hui and Li Lihua were smeared with red and white paint, making them completely "unrecognizable." A small turtle was also drawn under the names of the lead actors, Li Lihua and Huang Zuolin.

When the situation was tense in front of the Grand Theater, Shi Hui was also present. After witnessing the deterioration of the situation, he took refuge inside the Carlton Hotel and waited quietly with Li Minghui and others for developments. In the end, he returned dejectedly because "negotiations were not complete."

### Xin Liqin Receives a Strange Letter; The Mystery of the Suicide of an American Actress; Stirring Up the Peking Opera Circle in Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night, the news that "American Actress" Hua Da (pictured) had committed suicide in Suzhou spread widely in the Peking Opera circle in this city, causing much discussion and regret in the backstage areas of various theaters. The details of this incident are quite tortuous and bizarre, and it can be called the most dramatic of the recent suicide cases.

The first person to hear of this news was Xin Liqin, who is currently performing in the role of a female impersonator at the China Grand Theater. Xin Liqin received a letter yesterday morning signed Jin Miaosheng. The letter stated that Hua Da had lost a diamond ring worth 20 to 30 million yuan in Suzhou and, after searching everywhere without success, had swallowed sleeping pills and jumped into a well to commit suicide. A friend in Suzhou had taken care of the funeral arrangements, which cost 30 to 40 million yuan, and she had already been buried for five days. Xin Liqin immediately showed the letter to her friends, causing alarm among people in the Peking Opera circle. After careful analysis by those who were close to Hua Da, it was suddenly discovered that there was clearly something hidden behind this. An examination of the handwriting in the letter, as well as the sequence of events, revealed many contradictions and inconsistencies, and it was determined that the letter was undoubtedly a forgery. There is no one named Jin Miaosheng in the Peking Opera circle; only Jin Miaosheng, the famous Qingyi actress. From this, it can be inferred that the writer of the letter intended to...

After further research, it was discovered that Hua Da had gone to Suzhou on Monday, while the letter received by Xin Liqin was written on Wednesday, mailed on Thursday, and received yesterday morning. Therefore, the letter's claim that she had already been buried for five days was clearly false.

Furthermore, Jin Miaosheng is currently in Beiping and recently remitted 1 million yuan for household expenses, which can serve as proof. Finally, a careful examination of the handwriting revealed that it was no different from Hua Da's own handwriting, which made the matter even more confusing. If the letter was indeed written by Hua Da, then it can be speculated that Hua Da's state of mind when she wrote the letter was either out of dissatisfaction with Jin Miaosheng, resulting in this prank, or for some other purpose. It is said that when Hua Da recently returned to Shanghai after financing a play herself, she said that Jin Miaosheng was "fighting with her" in Qingdao, so she was quite dissatisfied and went to Suzhou in low spirits a few days ago for a short visit.

When the incident first occurred, her mother was extremely anxious. However, after learning that it was a forgery, she was relieved. Therefore, when reporters visited Hua's mother at her residence last night, she finally smiled through her tears and happily saw them off, repeatedly saying, "I'm sorry, thank you for your concern." Hua Da is 22 years old and is of mixed race, hence the name "American Actress." Five years ago, she became a student of Huang Jingbo, a famous amateur actor in this city who was a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, and they agreed to an eight-year "contract." Huang devoted himself to her guidance, and she mastered more than ten famous plays.

### Contracting Project Unfairly Dominated; Father Dies, Son Drowns; Uncle and Nephew Accused of Murder

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xun Henian and Xun Baiji, an uncle and nephew, were accused of murder for financial gain by Liu Liu, a widow, and others at the District Procuratorate yesterday. According to the facts stated in the complaint: Liu Aqing, owner of Liu Qingji (residing at 21 Baoyu Lane, Zhejiang South Road), contracted the rust removal project for the Hefeng Shipyard. In January, due to financial difficulties, Liu invited his friends Xun Henian and Xun Baiji (residing at 22 Gongyi Lane, North Sichuan Road), an uncle and nephew, to participate as the financial backers for the contracting project. Liu Aqing suddenly died of illness in February, and Xun Henian and his nephew took the opportunity to steal and use the important keys and seals of Liu Qingji, changed the name of Liu Qingji to Xun Qingji, and monopolized the business. At the same time, Xun also prevented the Hefeng Shipyard from paying Liu Zhifu, the son of the deceased. Liu Zhifu negotiated with the shipyard's foreman, and Xun arranged for Zhifu to cross the river to the factory on the 27th of last month to collect the money. However, Zhifu went missing after leaving home. Two days later, his body was found floating in the Huangpu River. His mother, Liu Liu, his wife, Qiu, and his sister, Liu Qiaoyun, were deeply saddened and, believing that the Xun uncle and nephew were highly suspicious, jointly filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate.

### Nightclub Patron Arrested; Connected to the Jiang Gongmei Case

[Report from Our Newspaper] A nightclub patron was arrested at the Sin Wah Cabaret on the evening of the 9th. It is reported that his name is Zeng Yueming, a native of Jiangsu, 40 years old, and he is related to the corruption case of Jiang Gongmei, the former commander of the Shanghai Gendarmerie, who has already been executed. During the Japanese occupation of this city, Zeng served as a section member in the puppet police station. After the victory, he was recruited by Jiang Gongmei to serve in an important position. After Jiang was arrested, he fled to Hong Kong. Recently, believing that the Jiang case had come to an end, he secretly returned to this city and frequented various dance halls. He was eventually detected and arrested by the authorities.

### Equal Treatment for Eighteen Private Radio Stations Difficult to Approve

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Council, based on a previous request from the Eighteen Private Radio Stations of the China Free Radio Association for equal treatment with other radio stations, specially forwarded a letter to the Ministry of Communications for review. According to the Ministry of Communications' reply: "The request that each radio station be allowed to use a frequency is difficult to approve because the number of frequencies is limited. If these stations find it difficult to maintain operations because they have to purchase equipment and cannot reduce staff and national taxes by half by taking turns broadcasting on alternate days, they can negotiate among themselves and, with the approval of the Ministry, two stations can be allowed to use the same equipment to broadcast every day, thereby saving money."

### The Mint in Hibernation; The Place Where the Nation's Wealth Was Once Handled; Now as Decayed as a Declining Aristocratic Family

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Mint, which has experienced ten years of vicissitudes, is like a declining aristocratic family, with deserted gates and dilapidated conditions, making people feel a sense of the changing times. More than ten years ago, when the currency system had not yet been reformed and the silver standard was in effect, it was the place where the nation's wealth was handled. Silver dollars and coins were minted from its dozens of machines and circulated among the people. At that time, it had more than six hundred workers, and the sound of machines was constant and intense. However, after currency reform and the issuance of paper money, it declined. After eight years of war, the site was occupied by the enemy, and the melting workshop became a stable. Machines were dismantled and destroyed. When it was recovered after the victory, it was almost unrecognizable. Nevertheless, it still maintained the facade of an aristocratic family. Looking from the Mint Bridge, you can see its surrounding 80-acre site. Walking through the iron gate, there are lawns on both sides, and the three-story building in the Jianghai Customs style in the middle can still make people appreciate its former grandeur.

Guided by Director Lu of the factory, and with several old employees accompanying us to visit the various departments and explain them one by one, it was truly like "an old palace maid talking about Tianbao," making people feel endless emotion.

We walked into the U-shaped workshop. The first room was a weighing room, with dark walls and dusty rooms. There were two scales that could weigh a ton, quietly placed there. In the corner on the left was a ground scale that could originally weigh several tons, but now only a hole remains. On the other side was a warehouse door that had been removed and was already rusted. These warehouse doors were special products from overseas, used in the same way as bank vault doors. When the War of Resistance against Japan began in 1937, they were removed with the intention of being moved inland, but unfortunately, due to lack of time, they were piled up in the warehouse and destroyed. The current warehouse door is still a steel plate door installed by the Japanese, because they had used the Mint as a vehicle and fire warehouse during the occupation.

Forty Furnaces Remaining Four

Entering the melting workshop from the weighing room, one feels a sense of decline. In the center of the room, two ditches about a foot deep were originally for installing gas pipes, but now they are gone. Originally, there were forty furnaces, but only four remain, and they have been repaired to burn diesel fuel. To the left of the melting workshop is the vault, and the vault door has also been dismantled. Inside are more than 300,000 taels of silver ingots, each weighing more than a thousand taels, which were scattered silver received by the Central Bank after the victory when it took over enemy and puppet property, entrusted to the factory to melt into ingots and verify the composition. Across from the vault, turning around the U-shape, is the rolling mill workshop. Originally, there were more than a dozen rolling machines, but only three remain. The machines in the annealing room have all been dismantled. Turning into the boiler room, you can see the iron door tightly locked, and there are still traces of the Japanese words "Duty Room" on the wall. Only two of the three boilers remain burned out.

Tall Grass Surrounding the Water Tower

Outside the boiler room, in an open space, is a tall water tower, which has been riddled with bullet holes from machine guns. It has now been repaired, and the surrounding grass is knee-deep. The water pipes in the swimming pool-like boiler water changing pool have also been removed long ago. On the other side is a tunnel that looks like an air-raid shelter, leading to the workers' bathroom in the middle of the U-shape. Originally, to prevent workers from stealing, the factory required them to go to the bathroom to bathe after a day's work, and their clothes were thoroughly inspected before they were allowed to leave the factory. This tunnel was the road for leaving the factory after bathing. The tunnel is about thirty feet long and was used as an air-raid shelter by the Japanese during the war. Even now, there is still an iron plate blocking the exit on the other side of the tunnel. Most of the other side of the U-shaped workshop is now being used by the Naval Authorities to store discarded torpedoes and other munitions. A small portion is being used by the factory as a material storage warehouse, with four large scales, twelve small scales, and two stamping machines. The stamping machine is the last machine to produce silver coins. It is about six feet tall and shaped like a "slot machine." It sits quietly in the corner. If it had consciousness, recalling the glory of spitting out silver dollars in the past, it would also be sad about its fate.

Making Copper Sheets to Maintain Operations

Such a large factory, destroyed to such an extent, would require an estimated US$3 million to US$4 million to restore it to its original state. It is truly easier said than done, especially since the era of coins has long passed. So we must ask, what is the Central Mint actually doing now? Starting in 1932, the Mint began minting silver dollars. The initial design was a sailboat with three flying birds and a sun below, but very few silver dollars with this design were minted. It was then ordered to remove the birds and sun from the design. After the currency reform, it continued to manufacture subsidiary coins. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, branch factories were established in Wuchang, Chengdu, Guilin, Kunming, and Lanzhou to melt scrap silver and gold. After the victory, the branch factories in various places were closed. The current work of the head factory is still to melt scrap silver and gold for the Central Bank and to melt copper coins for the Enemy Property Administration. At the same time, it uses its remaining machinery and manpower to engage in the side business of manufacturing copper sheets (for use in hot water heater shells, etc.) to maintain the livelihoods of more than one hundred employees.

Minting Coins All Rumors

Recently, there have been rumors that the Central Mint has begun to manufacture coins for the government, but this is completely false. The reason for this may be that the Central Bank, in order to clear small bills, had a large number of banknote boxes that it had no place to store and borrowed a factory building from the Mint to build a shed to store them. The shape of these banknote boxes is exactly the same as the wooden boxes that used to hold 5,000 yuan in silver coins. The Central Bank transported the boxes to the Mint in batches, and the rumors spread like wildfire. In any case, although the Mint has experienced ten years of vicissitudes, the government has always maintained its scale and employees. We can foresee that this declining aristocratic family will eventually be revived, although we do not know when that day will come. [Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of Zhongyong Foreign Firm operating in the black market for gold and banknotes and disrupting the financial market, the District Procuratorate summoned the firm's manager, Ess Gardin, and accountant, Qian Mengchu, for interrogation yesterday. The key points of the investigation yesterday were three: (1) Whether Zhongyong Foreign Firm engaged in banking activities. (2) Whether the firm's receipts and payments were denominated in legal tender after the National Government promulgated the Economic Emergency Measures Plan on February 17. (3) How much U.S. dollars did the firm pay out and receive after the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan? According to Ess Gardin, the firm has three managers who are jointly responsible, and he cannot bear this responsibility alone. The court found that the accounts needed to be further reviewed and ordered the defendant to remain on bail and rescheduled the hearing.

### Oil Rationing Based on Population Canceled

Edible Oil and Coal Briquettes Exclusively Rationed to Factory Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, President Zhang of the Central Bank convened relevant agencies at his private residence to discuss general rationing issues in this city. It was decided to cancel oil rationing based on population and instead exclusively ration it to factory workers at two catties per person per month, at a price of 4,500 yuan per catty. At the same time, coal briquettes will be rationed to workers. The Fuel Control Committee will provide sawdust to the Bureau of Social Affairs, which will then distribute it to the coal briquette factories to manufacture coal briquettes and distribute them to workers at one dan (about 100 pounds) per month. The price has not yet been determined, but it should be cheaper than the market price. The distribution method is the same as for rice rationing. All factory workers who have applied for and been approved for rice rationing are entitled to oil and coal briquette rationing.

### Qiu Lianhuan Murder Case; Fifteen Defendants Recant

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Qiu Lianhuan murder case was first investigated at the District Procuratorate yesterday morning. The suspects arrested one after another, Mao Qingyun, Sheng Shugen, Wei Xiaoyang, Chu Shutang, Chai Liangjiang, Li Desheng, Ye Dongying (nicknamed Hercules), Ma Wenkui (nicknamed August 13), Chen Fugen (nicknamed Little Brother), Fu Qifu (nicknamed Little Afu), Ma Caide, Chen Yonggui, Zhang Ruting (nicknamed Little Aha), Bao Yongfa, and Xiang Yinquan, a total of fifteen people, were brought from the detention center for questioning. In addition, Xue Fuyuan, manager of the Gaoshiman Ballroom, and witnesses Wang Aixiang, wife of Xiang Yinquan, Wu Zhishun, Liu Bingcai, and Zhu Shusheng, teahouse workers at Leyuan Bookstore, a total of five people, were interrogated by Prosecutor Xu Dingkan. The interrogation lasted from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The defendants all denied their previous confessions to the police. However, Xiang Yinquan, Mao Qingyun, Ye Dongying, Sheng Shugen, and Wei Xiaoyang had injuries or bloodstains on their bodies, and the evidence was solid, making them highly suspicious. The court found that the case was complex and required further investigation and ordered that the suspects be returned to custody and the witnesses dismissed.

### Bureau of Social Affairs Calls for Talks with Various Industries to Discuss the Time Limit for Warehouse Receipt Transactions

[Report from Our Newspaper] To formulate measures to restrict warehouse receipt transactions, the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned responsible persons from the edible oil, bean cake, rice, grain, and fuel industries yesterday morning and afternoon for talks. (1) Representatives of the oil industry, Hu Yan, and representatives of the oil merchants and bean cake industry, Zhang Chao, agreed that the term for edible oil warehouse receipts should not exceed ten days, as in the past. Due to the peak trading season for the bean cake industry being from April 15 to September 15 each year, it was agreed that the maximum term for storage receipts should not exceed one month. (2) Representatives of the rice and grain industry, Jiang Chengqing, representatives of the rice merchants, Yang Shifang, and representatives of the miscellaneous grain merchants, Xing Zhigang, stated that all rice transactions are currently spot transactions and there are no warehouse receipts, so there is no way to limit the term. (3) Representatives of the fuel industry stated that the authorities currently hope that this city will have a monthly coal reserve of 200,000 tons and are encouraging the import of white coal, so rashly restricting warehouse receipt transactions will affect the import of fuel. The Bureau of Social Affairs stated that it would consider this.

In addition to free schooling in public schools at all levels, national schools or public schools in various provinces and cities with public funding slots, or private schools without public funding slots but with free slots, should give priority to the children of soldiers. Since the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents have not been repealed, those who have not been demobilized or discharged and hold certificates of direct participation in combat should still be given priority for approval of public funding or free treatment when their children apply for free schooling.

The decision not to rehire the 30 professors was made by the heads of the various departments and the school through consultation, and it was purely an administrative decision of the school and did not involve any political relations. Zhou strongly denied external rumors that the school was under pressure from outside to dismiss the professors.

### Municipal Middle School Enrollment; Examinations to be Held on the Same Day

### The Crowd Can't Pass Five Barriers (Part 2): Fans Irrationally Gamble on the Outcome

Some spectators were very dissatisfied with the actions of the Qunsheng team. During the disputes, they constantly shouted abuse and threats. Miscellaneous objects and debris were thrown at the Qunsheng players. After the match ended, they surrounded the Qunsheng players, preventing them from leaving the field. Some even rushed forward. Fortunately, the Boy Scouts present worked hard to maintain order, and the Xinglian players escorted them away from the field, preventing any accidents. However, they were trapped inside the field for as long as one hour. In all fairness, the bad habits of the Qunsheng players in casually protesting on the spot and disregarding the spirit of sports should be condemned, but the crowd's troublemaking and unreasonable shouts cannot be excused either. At the same time, the different refereeing habits between the two places easily lead to misunderstandings and are inevitably one of the causes of disputes. Speaking of the audience's unreasonable shouting, it is truly absurd. Many fans in Singapore, like those in other places, are not only fans of the sport but also of gambling, either on the outcome of the game or on the number of goals scored. Basketball has never been as risky as football, but this time, with Qunsheng touring Singapore, the team is good, and the gambling fans are invisibly active. In the first match against the mixed team, someone bet 5,000 Singapore dollars (equivalent to more than 50 million National Currency) that Qunsheng would win by more than 18 points. As a result, Qunsheng only won by 13 points, and the gamblers lost heavily. This time, with Qunsheng against Xinglian, it was a close match, and the betting was even more intense, with winnings and losses reaching 50 dollars for each goal scored. As a result, watching the game was like watching horse racing, with constant disputes. Most of those who started the shouts and disturbances were this group of people. The basketball match was held at the Happy World Amusement Park Gymnasium, the best basketball venue in Malaya. It is entirely built with cement tile and has a seating capacity of 10,000. Although I wouldn't dare say that all 10,000 people were shouting and making noise, even if only half of them were, it was still lively enough. Domestic commentators said that Qunsheng would panic when losing or drawing. This is very true. The reason why they lost their composure this time was entirely related to losing. In the past few games, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Cai Wenzhang had also protested on the spot several times, but at that time, they always had the upper hand and knew they would win, so their protests were ineffective and they just laughed it off. This time, the situation was different. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, they were still losing by six points, so when their protests were ineffective, they didn't give up and simply refused to play. But why did Qunsheng lose? This is difficult to explain except for "abnormal performance" and "there is always someone better." Indeed, the individual skills of the Qunsheng players are superb, and they have many offensive tactics, but they lack defensive strength. They are used to five-man offense and five-man defense, attacking quickly but defending slowly. This is not a problem when facing weaker opponents, but it was terrible against Xinglian. That night, Xinglian had many excellent passes to the basket, resulting in clear scores, which is a clear example. In this battle, except for Wen Hua and Jin Zhi, who each scored 14 points, the others were out of form. Ball freak Cai Wenzhang, known for "hanging points," only scored three points and was at a loss. However, having said that, if Qunsheng had not lost so "unilaterally" in the second quarter, the outcome of this game might have been difficult to predict. Take a look at the detailed score table below. First quarter: 12-7, Philippines wins. Second quarter: 3-17, Xing wins. Third quarter: 15-12, Philippines wins. Fourth quarter: 11-10, Philippines wins. Total: 41 to 46, Philippines loses. Qunsheng lost, but there are still two games ahead. Many people are worried that Qunsheng may not play again due to this unpleasant incident, but according to reliable news today, Qunsheng has decided to continue as originally scheduled. The Chinese Sports Promotion Association, which is organizing this tournament, will learn from the past and have the association's president, Wu Zaixing, and Singapore's top basketball coach, Chen Shishui, serve as referees. The final two games will be against the Penang team and the Malaysian Chinese Joint Team. Although they are both very strong teams, if Qunsheng does not perform abnormally, it is believed that they will not lose again and again. In any case, the media is urging both sides not to focus on winning or losing, and especially hoping that the Qunsheng team will play a good game to restore their lost reputation. (June 25th, Central News Agency reporter Cai Baiqing)

### Fluctuations Seen in Chinese Stocks: Northern and Shanghai Cotton Brokers Emerge

Chinese stocks initially appeared lively yesterday, but soon became fatigued. Trading was limited. Xinhuo still showed vitality, and Jingfu and Xinguang also occasionally revealed their strength. Unfortunately, due to tight credit conditions, Yongsha soon reported a decline again, eventually showing signs of loosening. Over-the-counter interest rates remained high. Yongsha still required 3.6 to 4.05, while small stocks opened at 2.25 to 2.7. There was no intention to actively buy, and more brokers from the North and Shanghai emerged. Purchases by securities giants and those from Guangdong were only slight embellishments. In the end, fluctuations were seen. The morning opened with a high trading price due to the previous day's difference in exchange rates at the National Bank. After opening, Yongsha rose from 1120 yuan, sold by numbers 224, 223, and 94 to 10970 yuan. Numbers 177 and 143, although entering, only struggled slightly around 11000 yuan. Numbers 218, 149, 152, and 85 supplied, retreating to 10800 yuan. Numbers 177 and 14 and 231 were still around 11000 yuan, but numbers 218, 117, 153, 94, and 69 were very eager to sell, forcing Yongsha down to a low price of 10620 yuan. Xinhuo also fell below 4350 yuan due to strong sales from numbers 157, 104, and 165. Numbers 89, 163, 154, and 104 took advantage of the low prices to enter, pulling it up slightly. It was not until 11:30 that there was any movement. Xinhuo rose to around 4550 yuan, bought by numbers 23, 232, 84, 104, and 85. Yongsha also strengthened with purchases from numbers 152, 54, 155, 223, 2344, 231, 215, 24, 102, and 116. At 12:15, credit conditions greatly eased, and it once again exceeded 11000 yuan. Jingfu, under the pursuit of the masses, soared to a high price of 189 yuan. The high over-the-counter interest rates and the hype of scattered purchases only accelerated the stock market's turnaround. Numbers 71, 231, 185, and 45 all closed out, and due to the excess of time, they also competed to sell. Yongsha was the first to fall back, and Xinhuo and Xinguang were also dragged down. In the end, Yongsha closed at 10700 yuan, and the spot Yongsha closed at 10300 yuan. After closing, the closing prices for the current delivery of various stocks showed that Xinguang, Xinhuo, Meiya, Dongdian, and Xinhua rose slightly, Yongsha and Huali remained unchanged, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Jingfu fell slightly, Shangwu and Guohuo fell by half a percent, Lianan rose by half a percent, and Yinglun and Cement were flat. The closing prices for the deferred delivery of various stocks showed that Xinguang and Meiya were flat, Yingfu, Xinhuo, and Hua rose, and Yongsha, Yonggong, and Qinxing fell slightly. Except for Shijie, which was still difficult to recover, the other old stocks outside the market showed a slight increase.

### National Bonds Continue to Decline, Foreign Stocks are Mediocre

National bonds continued to decline yesterday, and the process was uneventful. Credit conditions were tight. National Bond C opened at 6700, and Baolong and Room 503 sold out. Although Room 533 entered, it still declined to around 6300 at the close. The total transaction volume was around one million. The result was that Grades A, B, D, and E each fell by a small amount of 200 yuan, and National Bond C fell by another 500 yuan.

Although foreign stocks softened, the process was mediocre and consistent. Although the Guangdong brokers bought, the Northern brokers, securities brokers, and banks slightly sold off. Extra-market stimulation反而助賣告, which instead prompted selling. Yisha fell from an opening of 79500 yuan in the morning to a close of 77500 yuan. The result was that, apart from the steel industry, which fell by half a percent, all other stocks declined slightly.

### Cotton Merchants Negotiate Purchase Issues with the China Trust Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] Cotton Textile Association Chairman Sun Pingsun and member representative Sun Zhizhi visited Zhang Xu, deputy manager of the purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau, at around 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the purchase of imported cotton without import licenses. They stated that members of the association had already paid for part of the imported cotton and that the losses suffered by cotton merchants according to the China Trust Bureau's purchase methods were too great, requesting a flexible solution. Zhang stated that the methods had been determined and could only be followed, but that the purchase was not mandatory. If each cotton merchant was willing to settle the matter, they should provide all the procedures for ordering the imported cotton individually for direct negotiation. If there were indeed difficulties and the purchase methods were not agreeable, they could choose not to coordinate. Liu and others immediately notified all members of the association via a public letter to check the situation and said that those who needed to contact the China Trust Bureau individually should first explain the situation to the association for introduction.

### MacArthur's Headquarters Expresses Agreement to Inspect Japanese Reparations Industries

[Reported by this newspaper] Private factories undertaking Japanese reparations industries had previously requested that technical personnel be sent to Japan first to inspect whether the reparations industrial equipment was suitable. The headquarters then sent a telegram to solicit the opinion of MacArthur's headquarters, which recently replied by telegram, expressing agreement in principle and listing various necessary expenses, requiring the group to bear them themselves. Some other minor issues are still pending clarification by telegram. Relevant industrial groups here will hold a meeting within days to select representatives.

### It is Said that Liang Jun Flew to Beijing Yesterday to Attend the National Economic Conference

Report on the Development of Foreign Cotton Textile Markets Plan

[Reported from this city] The "China Cotton Textile Production and Sales Joint Stock Co., Ltd." jointly organized by Shanghai industrial authorities Xu Wenzhao, Fu Liangjun, etc., has already announced its establishment. More than a hundred manufacturers have joined, and the scale is grand. Xu and Fu traveled to Beijing together on the 2nd of this month and carried detailed plans to visit the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the heads of relevant government agencies to explain that China's cotton textiles are currently sold in Southeast Asia, occupying a large market and earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the government. If Japan's foreign trade is officially opened, the Southeast Asian market will inevitably face fierce competition, directly harming the national economy and indirectly affecting the government's foreign exchange. The plan they drafted was supported by Executive Yuan President Zhang, government leaders Chen Lifu, Zhang Jia'ao, and Shu Yunzhang. It will be submitted for discussion and approval at the National Economic Commission meeting. It is reported that the company received a telegram from the Executive Yuan yesterday, summoning representatives to attend the National Economic Conference to report on the plan for developing foreign cotton textile markets. It is said that the company's Vice Chairman, Mr. Fu Liangjun, flew to Beijing yesterday to attend today's National Economic Commission meeting.

### Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee Discusses the General Situation of Committee Affairs Promotion

[Reported by this newspaper] Chairman Zou Bingwen of the Textile Adjustment Committee met with reporters yesterday and explained in detail the general situation of the committee's affairs promotion, focusing on the most important aspects. The details are recorded as follows: (1) Cotton yarn prices: Since the establishment of the Textile Adjustment Committee, a price negotiation system has been established. The committee discusses and evaluates reasonable prices based on the actual production cost of yarn plus a legitimate profit. At the same time, a flexible pricing system is adopted according to the actual situation. Therefore, the trend of yarn prices in the future is expected to move onto the right track. (2) More than 60,000 bales of cotton supplied to various yarn factories by the Executive Yuan in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months produced about 30,000 pieces of yarn, and it has been decided that the Textile Adjustment Committee will purchase all of them at a price of 6.5 million yuan per piece of 20-count yarn, starting immediately. The Textile Adjustment Committee has signed an overdraft contract of 150 billion yuan with the National Bank yesterday to prepare for the purchase of this batch of cotton yarn. (3) The factories under the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association have provided 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn for joint distribution. 8032 pieces of pre-ordered cotton yarn have been delivered to the China Textile Construction Company for distribution. (4) Since the second quarter's import quota for imported cotton, the government will fully implement the policy of commissioning spinning and weaving. It is estimated that in six months, the government can control 70% of the yarn production of national and private yarn factories. For the remaining 30% of yarn production, the government will impose restrictions by adjusting the cloth policy. Therefore, the government has full confidence in the future of yarn and cloth, ensuring stable development. According to Zou, he was originally an executive member of the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization and should have been stationed in Washington, D.C. all year round. This time, he was summoned back to the country to plan the Textile Adjustment Committee. The Agriculture and Food Organization has scheduled its third annual meeting to be held in Geneva starting on August 23rd of this year. The meeting will last for three weeks before and after, and preparatory meetings are scheduled to begin on August 16th. Therefore, he must fly to the United States immediately to handle the official business of the Agriculture and Food Organization. During his absence, the position of Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be temporarily filled by Vice Chairman Tong Jiling. However, Tong is currently also stranded in Geneva. Before Tong returns to China, the chairman will be temporarily filled by Liu Ying, member of the Textile Adjustment Committee and acting Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### After the Expiration of the Business Tax Deadline, Grain Merchants Request Continued Exemption: Decide to Organize a Petition Group to Appeal to Beijing

[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Merchants Associations of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi and the two municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing held a joint meeting at the Youth Association at 12:00 noon yesterday. Discussions continued on the government's exemption of business tax for grain merchants across the country, which is set to expire at the end of October this year. Representatives from various regions believe that grain merchants suffered heavy losses during the war and that grain is a necessity for the general population. As a result of taxation, the burden on the general poor will increase even more. Based on this, they request that the government continue to exempt them from business tax after the expiration of the deadline. It was decided to organize a petition group of grain merchants from the four provinces and two municipalities, and more than ten people, including Wang Tongsheng and Zhang Chao, were selected as representatives to go to Beijing tonight to petition the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the three ministries of economy, finance, and food. A press conference is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 13th to report the purpose of the petition. Finally, a temporary motion by Wang Tongsheng, a representative from Zhejiang Province, was passed to form a joint association of grain merchants across the country. The grain merchants associations of the four provinces and two municipalities are the natural initiators, and preparations will begin immediately.

Unpolished Rice Slightly Increases

Yesterday, about 4,600 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Retail sales at stores were active, and market transactions were acceptable. The market opened higher in the early morning, but turned sluggish at noon. As a result, japonica and indica rice increased by 120,000 yuan compared to yesterday, but sales were very sluggish, forming a fluctuating situation.

Wheat flour rose first and then fell back, with no significant gains or losses. The situation was slightly tight. Foreign flour rose slightly by 1000-2000 yuan. Bran factories did not open, and the owners were firm, rebounding by 2000 yuan. Soybean oil sales were sluggish, and the market was stable. Yingkou cake customers could not sell, and prices fell by 3000-4000 yuan. Soybean oil merchants were still eager to buy, rising by 3000-5000 yuan. Mung beans continued to be processed in Southeast Asia, rising step by step, increasing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans also followed, rising by 3000-5000 yuan. Broad bean sales were average, and prices were weak. Red sorghum was mediocre, and corn lacked vitality. Raw peanuts fell again by 3000-5000 yuan.

Sesame seeds were scarce and strong, and peas were similar. Wheat was firm, and the market looked tight. Cowpeas were stable. Oil merchants were aggressively buying, and vegetable oil soared by 30,000-40,000 yuan. Soybean oil followed, rising by 10,000 yuan. Clear oil was scarce and increased by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Sesame oil was stable, but raw oil was still being received, falling back by 10,000 yuan, so the situation showed mixed gains and losses.

Two Batches of Foreign Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

[This report] The foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Myanmar was shipped out of Yangon on the 28th of last month by the Changxing and Huimin lines, with more than 12,000 tons of edible rice. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month. In addition, the foreign rice ordered by the bureau from the United States and South America, Brazil, Ecuador, and other places, totaling about 100,000 tons, is expected to be fully shipped to China before the end of August this year.

A batch of Japanese artificial silk, the amount of which is unknown, which was obtained through barter trade with Japan, may also be shipped to Shanghai within the month.

### Export Cargo Water Insurance Premiums and Freight Charges Can Be Settled First and Then Audited After the Fact

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the start of its work, the Non-Import Cargo Foreign Exchange Application Review Committee of the Central Bank has reviewed more than 300 self-funded student applications and more than 30 cases of merchants' export water insurance travel expenses, etc. After preliminary review by the committee, they will be transferred to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee of the Executive Yuan within days to be submitted to the committee's regular meeting next Thursday for final approval.

[Another report] It is reported that to reduce the difficulties for merchants and meet practical needs, for merchants' export water insurance premiums and export freight charges, each designated bank may settle and sell foreign exchange based on the No. 72 circular issued by the Business Bureau of the National Bank, based on the exporter's documents, and then report to the committee for post-event review. The committee will submit the report to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee of the Executive Yuan for filing. The above measures have been approved by President Zhang of the National Bank and notified to the designated banks to comply with.

### China Farmers Bank Sets Deadline for Returning 1946 Tea Merchant Deposits; Green Tea Expected to Dominate This Year's Tea Production

The China Farmers Bank's 1946 tea leaf deposits have been successively maturing this month. However, most tea merchants have yet to return the deposited tea, with a total of 17 billion yuan in deposits still outstanding. The Central Trust of China (CTC) has now been ordered to purchase new tea and provide merchants with legitimate profits. Therefore, the bank is setting a deadline for tea merchants to sell their deposited tea to the CTC to repay their deposits.

Furthermore, according to the bank's负责人 (responsible person): Since the CTC was ordered to announce the purchase of tea leaves, tea merchants have been more enthusiastic about producing tea. To date, 2,000 cases of tea for this year have been shipped to Shanghai. After evaluation by the bank, the quality of this batch of cased tea is considered to be better than in previous years, with no old tea mixed in. This proves that with a sales outlet for tea leaves, tea merchants can also improve the quality of their tea production, thereby expanding exports. In addition, black tea collection is complete, with only some green tea remaining. It is expected that green tea production will exceed black tea this year.

Export Tea Demand Exceeds Supply

Yesterday, in the foreign firms' tea market, there was continued demand for "Chou Chen," "Chen Mei," and other green teas destined for Morocco, Africa. However, after Yongxing and Tongfu foreign firms, as well as Wuchang and other tea companies, sought these varieties, market inventories have gradually dwindled. Furthermore, holders are becoming more insistent on higher prices, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply, hindering transactions and driving prices upward. As for various domestic sales teas, the selling trend remains strong, particularly with "Mao" black tea, where demand from Fengjing, Jiashan, and surrounding areas is increasingly urgent. Prices are exceptionally favorable, and the outlook continues to be bullish.

### Sugar Prices Rise Uniformly

Yesterday, sugar prices from Taiwan Sugar Corporation have fully increased, native sugar varieties including Qing (blue), Chi (red), and Bai (white) followed suit. The public association board shows that the current price of Peruvian raw sugar is 725,000 to 720,000 yuan, the initial price for current 20 medium-grain white sugar was 700,000 yuan, but it immediately fell back to 695,000 yuan and 680,000 yuan. 24 coarse white sugar is 780,000 yuan. Half-car white sugar is 695,000 yuan to 690,000 yuan. Taiwan red sugar is 630,000 yuan. Shantou "Qing" (blue) high-quality goods are 480,000 yuan, and lower quality is 465,000 yuan.

### Revised Handling Procedures for Goods Arrived in Shanghai But Not Permitted to Enter; Deadline for Transshipment Overseas or Abandonment

[This Paper Report] The Jianghai Customs has recently issued Public Notice No. 139 to establish new handling procedures for import goods not permitted to enter the country. The notice states that since the implementation of the provisional import and export trade regulations on March 1 of last year, the revised provisional import and export trade regulations on November 17 of last year, and the government's restrictions on the import of certain designated goods, there have been instances where goods arriving in Shanghai were not permitted to enter the country due to the inability to present an import license or a violation of government import restrictions. The announcement said that such goods not allowed to be imported may be allowed to be transferred abroad if there is no violation of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, but many declarants do not immediately arrange for transfer, resulting in a large backlog of unresolved cases.

It is now stipulated that all previously accumulated goods not permitted to be imported should be transferred to customs warehouses immediately, or abandoned and handed over to the customs for disposal. Otherwise, they should be transferred abroad within forty days from the date of this announcement. Subsequently, if goods not permitted to be imported are encountered, they should be transferred to customs warehouses, or abandoned, or the consignee or their agent should transfer the goods abroad within forty days from the date of receiving the customs notice that the goods cannot be imported according to regulations. If the goods are declared abandoned, all warehouse storage fees should still be paid by the declarant. If the declarant does not earnestly comply with the above regulations, the customs will not accept any new declarations submitted by the declarant, regardless of the goods being declared, until the accumulated cases have been completely processed.

Ships Traveling to Hong Kong and Macau Must First Declare and Pay Taxes

(2) The Customs Lanlu Office will be renamed the Jianghai Customs Lanlu Branch Office from July 10th of this year.

### Rayon Remains Firm

Rayon prices strengthened again yesterday due to dwindling inventories. The opening price for 120-count Takayama glossy rayon was 30.7 million yuan, but most buyers were in a wait-and-see mode and showed little interest, causing the price to fall quickly. By the midday close, the price had retreated to 30.2 million yuan. The afternoon price for deferred transactions was shouted up by 200,000 yuan, but the final price remained at 30.4 million yuan. 150-count glossy rayon had fewer buyers, and the market price was lower than 120-count glossy rayon, indicating that times and circumstances have changed.

Factory-spun yarns remain steadfast due to demand exceeding supply and sluggish actual sales. The traded price for C-grade yarns opened at 33.5 million yuan. There were small lots of higher grade yarns trading at 2.5 million and 700,000 yuan respectively.

### Coarse Yarn Market Showing Signs of Weakness

In the cotton yarn market, prices declined slightly at the opening yesterday morning due to weaker demand. However, as the market closed, some buyers were seen snapping up lower prices, and merchants from the Yangtze River region were also actively purchasing, especially 20-count yarns. As a result, 20-count Special Shuangma yarn rose to 12.5 million yuan, and Shuangma yarn rose to 11.5 million yuan, both increasing by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Brands such as Lanfeng, Tiannv, and Zhong also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming Tiannv Hongfeng also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, 32-count Lanfeng Yinyue fine yarn declined by 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, and 42-count yarn remained stable.

Spinning and Construction Allocation Yarn

[This Paper Report] China Textile Construction Company yesterday followed its usual procedure to handle the joint allocation of yarn by the Spinning and Negotiation Council. Private yarn factories provided cotton yarn for joint distribution, participating in the allocation for the first time yesterday. A total of 1,633 pieces of yarn were allocated, all to the reproduction industry, with a total of 389 application forms.

Regarding the procedures for obtaining purchase permits and paying for exchange of warehouse receipts, for yarn allocated by China Textile Construction Company, the purchase permit is still obtained on the afternoon of the opening of goods, payment is made the next day, and the warehouse receipt is exchanged four days later. For yarn allocated by private factories, the purchase permit is obtained on the afternoon of the opening of goods, the reservation form is obtained from China Textile Construction Company before 4 pm the next afternoon, and payment is made to the delivery factory's office on the third day to exchange for the warehouse receipt, which is invalid after the deadline.

### Cigarettes Continue to Show Strength

Cigarette transactions were particularly brisk yesterday, and the market continued to be strong. The final price for ten-pack Da Ying cigarettes rose to 8.9 million yuan, an increase of 250,000 yuan from the previous day.

### A Corner of Changchun: Sounds of Battle on All Sides; Setting Sun over the Solitary City Wall

— A Dispatch from Changchun Three Days Ago — By Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

The siege of Changchun for a month is not as tense as imagined from the outside. Currently, Changchun has a strong National Army, capable of not only defending but also launching attacks. The National Army's Advance Corps in the south of Changchun is already relieving the siege of Siping, which serves as strong proof.

However, the recent turbulence in the Northeast is the most intense situation since the National Army took over the Northeast. People in general have suffered a great psychological shock, especially those who came from inside the pass, whose beliefs have been shaken by fear. It is said that many people are fleeing Shenyang. Those with money pack up their belongings at the first sign of trouble and fly south. In Changchun, those who wanted to flee have not had the chance to do so. Seeing this distressing phenomenon, I cannot remain silent.

Over the past month, worry has been weighing on people's minds, and life has been shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. On June 13th, the power line from Xiaofengman to Changchun was destroyed, plunging most of the city into darkness. The limited electricity generated by thermal power plants can only illuminate some important government offices. Without electricity, there is no water, and housewives are racking their brains every day. The water supply has stopped, and the toilets of many large buildings are emitting a nauseating odor. The 600,000 residents are forced to use expensive and unsanitary well water.

The city's streetcars have also stopped running due to the power outage. Changchun does not have buses, making "travel" a major problem for this only affordable means of transportation. Several large government offices are located in the suburbs, which are sources of news. Due to the power outage, reporters have had to reduce the number of visits. A round trip by horse-drawn carriage costs 1,000 yuan in circulation notes, or 12,500 yuan in legal tender. Under today's high pressure of life, traveling by horse-drawn carriage is beyond the means of ordinary people. After Changchun was isolated, the China Chang Railway Bureau was idle. The once bustling North Station is now deserted. The Jilin Railway is busy transporting coal from Yingchengzi, and we can still hear the roar of trains.

"Food is the first necessity of the people." Food prices are leading the way in rising, causing widespread panic. In one month, the price of rice has risen from 250 yuan per catty to 350 yuan, sorghum rice from 70 yuan to 120 yuan, and coal from 17,000 yuan to 24,000 yuan, an average increase of one-third. The prices of vegetables and meat have doubled. Other daily necessities have become "daily-rising products," and cigarettes have mastered the art of climbing, increasing in value tenfold.

The repeated rise in prices is due to poor management. Although there is a price evaluation committee, it is not enough to cope with such a difficult situation. A week ago, the newspapers launched a major attack on rice weevils with a certain background. Later, a spokesman for the municipal government came forward to explain, and the newspapers lowered their flags and ceased their attacks. Changchun's food supply relies on assistance from nearby counties. Currently, efforts are being made to seize grain from Nong'an, Dehui, Jiutai, and other places. The existing grain reserves are sufficient for the military and civilians to eat for several months. The problem now is not "grain shortage" but "grain price."

Changchun can be said to have undergone a wartime examination. I remember that the most tense day was May 18th. In the early morning, we heard dense artillery fire from the planes. Most people believed that it was a live ammunition drill by the National Army. When a state of emergency was announced in the afternoon, tourists in Zhongshan Park were rushed out. Only young couples felt the tension. The Communist army once rushed into the urban area and engaged in a fierce battle. Entertainment venues maintained a calm attitude. On the 26th, when citizens were mobilized to build the city walls, movies were stopped. In front of a "New China" theater, soldiers were busy piling up sandbags and erecting barbed wire, while inside, "Du Yan Liu Xiang" was playing, and the Hollywood leg dance was very popular. Now, movies are allowed to be shown again, and cinemas are showing major love films, using self-generated electricity advertisements to attract business.

The construction of the city walls has been repeatedly delayed because the original plan was to cope with an emergency. Later, as the situation eased, the fortifications were strengthened. From May 26th to June 16th, the work lasted for 20 days, mobilizing a cumulative total of 500,000 people, completing the outer trench works of 25 kilometers around the city, greatly consolidating Changchun's defenses. Before the blockade line was lifted, more than 2,000 refugees who had fled from Songbei lived in empty houses in the suburbs. They could not retreat, nor could they advance. How miserable are these displaced people, lost and without a home! The Communist Party's policy of "the poor turning over" has produced many old, weak, orphaned, and impoverished refugees, adorning a corner of the Northeast's beautiful mountains and rivers!

Director Xiong Shihui once convened a meeting of party, government, and military cadres in Changchun to give instructions. This figure, known for not meeting with journalists, was surrounded by reporters. He explained that the National Army was in the process of deployment. Sun Liren came to Changchun three times, tasked with sitting in Changchun. Sun attached great importance to the defense of Changchun, saying, "Changchun is as important as Shenyang." He spent a lot of time inspecting the city's fortifications with senior generals of the New First Army, instructing on defense measures. Jiang Jingguo and Wang Shuming came to Changchun as special envoys of the Chairman to inquire about the situation of generals at all levels in the Northeast. The coming and going of these figures shows the importance of Changchun's position.

Competition is the mother of resentment. We often hear friends in the news industry say that the newspapers in Changchun are either the Party's trumpets or the military's trumpets. The opinions are not worth taking, and the editing and reporting are not strong. They are too insignificant to be mentioned. In fact, it is true that there are no opposition party newspapers in Changchun, but it is unfounded to say that there are no private newspapers. "Guomin Gongbao," "Gongshang Bao," "Zhengda Bao," and others are all private, and their opinions are known to be free. Although these three newspapers have all ceased publication due to economic problems, they have indeed fought for the cause of private newspapers. In the turbulent Northeast, running a newspaper is a real challenge. The only eight daily newspapers remaining in Changchun are also in a precarious state, especially since the siege of Changchun, the situation has become even more difficult, with the possibility of an early demise at any time. Even though there are Party newspapers and military newspapers, their opinions are still relatively moderate. At a time when the Northeast issue is so turbulent, the opinions of all newspapers are relatively cautious. No newspaper is willing to lower its face and openly accuse the Soviet artillery regiment of participating in the Battle of Siping. In fact, the Soviet weapons and captured Soviet explosives (with photos) discovered by the military are ironclad proof of Soviet interference in China's internal affairs. We should say a fair word for the newspaper industry in Changchun. In this dangerous situation, it takes a spirit of perseverance to support a newspaper. Now, the daily newspaper has been reduced from a full sheet to a quarter sheet, and it is struggling desperately. With the advent of summer, evening newspapers are springing up like mushrooms, showing a vigorous trend. There are five evening newspapers in total: "Songhua River," "Xin Sheng," "Min Bao," "Xin Shenghuo," "Jintian Evening News," etc. However, these evening newspapers are weak infants with poor congenital and postnatal care. How many storms can they withstand? I hope that they will grow stronger with the passage of time!

The Communist Army's 8th Brigade once destroyed a section of the Hailong-Meihekou railway. After being intercepted by the National Army's guards, they fled in a panic, abandoning as many as twelve boxes of Soviet explosives. (By our reporter Zhao Zhan) (Photo by Shi Wanli)

Gun stalls are everywhere,

allowing people to choose and buy weapons. Nanning is the largest transit station. As for where these arms are being sold, one can see it from the above.

After the outbreak of the war in Vietnam, the impact on Nanning was substantial. The freedom-seeking "Ong Ti" (Annamese for "teacher") suffered a defeat and brought stacks of altar paper (French banknotes) across the Zhennanguan Pass to Nanning to recruit troops. A lieutenant in the army would instantly be a major general or division commander there — even if the division had fewer than a hundred soldiers. The heroes of Marseille, who only knew how to dance and drink, could not endure the hardships of war. They favored those able-bodied young men from the three regions of southern Guangxi and made large numbers of promises of French francs,

recruiting forces

to fight for them, a truly miraculous event. Although the government has repeatedly forbidden it, the lure of profit is strong, and many are still willing to take the money of others to fight other people's wars.

The only suffering came to the Vietnamese overseas Chinese, who migrated in droves to Guangxi's border regions. Those with money could act like millionaires in Nanning, while those without money had nothing to eat. A Vietnamese overseas Chinese street was built in Pingxiang County, housing more than 400 overseas Chinese, but more than 300 of them had nothing to eat and relied solely on government relief to survive. At the same time, Vietnam, because of the war, had become impoverished after the overseas Chinese businesses had been forced to close down. The Annamese goods that had flowed in from Annam in large quantities in the past had disappeared from southern Guangxi. Instead, the rice, cloth, and sundries from the Nanning market flowed back to Annam in large quantities, making merchants and Vietnamese people happy. Now,

on the Guangxi-Vietnam road,

there are armed escort teams of the Viet Minh army protecting goods coming from Nanning for sale in Vietnam, which is also a strange piece of news.

As a result of these complications, Nanning's prices have set the highest record in Guangxi (probably more than one-third higher than in Guilin). Rice prices in nearby counties have soared to as high as 320,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), making the people's livelihood extremely difficult. For example, the salaries of civil servants here are lower than those in Guilin and Liuzhou by no less than one-third, which seems unreasonable.

The

culture and education

here are extremely backward. It was like that a year ago, and it is still the same. Since the National Guilin Normal College moved here, things seem to be a bit better. However, the education community seems to be extremely troubled. Some time ago, a group of students at the Provincial Nanning High School, who had failed their conduct grades and were forced to repeat the grade, publicly beat two teachers to death, causing public outrage among the teachers, who all resigned. The situation has not yet been resolved. In addition, students at two other middle schools fought each other over school buildings, with bamboo sticks, stones, and tiles flying everywhere, injuring many people. It is truly an astonishing and puzzling situation!

The constant rain is depressing, and there is nothing to do. The only things to enjoy in Nanning are the watermelons, which cost 300 yuan per catty, and the lychees, which cost 1,500 yuan per catty.

### The Most Economical Air Engine (Part 1)

— Cheng Yikun

In the early years of the last century, some people considered using the expansive force of air as a prime mover for engines. In 1816, a Scottish engineer named Stirling, based on precise principles, created a model of a hot air engine. Unfortunately, the industrial science and technology of that time were still underdeveloped, making it impossible to build an economically practical engine based on his principles. This was because its efficiency was too low to compete with steam engines. Later, as internal combustion engines using gasoline and diesel oil gradually improved, the hot air engine became obsolete and was forgotten by the engineering community. Even physics textbooks published after 1900 rarely mentioned it again.

In the Philips Physics Laboratory, several scientists realized that in many places, the lack of electricity prevented the use of radio, electric lights, and other electrical machinery. Therefore, they wanted to create a highly efficient engine as a prime mover for generating electricity. As a result, they recalled the long-forgotten hot air engine. Because its principle was quite good, they believed that if it could be manufactured using new methods, its efficiency would be very high, and it would not fail as it had before.

Before World War II, Philips had already begun further research, studying how to create a new air engine. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and German troops invaded the Netherlands. This research and experimentation could only be carried out in extreme secrecy, because if the plan fell into German hands, they would definitely use it as a prime mover for manufacturing weapons. Gasoline and diesel engines are both internal combustion engines, while the hot air engine is an external combustion engine—this is their fundamental difference. The driving force of a gasoline engine is produced by mixing gasoline with air, then igniting it with a spark plug inside the cylinder, creating heat and expansive force. This expansive force then pushes the piston inside the cylinder. After one explosion and combustion is complete, new gasoline and air are added, and the spark is used to ignite it again, continuing the combustion inside the cylinder. The piston is thus pushed continuously, driving the flywheel and generating the driving force. The principle of the diesel engine is essentially the same.

New Prime Mover: Two-Stroke Cycle

The principle of the air engine is completely different from what was described in the previous section. Its combustion does not take place in the cylinder in a series of explosions, but rather burns continuously outside the cylinder. It uses heat, but not the explosive force generated by explosions. Each time it rotates, a fixed amount of hot air (or other gas) is introduced into the cylinder, going through four different steps—heating and expansion, cooling, compression, etc.—to complete one cycle. However, it is different from a typical four-stroke internal combustion engine. Because an internal combustion engine only actually generates driving force once every two rotations, the Philips air engine actually generates driving force once every rotation. In other words, it is a two-stroke prime mover.

Any engine that generates power using heat hopes to generate the greatest power with the least amount of heat. The efficiency of the engine is determined accordingly. Currently, among various engines, the diesel engine has the highest efficiency, followed by the gasoline engine, and the steam engine is the lowest. The efficiency of the Philips air engine falls between the diesel and gasoline engines. As for why various engines are still used everywhere despite their different efficiencies, this is because of different needs and various other conditions in different places.

The Philips air engine is a completely new engine, not an improvement of an old one.

Many people who hear the name "air engine" will definitely think that it is an old-fashioned hot air engine—such as the Stirling engine, the Ericson engine, or other 1800s-style hot air engines that have been improved and manufactured. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, the Philips air engine differs from old-fashioned hot air engines not only in manufacturing but also in theory. Old-fashioned hot air engines use relatively large cylinders and pistons, and the entire machine is very heavy, with a very slow rotational speed. The Philips air engine is very small in size and weight, and its rotational speed is very fast, above three thousand revolutions per minute. Moreover, its force transmission, heat transfer, and the entire machine's manufacturing process are all made using completely new theories and methods. Its efficiency is, in fact, very close to the highest possible efficiency considered in theory.

The maximum pressure inside the cylinders of the Philips air engine is about fifty times the atmospheric pressure, and its maximum temperature is about 650 degrees Celsius. Because its combustion work takes place outside the cylinder, the cylinder and the combustion work are completely isolated. The heat and pressure inside the cylinder are roughly the same as in an internal combustion engine, so there is no danger of explosion due to excessive heat or pressure. Its cylinder is made of a special alloy with extremely high heat resistance, which can withstand extremely high pressure and heat. Its other components, such as the boiler, cooler, and regulator, are all specially made, so the heat transfer work is extremely efficient.

Most Important Mechanism: Heat Regenerator

The most important component on the air engine is the heat regenerator, which is specifically designed to save the heat required by the entire machine. It is located on top of the cylinder (see the first circle in the lower picture). The side closest to the cylinder is an isolation plate (made of extremely fine alloy wire, looking like a pile of very loose cotton). Behind the plate is another cylinder, called the cold cylinder, which also has a piston. This piston does not generate driving force, but is connected to the flywheel on the same shaft as the piston that generates the driving force.

When the hot air generated in the boiler is introduced into the cylinder, it is compressed and expanded in the cylinder, pushing the piston and then the flywheel, completing the work and generating power. The hot air that has already been used in the cylinder is then absorbed by the heat regenerator and transferred to the cold cylinder. The cold cylinder's piston, driven by the flywheel, forcefully compresses the cooled air. In about one-hundredth of a second, the cold air piston rotates once, raising the temperature of the cooled air from about 100 degrees Celsius to about 650 degrees Celsius. This regenerated hot air is then passed back through the isolation plate and introduced into the power cylinder, where it is used as the heat for generating the driving force.

If there were no heat regenerator, the engine would need to have all heat supplied by the boiler. By using this heat regenerator, the boiler only needs to supply one-quarter of the heat to keep the entire machine working. The other three-quarters of the heat is supplemented by it using waste gas to regenerate heat, greatly saving on the size of the boiler and the fuel constantly required.

### A Quick Look at Nanning

— Nanning Four-Day Airmail Report, Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

Traveling to and from the southern border, entering and exiting disaster areas, and staying briefly in Nanning for two days, I reside in this important border town, carefully experiencing the many changes of the past year, and I always find it both interesting and uninteresting! ...

Nanning, formerly known as Xuanhua, is the first and only rich area in southern Guangxi. Therefore, in the past, officials circulated a soup head song that said, "Gold is in Beiliu, silver is in Xuanhua, it doesn't matter if you don't get a noble county," because these three places were all famous lucrative posts. It was like this in the past, and it is still like this now. After being away from Nanning for many years, I have returned to this land. Not only have the stores that existed in the past not closed, but even the ones that were closed before have now opened and are doing brisk business. Bustling with activity, Guangxi's cities, with the exception of Wuzhou, are comparable. The markets in Guilin and Liuzhou are far behind!

This small city with a population of 130,000 is not necessarily just a business marketplace. Since the war with Vietnam, the situation has become complicated, coupled with the political turmoil of "something is about to happen in the southern fields," the people of Nanning live a tense life.

The bandit problem still seems to be worth noting. According to legend, the "Democratic Allied Army" based in

The Nanning-Guizhou Border Area

The "Democratic Allied Army" in the Shiwandashan Xiaodong Datang has long sought "day and night" to capture Nanning. Although they are still tossing and turning, it is enough to make people shudder. Five gold shops simultaneously received a notice to "raise military funds and jointly promote righteousness." Occasionally, a curfew is issued, and every household closes its doors tightly. It is truly an eventful autumn—in the area where Nanning, Shangsi, and Fangcheng (Guangdong) meet, the "unruly people" who live in dangerous terrain refuse to pay taxes or serve in the military, and instead collect grain and recruit soldiers, which has already become an open secret. They beat up the poor, kill the innocent, and constantly say things like "We are the Southern Route Column, we are the Communist Army." There are about 2,000 of them, gathering in the wilderness. When government troops arrive, they disappear without a trace. When government troops leave, they run rampant everywhere again. A batch recently fled into Lingshan (Guangdong), which is in the territory of Ningheng County, further increasing anxiety. Nurturing problems and allowing them to become a threat, in fact, it is no longer a time to be complacent by avoiding medical treatment.

Recently, a folk song has been circulating in the market, called

The Three Disasters of Nanning

: Counterfeit money, opium, and firearms. The sources of the three are generally interrelated. The abundance of counterfeit money is due to the financial difficulties of the "democratic fighters," so they loudly advocate "freedom of copying," which is beyond doubt. But opium is a sight to behold, at its peak for a time, almost every day cars and boats coming down from Baise (a small city in western Guangxi, a thoroughfare to Yunnan and Guizhou) are carrying it. The rampant momentum has made the anti-smuggling personnel overwhelmed. Open the hatches of the boats, there are two or three hundred catties. Open the car engines, there are also one or two hundred catties. Dig into the ceilings of hotels, and there are also one or two dans. A few days ago, a general ship was sealed off for carrying a large amount of opium to Yong. The state of lawlessness has made this place the greatest paradise for adventurers. It is said that transporting drugs from western Guangxi to Hong Kong and Guangdong, if you don't reveal your plans, a single turnover will yield four to ten times the profit, and about ten or eight dans pass through the ears and eyes of the military and police every day in various ways. A lot of trading also happens in Nanning. As for private sales of firearms and private guns, they are mostly the masterpieces of heroes with guns on their waists. In Shangsi County, "arsenals" are everywhere, producing homemade pistols and even fast and slow light machine guns, hand grenades, etc. The quality is still good. A pistol costs about three or four hundred thousand. Every market day, in the market

Spring and Autumn

### Random Chat in England: Visiting Shakespeare's Hometown

— Bang Shuyi

Two days after a Mid-Autumn Festival, we visited Cambridge University, a picturesque spot in Jiangnan, which further enhanced our interest in touring the countryside. We continued our pilgrimage to the hometown of the great English writer Shakespeare, accompanied by teachers Zheng Xiaocang and his sons Rui and Xizhen. In London, we hired Brother Chengxu, who had been living in England for a long time, as our guide, and naturally everything went smoothly on the trip! Speaking of Shakespeare's great name, everyone knows that he is a giant in the British literary world and the ancestor of the world's drama scene. Although he has been dead for more than three hundred years, his thirty-seven immortal masterpieces are like thirty-seven shining stars, forever illuminating the course of progress in the literary and art world. As I was thinking about how I should admire the sage today and what my first impression would be upon entering Shakespeare's former residence... suddenly the train stopped, and I knew we had arrived at Stratford-upon-Avon station. As we exited the station, a representative from the British Council was already there to greet us in a small car. The hotel we had booked was called "William and Mary" in the Old Town of Stratford. The hotel was named after Shakespeare's first name, William, and his mother's name, Mary, which was a very meaningful way to attract guests! The hotel was founded in 1690 and is decorated in a rather elegant style. The dining hall is decorated entirely with swords and animal skins, which the owner designed to highlight the meaning of the antique style. It took our group of five an entire day to visit Shakespeare's historical sites. The following can be recorded:

Shakespeare's House—including New Place and the house of Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway. This house became state property in 1847, and was returned to the original owner in 1857. In this house, you can still see many wooden and stone works from the Elizabethan era.

At the corner of Bridge Street, there is a Quiney House. This house was where Judith Shakespeare, Shakespeare's daughter, and her wine merchant husband lived. But now it has become a tea house. On the other side of the street is Harvard House, a half-timbered building from 1596. This house is named because Katharine Rogers lived in this house in her early years, and she later became the mother of the founder of Harvard University. This house was given to Harvard University by Mr. Edward Morris in 1909 to serve as a gathering place for American tourists.

In the Town Hall, there is a portrait of Shakespeare painted by Wilson.

At the end of Chapel Street is New Place Estate. New Place was originally the largest house in Stratford, built by Sir Hugh Clopton in 1488. Shakespeare bought it in 1547, and he died in this house. After Shakespeare's death, this house went through several disputes, and in 1757, it was torn down by Rev. Francis Gastrell, who lived there.

Next to this house is Nash's House, inherited by Shakespeare's granddaughter. This house has now been converted into the New Place Estate Museum, which includes memorials to Shakespeare's demolition of the house, memorials to Shakespeare's 50th anniversary, and many other interesting local items.

On the cover of New Place, there is a Guild Chapel, rebuilt by Sir Clopton in 1495. Connected to this chapel is a Guild Hall, a half-timbered building. On the upper floor of this building is a Grammar School, where Shakespeare began his education as a child. I researched his historical facts. His father's name was John Shakespear. He was an unknown wool merchant and grain merchant. He himself was not from a scholarly family. After studying in elementary school, he worked hard on his own to create this unprecedentedly great poet saint. I admired his all-encompassing talent, and at the same time, I couldn't help but admire the beautiful Stratford countryside on the silvery River Avon.

From Chapel Street to Old Town, passing through Halps Croft, this old house is said to have belonged to Shakespeare's son-in-law, Dr. John Han. We can see the famous Trinity Church next to the River Avon in the shade of the linden tree.

About a mile west of Stratford, a quiet path leads to Shottery, the cottage of Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway, a beautiful Elizabethan half-timbered farmhouse with a thatched roof. Everything in the room is still in its original state, with very strange beds and many other souvenirs, as well as a very attractive old-fashioned garden.

Impressions of this trip: First, the lovely "Stratford-upon-Avon" is truly a lovely place, but why are there so many poetic antiquities there? Of course, it is because it is the hometown of the great writer Shakespeare. According to our Chinese meaning of "a place with outstanding people," then this clean and slender River Avon is winding and beautiful, flowing quietly, with the charm of a virgin, plus the drooping green willows, brushing the green grassland by the river, the clear waves on the river reflecting the ever-changing white clouds, like children playing in the blue sky! Small sparrows jump from time to time in the shade of the trees and flowers, as if to announce that the bright silver river "Avon" has already put on a light autumn dress, welcoming the poets to wander and chant!

Second, the British are very conservative. At the same time, they do not forget "novelty." Therefore, in the construction plan of the city, while trying to preserve Shakespeare's antiquities, they also designed a brand-new theater, built on the banks of the historically rich Avon River. It is the world-famous Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. It is said that this theater was destroyed by fire in 1926, and was later redesigned and built by Elizabeth Scott as the most modern theater in the UK. It specializes in performing Shakespeare's famous plays. Except for (Titus Andronicus), Sir Frank Benson performed them in this theater. By the time of the annual performance season, people come from Europe and the United States to see the plays! It is conceivable that the famous play was a sensation at the time! In the Shakespeare Memorial, there is also a memorial library with tens of thousands of books. In addition to displaying Shakespeare's portraits, famous works from Shakespeare's era, as well as clips and gloves used by Shakespeare during his lifetime, are also preserved here. In the open space near the Shakespeare Memorial, there is also the Shakespeare Monument. On this trip, the teachers and Brother Rui composed many wonderful works. Because I was accompanied by a poetic friend on this visit, it seemed that I could not be without poetry, so after reading Brother Rui's "Le Mansion is famous for three hundred years, and the charm of this city has been passed down together. The boundless meaning is lingering, and the ancient road is the west wind and the evening smoke," I added a sequel, remembering that it was "The lonely poet hero is here year after year, and the Le Mansion of the ages has been passed down, the Eastern guests fly from thousands of miles away, and chant the smoke of the evening trees in this city." It can be regarded as the mud and claws of a wild goose visiting Shakespeare's hometown from thousands of miles away. Of course, the craftsmanship is not important.

### The Old Taoist

— Li Weichu

It was an warm afternoon in October. At five o'clock, the bell rang for the end of the workday. Dinglingling, it called me to run out of the office. My tired back and waist felt as if it had just been relieved of a heavy burden. I felt so relaxed, so weak, so happy, and also slightly troubled. I walked from Zhonghua Road to Linjiang Road in order to hurry home to the dormitory for dinner. As I turned into Linjiang Road, the supplement page of the newspaper posted on the wall caught my attention. I stopped and stood there to watch for a little while. A voice startled me from behind:

"Miss, give me some money!"

I looked back and saw an old Taoist with snow-white hair and temples. His bright eyes seemed very timid, and his gaze was full of pleading and sincerity. I have always been soft-hearted towards the elderly. Because of this gaze and the white hair, I reached out to open my purse, but just as I opened my purse, I heard him say:

"Miss, give me a few more. I'll cultivate into a man in the next life!"

These words angered me. I thought: Just because I am a woman, I suffer so much pain and endure so much anger in this society. So many troubles and grievances in the office, and yet you, an old Taoist, a cultivator, also look down on women in the same way. - I slammed my purse shut. I don't know where the anger came from, but I blurted out to the poor old man: "Why do you want to cultivate into a man? I don't want to. I just want to be a woman!" I still thought in my heart that if there really is a next life, even if the King of Hell forces me to be a man, I will refuse. I will definitely be a woman. After I said this, I started walking, but I still heard him grumbling:

"It's better to cultivate into a man so you can become an official!" I still couldn't help myself, so I walked and answered him:

"I don't want to be an official. I don't like being an official!"

"Becoming an official means enjoying wealth and fortune!"

I faintly heard him say this, and I was even more angry. Looking back, it was such a kind of gaze, so unbearable, a timid and disappointed gaze! But at this moment, an even hotter emotion occupied me, as if a violent and surging wave had washed away a calm and gentle ripple. I couldn't soften my heart, and at the same time, I thought to myself: You, this old Taoist who cultivates and studies the Tao, are also full of fame and fortune. No wonder those men all want to become officials and get rich... As I thought this, I pouted as if I was angry with someone. By the time I walked into the dining hall, the others at the table had already finished half a bowl. Fortunately, they weren't wolfing it down. Look at the men at the other tables; many dishes had already been wiped clean.

"Hey, you daydreamer, hurry up and report. Why are you distracted? Why are you late?"

### Portrait of Madame Récamier

— David

Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) was born in Paris. His early works were extremely immature. After studying in Rome and Greece, he returned to France and was still unknown. He was recommended to the revolutionary government by Robespierre, a giant of the French Revolution, to create large-scale murals, and he became famous in one fell swoop.

When Napoleon came to power, David was even more favored, so he specialized in singing the praises of the clan and became an authority in the art world at that time.

Until Napoleon's defeat, David was also exiled abroad, hiding in Belgium, continuing to paint, and widely accepting students, founding classicism. Among his most famous disciples were Gros (B. Gros), Ingres (J.A. Ingres), and Delacroix (E. Delacroix).

Representative works include "The Coronation of Napoleon," "Portrait of Madame Récamier," etc. (Liu Shi)

### A Foot of Land, A Foot of Blood 340

— Ye Jingfeng

"Yes..." I understood what Mr. W meant; he probably wanted to say that this part after Changping, I would have to explore and advance on my own. In other words, I would have to hold onto my life, probing step by step, advancing gradually. Here, I could imagine that besides the military deployments on both sides, there were also spies from various factions, local hoodlums, bandits, and all sorts of dangerous activities. It could be said that these dozen or so miles were fraught with thorns and traps at every step. To pass through this area was like traversing a mountain of knives and a forest of arrows; the danger was indescribable. But, the mission was sacred; the mission was greater than everything else, even if it was more dangerous, I would still move forward.

"However," Mr. W hesitated a little, "I still can't be sure whether Miss Yao has already passed through, or is still fighting bitterly with the enemy in the Changping area, or has taken a big detour, taking another road to Zhangbei for safety. It's all impossible to know. It's no wonder she's delayed, perhaps reports are being held up along the way, just like her Tianjin telegram, which was delayed for three days. ...Besides that, Tiger Chen's whereabouts are also hard to pin down - in short, the biggest difficulty is the lack of news; it leaves people with no way to start - we'll just have to wait for a busy and difficult trip."

I decided to entrust all official business in Beijing to Mr. W, to handle or convey on my behalf. In order to ensure smooth information flow, of course, I had to bring "04" and two or three deputies along the way. That French-style portable wireless machine was certainly an important tool. After arriving in Shanxi, we would also rely entirely on it to handle various communication tasks. But ensuring that this priceless tool was not seized or damaged was also one of the major tasks of our trip.

In terms of personnel, besides "04," there was also a couple, the man was called She Erheshang, people called him Erheshang, we called him Du Er, from Cangzhou, in his forties; according to him, he practiced some martial arts when he was a teenager, because it was the late Qing Dynasty, and he really wanted to take the martial arts exam to become a martial arts scholar, pass the martial arts imperial examination, and become a military officer, to bring glory to his family. But after the founding of the Republic of China, he could only change careers, working as a young soldier and groom in the army, and later becoming a cook and doing odd jobs.

His wife was also a native of Cangzhou. To describe her appearance and demeanor simply, she was probably like the fierce Yaksha Sun Erniang in the Water Margin's 108 heroes. Her commonly used weapon was a vajra pestle. This weapon of hers (a rolling pin) was not used for anything else, but specifically to deal with the "old teapot" in her mouth, the cook Du Er. The word "teapot" is equivalent to the southern "bastard."

This virtuous couple also served as cooks at our Changxindian terminal station; the man did the purchasing and cooking, and the woman did the kitchen chores and laundry. Don't look at how rough they are, when we temporarily need them to inquire about rumors, legends, news, etc., they are quite capable of using some cunning tricks. Moreover, both of them can use knives and rob; they are also very accurate with targets. Unfortunately, neither of them had read since childhood, and together they could probably write five characters, three characters being "Du Er He," which was Du's official seal; the other two characters are "Liu Shi"; that was the wife's signature. Because we had many procedures that required signatures, the two of them spent half their lives familiarizing themselves with these four and a half characters. Why only four and a half? Because the character "Liu" had too many strokes, and this fierce Yaksha Mrs. Du, no matter how hard she worked, could not draw it, so she could only use the abbreviated "Liu" character; since it was abbreviated, it could only be counted as half a character.

Hui said playfully, and I told them everything that had happened, which made them laugh.

"Then he really is an unlucky egg, he just happened to run into Miss's anger!" the little fat boy said jokingly.

But I still frowned, helplessly defending:

"In this society, don't you still know our suffering, sorrow, worries, and troubles? You can only not be angry if you are a fool, you can only not care if you are cold-hearted."

Due to my seriousness, the atmosphere at dinner also became heavy.

In the morning of the next day, in the office, when I thought of yesterday's feelings, yesterday's genuineness and lack of cultivation, I couldn't help but laugh, but when I thought of that poor old Taoist, who was hit with the nail by me out of nowhere, how could he know the cause hidden in my heart? That snow-white beard and hair, the decrepit state, the timid, expectant gaze, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of shame and repentance! I blamed myself, I thought why I was so easily angered? I thought why I didn't give him the money before getting angry? I thought that when I suddenly closed the opened bag, my face changed, and angry words came out inexplicably, wasn't it a very sad blow to his heart at that time? Wouldn't that poor heart be deeply disappointed, saddened by an undeserved loss? Thinking like this, I really felt regretful and sad, an indescribable emotion invaded me, in the absence of anything else, I could only pray silently, hoping that I would meet him again somewhere, then I would give him a lot more money, and let me use my heart, my eyes, my attitude, to sincerely express my joy to him. At dusk, everyone rushed to the restaurant, but I wandered alone on that road, waiting, searching, hoping to find the figure with snow-white beard and hair, but on the second day, the third day, the fourth day, until today, I have never met him. And my thoughts of him, until today, cannot be relieved.

Old Taoist! Old Taoist with snow-white beard and hair! Where did you go? In this expensive, difficult city, how are you begging? Where did you go to beg? - I often think to myself: "May your begging fingers always receive the gifts and warmth of kind-hearted people, and never meet someone as rude as me who makes your heart suffer!" I also often pray silently in my heart, as if only in this way can I slightly reduce the unease in my heart.

### ### A Thousand Years of Irish Poetry

— Zhao Jingshen

Irish poetry is much older than the English epic "Beowulf." "A Thousand Years of Irish Poetry," compiled by Miss K. Hoaglan, begins with Amergin, who was born several centuries before Jesus. In early Ireland, the power of official poets was second only to that of emperors. During the rise of Irish culture, even the English King Alfred left his country and bowed down at the feet of the Irish clergy. This king wrote poetry under the pseudonym of the Scottish Highland Gaels.

This anthology of a thousand years of Irish poetry is the first collection of Scottish Highland and Anglo-Irish poets, making a great contribution to world literature. Apart from Greece, Irish poetry is the oldest and purest literature in Europe. Its cultural influences include ice age legends, the Nibelungenlied, and the Australian romance "Gudrunlied." Queen Mab in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" comes from the Irish Maeve; Puck comes from the ancient Irish Puca.

The editor also introduced two major satirical poems, one is the 14th-century "Land of Cockaigne," and the other is the 18th-century "Midnight Court." She specifically stated that Swift, Goldsmith, Wilde, Sheridan, and other writers, who are often considered English, are actually Irish and should have their citizenship returned to them.

This collection of poems includes the Irish underground resistance to English tyranny, as well as desolate poems, and many humorous and joyful poems. There are also drinking songs and prayer songs.

This collection of poems can be called a sea of poetry. The two wings of Icarus soar, scattering in the wind and waves. Romantic love, the passion for land, the desire for freedom, mysteriously united with nature - these are all the voices of the Irish people, expressed in the last poem of this collection.

Miss Hoaglan's preface details the history of Irish poetry, and there is also a timeline of major events.

### ### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

Fang Hui's "Kuilv Sui" records: When Xia Song was guarding Anzhou, Song Xiang's brothers were traveling and studying as commoners. At the banquet, they each composed poems on falling flowers. Song thought they had the talent to assist the government. Zhao Lingzhi's "Hou Qing Lu" also said: "The two Song's poems on falling flowers were very popular at the time. In fact, these poems on falling flowers are just in the style of the late Tang Dynasty, and have not fully shown their strengths. For example, Song Xiang's poem on West Lake, 'Opening up a place where fish and birds forget their feelings, unfolding a vast view of rivers and lakes,' is the best." Xiang's "Yuan Xian Collection" has thirty-six volumes, with brilliant lines of poetry appearing frequently, such as the inscription on the mixed scenery of the pond behind Gaoming Hall: "Frogs are angry and love to call before the rain, swallows often fly against the wind"; observing things in the small garden in late spring: "New bamboo occasionally emerges with withered bamboo, wild flowers idly embrace old vines." These couplets are extremely beautiful and outstanding.

### ### On "Elections"

— Shi Lang

Last year, a so-called popular election of Bao Chiefs was held, which caused many ridiculous scenes at the time; fake election votes were stuffed into the ballot box in large quantities. Two groups were evenly matched, and this even caused a group fight. From the perspective of a newly implemented constitutional government, our people and popular opinion institutions still need to learn and practice hard.

The Chinese people have always been unaccustomed to the rights that people in democratic countries should enjoy. They have always been indifferent to popular elections. Therefore, although the government has delegated the election to the people, most people have not made good use of this basic right.

You see, when Truman drove back to Washington from Virginia on July 6, because the car was driving too fast, the New York Times wrote an article, "Too Fast, Mr. President," criticizing the American president.

In the United States, the exercise of this basic right of the people is extremely common in a democratic country.

And this year's Bao Chief election is again making a fuss about "illegal votes" and "Bao people filing lawsuits," etc. If the British and American countries see this, how can people not feel ashamed to death!

We must make every citizen understand and participate in every activity that people should participate in during the constitutional era. In every district and every Bao, we must make people accustomed to all democratic activities, then, of course, there will be no more evil habits of "illegal voting" in these "popular elections."

### Elizabeth and Mountbatten

— Lei Ying

The future Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth, has already turned twenty-one this year. On the day of her twenty-first birthday, someone predicted that she might get engaged this year, because she was unfortunately born into the royal family and must be of age to be eligible for engagement.

Sure enough, on the ninth of this month, Buckingham Palace finally announced the good news that the King had formally agreed to her engagement to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. Buckingham Palace specially held a grand tea party on the tenth to celebrate the auspicious event. The new couple happily attended, and the wedding ceremony will probably not be far away.

Mountbatten was originally Prince Philip of Greece, the sixth in line to the throne, but this year he resolutely abandoned his nationality and his title, and became a lieutenant in the British Navy. Since he is a soldier, of course he has his own work, but Princess Elizabeth is deeply in love with him, and she always sends him three letters every week. If he happens to be on leave in England, then he is always a frequent visitor to Windsor Castle. Elizabeth's younger sister, the clever sixteen-year-old Princess Margaret, often teases her sister about Philip, but, according to a guest in the royal family, he has never seen Elizabeth get angry because of this teasing.

Elizabeth is an extremely filial daughter, she can almost be said to worship her father - just like King George VI, she does not relax on any small details, likes outdoor sports, and hates people who talk too much; but many people say that her personality is still somewhat like her "Uncle David," that is, the abdicated Emperor Edward VIII, the current Duke of Windsor, who resolutely abandoned his honor for love. They equally like to be close to commoners and hate excessive etiquette and restraint. Philip also giving up the right to inherit the throne naturally etched himself deeper into Elizabeth's heart.

As early as when she was four years old, people were already looking for a future husband for Princess Elizabeth. One British magazine even published a list that year, listing eight promising candidates. For a time, there were rumors that she was going to be engaged to Prince George of Denmark; and it was said that Prince Charles of Belgium, who was twenty-five years older than her, was also very promising. For a while, she was very close to the handsome Marquis of Euston, but the Marquis was soon sent to India and quietly went to work in the Governor's Palace.

Elizabeth and Mountbatten knew each other when they were young. They were originally cousins. As children, they often met at the home of his maternal uncle, Lord Mountbatten (the current Governor-General of India). He left Greece when he was just one year old and lived in his maternal uncle's residence. Later, he studied naval warfare in the UK and graduated from Dartmouth Naval College with the highest honors. He then joined the British Navy. He participated in the landing in Sicily on the battleship "Valiant" and also witnessed the grand ceremony of Japan's surrender in Tokyo Bay. But he only returned to Greece once after growing up, staying for a few weeks. He doesn't speak Greek at all.

Initially, the King and Queen of England were not very satisfied with Mountbatten - mainly because he was Greek. Mountbatten repeatedly requested to obtain British citizenship, but he was unsuccessful twice in a row, and it was not until the third time that he finally got his wish.

But, Elizabeth has come of age this year, and the engagement has finally been announced - hasn't it already been said above that her personality is somewhat similar to that of her rather stubborn "Uncle David"?

### ### The Status of Confucianism

— Ji Ming

After Emperor Shizu of Yuan destroyed the Southern Song Dynasty and unified China, his institutions and systems were based on the best of the Liao, Jin, and Song dynasties, and also incorporated the remnants of the four great Khanates. After establishing his capital in Beijing, he ordered the formulation of these systems, among which the most prominent were the racial hierarchy and the occupational ranking. In the former, the Yuan people divided racial hierarchy into four: first, the Mongols; second, the Semu people; third, the Southern Chinese; and last, the Han Chinese. The Mongols were naturally the masters of the country. The Semu people were from the four great Khanates, that is, the various ethnic groups of Eastern and Near Europe today. The Southern Chinese were the Han Chinese who had long lived in the lands of Liao and Jin, and had been conquered earlier. The Han Chinese were the survivors of the Southern Song Dynasty. The hierarchy of these four was strictly enforced, and they did not assimilate with each other until the fall of the Yuan Dynasty. In the latter, the Yuan people also divided occupational rankings into: first, officials; second, clerks; third, monks; fourth, Taoists; fifth, doctors; sixth, craftsmen; seventh, artisans; eighth, prostitutes; ninth, Confucian scholars; and tenth, beggars. Placing Confucian scholars above beggars and below prostitutes can truly be called the greatest joke in the world. Since the worship of Confucianism by Emperor Wu of Han, Confucian thought has controlled society for thousands of years. Now, to reverse this and violate the order is bound to cause the "Confucian scholars" to rise up and be irreconcilable. However, the fact that this did not happen (as evidenced by Xu Heng and Yu Ji serving the Yuan Dynasty) shows that the influence of Confucianism had reached its limit by the Yuan Dynasty. Although the later Yuan Dynasty was short-lived, its downfall was not due to the belittling of Confucianism. Moreover, Zhu Yuanzhang, Chen Youliang, Zhang Shicheng, and others had even less connection with Confucianism. So, what is a "Confucian scholar"? They are simply opportunists who regard themselves as the ruling class, serving when there is order and retreating when there is chaos.

### ### American Miscellany

Fountain Pen Gas Guns and Others

If you pay attention to small stores in the United States, you can buy countless small things, such as flashlights as small as lipsticks, radios smaller than the palm of your hand, cameras the size of watches, scales no more than five inches long, eight-power binoculars for ninety-five cents, foldable bathtubs, clotheslines that can be attached to the wall, calendars smaller than dominoes, calculators the size of matchboxes, phonograph records printed on paper strips, alarm clocks smaller than matchboxes, electric boats that can be folded and placed in a suitcase (not toys), diamond rings for six dollars each (not fake), pistols for ten dollars each (Lincoln brand), and fountain pen gas guns. Plainclothes detectives all carry this type of fountain pen. Ordinary thugs only notice the guns on the police's waists, but they don't notice the fountain pens in the plainclothes detectives' suit pockets. The gas released is mostly tear gas. The amount of gas released by one pen is probably enough to make twelve thugs cry. The people who use fountain pen gas guns are not limited to the police. Many women active in social settings can also find these things in their handbags. When they encounter unscrupulous men, this fountain pen can become their amulet. There are many shops selling fountain pen gas guns. They advertise in detective magazines such as True Detective Stories, etc. Each pen costs only about ten dollars. Fountain pen-shaped pistols for women are also available, but they are more expensive, about fifty dollars or more. Ordinary Colt No. 3 pistols for women cost only about thirty dollars. In addition, there are typewriter-style tabletop pianos. Press the music score on the typewriter to become the rhythm. There are small elevators for use in small families, which can be installed for several hundred dollars. There are also things that are extremely large and incredibly cheap. There are flying fortresses for one thousand five hundred dollars each. As long as you have the ability to move them away, you can choose from B-17, B-24, B-29. There are aircraft runways that can be rolled up into bedding, which can be bought to replace the cable bridge in Guan County, Sichuan. There are amphibious small airplanes, placed in car store windows for sale. (17)

### ### "Buridan's Donkey"

— Wang Jue

Between 1300 and 1358, there was a popular metaphor in France, which was first spoken by the philosopher Buridan. He said:

Suppose there are two piles of hay placed in front of a donkey, and the volume of the hay is the same. This donkey hesitates between these two piles of hay of the same volume, not knowing which pile to choose to eat first? It wanders left and right, circling until it is dizzy, and as a result, it starves to death alive. This satire was very famous at the time, and everyone talked about "Buridan's Donkey," which became a commonly used term.

Even today, we still often encounter "Buridan's Donkey" type of characters in this world. Even if they don't starve to death because they don't know which to choose by circling left and right, they should crash to death or die miserably because they don't know which to choose by continuing left and right.

The donkey is the representative of clumsiness in the West. They often scold people as Donkey or Ass. This Donkey or Ass has the meaning of idiot and fool in addition to its original meaning. Sometimes Chinese people cannot agree with the donkey's opinion, but they will show off a little cleverness. For example, Sun Quan in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms ridiculed Zhuge Ziyu, who had a long face, by hanging a plaque with the name "Zhuge Ziyu" written on it on his head, and making fun of him in front of Zhuge Ziyu during the banquet. However, his young son, named Ke, borrowed a pen and added the two characters "Zhi Donkey" under his father's name, becoming "Zhuge Ziyu's Donkey." Then his father was no longer the object of ridicule. This naturally won the laughter and praise of the audience. Zhuge Ke's reputation as a child prodigy spread far and wide, and has continued to this day.

But this can only be told as an anecdote or a good story, and it still cannot solve the satire of "Buridan's Donkey" for mankind.

Only poets sometimes tell the truth. Su Dongpo's fourteen short poems sent to his nephew Anjin have two lines that say: "Should laugh at the clumsiness of making a living, spinning around like a millstone." He honestly admitted that for the sake of life, he was spinning around like a donkey in a mill. In fact, this is definitely not just Su Dongpo. Who can truly avoid the predicament of "Buridan's Donkey"?

A book written by a Japanese person said: "The national celebration of a country full of donkeys, that mood, cannot be appreciated by anyone who has not traveled through China from south to north and witnessed the scene of hired mules hurrying along the mountains and rivers."

This seems to be intentionally insulting the Chinese, but in fact, not only Chinese people, but also Japanese people, and even people in all countries in the world, cannot avoid being a donkey.

Mr. Buridan is indeed a prophet, worthy of being a philosopher.

Scientific Essays

### Epiphyllum

— Jia Zuzhang

Last year, on July 26th, at 8:40 PM, two pots of Epiphyllum cultivated by Mr. Chen Jue Wu at 92 Huanghe Road in this city simultaneously bloomed, each with a single flower. The next day, newspapers all reported on it. A reporter from a certain newspaper used quite beautiful language to describe it as follows:

"Under the strong light of electric lamps, between the thick and lush green leaves, two Epiphyllum flowers gradually opened. The stems of the pinkish-purple sepals were as slender as wild lilies, truly deserving to be called 'pink necks.' She lowered her head shyly, but in that instant, she had mustered the courage to slightly raise her pink face and open her blushed petals. The petals were slightly red and purely transparent, very much like peonies, with a tuft of stamens in the center, the color appearing pinkish-yellow, resembling the stamens of lotus flowers."

The shape of the stems and leaves was: "There were three or four hard stems and about twenty leaves. The shape of the leaves was like a cactus, with branching leaves splitting from the pinnate petioles, and new leaves growing on the leaves. The growth process of the Epiphyllum was originally the same as that of the leaves. Even more strangely, the stems of the flowers emerged directly from the edges of the leaves."

Recently, on the afternoon of the Seventh-Seventh Anniversary, at 7:00 PM, an Epiphyllum planted by the Shandong Native Place Association on Ximen Road also bloomed. According to the record, "Its shape is somewhat similar to a white begonia chrysanthemum, especially the receptacle is exactly like a chrysanthemum. The color of the petals is white, the color of the stamens is dark yellow, and the color of the receptacle is slightly lighter than the stamens. It was largest at ten o'clock after opening, about eight inches in diameter; the strangest thing is that the stamens are particularly large, and in the middle of the stamens, there is another hanging flower shape (?). The flower stem is like a lotus seedpod stem, but it is grown on a small wooden frame. The shape of the flower is not peculiar, but the emerald green sepal is strangely lovely."

The aforementioned Epiphyllum cultivated by Mr. Chen Jue Wu also bloomed this year and was publicly exhibited for charity at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road on the evening of the 9th, when many people had already seen the true appearance of the Epiphyllum.

Last September, a Suzhou newspaper recorded the morphology of the Epiphyllum cultivated in the Tan Family Garden in Wujin, which was even more concise: "Two buds grow on the flower stalks at the lower end of the deep green leaves, the stalks are purplish-brown, the flowers are white as jade, the petals are like ribbons, with more than twenty petals, slightly like chrysanthemums, the stamens are slender and soft, with a stem in the middle, like a small flower, shaped like a dragon claw chrysanthemum, standing upright in between, like a leech's tongue stretching out."

Combining the above records, we can roughly conclude that Epiphyllum is a kind of cactus plant. The leaves of cactus plants often degenerate, the stems are fleshy and green, which in botany is called a cladode—a type of modified stem. In the previous text, "The shape of the leaves is like a cactus," "Two buds grow on the flower stalks at the lower end of the deep green leaves," the so-called "leaves" are all mistakes for "branches."

Although the descriptions of the flower's morphology are beautiful, because they do not use common botanical terms such as corolla, pistil, stamen, ovary, anther, etc. to make detailed and analytical descriptions, just like the records of animal and plant morphology in old books, they are too simple and vague. After reading, people cannot get a clear impression, which is a pity.

Editor's Note: Recently, Epiphyllum has bloomed, and the editor specially invited Mr. Jia Zuzhang to write about the Epiphyllum so that further views could be provided. The first part is published here, and there are two more parts, middle and lower, which will be published continuously in one or two days. According to the author, the middle part is written as "An Eyewitness Account of Epiphyllum"; the lower part will make a slight textual research. We hope readers will pay attention.

### "Japanese People"

— Ya Ludi

The Japanese people's fickleness and the prostitute-like behavior of changing allegiances at dawn and dusk have long been known to the world. They are thorough opportunists. In the last war, they suddenly asked Matsuoka to present a folding screen to Stalin, then suddenly fought the Soviet Union at Zhanggufeng, then sent Nomura and Kurusu bustling to the White House, and then suddenly wiped out the American fleet at Pearl Harbor with stealthy movements. From shocking the world for a time to surrendering with bowed heads, it was almost only as long as from the flourishing to the withering of cherry blossoms.

They exhausted their flattery and adulation by offering poems and essays of praise to MacArthur, praising the ways of Western democracies to the skies. All Japanese people know what this is all about, and they agree with this behavior, as it often brings them practical benefits. Now, they are even asking to form an army, casting a flirtatious glance and acting coy for a while. The Japanese people's "acting" has truly reached a state of perfection.

However, the young men in Tokyo are ultimately more straightforward and do not like to put on airs. They despise Americans. When vehicles carrying Americans pass by, they throw stones and shout abuse, forcing the passengers on the vehicles to lower the curtains. Also, when an American is walking down the street, suddenly a Japanese person rushes towards them, stands in front of them without moving, and rolls their eyes at them while blocking their way. The walking American has no choice but to make way and take a detour.

No matter how they wear coats or masks, the Japanese people ultimately cannot change.
