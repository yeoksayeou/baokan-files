[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The seventh session of the Deliberative Council was held on the morning of the 24th. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, attended to report on the general administrative situation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, making him the first youth party minister to participate in administrative reporting. The councilors expressed great concern. A total of 194 councilors attended, chaired by Jiang Yong. After the Secretariat's routine report, Zuo began his report at 9:30 a.m., ending at 10:15 a.m., lasting forty-five minutes. The content avoided the important and emphasized the trivial, which was quite well received. The Secretariat then read five written inquiries, followed by fifteen oral inquiries. Zuo then answered them one by one. The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 12:00. (Zuo's report can be found on page 2)

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The eighth session of the Deliberative Council was held at 3:15 p.m. on the 24th, chaired by Jiang Yong. 197 councilors attended. First, the chairman reported on the proposals, requesting that they be submitted by 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. Then, Deputy Minister Lin Wei of the Ministry of National Defense gave a military report. Lin divided the report into two parts: demobilization and reorganization of the army, and national defense construction, providing detailed analysis. He also gave a detailed report on the current military situation. After the report, councilors raised 43 written and oral inquiries, mostly focusing on the current military situation, military discipline, and conscription issues. Lin gave brief answers. After a 20-minute break at approximately 6:20 p.m., the meeting resumed. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei gave a report. Yu first explained the implementation of the resolutions related to transportation from the previous plenary session of the Deliberative Council. Then, he separately explained the current situation of railway, highway, aviation, telecommunications, and postal service reform. This lasted 27 minutes. Then, written inquiries were conducted, totaling 25. After they were read, it was already 7:40 p.m. The chairman immediately announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled a continuation of the oral inquiries and Minister Yu's answers for 9:00 a.m. on the 25th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to the Deliberative Council's meeting schedule, there will be no break on Sunday morning. The ninth session is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 25th. In addition to Yu Dawei answering councilors' inquiries about the Ministry of Transportation, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua will also give an education report. There will be a recess in the afternoon. At 4:00 p.m., the Executive Yuan will host a tea party, and at 7:00 p.m., the general assembly will host a movie.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Deliberative Council stopped accepting proposals at 8:00 p.m. on the 24th. The Secretariat has now received 450 proposals, with economic and financial proposals being the most numerous.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yang Buping, He Jihong, Zhang Qiyu, Gu Jiegang, Wang Puhan, and more than 70 other councilors submitted an extraordinary motion to the general assembly on the 24th, requesting that Chairman Chiang attend a temporary session to personally hear the councilors' statements. The motion stated: "Each councilor's sincere words are accompanied by tears, but it is a pity that the highest authorities cannot hear them in person, which is of little benefit to national affairs. Therefore, we carefully suggest that the Presidium, in the name of the general assembly, invite Chairman Chiang to attend a temporary general assembly on a scheduled basis, so that each councilor has an opportunity to make a statement, so as to clarify the true situation in various places. We respectfully request a public decision on whether this is appropriate." However, this case was not discussed on the 24th.

### Situation of Communist Army Distribution: 800,000 People Divided into Three Parts; Attempting to Expand Strength Through Guerrilla Warfare

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Deputy Minister of National Defense Lin Wei pointed out during his war report to the Deliberative Council on the afternoon of the 24th that there is currently fierce fighting on the outskirts of Changchun. However, the Communist army's attempt to encircle Taiyuan will likely be abandoned due to food shortages. There is currently no fierce fighting in Shandong Province. The Communist army is unable to seize strongholds and can only attack by opportunity. In northern Shaanxi, there has been little military action recently. Lin explained that the Communist army is attempting to expand its strength through guerrilla warfare. In terms of military distribution, the total number of Communist troops is 812,000. 290,000 are in the Northeast, commanded by Lin Biao, with Jiamusi as the main base. In Shandong, the East China Field Army has 190,000 soldiers, commanded by Chen Yi. The Communist army in Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi has 152,000 soldiers, commanded by Liu Bocheng. The Communist army in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar has 95,800 soldiers, commanded by Nie Rongzhen. The Communist army in northern and northwestern Shanxi has 35,000 soldiers, commanded by He Long. The Communist army in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia has about 50,000 soldiers. These more than 800,000 Communist troops can be roughly divided into three parts: the Northeast Democratic United Army under Lin Biao's command operates independently. The Communist army in Shandong is commanded by Chen Yi. The departments of Nie Rongzhen, Chen Geng, and He Long are commanded by Zhu De. Regarding the current war situation, the Communist army in the Northeast has crossed the Songhua River to invade four times this year, and recently launched a fifth attack, resulting in fierce fighting. In Changchun, 90,000 Communist troops have launched an attack, and fierce fighting is taking place on the outskirts. In Yongji, the Communist army has also dispatched 40,000 troops to invade. In addition, there are 50,000 Communist troops near Meihekou. In the past, the Communist army repeatedly failed to attack strongholds, and now focuses on attacking transportation lines. In the overall war situation in the Northeast, Yongji and Meihekou are used for containment, and the focus is still on the Shenyang line, where there will be fierce fighting. In Shandong, Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng have been unable to communicate since the central section of the Jinpu Railway was opened. The remnants of Chen Yi's troops have now moved into the mountainous areas of central Shandong. There is currently no fierce fighting in Shandong Province. The Communist army is unable to seize strongholds and can only attack by opportunity. In Shanxi and Shaanxi, Nie Rongzhen's troops failed to besiege Shijiazhuang. At the beginning of this month, they sent 40,000 troops to invade eastern Shanxi, attempting to join forces with the Communist army in northern and southern Shanxi to spy on Taiyuan. However, they have likely abandoned their attempt to encircle Taiyuan. After the recovery of Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, a part of the Communist army fled to northwestern Shanxi, but there has been little fighting in that area recently.

In his report, Lin also gave detailed explanations on military administration. Regarding the reorganization of the troops, the reorganization and unified compilation plan formulated by the Military Three-Person Group stipulated that within the first 12 months, 242 divisions would be reorganized into 90 divisions, and in the second phase within 6 months, the 90 divisions would be reduced to 50 divisions. In terms of national defense, from March of last year to July of the same year, in 4 months, 57 armies were reorganized into 57 divisions, and 242 divisions were reduced to 154 divisions. The number of personnel was reduced from 3.9 million to 3 million. However, the Communist army did not reduce its size, but instead expanded as much as possible, constantly attacking the National Army. For safety reasons, the government had to temporarily suspend the reorganization work after July of last year. In January of this year, in order to strengthen the troops and conserve military spending, the authorities reorganized again according to the principle of "strengthening the front and tightening the rear." The number of military personnel was gradually reduced to 2.8 million, and the troops were reduced from 154 divisions to 138 divisions. However, this will not affect the troops. In addition, the Air Force maintains 160,000 people, and the Navy maintains 30,000 people. This is because they are limited by national strength, so they could not be expanded.

Regarding the disposal of demobilized officers and soldiers, Lin cited concrete figures in his report. As of April of this year, 47,480 people have been retained, 10,985 are pending, 46,550 have been transferred to other industries, 194,82 are pending, 65,402 have been retired, and 53,122 are pending. Adjustments to the treatment of officers and soldiers have been made three times since July of last year. The treatment of generals has increased from 150,000 to 500,000, the treatment of lieutenant generals has increased from 110,000 to 450,000, the treatment of privates first class has increased from 10,000 to 25,000, the treatment of privates second class has increased from 8,000 to 20,000, and the treatment of privates third class has increased from 6,000 to 15,000. However, this still cannot keep up with prices, and a fourth adjustment will be made starting in May.

In terms of military construction, the most important measure in the past year was the cancellation of the Military Affairs Commission and its reorganization into the Ministry of National Defense. Military education is also highly valued. In the future, efforts will continue to be made in accordance with the established policy to achieve thorough implementation.

### Proposal to Reform the Monetary System

Submitted to the Deliberative Council by Yin Shuxian and others

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Councilor Yin Shuxian and others submitted a proposal to the general assembly on the 24th regarding the reform of the monetary system. According to Yin, the content of the proposal advocates changing to a gold standard, with a 50% reserve requirement and independent issuance. It also aims to determine the exchange rate with the gold pound and the US dollar. The legal tender will still exist, but it will be changed to subsidiary currency. According to Yin, there are many aspects of this case that need to be studied and discussed, and it cannot be fully disclosed at present.

### Councilors Question Military Affairs; Hoping for an Early End to the War; Proper Placement of Demobilized Officers Should Be Ensured

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] During the military questioning in the afternoon of the 24th, the councilors attached great importance to the current war situation. It was generally believed that the war should end as soon as possible, and some councilors hoped that the authorities would have a clear statement on whether to seek peace or continue the war.

Ma Chengfeng took the floor first, pointing out that two years have passed since the end of the War of Resistance, and a series of mistakes have led to the current situation, which is a tragedy. We have not seen what attitude the government has adopted on the issue of peace or war. It should be made clear whether to pursue peace or continue the war. Otherwise, not only will the public have no clear understanding, but morale will also be affected.

Zhang Deng'ao said: "The people in the Communist-controlled areas hope for peace, but they are afraid of peace talks."

Liu Zhongyi of the Democratic Socialist Party reiterated his appeal, pointing out that the people of the whole country cannot tolerate this situation. We demand peace, but peace is not a one-sided affair. Chen Guangya hoped that the war could end soon and that peace could be achieved, so that we can move from civil war to stability and then to construction. Ju Qianchong of the Youth Party said: Peace is the unanimous demand of the people. He believes that the current military situation should not be attributed to peace talks.

Northern councilor Guan Huai was concerned about the long-term war situation, believing that the authorities should not only focus on Shandong and Shanxi, but also ignore the Northeast. Wang Hansheng hoped that the authorities would not be overly concerned about the international situation, and hoped that they could strengthen the local military force to save the pitiful people of the Northeast from their suffering. Cui Chuiyan, who had just arrived from Changchun, said with tears in his eyes that the "beating-receiving doctrine" adopted by the authorities is unbearable for the people. The main attempt of the Communist army's attack on Changchun is to create a food panic in the Northeast, because the Songhua River basin is the main grain-producing area in the Northeast. In addition, the southern representatives inquired about recent events in Guangdong. He Shifan pointed out that due to the weak strength of the National Army in Guangdong Province, the Communist Party's forces have infiltrated, and this must be prevented.

The issue of military discipline was also a focus of questioning. Some councilors hoped for genuine cooperation between the military and the people. Qian Gonglai was the most vehement in his inquiry, fiercely criticizing the corruption of a certain senior official in the Northeast. Cai Zhisheng reported the reality of the forced occupation of civilian houses and the protection of corruption along the entire Longhai Line. When Qian and others talked about such incidents, their indignation was evident in their words, which moved the listeners.

The councilors expressed sympathy for the demobilized officers, hoping that they could be properly placed so that they would not be let down after having made their greatest efforts during the War of Resistance. More than half of the 25 written inquiries mentioned this issue. During the oral inquiries, Pan Chaoying and others also believed that the crying at a funeral event that recently occurred in the capital was a "wonder," which was truly unfair to the officers and soldiers. In addition, the issues of veterans and the compensation of families of fallen soldiers were also the focus of attention.

The issue of conscription was also raised during the questioning. Cai Zhisheng asked why the conscription quota in Henan was so high, and reported the public sale of recruits. In addition, personnel handling conscription and receiving recruits often deliberately nitpick or delay acceptance, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. The questioning ended at around 6:15 p.m.

Then, Deputy Minister Lin gave a brief reply, stating that he would accept the inquiries raised by the councilors. Those within the scope of the Ministry of National Defense itself would be studied and implemented as much as possible. Those involving other ministries and departments would also be studied and implemented by the government.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Zhang Lan, Zhang Bojun, Han Zhaoquan, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and other five councilors of the Democratic League recently drafted a peace plan and submitted it to the Deliberative Council on the morning of the 24th.

### Jing Taochen Qiutian Assumes Office; Wang Yunwu Personally Handles the Handover; The New Minister States That He Will Only Use Talent

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Chen Qitian went to the Ministry of Economic Affairs at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to assume office. Those who took over at the same time as Chen included the newly appointed Political Vice Minister Zhang Zizhu, Acting Permanent Vice Minister Liu Siying, Chief Secretary Zhu Shilong, and Director of General Affairs Wang Lanseng. Former Minister Wang Yunwu personally went to handle the handover and introduced the new minister to the senior officials of the ministry before Chen's speech. Wang said: "I took over as Minister of Economic Affairs on this day last year, and I am handing over on this day this year, exactly one year." He expressed his gratitude to the colleagues of the ministry for their assistance to him over the past year, and said that his predecessor was a scholar, and the new minister is also a scholar. After introducing Chen, Wang asked the colleagues of the ministry to assist the new minister as they had assisted him. Wang also stated that he was most pleased that he had handled the takeover of enemy and puppet materials in over a thousand units during his year in office without any mistakes. This was all due to the diligent work of his colleagues. He went on to point out that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is an industrial administrative department, and that a foundation has been laid for assisting private factories in recent years, and that many industrial regulations have been completed. However, other plans have not yet been started due to environmental and situational limitations, and he hoped that Minister Chen would continue to carry them out and give his full assistance. In his speech, Chen pointed out that the current economic problems have become extremely serious problems that cannot be completely solved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs alone. He feared that he would be unable to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. He then explained three points: First, he is taking over the ministry as a member of the Youth Party, but the ministry is a national institution, and all personnel in the ministry and its affiliated institutions, regardless of their party affiliation, will be treated equally. He hoped that the current personnel would be assured of their positions. Second, in the future, the authorities will do their best to improve industrial and commercial administration and support private enterprises in order to benefit economic construction. He will follow the established rules and trust experts so that they can be improved at any time, establish a scientific foundation for economic construction, and supply the necessary materials for people's lives. Third, the entire economic problem must first be fully discussed by the National Economic Commission and then finally decided by the National Government Committee. Chen began work immediately after his speech.

### Yu Dawei Reports on Transportation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Yu Dawei's report to the Deliberative Council on the 24th can be divided into two parts: one is the implementation of the transportation-related proposals of the previous Deliberative Council, and the other is the current state of transportation. The former includes the following points: (1) In the railway construction section, there is the Tianlan-Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dushan section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. The Shengkang, Min-Gan, Min-Ao, and Gui-Nan lines will soon be under construction. (2) The implementation of military construction of roads is expected to be completed within three years. Class A national roads can accommodate a total of 150,000 surplus officers and soldiers. This plan is currently being discussed with the Ministry of National Defense. (3) Priority will be given to repairing railways in war-torn areas, with the Nanchang-Jiujiang section mostly completed and expected to be fully repaired by the end of next month. (4) Organize postal and telecommunications operations to improve postal and telecommunications efficiency. (5) Development of civil aviation. (6) Compensation for the support of private shipping companies. (7) The issue of wartime requisition of public and commercial military vehicles has been resolved. (8) The free transportation of refugees is still in progress. Last year, the railways transported 150,000 people, charging 25% of the ticket price. Highways transported 120,000 people, acquiring with 50% of ticket price. (9) The Ministry of Transportation can provide equipment and staff at any time. (10) Regarding the reduction of prices for various state-owned transportation enterprises, transportation can be implemented under subsidy measures, but high prices must be considered for national government expenditures.

Regarding the current state of transportation:

(A) Railways are divided into two parts: inside and outside the customs. Those outside the customs are still satisfactory. Those inside the customs are divided into three regions: North China is a repair region, South China is a renovation region, and Southwest and Northwest are construction regions. The North China section is further divided into three straight lines and three horizontal lines. The restoration of each line is extremely difficult. The South China section is divided into three standards: (1) maintaining military communications, (2) restoring pre-war transportation standards, and (3) exceeding pre-war transportation standards. There are six important trunk lines in the Southwest and Northwest: (1) Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou, (2) Liuzhou to Guiyang, (3) Guiyang to Longchang, (4) Longchang to Chengdu, (5) Chengdu to Tianshui, and (6) Tianshui to Lanzhou. In addition, the Tainan Railway in Taiwan is being taken over.

(B) Highways are divided into three regions: the Southwest is a repair region, the Southeast is a renovation region, and the Northeast is a construction region.

(C) The development of aviation does not depend on the number of aircraft, but on the completeness of ground equipment, such as good warehouses, airports, and repair shops. The ministry cannot help but condemn the plane crash at the end of last year in good conscience. We are currently doing our best to adjust personnel and replenish equipment.

(D) Telecommunications and telegrams, whether military or civilian, have been expedited, and can be delivered to the recipient within about an hour. The postal service has also been improved as much as possible, and airmail is widely used. "Mobile post offices" have also been tested.

### Yu Hung-chun's Financial Report (Continued from Yesterday)

Improving the Tax System

Before the war, the national income mainly came from customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. During the war, direct taxes gradually grew and became the main source of tax revenue. Now, the central tax system consists of four major systems: customs duties, salt tax, direct taxes, and commodity taxes. In recent years, the Ministry of Finance has improved the basic system of each tax according to its nature. The goals are three: (1) simplify the tax system and facilitate merchants and people; (2) cooperate with the economy and maintain production; (3) use tax policies to regulate the distribution of wealth. In the last fiscal year, in order to expand the scope of collection, further improvements were made to the current tax system, which has achieved considerable results in both tax administration and tax revenue. First, in terms of direct taxes, the important goal is to establish a sound and reasonable tax system that takes into account the principles of fairness in taxation and increased tax revenue. Recent measures include: (1) Implementing a categorized and comprehensive income tax system, based on categorized income, and then levying a comprehensive income tax on the total income of each individual that exceeds a certain amount. (2) Implementing a special excess profits tax, which taxes the excess profits of finance, trust, manufacturing, construction, agency, and trading industries. The tax rate ranges from 10% to 60%. (3) Imposing a securities transaction tax on securities transactions made within the exchange, which is withheld and remitted to the national treasury by the original brokers. (4) Due to the revision of the financial revenue and expenditure system law, the business tax was assigned to local authorities. A special business tax is being planned for national businesses, targeting banks, insurance, trusts, exchanges, importers, international and inter-provincial transportation businesses, and state-owned or joint state-private profit-making enterprises. The legislative process has been completed and collection will begin soon. (5) Planning for a one-time property tax, which was decided in the Emergency Restoration Measures Case in February last year. The Ministry has been actively planning in accordance with the original plan, but the collection of property tax is aimed at the wealth of the people across the country. Without a precise property survey and sound household administration as a foundation, it would be difficult to achieve fairness, and there would inevitably be many obstacles in the implementation process. In order to implement the decision carefully, the Ministry believes that thorough consideration must be given during the planning process, and technical difficulties must be resolved. After careful research, four collection methods were proposed and submitted to the government for approval. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan approved the implementation of a national property registration first, and then the taxation based on the registered data, ordered to be handled by the Ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Interior. Relevant agencies were invited to discuss the implementation steps and actively promote it. Recently, in order to cooperate with the economic emergency measures plan, considering that property registration is too slow to solve the urgent need, the method of property tax collection has been re-examined, and a tax collection target has been formulated, using both individuals and objects, first levying a proportional tax once on several important and easily controlled properties (such as land, houses, foreign exchange, etc.), and then levying a progressive tax on the property of individuals and legal entities exceeding a certain limit, in order to comply with the principle of ability to pay. This plan has been submitted to the government and will be implemented after approval.

In terms of customs duties, the government has adjusted them several times last year in order to cooperate with foreign exchange management and the development of trade policy. Initially, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated with the opening of the foreign exchange market, dividing imported goods into three categories: free import, permitted import, and prohibited import, in order to regulate imports. At the same time, it was stipulated that, except for a few items that require special permission, all exports are allowed to be freely converted into foreign exchange to promote exports. Later, due to price reasons, domestic goods could not be sold smoothly, and in August, foreign exchange was re-adjusted to cancel export taxes to encourage exports. After that, due to too many imports and a large trade deficit, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade were revised again in November, and a comprehensive import licensing system was implemented. Domestic production enterprises were given priority for the import of necessary goods or raw materials, as well as other materials with legitimate uses, and non-essential goods were either prohibited or suspended from import. The purpose of repeated adjustments is to restrict imports and encourage exports in order to balance international trade. In total, the total value of imported goods last year was 150.12 billion, and the total value of exports was 41.21 billion, with a trade deficit of 109.9 billion (approximately US$325 million). Although this trade deficit figure is very large, an analysis of imported goods shows that cotton, , gasoline, vehicles, steel machinery , rubber, and paper are the main items, followed by electrical materials, metal ingots, chemical drugs, and leather, which are all urgently needed materials during the restoration period. Since the implementation of the export promotion and comprehensive import licensing system, international trade has been implemented according to the government's economic construction plan, and unnecessary materials have been greatly reduced. Statistics show that as of the end of March this year, the total value of imported goods was more than 797.5 billion, and the total value of exports was more than 275.2 billion. The trade deficit has obviously decreased compared with before the implementation of the comprehensive import licensing system. However, import control is only a temporary expedient. To balance international trade and payments, a strict tariff is the fundamental solution. Regarding this matter, the Ministry has conducted long-term research and preparation, and recently the legislative principles for import and export tariffs have been promulgated as the basis for revision. In the future, import and export tariffs will reduce or exempt taxes on the import of industrial and agricultural equipment, machinery, instruments, tools, accessories, and medical equipment that cannot be manufactured domestically and whose supply is insufficient. For domestic processing of handicrafts and machinery industries, those whose finished products are sold abroad will be given a tax refund on the imported raw materials or semi-finished products. For people's livelihood necessities with insufficient domestic supply, a lighter import tax will be levied or refunded. For imported goods that compete with domestic infant industries that should be protected, a heavier import tax will be levied, and luxury goods will be subject to a prohibitive import tax. As for exports, export tax rates will be exempted or reduced for those that should be encouraged. These principles are also based on the obligations accepted by China at the World Trade Industry Conference to properly set tariffs and put them into practice. In the future, import and export trade can be properly adjusted.

In terms of salt tax, the current edible salt is produced, transported, and sold by the people in accordance with the "Salt Administration Outline" in early 1946, with free sales, free trade, and the government only adjusting production and sales. The current salt tax applies a differential tax rate, which is divided into four levels according to the production cost of each region in the country. In addition, in terms of salt affairs, the following important measures have been taken to cooperate with the economic production policy: (1) Actively organize and start work on the received salt fields and salt factories to make full use of them. (2) Pay attention to the industrialization of production, improve salt areas, and reduce costs. (3) Industrial salt, whether private or state-owned, is completely tax-free, and fishery salt adopts a light tax policy. (4) Accumulated salt along the coast is transported to Japan in exchange for construction materials to develop economic construction.

In terms of commodity tax, in order to comply with the principle of heavy taxation of luxury goods and to meet the needs of economic construction, the commodity tax rates have been adjusted. Among them, the tax rates for luxury goods such as foreign wine, beer, local wine, and local tobacco have been increased by 20% to 40% respectively. At the same time, the Mineral Resources Tax Regulations were formulated, and the tax rate for coal and iron was reduced from 5% to 3% to reduce the burden on national defense industry and daily life, while the tax rate for the main raw materials of porcelain clay, copper, tin, etc., was reduced from 10% to 5%. In addition, the principle of export tax refund is adopted for all export consolidated tax commodities to encourage exports. In order to increase tax revenue last year, seven consolidated taxes were implemented for wheat flour, cement, tea, fur, tin foil and superstitious paper, beverages, and cosmetics. Different tax rates are formulated separately by carefully examining the nature of various commodities and the affordability of consumers, in order to increase treasury revenue and promote the implementation of economic policies.

Financial administration has also been actively rectified in the past year, seeking to cooperate with the work of improving the tax system. The efforts are: (1) Streamlining the organization. Regarding this point, your council has already made a resolution in the last session, requesting the government to earnestly handle it. The Ministry has implemented it according to the plan, and has merged more than 150 tax bureaus and units under its jurisdiction in one year, reducing the number of personnel by 16,965. It is planned to continue the adjustment in the future. (2) Punishing corruption. Regarding the issue of investigating the discipline of tax officials under its jurisdiction, the Ministry has sent inspectors to various regions to conduct regular investigations and examine all corruption and illegal events. Whether it is people's complaints or inspection reports, once verified, they will be strictly investigated. From April last year to the present, more than 300 personnel of subordinate agencies have been dismissed or suspended. (3) Strictly implementing the examination system. In conjunction with the Examination Yuan, a special financial officer examination was held to recruit outstanding young people from all sides to enrich the tax organization. It has been held twice in the past year, and it will be established as a system from now on, and will be selected and supplemented year by year, in the hope of achieving the goal of strictly examining and selecting, improving quality, and reforming personnel. (To be continued)

### Stability Around Changchun and Jilin; Communist Main Force Attacks Siping; Chen Mingren and Liu Donghan Vow to Defend to the Death

[Report from Shenyang by this Newspaper on the 24th] Siping is in critical condition. The Communist troops are approaching the urban area. Fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs three miles away at dusk on the 24th, with continuous artillery fire. Chen Mingren and Liu Donghan jointly telegraphed various leaders in Nanjing and other places, vowing to defend the territory to the death.

[Report from Changchun by this Newspaper on the 24th] The main force of the Communist troops gathered west of the Changchun-Siping section of the China Chang Railway has now split into several routes to harass the area. The general outline of the unpredictable war situation has emerged. The three divisions, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, of the Communist First Column, and a part of the Second Column, have secretly crossed the Dongbian River and are moving south, attempting to attack Siping. More than 4,000 troops of the Communist Independent Second Division were attracted to the vicinity of Shuangyang in the southeast of Changchun by the National Army crossing the Dongliao River northward. Fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs of Shuangyang yesterday. The troops disturbing the outskirts of Changchun are only about 10,000, which is obviously a containment effort. About 4,000 troops in the northwest of Changchun, and about 5,000 troops between Gongzhuling and Fanjia Village on the China Chang Railway, are not worth worrying about. According to authoritative military sources, the Communist troops attacking Siping will definitely suffer a serious blow, and a major battle will unfold near Siping. As for the Communist troops harassing Shuangyang, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. There is no need to worry about the defense of Changchun City. Another telegram: The Dongliao River railway bridge, a vital transportation hub on the China Chang Railway between Siping and Gongzhuling, is still intact according to reliable information, and is being guarded by elite troops of the National Army.

[Report from Shenkai by this Newspaper on the 24th] The outskirts of Changchun and Jilin are stable, Siping is becoming tighter. Most of the Communist troops are approaching Siping from the vicinity of Guojiadian and Wushu. Dozens of Communist troops have also been found south and east of Siping, such as in Bakagou and Jiangshanzizi. It is heard that the Communist troops besieging Siping, in addition to those coming from the south of Gongzhuling, have also transferred five divisions from Changchun South Yitong and Fanjia Village to attempt to take Siping early, and then attack Changchun and Jilin.

[Another Telegram] The Panjian section of the Beining Railway has been open since the 24th. The damaged sections near Suizhong have been repaired.

[Report from Changchun by Central News Agency on the 24th] The air passage here has been reopened today by the landing of several transport aircraft. All supplies no longer need to be delivered by difficult airdrops. Although the reopening of the air passage is not enough to indicate a thorough improvement in the war situation here, the depression of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians for the past ten days has been greatly relieved.

### Fuzhou Press Holds Emergency Meeting to Support Minhai Zheng Bao

### Zhang Qun's Full Report - Continued

In terms of the economy, as a temporary solution, the Economic Emergency Measures Program has yielded considerable results in the three months since its promulgation. However, some parts of this program have not yet been implemented, and others must be supplemented and revised due to changing circumstances. For example, adjustments to the cost of living index for workers and the lifting of rice price controls are both variations from the original plan. Some have criticized this plan or offered other solutions, but any solution, upon careful discussion, has its advantages and disadvantages. The plan itself was never meant to be immutable. Until we find a better solution, we can only adopt this one, supplementing and revising it with the experience gained during its implementation to make it fit the actual needs. Regarding the six essential daily necessities that must be controlled under the original plan, China's rice production has always been insufficient to meet its own needs, and cotton yarn and cloth are even more deficient, requiring imports. Coal production is mainly concentrated in the Northeast and North China; even Guangdong's coal consumption relies on North China. Currently, many of China's coal mines have been destroyed by the Communist Party. If we can conserve usage, we can barely manage. After prohibiting the export of cooking oil and its raw materials, the current supply does not seem to be lacking. As for salt and sugar, there are no problems with either. The above-mentioned six items are all basic necessities of life, and there are reasonable plans and management for their production, transportation, and supply. If domestic production is insufficient, we must seek it from abroad to avoid shortages. However, from another perspective, before the war, China had trade surpluses only during the First World War; otherwise, it consistently had trade deficits. After eight years of war, our industry is dilapidated, and agricultural production has decreased. This year's international balance of payments has a significant deficit. Even including remittances from overseas Chinese on the income side, we can only offset half of the expenditures. This is a very dangerous phenomenon for the nation. To ensure the basic living needs of the people, we must buy foreign rice, foreign wheat, foreign yarn, and foreign cloth. However, if items are not essential for life, we should not waste the nation's foreign exchange. Therefore, the government must restrict imports and provide as much assistance as possible to exports. If there are difficulties in exporting goods, it is best for the government to purchase them, even at a loss. We are currently planning to use this policy to increase exports, which can, on the one hand, compensate for expenditures. Regarding subsidy policies, the original intention was to avoid reducing the stimulus for prices. Currently, opinions on this policy vary, with three main arguments, each with its own justification, which are currently under consideration. However, the various methods mentioned above are still insufficient for the nation's needs. Any promising country or nation that wants to transition from an agricultural nation to an industrial nation, or seeks rapid recovery after a foreign war, must have its entire population tighten their belts, foregoing enjoyment that they could afford, and use it to acquire the means of production from abroad. With this spirit of austerity, they can accumulate surplus wealth and concentrate it on construction. We can find many precedents in modern nations. For us to transform from an agricultural nation to an industrial nation, and to rebuild a new China after the devastation of war, we truly rely on being half as capable as others, but working twice as hard. If our spirit of hard work and thrift cannot achieve the goal of national construction, then the cultivation of this spirit cannot rely solely on laws and regulations. Therefore, in addition to the government working towards this direction, social figures must also jointly create this kind of national awareness and atmosphere to be effective. The Economic Emergency Measures Program is mostly a temporary solution. Even if implemented effectively, it can only alleviate rising prices. To fundamentally improve China's economy and increase production, we must, on the one hand, support private economic enterprises, and on the other hand, welcome foreign investment. Regarding support for private enterprises, the government is now not only providing assistance to existing essential private enterprises but is also selling off state-owned enterprises as much as possible to transform them into private enterprises. Based on the principles of the People's Livelihood and its socialization, we will determine the future direction of handling all economic issues, with state capital as the center, leading the activity of private capital, assigning difficult tasks to state-owned enterprises and assisting private enterprises in easier tasks. In terms of utilizing foreign capital, a country that has been devastated by war and wants to quickly recover and rebuild must welcome foreign investment. Looking at other victorious countries in the world, except for the United States, countries like Britain, the Soviet Union, and France all have to seek assistance from abroad. China was originally poor, and the direct and indirect losses of public and private property during the eight years of war, as listed earlier, are truly shocking. We certainly rely on foreign debt to make up for the overspending in the national budget, but our vast territory needs to immediately begin economic recovery and construction work. The costs required for this work are naturally beyond our existing national financial resources and social capacity. Based on this situation, loans from the United States are of utmost importance. The government will proceed according to the policy direction after the reorganization of the government, that is, foreign debt must be used to stabilize and improve the people's lives and for productive construction. As for the balance of national and local fiscal revenues and expenditures, we must continue to strive based on our belief in self-reliance. As for the entire economic reform issue, our Yuan has drafted a plan, which is being submitted to the National Government for review. How this plan will be implemented in the future is up to the National Economic Commission, which has been established for this purpose. Because regular administrative organizations are divided based on various specialized administrative tasks or technologies, there are seven or eight departments in the various ministries of the Executive Yuan whose duties are related to economic matters. Without an organization to strengthen the connection between these departments, it would be difficult to maintain a consistent pace, which would affect policy implementation. Promoting production and construction requires even more coordination. Therefore, in today's extremely serious economic situation, it is necessary to combine relevant business or technical experts from society with the competent authorities in the government, so that they can gather their wisdom and work together under one organization, a specific policy, and the principle of division of labor and cooperation. Although this organization is proposed by the government, the focus is on social, industrial, and business leaders and specialized economic talents. Without this, it would be difficult to cope with the current serious situation, let alone planned reform. Currently, there are educational problems.

### Educational Problems

During the Anti-Japanese War, the government in the rear areas never slackened on education, but due to wartime financial difficulties, transportation obstacles, incomplete school facilities, and the lack of peace of mind for teachers and students, although the number of schools and students increased during the war, the level of education was actually lower than before the war. This spiritual loss has a more lasting impact than material losses, and there has been no improvement after the end of the war. I have always participated in educational undertakings. After arriving at the Yuan, I invited the presidents, deans, and professors of various schools in the capital to tea parties to listen to the difficulties currently faced by the schools and opinions on improving education, which serve as the basis for the government's educational policies. Unexpectedly, recently in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, some university students have gathered for petitions and demonstrations over issues such as subsidies for public-funded students, food costs, school administration, and the academic system, even seizing vehicles, obstructing traffic, occupying institutions, and hindering public affairs. Many of the frivolous and insulting attitudes are too unbearable to describe. To build a nation, we must first build the people. If the atmosphere among young students continues to deteriorate like this, the talent shortage in China will be even more profound and widespread ten years later. This hidden worry is truly unimaginable. Tracing the root cause, it is a misinterpretation of freedom. Special attention must be paid to this issue in the current constitutional preparation stage. We should exert the spirit of the Constitution as much as possible. Any freedom granted to the people in the Constitution should be granted to the people as early as possible. But on the other hand, the state needs laws, and society needs order. Therefore, the people's spirit of abiding by the law and their sense of responsibility to the country must also increase in proportion to the freedom they enjoy. Only then can freedom and the rule of law complement each other and become a modern democratic country. This kind of character of abiding by laws and discipline, valuing order, and being self-respecting and patriotic should be led by intellectual youths for the general public, spreading from schools to society. If the youths who are currently receiving education in schools do not have a clear understanding and are unrestrained, how can we expect the general public's atmosphere to improve? Therefore, the government must fully protect the freedoms that the people should enjoy, but to maintain social tranquility, it is necessary to take measures to restrict overstepping behavior when absolutely necessary.

Today's youths in school are all future nation-building cadres. The country hopes that they will have profound knowledge and, in particular, hopes that they will have rigorous integrity. Therefore, we must cherish today's youths in school, cultivate their knowledge and virtue, so that they can stand on their own feet and be able to shoulder the mission of nation-building after leaving school. The government, school teachers, and family elders should jointly bear this responsibility.

To strengthen school facilities, stabilize the lives of teachers, and reward and assist private educational undertakings are measures that the government should take. If you, the councilors, have any opinions, please provide guidance. I have been appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan during this difficult time, and I am truly cautious and apprehensive about my abilities. I can only do my best to seek some benefit for national affairs. I don't have any genius, and I won't create miracles. Faced with the current difficult situation, what is the most correct and effective solution? In addition to the government exhausting its efforts, we also need all of you, the councilors, to plan together and provide more guidance! (End)

### Zuo Shunsheng Reports on Agricultural and Forestry Administration

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng's report at the Political Council was mostly factual, without involving plans or policies. Zuo first stated that he had only been in office for nine days, and the previous report had already been made by Minister Zhou Qian, so he would not elaborate further. Zuo then touched on the history and funding of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, stating: Since the establishment of the Ministry seven years ago, there have been a total of six ministers, including himself, which can be said to be frequent personnel changes. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's funding only accounts for five per thousand of the total budget, so from the perspective of personnel and funding, it has not been valued in the administrative system. However, I am not pessimistic. Firstly, because the various matters under the Ministry of Agriculture are related to everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and secondly, the organization of the Ministry has already been established, with a total of seven departments and two committees, as well as various research institutes, etc., waiting to be filled in the future, so there is hope for the future.

Zuo continued: I believe that: Firstly, academic institutions and technical personnel in villages will not be changed. Any faction will value talent and will not favor the Youth Party. Secondly, research work should be strengthened to seek improvement and to establish close contact with specialized talents. Zuo then presented an incomplete statistic stating that there are approximately 15,000 specialized talents in agriculture nationwide, but currently, less than 5,000 are employed in this field. I intend to enable these 10,000 people who do not have opportunities to each find their place and make the best use of their talents, entrusting limited funding to the most reliable people to manage and develop agricultural and forestry undertakings. Thirdly, I hope that people nationwide can understand the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Zuo then presented several examples from the Ministry, hoping that the councilors could visit them: The first is the work of the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Group, which was formed in June 1946, composed of ten American experts and thirteen Chinese experts. After eleven weeks of studying Chinese agriculture and forestry, they returned to Beijing and spent five weeks writing a report based on their findings. The group focused on three objectives: (1) Chinese agricultural and forestry education, (2) Chinese agricultural production and marketing, and (3) the utilization of living water and soil, which are extremely applicable. The second is the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, which is divided into ten departments and carries out work with extremely limited funding, only 1 billion yuan per year. The third is the Agricultural Production Improvement Office, which was established in January of this year. Its working goal for this year is to restore the 52 million mu of cotton fields that existed before the war and produce 12.5 million dan of improved Sino-American cotton seeds, of which 7.28 million dan are for spinning machines. The fourth is the Tobacco Improvement Institute, with a tobacco loan of 15.6 billion yuan and processing of 12.4 billion yuan this year. Most of this funding is provided to Henan for tobacco improvement, and a small portion is provided to Anhui.

### Provincial Orders for Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to Quickly Implement Grain Storage and Price Stabilization, and a Rice-Snatching Riot Occurred Outside Zhenjiang's West Gate Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 24th Dispatch] From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 24th, a rice-snatching riot occurred continuously outside Zhenjiang's West Gate, involving three stores: Yi Ming in Shanxiang Lane, Ying Yu in Xinma Road, and Fu Ming in Zeta Road. The loss of rice was about ten or more dan. The rice snatchers were all common people who lived by the dan and sheng, because the stores deliberately increased the selling price, which aroused public outrage. Fortunately, the military and police arrived to suppress the riot, and the rice-snatching crowd dispersed, restoring order. After the incident, the provincial and county authorities not only dispatched military and police to key locations to maintain order but also held separate meetings to discuss follow-up measures and decided to: (1) Issue a public notice to reassure the people, urging rice merchants to recognize the greater good and not to raise prices. (2) Organize price stabilization sales. (3) Make every effort to dredge the grain supply. (4) Order all rice stores to resume business on the 25th, with the price not to exceed 245,000 yuan per dan. Chairman Wang attached great importance to this and slowly patrolled the entire city for a week in a military vehicle. Also, He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Land and Food Administration, in order to ensure the safety of the people's livelihood, specially ordered the three counties of Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Suzhou to not only allocate a portion of their stored grain but also to quickly implement price stabilization sales of local grain. It is now decided that Zhenjiang will set up one price stabilization sales point in each of the east, south, west, north, and central areas starting from June 1, with each household limited to purchasing three sheng, and the selling price is stipulated to be 3% to 5% lower than the market price.

[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 24th Dispatch] Rice prices have soared in recent days, rising another 60,000 yuan today compared to yesterday, with a price of 382,500 yuan. The county government has telegraphed the Ministry of Food for assistance. Also, the method of selling rice and flour at stabilized prices in this county has been decided to be based on household registration. Applications will be made to the township offices, and then purchases will be made to prevent scalping.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 24th Dispatch] Since the Central Government ordered the restoration of negotiated grain prices and abolished price limits, Suzhou's grain prices have risen from 140,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan in more than 20 days. The Suzhou County government has telegraphed the provincial government to request instructions from the Central Government on future measures.

### Japanese Political Trends

After the Yoshida Cabinet in Japan resigned on the 20th, who would succeed as Prime Minister became the focus of world attention. The House of Representatives and the House of Councillors elected a Prime Minister on the 23rd, and as a result, the leader of the Socialist Party, Katayama, was elected and took office as Prime Minister yesterday. He has begun meeting with the leaders of the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party to discuss the formation of a four-party coalition cabinet. It is expected that the new cabinet will be established within the next week. The future trends of Japanese politics are certainly worthy of our close attention.

Japan's new constitution has been in effect since May 3rd. The newly elected parliament convened on the 20th, and looking at the election of the speaker and the prime minister over the past few days, the political situation has become clearer. The parliament, established under the new constitution, consists of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, with the House of Representatives holding a more important position. The Prime Minister is jointly elected by both houses. The first session of the House of Councillors under the new constitution was held on the 20th, with Matsudaira elected as the President of the House and Socialist Party member Matsudaira Jiichirō elected as Vice President. The House of Representatives convened on the 21st, with Socialist Party member Matsuoka Komakichi elected as the President of the House and Democratic Party member Tanaka Man-itsu elected as Vice President. Due to the Socialist Party's victory in the parliamentary speaker elections, Katayama's election as Prime Minister laid a solid foundation. At the continued meeting of the upper house on the 23rd, Katayama Tetsu of the Socialist Party was elected Prime Minister with a landslide victory of 420 votes to 6 in the House of Representatives and 205 votes to 2 in the House of Councillors. This is a new turning point in Japanese politics and the beginning of building a new Japan.

The Socialist Party of Japan was founded on November 2, 1945, and was the first political party established after Japan's surrender. It advocates social democracy, and some mistakenly refer to it as the "Social Democratic Party." Although the party has a short history, it is the successor to the pre-war Social Masses Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, with socialist Isoo Abe as its guiding spirit. Japanese socialism has many factions and new ideas, so since the establishment of the Socialist Party, there has been a division between the left and right wings. Generally speaking, the right wing is centered on Suehiro Nishio, Rikizo Hirano, and Komakichi Matsuoka, while the left wing is centered on Chozaburo Mizutani, Ju Kato, and Mosaburo Suzuki. The important principles of the party platform are threefold: (1) to be a combination of the working class, with the aim of ensuring political freedom and a democratic system; (2) to reject capitalism, implement socialism, and strive to stabilize and improve the national livelihood; and (3) to oppose all militaristic ideas and actions, and cooperate with all countries in the world to achieve lasting peace. Based on the spirit of this platform, eleven policies were decided on September 28th of last year. The ideas expressed in its demands for political, economic, and social systems are close to the policies of the British Labour Party. The method is gradual, the means are peaceful, there is no extremism of the Communist Party, and there is no continuous struggle of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, democracy criticizes it as social democracy, and communism criticizes it as reformist socialism. In fact, the policy spirit is social reformism. When the Socialist Party was first established, Tetsu Katayama was the party's secretary-general and later became chairman, serving as the de facto party leader. He was born in Wakayama Prefecture in 1887 and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University in 1912. He has presided over the "Legal Consultation Office," "Legal Newspaper," and the legal department of the General Federation of Labor. After that, he participated in the Farmer-Labor Party, the Social Masses Party, and the Social Masses Academy, and once launched the National Labor Party, which was soon dissolved. In 1942, the Tojo Cabinet implemented the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," and Katayama was not recommended, resulting in his failure to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in that election. As for his retreat to the countryside under the autocratic politics of military fascism, he devoted himself to reading and did not ask about politics until Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. He is sixty years old this year and has thirty-six years of history in political and social movements. He has never entered officialdom, engaged in commerce or industry, or taught at a university, and has only been elected to the House of Representatives five times. Katayama's election as Prime Minister this time can be called the world's second "commoner prime minister."

Japanese politics, since the Meiji era, has been centered on the bourgeoisie, aristocrats, and military cliques. In the past forty-six cabinets, the prime ministers all came from the ranks of aristocrats, generals, or bureaucrats. The only "commoner prime minister" from the people was Inukai Tsuyoshi. However, Inukai was a spokesperson for the financial clique, and his ideas and ambitions cannot compare with those of Katayama today. Katayama is indeed an extraordinary figure in Japanese social movements and politics, and MacArthur has also praised him as an ideal democrat. In Japan, one year and nine months after the surrender, the Socialist Party's rapid rise, gaining the position of the first party in the Diet, and obtaining the position of "overseeing all officials" in the new cabinet is by no means accidental. First, the Liberal Party has been in power for years, and its misdeeds are obvious, and complaints are everywhere. Yoshida succeeded in courting MacArthur, but there is still no clue about the recovery of society and the economy and the progress of Japan's reconstruction work. Katayama is a new figure in politics, with perseverance and ability. Observing his remarks just ten minutes after being elected Prime Minister: "I am extremely grateful to be unanimously elected Prime Minister by all members of the Diet today. In order to overcome the crisis of the Japanese nation and build a new Japan, I will do my best with sincerity." His words are earnest and leap off the page. Second, Katayama's complete victory in both houses of the Diet is indeed what the people want. Katayama's agreement to form a cabinet with the Democratic Party and the People's Cooperative Party has been reached. Only the Liberal Party stands in opposition, but many Liberal Party members in both houses still voted to support Katayama, which shows that although there are differences in party interests in Japan, when facing great difficulties, the whole country is united.

According to sources in Tokyo, Katayama's cabinet formation work will begin on the 26th. Katayama is determined to form a coalition government of four parties based on established policies and guidelines. Whether the Liberal Party will join the cabinet is doubtful. If Katayama completely loses the cooperation of conservative forces, there will be many obstacles in the future. Because today's conservative forces control important sectors of society and the economy, as well as local administration and parliament. However, Katayama has the魄力 and has 手腕, and has considerable support from MacArthur. It is expected that Katayama will win the hearts of the people and overcome this difficulty. In short, the Japanese political situation has gradually become clear after months of elections and evolution. Relations with the United States are becoming more and more smooth, and foreign trade will also be restored. Only the response to the peace treaty with Japan remains to be arranged by the new government.

### British Cabinet Holds Meeting, Approves Indian Viceroy's Plan, Partition of India Seems Inevitable, Rumor Mountbatten to Return to India Next Thursday to Resume Post

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The negotiations between Indian Viceroy Mountbatten and the British Cabinet ended today. The Cabinet meeting has approved the Viceroy's plan to submit a document to Indian leaders on June 2 regarding the process of transferring political power. The Viceroy did not attend the Cabinet meeting, but he did meet with the Commerce Minister of the Indian Provisional Government, Zontrija of the Muslim League, and Nehru's personal representative in London, Menon, to listen to the opinions of both India and the Muslim League. At the same time, Prime Minister Attlee has informed the leaders of various opposition parties of the general outline of the Viceroy's plan. The reaction of Churchill and other Conservative Party leaders is not yet known, but Liberal Party leader Davis has expressed his agreement with the plan. The government stated that Parliament has adjourned today, and the content of the Viceroy's plan will be formally announced after the Viceroy presents it to Indian leaders at a meeting in Delhi.

[United Press, London, 23rd] It is reported that Mountbatten will return to his post in India next Thursday and will consult with the Cabinet again before his departure.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Although the British Cabinet has approved Viceroy Mountbatten's plan today, some Indian people expect that it will be difficult to establish a complete solution before June of next year, the deadline for Britain's withdrawal from India. The Chairman of the Indian Constituent Assembly, Chinglara, stated that the Muslim League Chairman Jinnah's request to obtain a corridor in Hindustan territory for the eastern and western parts of Pakistan is an unacceptable proposal. Benzheyou, Delhi, the United Provinces, Bihar, and part of Bengal will inevitably be cut off, with a distance of 1,600 kilometers, passing through areas that are all non-Muslim. Jinsalasa expressed his hatred for the partition of India, but said that if the decision is made to implement the partition, the Congress Party will demand the partition of the two provinces of Bengal and Benzhebu. Pu also recognized that after the partition of India, the division of the army would inevitably be unavoidable. In addition, Modi, the leader of India's wealthiest Parsee community, also expressed opposition to the partition of India, because after the partition, the status of both Pakistan and Hindustan would be weakened, reducing India's importance in the world. The Muslim League Liaison Department announced today that it has sent a telegram to Prime Minister Attlee, Indian Affairs Minister Listowel, and Viceroy Mountbatten, asking them to uphold justice for 30 million Muslims.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Generally speaking, it is expected that although the British government will re-submit the British internal Indian federal plan to Indian leaders, the partition of India is unavoidable. They also believe that if the partition is indeed unavoidable, the opinions of the representatives of the Indian people must be sought in a democratic way. As far as the Congress Party, the Sikhs, the Indian Christians, and some native states are concerned, the existing Constituent Assembly is sufficient as an institution for seeking opinions. However, as far as the Muslims are concerned, because the Muslim League boycotts the Constituent Assembly, another Muslim League Constituent Assembly must be established. Regarding the partition of the two provinces of Bengal and Benzhebu, it seems that a referendum must be held to decide, and the problem of the Northwest Frontier Province also needs to be decided by a special method. British officials all believe that time is the main factor in the Viceroy's procedural plan, and it is almost impossible to hold a referendum nationwide. British officials reiterated that all decisions will be made by Indian leaders. If Indian leaders agree with the plan proposed by the Viceroy, then future constitutional decisions should also be made by Indian leaders.

### Katayama Elected Prime Minister, MacArthur Highly Praises, Katayama Expresses Great Pleasure, Saying It Will Help Cabinet Formation

[International Dispatch to Tokyo, 24th] Katayama drove to visit MacArthur at 5:30 p.m. on the 24th, making his first visit after taking office as Prime Minister.

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] After the leader of the Japanese Socialist Party, Katayama, was elected Prime Minister, MacArthur immediately issued a public statement, saying that Katayama leading the country as a Christian leader is a groundbreaking event in Japanese history, reflecting Japan's complete tolerance of religion. The other two major leaders in Asian countries, namely Chinese Chairman Chiang and Philippine President Roxas, are both Christians. Katayama's election as Prime Minister proves that the Japanese are pursuing non-extremist policies. The international propaganda that Japan's recent election was a victory for reactionary forces is self-defeating. Tetsu Katayama expressed great pleasure with MacArthur's statement. He said: "If the leaders of other political parties carefully study MacArthur's statement, then my work in forming a new cabinet will be easier. My initial wish is to establish a government that can contribute to world peace and Japanese happiness. I have never had the desire to become Prime Minister by unreasonable means."

Former and New Prime Ministers Hand Over Yesterday

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Prime Minister's appointment ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace at 5 p.m. on the 24th. The Yoshida Cabinet held two cabinet meetings at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. today to discuss the handover between the former and new Prime Ministers. After that, the Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, Irie, invited representatives from the Socialist Party to discuss. As a result, it was decided to hand over immediately. Yoshida entered the palace at 4 p.m. to report the Diet's appointment of Katayama as Prime Minister. The new Prime Minister's appointment ceremony was held at 5 p.m. Former Prime Minister Yoshida and the speakers of both houses, Komakichi Matsuoka and Tsuneo Matsudaira, attended the ceremony.

Yoshida Claims Illness, Refuses Meeting

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Prime Minister Katayama originally planned to meet with the presidents of various parties on the 25th to request their cooperation in cabinet formation work, but because Liberal Party President Yoshida refused to meet on the grounds of physical discomfort, the planned meeting had to be postponed again. The Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Ohno, declared on the 24th: "The Katayama Cabinet has no intention of inviting the Liberal Party to join the cabinet. If the policies agreed upon by the secretaries-general of the four parties are implemented, our party will cooperate outside the cabinet." As for the internal situation of the Democratic Party, it is also very complicated. The reason why it repeatedly demanded the formation of a four-party coalition cabinet is said to be a means by the Shidehara faction to put the Katayama Cabinet in a state of stillbirth. Although Ashida and Nishio had a meeting on the 22nd and had a considerable understanding of the formation of a three-party coalition cabinet, the result may only be the formation of a two-and-a-half-party coalition cabinet of the Socialist, National Cooperative, and the Tada faction of the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party will inevitably split internally.

### Katayama Weak, Emperor Greatly Concerned

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Speaker of the House of Representatives Matsuoka had an audience with the Emperor at 3:50 p.m. on the 24th and, when reporting on the process of the House of Representatives' election of the Prime Minister, had the following exchange with the Emperor: (Emperor) It is reported that Katayama is quite weak. What is the Speaker's opinion? (Matsuoka) What is said is indeed true. Katayama is quite weak when in a position of being attacked, but if given proper protection, he will develop an unexpectedly strong style. (Emperor) Before the cabinet formation work is completed, the political affairs will only be managed by the Minister of _____. Can Katayama handle it alone? (Matsuoka) Katayama should select cabinet members to assist him as soon as possible within the realm of possibility. (Emperor) Will it take two weeks to form a cabinet? (Matsuoka) The political situation does not allow such a delay. We should strive to achieve its establishment within a few days.

### Unrest Continues in India, Severe Damage in Various Places

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] Today is the Sikh's great religious festival. The capital of Punjab Province, Lahore, is under strict guard to prevent incidents from occurring. In the Northwest Frontier Province, unrest continues to occur. Demonstrators from the Muslim League in Mardan, the capital of the province, destroyed the city hall. Many villages' tax offices were also destroyed. Members of the Muslim League in Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, continued to march and demonstrate to show their opposition to the province's Congress Party government. They once attacked the outer wall of Warden Prison, and Xiangshui Pond outside the city was bombed and suffered minor damage. Since the riots in Lahore on May 14th, ____108 people have been killed, and property losses are estimated at ____1 million pounds. 150 houses have been burned, including more than ten Hindu and Sikh temples, as well as the residence of the largest landlord in Punjab Province. About 5,000 Hindus are evacuating Lahore every day, and Hindu-owned businesses and banks are planning to relocate to Delhi. A bomb exploded in Amritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, yesterday.

### British Fleet to Hold Summer Exercises, More Than 60 Warships to Participate

[French News Agency, 23rd] The Admiralty announced today that the British Home Fleet is scheduled to begin its summer exercises on May 31. More than 60 warships will participate in the exercises, including 3 battleships, 2 aircraft carriers, 5 cruisers, 30 destroyers, 20 submarines, and several other warships (the number of which has not been announced). Some of these warships will visit ports in Britain and Europe in the next three months. The exercise will take place on the high seas, and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Vian, will issue orders on the flagship HMS Duke of York.

### Former Italian Prime Minister Gasperi Reappointed to Form New Cabinet, Plans to Unite Various Factions to Resolve Current Economic Crisis

[This Newspaper News] London, 24th Radio: Gasperi accepted the official order from President Nicotra today to succeed as the Prime Minister of the Italian coalition government. Gasperi is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and he had already begun negotiations with the leaders of other parties before officially being ordered to form a cabinet. He hopes that the strength of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party in the new cabinet will be weaker than the cabinet that resigned on May 13. Gasperi said: "Regarding my policy direction, the country has long been aware of it, that is, to sincerely cooperate with all parties and factions to overcome the economic crisis and solve the urgent problems of the moment."

[United Press, Rome, 23rd] The eight major political parties in Italy unanimously elected Gasperi today to lead the new government. The possibility of Gasperi wanting to expel the Communist Party has been rejected by various parties, but weakening the Communist Party's power in the government seems inevitable, as the failure of Nitti and Aurenshe to form a cabinet has strengthened Gasperi's position.

### Italian and French Political Situations are Strikingly Similar

[United Press, New York] Under the influence of President Truman's new foreign policy, Italy, following France, is also turning to the right. The Italian cabinet crisis has lasted for ten days. After the successive failures of various political leaders to form a cabinet, Gasperi is now planning to form a cabinet to expand the base and increase the number of right-wing conservatives in order to weaken the power of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party. Gasperi's motive is to move Italy to the right in order to obtain American economic assistance, as the Truman Doctrine is to provide financial assistance to countries that are curbing communism and resisting Soviet aggression. Currently, representatives from the US Export-Import Bank are about to negotiate with Italian officials for a $100 million loan. At the same time, after the US Congress passes a $350 million foreign aid bill, Italy will also receive a portion, so the political situation in Italy today is actually the same as in France.

### Our Embassy in France Hosts Wei Lihuang

[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] The Chinese Embassy in France hosted General Wei Lihuang at noon today. The newly appointed French Resident-General in Morocco, General Juhan, and the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jadelu, were also present. General Wei is scheduled to fly to Casa on the 27th to visit the French Air Force bombing training school and will be hosted by the Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, General Van Oley. It is expected that General Yu will visit the Chief of Staff of the French Army, General Talatel, at the end of this month before leaving France to return home.

### Truman Urges Congress to Extend Import and Export Controls

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] President Truman today asked the meeting to approve the extension of wartime controls on certain types of food, fertilizer, and industrial equipment from June 30 for another year in order to maintain domestic production and support American foreign policy. He requested the meeting to continue to approve import controls on fats, oils, rice, and produce. The President's message also advocated that the United States continue to participate in the International Emergency Food Committee's allocation system, emphasizing that the United States must take the necessary steps to limit the import of food that other countries lack into the United States in order to avoid increasing their hunger and panic. The President pointed out that since the end of the war, American agricultural and industrial production has established new records. If other countries' production can also maintain similar heights, controls will not be necessary. However, because the progress of the world's post-war reconstruction work is slow, it is necessary to continue to retain controls on certain items. The impact on the United States itself due to controls is minimal compared to the tragic living conditions faced by most other countries in the world today. Such living conditions have a major impact on politics and society.

### Soviet Union Proposes Restoring Trade with Japan, Plans to Purchase Millions of Dollars Worth of Japanese Goods

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] It was learned today that MacArthur's headquarters is negotiating a trade with Soviet representatives involving millions of dollars worth of Japanese goods. This is the first time since the war that the Soviet Union has entered into large-scale trade with Japan, having previously only obtained a few ____ products. It is said that part of this trade is purely purchasing, and part is barter. The Soviet economic advisor to the Allied Control Council, Lieutenant General Teleuvianki, told a United Press reporter that the Soviet proposal has been submitted to the Foreign Trade Office of MacArthur's headquarters, and it is hoped that a contract can be concluded soon. According to people at MacArthur's headquarters, the Soviet Union plans to purchase fishing boats, locomotives, and railway equipment, and is willing to supply bituminous coal, coking coal, steel products, and ferrosilicon in exchange.

### The Issue of Amnesty: Related to Pacifying the Civil War

[French News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Political figures here say that the United Nations Balkan Fact-Finding Committee's blaming Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for guerrilla activities in northern Greece can be seen as clear evidence of a new U.S. policy toward the Mediterranean. Conversely, regarding the U.S. attitude toward the Greek government, such as the White House and State Department's reiterated stance and statements during yesterday's final discussions on the Greek aid bill, the U.S. hopes Greece will expand its government and grant amnesty. Although the U.S. does not intend to exert pressure to achieve this, it has puzzled some non-partisan Greek figures here. According to these Greek figures, Greece's future depends on a swift resolution of the amnesty issue, as it has a twofold effect. Namely, (1) if amnesty can be sincerely implemented, expanding the Greek government will be easier to achieve, whether it should be guaranteed by a United Nations observer group will not be a problem, and the need for U.S. munitions will not be as urgent as it is now, and the national economy will benefit from it. (2) If amnesty is not granted, the war against the guerrillas will have no end, wasting money that could be used for other purposes. Speaking of amnesty, without sufficient guarantees, the civil unrest cannot be quelled. Therefore, it is hoped that the United States will first resolve the important issue of amnesty.

### International Bank Loan: Approved by the French Parliament

Entirely for Reconstruction Purposes

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The National Assembly today unanimously passed the bill for a $250 million loan from the International Bank. Previously, Communist Party leader Duclos had accused the International Bank of attempting to impose political conditions on France when granting the loan, as the clause that each payment must be approved by the lender could be used to suppress French politics and government. Duclos vehemently declared that France's internal affairs would not tolerate foreign advisors, which was met with cheers throughout the room. Finance Minister Schuman told Duclos that France's dignity and independence would not be affected by this loan. France can use this loan to freely purchase goods from any country, and the interest rate is the same as other loans on the international market. $165 million of the loan will be used to purchase raw materials needed to build France's production capacity, and the rest will be used to purchase machinery. In any case, this loan will not be used to offset the national budget deficit.

### British to Transfer Management of Ruhr Coal Mines to German Authorities

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Authoritative sources say that the plan for the British authorities to transfer the management of the Ruhr coal mines to German authorities is nearing completion, and the transfer will be implemented soon. This transfer was originally scheduled to take place on May 1st but was later announced to be postponed. Lord Pakenham, the British Cabinet Minister for the German Occupation Zone, arrived in Essen, the headquarters of the Northern German Coal Control, over the weekend, and may discuss this matter. London insists that this transfer does not involve the transfer of ownership, but only the transfer of administrative management. In other words, the British officials in the Production Department of the Northern German Coal Control Bureau will gradually decrease.

### Marshall's Letter to Korean Political Leaders: Asking Them to Remain Calm and Patient

[French News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the joint letter from more than thirty Korean political leaders to U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall, requesting the cancellation of the demarcation line between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones in Korea, and requesting that U.S. Army Commander Hodge remain in office until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea, Secretary of State Marshall has replied to the Korean political leaders, asking them to remain patient and calm during the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Gyeongseong.

### Announcement of U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Communiqué Postponed

[Our Newspaper, Jinshan, 24th Broadcast: The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for Korea was originally scheduled to issue a joint communiqué on Saturday, but because the representatives of both sides still need to consider the wording of the report, it has been postponed to Monday. According to the content of the communiqué, there is not much more information than what was informally released by the leader of the U.S. delegation, Blanc.]

[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Father Flanagan, founder of Boys Town in Nebraska, USA, has been invited by U.S. Army Commander Hodge in Korea and is expected to depart from Japan at the end of the month to come here.

### Measuring Love: Invented an Instrument

[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] "Poetry Age" recently reported that a Danish scientist has invented a love measuring instrument. This measuring instrument is small and exquisite and can be placed in a man's pocket or a woman's purse. It has degrees up and down and can measure the depth of love.

### Corfu Strait Mine Incident: Britain Appeals to International Court

[French News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd] According to an announcement by United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie: Britain has today filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice against Albania for laying mines in the Corfu Strait. The Registrar of the International Court of Justice has sent a copy of the British indictment to me. The United Nations Security Council previously discussed the Strait issue, but due to the Soviet representative Gromyko's use of the veto, an agreement could not be reached, so it was recommended that both Britain and Albania submit the case to the International Court of Justice.

### U.S. and Turkish Representatives Begin Talks: Discussing Practical Ways to Aid Turkey

[French News Agency, Ankara, 23rd] After the U.S. military delegation arrived here last night, they began talks today with representatives of the Turkish Army General Staff to discuss the practical ways in which the United States should aid Turkey.

### Turkish President's Speech

Thanking the United States for Assistance

[French News Agency, Ankara, 23rd] Turkish President İsmet İnönü gave a radio address this morning, saying: The U.S. aid plan for Greece and Turkey symbolizes the friendship of the United States toward Turkey, and also acknowledges the merits of the Turkish people during World War II. The difficulties encountered by Turkey due to the impact of the war can now be alleviated with the help of the United States. In short, this action by the United States is to fulfill its task of maintaining and strengthening world peace.

### Balkan Investigation Committee Report: To Be Reviewed by the Security Council / Investigation Committee Work Concluded

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] Today it was learned that after the Balkan Investigation Group completes its report in Geneva, the Security Council will begin debates around June 9. The Soviet Union may use its veto power on the section condemning the three Soviet satellite states for causing the disputes on Greece's northern border.

[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The eleven members of the United Nations Balkan Committee today signed the report on the results of the investigation submitted to the Security Council, and the work of the committee is now concluded. At the last meeting, the Soviet representative raised objections to some of the conclusions reached by the committee, but he still expressed his acceptance of the report. The chairman of the committee delivered a closing speech, expressing the hope that the committee will help establish lasting peace in the Balkans.

### Greek Foreign Minister's Speech

[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris recently declared that the United Nations Balkan Investigation Group has reached an agreement on Greece in Geneva. This agreement is a necessary condition for consolidating peace and a sign of promoting international understanding. Greece is extremely willing to make peace with its neighbors and hopes that the Security Council will pass a fair resolution based on the investigation group's report and recommendations to promote world peace.

### French Government Prevents Labor Strikes: Prepares to Take Over Gas and Electricity Plants / Will Deploy Troops to Maintain Order If Necessary

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Less than half an hour after the French Gas and Electricity Workers' Union threatened to implement a work slowdown and follow it with a general strike, the Ramadier cabinet decided at midnight to take over the nation's gas and electricity plants and their employees. If necessary, troops will be deployed to maintain supply. The union's "Communique" declared that the nation's gas and electricity workers will soon implement a work slowdown, reducing the supply by 15 to 25 percent, and a full-scale strike will be implemented on Wednesday, supplying only a very small amount of necessary gas and electricity. The strike period will depend on the situation in other industries. The Minister of the Interior announced to the press after the cabinet meeting that the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were also present at the meeting. Union leaders stated that their actions would not change due to the cabinet's resolution. The union has issued orders to branches nationwide, with the launch date to be in 48 hours. This action by the gas and electricity union is the first major conflict over wages since the government announced its policy of maintaining its price and wage policy. The union is demanding a 15 percent wage increase, while the government says there is no room for consideration before December. Some people predict that other labor strikes may follow after the gas and electricity labor strike.

The detailed methods will be studied in the meetings in the next three years.

### Pan-American Conference: Will Focus on Defense

[French News Agency, Brazilian Capital, 23rd] Brazilian Foreign Minister Fernandes declared today that there is a need for consultation among the American countries to cope with attacks suffered by the United States. The Pan-American Conference will be held in the Brazilian capital in the coming days. Its agenda will be strictly limited to the security and defense issues of the American continent. However, the concept of Pan-Americanism goes beyond this scope. It is hoped that the Pan-American alliance will finally be successfully realized.

### Soviets Create High-Speed: Jet Fighter

Breaks British Aircraft Record [United Press, Boston, 24th] The editor of Aviation Magazine, Ford, told the New England Aviation Association today that the Soviet Union has created the jet aircraft with the highest speed in the world. The speed of the aircraft is over 600 miles per hour, which is about 40 miles per hour faster than the world speed record maintained by British aircraft. The aircraft is a single-seat fighter plane created by German scientists brought back to Russia by the Soviet Union.

### Rampant Japanese Black Market Merchants: Actually Use Radio to Direct

[United Press, Osaka, 24th] Kyodo News Agency reported today that Japanese black market merchants are using shortwave radio to direct truck drivers to favorable markets and warn them to evade police pursuit. Earlier, a radio repairman in Osaka reported to the police station that when he was repairing a machine, he heard a strong shortwave broadcast. He rushed to the street and saw a truck with an antenna driving by. After further investigation, the police station announced that black market merchants are using old military transmitters to transmit messages to trucks, directing them to markets with favorable prices. Some black market trading locations are close to U.S. military supply routes.

### Indonesian-Dutch Negotiations Difficult to Be Optimistic: Sjahrir Publishes the Course of Repeated Talks / Rumors that the Dutch Advocate Stopping Negotiations with Indonesia

[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir said today that Dutch Prime Minister Beel and Overseas Minister Jonkman have taken a proposal for further political concessions from the Indonesian side back to the Netherlands for governance, so that an agreement can be reached. Indonesia is asking the Netherlands to reduce its troops stationed in the East Indies so that it will no longer be regarded as a force with real offensive power. Well-informed Dutch sources say that after Beel returns to The Hague, his policy of continuing negotiations with Indonesia will encounter major opposition. It is heard that the Dutch side is launching a bipartisan movement advocating stopping negotiations with Indonesia and making Indonesia choose one of "take it or leave it," and will not hesitate to use force as a backing if necessary. Sjahrir also said that he had met with Beel twice and with Jonkman three times, frankly informing them of Indonesia's attitude, and both sides are now very clear about the truth. The fundamental difficulty is that the Netherlands does not want Indonesia to have the freedom to handle its finances independently. We insist on managing import and export trade and foreign exchange ourselves, but the Netherlands itself also urgently needs foreign financial assistance and loans. In order to gain the trust of lenders, it has to insist on jointly managing Indonesia's exports and foreign exchange under Dutch leadership, in order to manipulate Indonesian finances.

### After the United States Decides to Provide Economic Aid to Greece: Prospects for Greek Reconstruction

— Special Translation by Our Newspaper Editorial Department

The United States is giving economic aid to Greece, and at the same time, it must consider the issue of building Greece and revitalizing Greece. President Truman's purpose in requesting a $250 million loan to Greece is to help the country restore its status as an independent and free country. Behind this loan, there is also a need for the meticulous planning and guidance of the United States as a price for seeking peace in the Mediterranean.

There have been various questions raised about how to use this loan. The U.S. plan is still being drafted, but based on investigations, a preliminary forecast is made as follows.

Thinking on the Bright Side

With the assistance of the United States to establish the Greek economy, unify Greek politics, and improve the Greek army, Greece may be able to stand on its own feet and return to self-sufficiency in a few years.

In 1947, Greece may not need the entire $250 million loan. In this year, Greece will spend approximately $350 million, including $200 million for grains, coal, machinery, fabrics and other supplies, $50 million for construction costs, and $100 million for military equipment. The total revenue for the same year is approximately $130 million, including approximately $85 million in export earnings, $9 million in transportation earnings, and $36 million in private remittances from the United States.

The shortfall is $220 million, which will be offset by the following: $15 million still existing in the Export-Import Bank, $12 million in UNRRA relief supplies, and $50 million in Greece's share of U.S. relief funds for liberated countries. The remaining deficit of $143 million will be offset by new loans.

In 1948, Greek production and foreign earnings are expected to increase, reducing the deficit to $180 million, assuming construction and development costs of $100 million. Most of this can be offset by the remaining funds from 1947, but at least $80 million in new loans can be obtained from the United States.

For the next ten years, Greece will need approximately $70 million in construction costs each year. By 1958, the United States may invest $1 billion in Greece. However, unless the United States handles it properly, Greece can cooperate with the United States, and the world remains at peace, the above predictions will not be realized.

Thinking on the Dark Side

The loan that the United States gives to Greece may be used for the Greeks to kill each other, for the exploitation of the Greek bureaucracy, or for matters unrelated to the revitalization of Greece. In the event of this situation, the United States may be unwilling to waste useful money and allow Greece to fall into chaos, allowing the Greek Communists to send Greece into the arms of the Soviet Union.

To avoid this situation, the Greek and U.S. authorities must handle it well.

Outline of the Aid Greece Plan

The plan to aid Greece is still being drafted, but based on the research done in Greece by organizations such as UNRRA, the United Nations, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, a rough outline of the plan can be obtained as follows:

There are three key points to the plan: first, national security, reorganizing the Greek army under U.S. guidance so that it can assume the task of defending the country; second, political stability, persuading Greek parties to cooperate to stabilize the political situation; and third, rebuilding public confidence.

The main goal of the plan is to restore Greece's productivity and enable it to be self-sufficient.

The problem of prices in Greece not only hinders domestic trade but also threatens foreign trade. If you want to develop trade, you must first suppress prices. In Greece, the prices of manufactured goods are high, and the prices of agricultural products are low. If you want to adjust this, you must abolish the tax on daily necessities, and at the same time increase the allocation of manufactured goods to agricultural cooperatives.

The price of Greek exports is much higher than the price on the world market. In order to encourage the export industry, a portion of the profits can be paid to Greek exporters in foreign exchange. After credit is restored, a foreign exchange fund can be placed to stabilize the Greek monetary system. But to reform the monetary system, it is necessary to cut government spending.

Secondly, Greece's transportation industry must find ways to recover. It will cost about $70 million to fully restore the Greek railway. Only 59 percent of the pre-war tracks are available. Since 1939, Greece has lost 82 percent of its freight cars and 76 percent of its locomotives. Greece's highways are extremely poor, and the speed of trucks is only 11 miles per hour. There are 10,000 trucks in the country, which are currently sufficient for use, but most of them are old and will not last long.

Nowhere in Greece is more than 70 miles from the sea, so the development of coastal shipping will be of great help to Greece. However, transportation tools suffered great losses during the war, and the total cost of reconstruction is approximately $53 million. Ships sunk in the Corinth Canal will be salvaged and sold to Greek factories as waste materials. Greece's maritime industry will soon return to its pre-war state. Greece currently has 99 Liberty ships and 2 C-1 ships, all purchased from the United States on credit. Therefore, the current total of Greece's merchant ships is approximately 1.7 million tons, all of which are relatively new ships.

Tobacco is a valuable asset of Greece and once accounted for more than half of Greece's total exports. If the price is comparable to Turkish tobacco, then the United States is prepared to buy more tobacco from Greece. Although the production of American cigarettes has doubled compared to 1938, the proportion of oriental tobacco used has decreased from 11 percent to 5.7 percent. If the proportion of oriental tobacco increases to 8.5 percent, Greece will sell 14,000 tons of tobacco to the United States, and the remaining 32,000 tons will be sold to European countries.

Other products prepared for sale to Europe include wine, raisins, figs, tanning solutions, and rosin.

Stopgap and Fundamental Solutions

The United States is currently seeking expert advice as a reference for drafting a Greek revitalization plan, while also obtaining the cooperation of the Greeks. Britain and other allied countries will assist in the revitalization of Greece by developing trade.

Short-term aid to Greece, the purpose is only to strengthen the Greek army and stabilize the Greek currency loans, is only a stopgap measure. Once it is used up, nothing will be left.

To restore Greece's former prosperity, there must be a long-term fundamental plan. President Truman said: The United States is prepared to help Greece resist aggression and make it a "self-reliant and self-respecting democracy." Greece, the Soviet Union, and countries around the world will wait and see. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)

### The Third Session of the City Council Will Open Tomorrow Morning / Proposals Suggest Recruiting Soldiers from Conscripts / The Finance Committee Decides Four Principles for Organizing Old Debts / The Government Should Do Its Utmost to Maintain Creditworthiness

[Our Newspaper] The first third session of the City Council will begin at 9:00 AM tomorrow. As of yesterday, a total of 154 councilors have reported to the council, and 91 proposals have been received. Of these, 66 have been reviewed, and the rest will continue to be reviewed on the 29th and 30th, respectively. The city government's policy report was delivered to the council yesterday, but the mayor's motion has not yet been delivered. In addition, the City Council Secretariat has been extremely busy working these days. Although today is Sunday, it is still operating as usual.

The Finance Committee of the City Council had previously submitted a motion to the second session of the council regarding the "Proposal by Councilors Tang Shichang and others to suggest that the central and municipal governments organize various old debts and determine reasonable repayment methods." A plan was drafted and submitted for discussion at this session. It is learned that the councilors strongly oppose the principle of one-to-one repayment, because the current cost of living index has reached more than 18,000 times, and the price index has exceeded 30,000 times. Even based on the minimum salary multiplication of public and educational personnel, it is 1,800 times. Therefore, the Finance Committee decided on four organizational principles to provide for this session: (1) One-to-one repayment is indeed too low, and the people's losses are too great. (2) It is suggested that the government simultaneously resolve the repayment methods for bank deposits and public bonds. (3) The government should do its utmost to maintain creditworthiness. (4) Use new debt to exchange for old debt to avoid inflation, but the nature and year of public bond issuance must be considered to determine a reasonable repayment method.

[Also News] Among the proposals collected by the City Council from various councilors, Councilor Tang Shichang and others proposed the following regarding conscription in the city: "In this time of fluctuating public sentiment and social unrest, the city should temporarily postpone conscription to avoid stimulation, reduce misunderstandings, and eliminate unnecessary disturbances. Currently, engaging in production is no less important than serving in the military, so it is requested that the city government forward this to the central government, recruiting unemployed veterans and others for service."

### Speaker Pan Visits the Eighth District - Nanshi Hopes to Establish a Temporary Epidemic Hospital

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the eighth day of City Councilor Pan's visit to the various districts. Despite the rain, he, along with Secretary-General Xiang and representatives from the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Health, visited the four districts of Songshan, Luwan, Yimiao, and Penglai. Councilors and the chief and deputy district heads gathered to welcome them and raised issues concerning the reform of municipal administration, requesting the speaker to make suggestions on their behalf. These included: (1) Most Bao (neighborhood) offices do not have fixed premises. It is hoped that joint Bao offices can be organized, which would make it easier to solve the issues of housing and personnel. (2) The district people's representative council has too little funding and no full-time staff, making it impossible to carry out its work. (3) There are too many leaking manure carts, causing the area around Rue Pere Robert to be filled with foul odors whenever manure carts gather. It is hoped that this can be improved. (4) Ri Hui Port is a pier for both manure carts and firewood, and every morning it is extremely crowded and disorderly. It is hoped that the manure cart pier can be moved to Qu Zhenren Road, which would not only reduce congestion but also significantly improve the hygiene of the densely populated Ri Hui Port area. (5) The French Water and Electricity Company is again increasing security deposits, which causes significant losses to residents. It is hoped that this can be stopped. (6) The accumulated garbage in the Nanshi area, including broken bricks and tiles, totals 300,000 to 400,000 shi (a unit of dry measure). The district office has been ordered to clear it, but they feel powerless. The Civil Affairs Department's allocated cleanup fee of 1,500 yuan per shi, based on the fixed survey figures, is far from the actual cost. Regarding the Luwan district, where the amount is relatively small, when the district head raised this issue, Councilors Chen Linsheng and Ma Shaoquan each donated one million yuan on the spot, urging the district office to clear it as soon as possible and not to procrastinate, in order to emphasize public health for the citizens. (7) Nanshi has a dense population and many refugees. Summer is approaching soon. It is hoped that there can be a temporary epidemic hospital. (8) The Nanshi Eastern District Fire Brigade has been restored, and the organizers Huang Bingquan and Mao Zijian are enthusiastic and dedicated, serving as good role models. Recent fires have been frequent, and various districts and Baos have been requesting the establishment of volunteer fire brigades. It is hoped that the authorities can provide as much assistance as possible on this issue.

Speaker Pan will visit the four districts of Huangpu, Lao Zha, Jing'an, and Xincheng today.

### Urban Planning Committee - Joint Meeting of All Groups

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Urban Planning Committee held its third joint meeting of all groups at 9:00 AM yesterday in the conference room of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works.

### Small Loan Lending - All Repaid by Due Date

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Winter Relief Committee previously allocated 100 million yuan to launch small-scale production loans. From April 20th to May 10th, a total of 62 million yuan was lent out. According to regulations, the monthly interest rate on these loans is 2%, and it was estimated that one-quarter of the principal could be repaid by May 10th. However, the reality was unexpected, and by the deadline, all of the loans had been repaid. The Social Affairs Bureau believes this is a very good sign. At the current session of the City Council, a councilor has proposed expanding the small-scale loans to 300 million yuan to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people under the pressure of high-interest loans.

### Shanghai Branch of the Municipal Association - Board Meeting Held Yesterday

### Public Works Department Works Through the Night - Battling Waterlogging Everywhere

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city has been experiencing torrential rain from last night to this morning. By 9:00 AM, the rainfall had reached 5.47 centimeters. The Ditch and Drainage Engineering Department of the Bureau of Public Works has been working through the night since midnight the day before yesterday. By yesterday afternoon, although there was waterlogging in areas such as Ri Sheng Lou and Yuyuan Road Difeng Road, it receded completely after the bureau actively dredged the area. The waterlogging at Thirteen-Story Building and east of Daxilu yesterday afternoon has also receded slightly. If the weather turns clear, it can be drained completely immediately. As for the section of Jiaozhou Road and Yejiatai Road, due to the installation of drainage pipes and pumping station projects under construction, the water problems north of Xinzha Road can be greatly reduced once the project is completed. The relocation of drainage pipes near Anle Factory along Haifang Road has caused a slight blockage. The low-lying areas of the northern section of Fanhuangdu Road and Jiangsu Road, where the pipe-laying project was completed a month ago, have not experienced any waterlogging yesterday or today.

### Important Meeting of the Garrison Headquarters - Three Newspapers to Cease Publication Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, student unrest has been breaking out in the city, and social order is extremely unstable. Conspirators are taking the opportunity to incite and cause trouble.

### Rice Rationing for the Poor to be Implemented Within a Month - Purchase Certificates Already Being Printed - To be Distributed by District Offices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rice rationing for factories and schools is currently being reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau. As of yesterday, a portion has been completed, and distribution can begin next week. The payment location has been arranged with the City Bank. After the applications from various factories and schools have been reviewed and approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, each unit will be given a notice of approval for rice rationing, which will be used to pay at the designated bank in exchange for a rice collection certificate. The certificate can then be used to collect rice from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. The procedure is extremely simple.

Standard Regulations - Preventing Fraud

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday: "We will do our best to implement rice rationing for the poor within this month." The criteria for the poor, previously defined as the elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, disabled, and those with no one to support them, as well as those with a monthly income of 300,000 yuan and family burdens, will be investigated by the district offices and police stations. The rice purchase certificates are currently being printed. After printing, they will be distributed to the poor by the district offices. The purchase certificates will need to have the name filled in. In the future, when purchasing rice, a national identity card must be shown for verification. Only if it matches the rice purchase certificate will the rice be sold to prevent fraud. The price of white rice for the poor is 168,000 yuan per shi, and the price of indica rice is 147,000 yuan. The Ministry of Food recently sent a telegram increasing the price of rice for factory purchases to 240,000 yuan per shi. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted a request to the city government to negotiate with the Ministry of Food to maintain the original price.

Investigation Procedures - Many Difficulties

Regarding the rice rationing method for poor households, the Social Affairs Bureau previously suggested that it be organized by the government, with public sales offices or price-stabilized grain stations established in each district. However, the procedures for investigating poor households are quite difficult. Therefore, City Government Advisor Ge Kexin suggested that the rice rationing for poor households be handled by autonomous organizations and charitable groups, as they are closer to the poor and have experience. However, this also has its own shortcomings. Therefore, a meeting was convened by the city government at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of rice rationing for poor households. No decision has been made on which method to adopt, and it will be left to Director Wu and Mayor Wu to approve.

### Establishing Workers' Transportation Cars

The council then discussed proposals from various unions and resolved to approve the proposal from Liuhe Company to establish workers' transportation cars. Detailed measures will be formulated by the union's welfare department in conjunction with the company in the near future and then implemented.

### Labor-Management Assessment Subcommittee - Discussing Detailed Rules for Unfreezing the Index

Since the government passed the implementation of unfreezing the cost of living index for workers and promulgated the Shanghai Temporary Measures for Wage Adjustment, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has announced that it will unfreeze the index starting in May. Regarding the detailed rules for implementation, such as piecework, overtime, work stoppage, leave, and vacation, a subcommittee will be formed by the Labor-Management Assessment Committee to study them. The subcommittee met yesterday morning and formulated concrete measures for issues such as piecework after the cost of living index is unfrozen. They will be submitted to the standing committee meeting of the Assessment Committee next Wednesday for approval and then announced. Reporters from Dagong News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the measures formulated by the subcommittee yesterday are roughly as follows: (1) "Piecework" wages will be calculated according to the cost of living index. The actual base salary received each month should be calculated and issued in accordance with the discount stipulated in item 4 of the adjustment measures. (2) In principle, "overtime" temporary overtime work, extra work, the overtime wage portion will not be discounted. (3) "Work stoppage" and "leave" will be calculated based on the worker's actual monthly base salary and issued with the prescribed discount. (4) "Vacation," such as national holidays and rest days stipulated by the Factory Law, if the employer obtains the worker's consent to work overtime, the overtime portion will be paid in full without discount. However, the above measures are subject to submission to the Standing Committee of the Assessment Committee for discussion and formal decision.

### Liji Company Vandalized - 37 People Arrested and Released on Bail

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Liji Industrial Company on Hong Kong Road, which owns the "Ligong" ship, previously allowed the Seamen's Union to place some unemployed seamen. The union recently heard that the "Ligong" ship was about to leave Shanghai, so Wang Lanxin, the investigation section chief of the Seamen's General Union, Zhang Yaoming, the chairman of the Shanghai branch, and 37 workers' representatives went to negotiate. The company agreed to reply today. Unexpectedly, the "Ligong" ship left Shanghai and sailed to Canada the day before yesterday afternoon. The workers learned of this and, feeling angry that the company had broken its promise, gathered at the company to question them, resulting in the destruction of property. The Huangpu Branch Bureau dispatched police to arrest the workers involved, Li Yinglong, Wang Donghai, Cui Yonglu, Liu Chunfu, He Delin, Wang Baodian, Fan Agen, and 30 others. They were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday and interrogated by Prosecutor Yu Yixin in the afternoon. After interrogation, they were all released on bail pending trial.

### Dapulu Fire Case - Two Defendants Sentenced to One and a Half Years Each

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fire case on Dapulu on April 10 was heard by Judge Ye Guiling in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday. The case involved a driver named Li Ada, who was driving truck number 36561, which was carrying nine barrels of film. When the truck passed the front of number 57 Dapulu, the worker on the truck, Lin Ruifu, carelessly threw a cigarette butt into one of the iron barrels that had a crack, causing it to ignite the celluloid film. In an instant, flames erupted in all directions. Li Ada and the worker, seeing that they had caused trouble, abandoned the truck and fled.

### Selling Black Market Tickets - Impersonating Air Force

Guo Yinan, 20 years old, from Fujian, was formerly a driver for the Supply General Office of the Air Force General Headquarters and was later dismissed for reasons. Unexpectedly, Guo had the far-fetched idea to illegally engrave the official seal of the Air Force Headquarters and still wear his uniform and swagger around outside. Recently, taking advantage of the convenience of his "military status," he sold black market tickets at the station. At around 8:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Guo was selling black market tickets at the first-class ticket booth and was spotted by plainclothes officers from the Third Section of the Xihu Police Section of the Railway Bureau Police Department. He was immediately arrested and taken to the section, and three second-class tickets to Nanjing and a forged "Dachang Air Force Station Official Seal" were found on his person. Section Chief Liu Yao and Deputy Section Chief Zhang Hanying reported the facts to Director Wang Zhaohu, stating that the criminal not only impersonated a soldier to sell black market tickets, but also forged an official seal, harming the reputation of the military. It has been decided to transfer him to the Garrison Headquarters for severe punishment within days.

### Military Vehicles Transporting Commercial Goods - Intercepted at Tushanwan, Seven Arrested for Military Trial

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the 12th of this month, the Seventh Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters intercepted six military vehicles of the 14th Transportation Battalion, 2nd Company, at Tushanwan, carrying gauze from the Hezhong Company and stationery such as DDT from the Huixin Company, intending to drive to Hangzhou. The six military vehicle drivers and Huang Borong, the manager of the Hezhong Company, and employees Lu Lisheng, Cha Lizhi, and He Yousong of the Huixin Company were taken to the Garrison Headquarters along with the gauze and other goods. The case is now being tried by the Military Law Office. The intercepted 36 pieces of cotton yarn and 156 pieces of cotton cloth were sent to the Textile Control Commission yesterday for review. Huang Borong, the manager of the Hezhong Company, was detained along with the six drivers for colluding with military vehicles to transport goods for profit, while employee Lu Lisheng was released.

In the afternoon, only the Jiangjing ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route entered. The Qiujin ship on the Shanghai-Tianjin route and the Haixuan ship on the Fuzhou route had not entered by the evening.

### Sunny Skies Expected in the Yangtze River Basin Today

The weather has changed drastically in recent days, and the temperature has dropped. Zheng Zizheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, explained the reasons last night, stating that after the 20th, the warm air mass in southwestern China developed greatly. As a result, a low-pressure system formed near Hunan and Jiangxi on the following day. By the evening, the entire Yangtze River basin, including the upper and lower reaches, was shrouded in overcast skies and rain. Its center gradually moved to the southeast of Hankou. From 8:00 AM the day before yesterday until yesterday morning, intermittent showers were observed. The reason was that cold air in Central China was pushing southeast, which caused the wind in the city to suddenly increase and the rain to intensify. As of now, the high-pressure system in Central China may push to the middle reaches of the Yangtze River tonight. Sunny weather is expected in the Yangtze River area today, and the heavy rain area may shift to the southeastern coastal areas, such as Guangzhou, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. Regarding the recent rainfall, Zheng estimated that it totaled 41.7 millimeters, equal to 1.64 inches. As for the temperature, the highest on the 22nd was 74.2 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest yesterday was 55.2 degrees, a difference of 19 degrees. The observatory's weather forecast is as follows:

Yellow Sea: Cloudy, sunny, localized morning fog, moderate northerly wind, medium waves.

Central China: Overcast, localized rain or morning fog, moderate northerly to easterly wind.

Shanghai: Overcast, showers turning cloudy, fog in the morning and evening, gentle to northerly wind.

East China Sea: Overcast, rain along the coast, gentle northeasterly to southeasterly wind, large waves.

Temperature on the 24th: Highest 60.9 degrees, lowest 55.2 degrees.

### Foreign Cases Tried According to Law with Impartiality; Criticism of Prisons is an Exaggeration

[Our Report] The "Millard's Review" published an article "Chinese Courts," criticizing Chinese courts and prisons. Initially, the president of the District Court issued a statement, followed by a lengthy article from the High Court's Secretariat titled "After Reading the 'Chinese Courts' Editorial by the Shanghai Millard's Review," with thousands of words, mainly stating: The "Zang Da Erzi case," the "Rogers case," the "Xi Zhi corruption case," and the "Foreign Tiger case" were all tried according to law without any partiality. Regarding the prison and detention center, it is true that heating is not provided in winter, due to the high cost of fuel in recent years. Even the court offices do not have heating. Although the facilities cannot be compared to those of wealthy countries, it is an exaggeration to say that prolonged detention leads to death. The equipment at Tilanqiao Prison is rarely seen even in Europe and America. Foreign detainees receive extra attention regarding their diet and living conditions due to their different habits. Regarding the claim of using tips to secure better prison cells, it was said that it is "occasionally heard of," and sincere and strict investigations have been conducted, with repeated announcements urging litigants and lawyers to cooperate with the court and not give tips to prevent corruption.

[Another Report] The "Millard's Review" of this city previously wrote an editorial titled "Chinese Courts" criticizing the Chinese judicial system, which attracted attention from all sides. Yesterday, the "Millard's Review" wrote another article to explain, stating that it did not despise the Chinese judicial system and expressed regret for the previous misunderstanding.

### Traveler at the Orient Hotel; Dispute Over a Sent Sum of Money

[Our Report] Qing Ru Yi, a senior official of the National Defense Ministry's News Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 22nd and checked into room 218 of the Orient Hotel with Commissioner Liu. At the time, he had a suitcase containing 30 million yuan in public funds. He gave it to waiter Rong Desheng to take to the accounting room and deposit it with staff member Li Peiqing. Qing opened it for Li to see, indicating that it was all cash, and then sealed it with a paper strip. However, the next morning, when Qing and others went to withdraw money for shopping, they discovered that 2 million yuan was missing in legal tender. They reported this to the police station for investigation. Li Peiqing and Rong Desheng were summoned to the station. According to Li's statement: Although the suitcase was opened during the deposit, both parties did not count the money, and the seal was intact. Rong stated that he only helped carry the suitcase to the accounting room and knew nothing else. The branch bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### A Middle-Aged Woman; Plays the Pipa for Another

Negotiations for Transfer Proceed as Desired

[Our Report] Zhang Juzhen, a 43-year-old woman from Changzhou, lived in Wusong Town. Her husband, Chen Akang, divorced her five years ago due to unemployment. Subsequently, Juzhen lived with Chen Xingsheng (50 years old) at No. 9 Chenjiazhai in the town, and their relationship was good. However, a month ago, Juzhen came to Shanghai for something and met Hua Shiquan (43 years old from Wuxi, a postal worker) whom she knew before. They fell in love and she went to Hua's house at No. 13, Lane 648, Xikang Road, and did not return. On April 7th, they held an engagement ceremony somewhere and planned to hold the wedding on June 1st.

### Letters to the Editor

Editor: We were shocked to see our school listed in a news item in your esteemed newspaper on the 24th regarding a strike. After investigation, our students' attitude is pure, their understanding clear, and classes are being held as usual. There is absolutely no strike happening. We sincerely hope you will correct this. Respectfully, Yangzheng Middle School.

Dear Editor: Our school has always adhered to its educational position, cared for students, and never interfered in external affairs. Classes are held as usual every day, without any strikes or suspensions. We are writing to inform you of this and respectfully request that you investigate and correct the record. Respectfully, Jinguang Middle School.

Dear Editor: Having read the news about our school in your esteemed newspaper on the 24th, there are some discrepancies from the facts, which we hereby clarify one by one. (1) Yesterday, our association held a literary evening, and in addition to various song and dance performances, we invited well-known figures from academic circles to give speeches. Your newspaper stated that we "invited a member of the Democratic League, Mr. Pingxin, to instigate a strike," which is surprising. Our association does not know whether Mr. Pingxin is a "member of the Democratic League" and cannot clarify this for him. Furthermore, the students' strike did not start yesterday, so the so-called "instigation" is unclear. (2) The cartoons produced by the support association were reviewed before being posted and did not contain the words "Who is the murderer? The government." All students in the school can testify to this and it is easy to verify. Moreover, Qin's tearing of the cartoon occurred at about 8 PM, and the security vehicle had already arrived at the school gate. It is clear that they did not "rush to the scene after hearing the news." Many students did not even know about this incident as the evening proceeded harmoniously. The claims of "interrogation and threats" and "chaos within the school" do not match the actual situation at all. Later, the police officers crossed the fence into the school and saw that it was calm as usual, so they retreated. (3) The representatives of the department student congress represent all students. The association is elected by all students and executes the resolutions of the department student congress. If students have any objections, they can notify their grade representatives or suggest them to the association. There is no need to establish another organization. Furthermore, the organization called the "Justice and Unity Alliance" has not been heard of until now, and whether it exists is still under investigation.

We hope you will investigate and correct the above points. National Chiao Tung University Student Association, May 24.

### Reader Consultation; Legal Clarification

Xu Yuefan asks: A married B and had sons C and D. Later, A passed away. C and D were still young. B remarried, raising C and D. Her husband was E. E had sons F and G, and E, F, and G still used A's surname. A, B, and E have now passed away, and they did not divide the inheritance before their deaths. I would like to ask: (1) What is E's legal position with respect to B, C, and D? (2) Do E's sons, F and G, have the right to inherit A's property under the law? (3) Do A's sons, C and D, have the right to inherit E's property?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers]: (1) Legally, E is B's spouse and the relative of C and D (see Article 969 of the Civil Code). (2) (3) According to the provisions of Article 1040 of the Civil Code, F and G have no right to inherit A's estate, and C and D have no right to inherit E's property.

(2) Refusal to Vacate

Wang Huimei asks: I previously allowed Tang to temporarily reside in a part of my house out of friendship, stating at the time that he could only stay for one month. Unexpectedly, after Tang moved in, he refused to move out. Now, Tang is adopting a tough attitude and not keeping his promise. I want to legally recover it for my own use. How should I proceed to be legal?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] Since you did not express any intention to lease, it should be a lending nature. Even if you collect rent, its nature is only a reward for the lending of use. Since the lease relationship has not been established, you can sue for vacating. However, there should be solid proof to recover for personal use.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 24th] To discuss urgent school relief issues, the Shanxi authorities convened an emergency party, government, military, and group meeting yesterday, and invited the presidents and student representatives of various schools to attend and offer opinions.

It is hoped that the actual amount of food will be issued according to the standard of two dou and six sheng of millet, or that the price will be issued on time. (2) The treatment of teaching staff is insufficient to maintain the minimum standard of living, and it is hoped that this will be resolved in the short term.

### Strike at Various Schools in This City; Classes May Gradually Resume Within Days; Internal Conflicts Continued Yesterday

[Central News Agency] Due to the increasing number of students in this city becoming aware of the inside story of the student movement, resuming classes and protecting the school has become a common call from various schools. The majority of students advocating for resumption of classes are actively engaged in a struggle to win back the freedom to resume classes. Although "support association" members are still trying to incite, they are opposed by the majority of students in various schools and are in a state of decline. It is expected that most of the striking schools will resume classes within days, but internal conflicts in one or two schools have not yet subsided. On the middle school side, unfortunately, mutual beatings have also occurred due to the incitement of "support association" members, which is regrettable. The situation in various schools yesterday is recorded below:

Fudan

At Fudan University yesterday, most students still attended classes as usual, and most professors were present, except for a small number of students and a small number of professors who were absent. At 3 PM, the school held a school affairs meeting to discuss how to deal with the unfortunate incident of the previous day. It was decided that, in view of the current situation, the school should resume classes as soon as possible, and professors were asked to persuade students in various ways.

Shanghai Law

At Shanghai Law College, at 3:15 PM yesterday, a truck suddenly brought more than 30 students from outside the school, distributing leaflets, posting cartoons and slogans, and convening a student meeting. At that time, the school was in class. Most students were unwilling to participate, which made the atmosphere tense. After receiving the report, the North Sichuan Road Police Branch Bureau, led by Section Chief Wang, went to the scene. When the police army drove to the school gate, the school gate had been closed, two gunshots were fired from inside the school, and bricks were thrown from inside the school. Section Chief Wang asked Dean Feng Yi about the situation. After discussion, it was decided that the school would send someone to check whether there were any students from outside the school remaining in the school. It was found that all students from outside the school had left a few minutes before the police army arrived. The police officers left the school and returned to the bureau at 4:25.

Jiaotong University

The resumption of classes movement at Jiaotong University has been actively launched yesterday thanks to the efforts of the Justice and Unity Alliance of the school's students. The department heads were also simultaneously persuading students to return to class. Principal Wu of the school issued a notice yesterday afternoon, hoping that students would not go to other schools to hold meetings and propaganda, and refused students from other schools to come to the school to hold meetings and propaganda, and hoped that students would accept the advice and resume classes starting next Monday (the 26th). It was also learned that the school's "Department Representative Assembly" decided to go on a hunger strike for one day this Sunday (the 25th) to support the "Nanjing Incident", but the students were not consulted in advance, which was opposed by most students. After inquiring with the person in charge of the dining group, the student union announced that the hunger strike had been postponed."

Datung

According to the news of Datung University, at 8 AM yesterday, a few students tried to instigate a strike, and blocked the classrooms and cut the phone, the majority of students advocated for class expressed dissatisfaction. The "Anti-Strike Movement Committee" was organized, and the advocacy of upper legs was thoroughly implemented. The classes continued in the afternoon, and the order was as usual.

Great China

Students at Datong University sorted out their desks and chairs and tore off all unnecessary slogans yesterday in preparation for resuming classes tomorrow. However, they still firmly demanded that the eight demands for reforming school administration be implemented. The student union classmates remained at school to work. The whole school professors were visited by classmates and requested to resume classes, most of them accepted.

Aurora

At 10 AM yesterday, two trucks of students from outside the school suddenly arrived at Aurora University to post slogans, distribute leaflets, propagate strikes, and convened meetings. At that time, the students of the school were in class and expressed their refusal. The students left angrily.

Shanghai Medical

Students at Shanghai Medical College launched a school protection movement yesterday, propagating the resumption of classes, and distributed "Letter to Students" and "Letter to Parents". Most students expressed their response, and the school is expected to resume classes in one or two days.

Aurora

Yesterday morning, dozens of medical students from Aurora University went to propagate the strike. After discussion, most students expressed regret for the unfortunate events in Nanjing, but opposed the strike, so the school continued to hold classes as usual yesterday.

Law and Politics

Shanghai Law and Politics College also held classes as usual yesterday. A few students launched a response to the "May 20th Massacre Support Association", but the number of signatories was very small. The student union held a meeting at 3 PM yesterday to discuss maintaining their own studies and maintaining the school's glory, and decided not to take strike action, and rejected students from outside the school to propagate at the school, or use pressure to threaten.

Shanghai Business

A part of the students of Shanghai Business College responded to the "May 20 Massacre Support Association". Yesterday, students were forced to sign a strike. As a result, only more than 100 people signed. According to the entire school, there are about 400 people. Some newspapers claimed that more than 10 students met to respond to the strike, which was a false rumor. The school was still in class as usual yesterday.

Normal School for Young Children

Yesterday, more than 30 students from the National Infant Normal School, the China Vocational School, and the China Institute of Technology went to the school to propagate the strike. At that time, the situation was slightly chaotic, causing the school to suspend classes invisibly.

Renyi

After the strike the day before yesterday, most of the students of Renyi Middle School launched an anti-strike yesterday and distributed leaflets. As a result, four classes were in session, and three classes were still not in session.

New Construction

[Another Dispatch] At New Construction Middle School, "students who supported the strike" and "students who did not support the strike" had a mutual fight in the morning.

Tongde

The Anti-Strike Committee of Tongde Medical College issued a quick report today. The news of the student union of the school published in a certain newspaper yesterday was purely fictitious, because the school has no organization of student unions. The school held classes as usual yesterday, except for a few two or thirty students who were absent.

Chung Te

The Chung Te Midwifery School resumed full classes today.

Huaguang

Yao Bohua, a junior high school student in the third grade of Huaguang Middle School, residing at No. 57 Chongqing South Road, was spreading reactionary leaflets with his classmates near Taichang Road, Huangpo South Road at 4:20 PM yesterday. He was seen by the post police of the Songshan Road Police Branch Bureau and taken into the bureau. Later, his father, Yao Yinquan, was summoned and handed over to him for custody.

Nantung

Yesterday morning, while the Nantung Institute was in class, more than 10 students from Shanghai Medical College broke in and made noise, posted slogans everywhere, and incited strikes, occupying the school's auditorium to hold a meeting. A "Nantung Institute Nanjing Massacre Support Association" also appeared, but all the classmates achieved that the establishment of the "Support Association" was not through legal procedures, and it suddenly appeared, of course, it could not be recognized, and the behavior such as strikes was even more absurd for abandoning studies, and they rose up against it. The propaganda students from Shanghai Medical University saw that it could not take effect and left immediately.

### Launching a Blitzkrieg to Popularize Mass Education

— Chen Heqin

In this day and age, you can't afford to do anything step by step!

Everything must be done quickly, intensified, and accelerated. Work that would normally take twice as long must be completed in one hour. This is the economy of time, the economy of manpower, and everything in accordance with the principles of economy.

The authorities' intention in launching this mass education campaign in this city is to enable all citizens, including adults and children, to become literate within a reasonable period. This is clearly an attempt, and we cannot deny, nor can we deny in fact, that this is a relatively arduous task. However, everyone participating in the work is already doing it, and everyone is happy to accept this "sacred and great" mission.

The "reasonable period" within which the work of making all citizens of this city literate is to be completed undoubtedly refers to a period that is not very long. This is because, in fact, we do not have much time, manpower, material resources, and financial resources to engage in this work. This means that we must accelerate the launch of this mass education movement under the principle of "all economy."

Education is a right that every citizen should have. Similarly, teaching illiterate people is a duty that every literate person should fulfill. I am confident, and I think everyone can be confident, that making illiterate people literate and teaching illiterate people to read will certainly be mutually agreeable and mutually pleasing. The question is how to do it quickly! Quickly and effectively!

This is a matter of method, that is, a technical matter. However, "quick" here does not mean chaotic, but rather a regulated and reasonable quickness.

Let's start with the teaching methods:

First, do not be constrained by form. In other words, the old methods do not necessarily have to be used, such as the way classes were organized in the past, or the school system, because these fixed methods can easily make learners feel bored and lose interest.

Second, the methods should be varied and adaptable, constantly changing to integrate learning with life, ensuring at least a 70-80% chance of success.

Third, make the most of the "teach as you know" method.

Here, I would like to recommend the "relay teaching method" or "literacy chain," which is a method of delivering education to people's doorsteps. It not only avoids the difficulties that arise in "classroom teaching," but also expands classroom teaching, allowing education to expand in a chain or relay, both universally and deeply. For example, if I teach four people, those four people can then teach others what I have taught them. By teaching in this relay, there is no worry that this mass education campaign will not be completed one day. However, there are some points that need to be noted when using this method:

(1) The first group of teachers must truly understand what they are teaching.

(2) The teachers and learners must be mutually established on the basis of affection.

(3) The teachers and learners should have frequent opportunities to gather together.

(4) A method of assessment should be established to measure the teachers and learners.

(5) The curriculum, time, and methods should all be determined and followed jointly by the teachers and learners.

Delivering education to people's doorsteps is indeed the most appropriate and effective way to promote mass education. The worry is not that illiterate people do not want to learn, but that literate people do not act. I hope that this time, the mobilization of all intellectuals in the city (including students in the upper grades of primary school and above, school staff, shop clerks, and literate friends in each household) to participate in the work will especially emphasize that we would rather sacrifice a little and deliver education to people's doorsteps, to the doorstep of every illiterate friend. We must promote the relay teaching method to every corner of the city. To complete a dense literacy network everywhere, no illiterate person can escape this campaign.

If we want to encourage this method, I suggest that we spend a little money to make some identifiable souvenirs, such as badges, etc., that everyone participating in the work, whether teachers or learners, can have, or use a symbol for each person taught, so that the more students one has, the more souvenirs one has.

Next, let's talk about the teaching content and class time:

First, of course, start with literacy education. Use the mass textbooks from the past if they are usable, and revise them if they are not suitable. It is best to compile a set of textbooks that cover about 1,000 commonly used characters. Use them while revising them. The number of subjects does not matter, but singing is essential.

Second, this mass education campaign must take into account the burdens of the people. At least, we cannot hinder their work. Therefore, the class time must be reduced according to the circumstances, and the length of the study period can also be shortened appropriately. For example, if classes are usually held six nights a week, we might try holding classes three nights a week, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This way, adults and women can take turns receiving education, which is economical in terms of both time and space.

Third, make the most of activities with educational significance to increase interest in learning.

Fourth, textbooks alone are not enough. Supplementary reading materials such as thousand-character newspapers should be compiled and printed to instill knowledge of world events and daily life.

Regarding the organizational structure, the simpler the better. It is easier to achieve results from the bottom up. Therefore, first, we must cooperate with administrative facilities and strengthen the launch of this movement through administrative organizations. District offices and baojia organizations are the biggest and best help. Second, each promotion district should be the organization in charge of promotion and mobilization. If we rely solely on this organization, it is indeed not enough. It is best to establish organizations such as the Bao Mass Education Promotion Association in each bao, with the bao chief, bao secretary, and principals of schools in the bao serving as members, responsible for planning and implementing. The former is a design, assessment, and guidance organization, while the latter is an implementing organization.

It is also necessary to give those engaged in this sacred and great work some encouragement. If we cannot make any material demands, then spiritual encouragement is necessary. For example, to encourage students to participate, we might ask schools to set up as many free places as possible, or ask enthusiastic members of society to donate scholarships. To reward educators participating in this work, the authorities could stipulate a method whereby anyone participating in the work would have their salary increased by a certain percentage after a certain period of time, or organize group trips, or distribute movie tickets to major cinemas, or publicize them in major newspapers, or have the mayor, bureau director, and other officials regularly meet with outstanding individuals. These are all methods, and everything can be decided at any time.

Participating in this work is like participating in a battle! As a combatant, you must have 120,000 points of confidence, 120,000 points of courage, and 120,000 points of perseverance in order to grasp victory. This battle only allows for victory, not defeat! We should seize the opportunity and accelerate the launch of a blitzkrieg to popularize mass education!

### Various People's Organizations in Zhejiang Province Urge Students to Return to Classes and Demand that the Government Be Responsible for Maintaining Order

[Central News Agency Hangzhou 24th] Various people's organizations in Zhejiang Province recently issued a letter to students of various schools, stating: The cause of this student unrest is purely that students have made petitions and suggestions for the improvement of current educational facilities. The motives are pure and the goals are clear, and public opinion is largely sympathetic. Unexpectedly, the situation has evolved and become complex and widespread, emotions have become nearly radical, actions have become extreme, and the situation has become unmanageable. Public order has disintegrated, and the hearts of the people have been shaken. The sympathy that people from all walks of life had in the past will turn into aversion today. This is probably something that most pure students did not expect, and it is also something that parents of students are uneasy about day and night. The letter also demands that the government be responsible for maintaining order and ensuring the sacred responsibility of public security. It also demands that students immediately return to classes and intensify their efforts to enrich the true knowledge of strengthening the country in order to build society and build the country.

### Even the Giants are Defeated: The Expedition Wheel Wins Six out of Six, Maintaining Victory at 47 to 40

[Our Newspaper] The Luoyang Expeditionary Army's Expedition Wheel basketball team continued to maintain its winning record, defeating the Western Overseas Chinese powerhouse Giants last night by a score of 47 to 40. In the first half, Expedition Wheel took the lead with a score of 23 to 14. The Municipal Gymnasium did not see a decrease in excitement due to the wind and rain; the enthusiasm was still fervent, with an estimated 2,000 fans. This was the first time the Expedition team's games had seen such a grand occasion, with 1,290 tickets sold and many people attending without tickets. This shows that the Expedition team is no longer what it used to be, and its appeal is quite considerable. Before the game, there was also the first final of the Mayor's Cup junior group, where the China-France team came from behind to defeat the Green Heroes 25 to 20.

Demonstrating Sharpshooting

The Expedition Wheel team continued to demonstrate its sharpshooting last night, combined with its unique talent and even development among its forwards. Although its passing and connection have not yet reached their peak, the hard work it has put in over the years has yielded considerable results. The ferocious Giants finally bowed their heads and succumbed once again. Giant player Founique, who has been present at every Expedition Wheel game, observing from the sidelines, was still overwhelmed by the Expedition Wheel team last night. From then on, the Western Youth brotherhood all suffered defeat, and the Expedition team's heroic spirit is unparalleled. Tu Wenlong only started showing his skill in the second half, and Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi rivaled each other. Liu Wang guarded his position responsibly. The Giants' most ferocious players were Founique, Yelong, and Taublingki. Their formation was also frequently adjusted. Although they launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, scoring two more points than the Expedition Wheel team, they were unable to salvage the situation.

Determined to Win

The Giant team members arrived at the stadium in two batches. The timer sounded the horn at 7:15. The referees were Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng. Taublingki received a flag from Cai Zhongqi of the Expedition Wheel team. The starting lineups for both sides were: Giants - Taublingki, Qiang Dulai, Founique, Yelong, N. Sashkin; Expedition Wheel - Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqi, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan. N. Sashkin scored one point from a free throw immediately after taking the court due to a foul by Yu Ruizhang. Yelong and Wang Binghuan both missed free throws. Yu made a shot from the right corner, and the crowd cheered enthusiastically. Although Founique, "The Board Door," blocked Tu Wenlong, he still managed to throw the ball into the basket. Qiang Dulai and Founique tried to support the situation, but Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi's successes made the score 10 to 5, a difference of double within ten minutes. Cai and Founique rivaled each other, and Tu Wenlong's single-arm shot was another masterpiece. At 15 to 9, Xuan Jiemilov replaced Yelong. Because the Expedition Wheel team was determined to win, they were overly nervous and frequently committed fouls, and also often faced the sharpshooter Founique. At 17 to 14, Yelong was replaced by Qiang Dulai, and the Giants took their third timeout. Yu and Cai each made contributions, while the Giants seemed at a loss. The first half ended with the Expeditionary Army leading by nine points, 23 to 14.

Giants Bow Their Heads

After a ten-minute break, the battle resumed. Kaijiemilov replaced Founique. Yu Ruizhang stood out. Yelong and Taublingki added three points. At 25 to 17, Founique and Qiang Dulai alternated. Tao and Yelong chased fiercely, making the score 27 to 22, getting closer and closer. Founique groped unsuccessfully under the basket. Yu and Cai added two more balls. V. Kairos replaced Xuan Jiemilov, and he and Yelong repeatedly scored empty basket shots. Who knew that Tu Wenlong would also contribute a smooth shot? Later, because of a dispute with Founique, he was penalized and left the court, at which time the score was 44 to 30. The last four minutes were at 46 to 34. Yelong advanced and N. Sashkin "graduated." Qiang Dulai went down again. The two armies held each other even more fiercely. The four minutes passed in the blink of an eye. At 47 to 40, Expedition Wheel won its sixth battle. Zhengtai Rubber Factory presented each Expedition Wheel team member with a pair of new basketball shoes, which the team said contributed greatly to their success last night.

### On the Expedition Wheel's Victory Over the Giants: Quick Movements, Reliable Shooting

Given the Giants' lineup last night, the Expedition Wheel should have won easily. The fact that they were caught in a difficult fight was truly unexpected.

The main reason for the Expedition Wheel's victory was their quick movements, which targeted the Giants' weaknesses, forcing the opponent to simply follow them.

In terms of overall team chemistry, the Giants surpassed the Expedition Wheel, and the Giants' efforts to win the ball under the basket, relying on the steadiness of Founique and Taublingki, led to a balanced situation. At one point in the second half, the score became 28-24.

The Expedition Wheel's defense was tight. As soon as the ball fell into the hands of the enemy, the entire team immediately returned to the defense. This agility is unparalleled in Shanghai.

Tu Wenlong's sharpshooting was slightly off, but Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi showed their skills to the fullest. The Expedition Wheel has three shooters. If one is off, the impact is not great. Based on several games, the Expedition Wheel's shooting percentage can be said to be consistently at a fairly high level, which is still a reliable condition for defeating the enemy.

The Expedition Wheel players all have amazing strength. The point at which they shoot the ball is, on average, farther than most teams. Although the audience may not be used to it, it is actually where they have an advantage. They do not need to deliberately break into the enemy's defense, and can shoot from outside the enemy's zone if necessary. First-time viewers may think they are "taking a chance," but their shooting percentage tells you not to doubt it. (Changnian)

### Allotment of Quota-Exceeding Foreign Cotton for May to July This Year is Completed - All Spinning Mills Should Expedite Ordering from Imported Cotton Merchants

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Foreign Cotton Allotment Committee of the Transportation Management Committee has recently completed the allotment of quota-exceeding foreign cotton for May to July of this year based on the number of operating spindles of each spinning mill. According to an official from the committee, the points to note for this allotment of foreign cotton are three: (1) Principles for the distribution of quota-exceeding foreign cotton for the second quarter: (A) The standard is a quota of US$20 million, equivalent to 100,000 bales of foreign cotton. (B) Spinning mills with equipment of less than 3,000 spindles that do not spin 20-count cotton yarn or higher will not be allotted foreign cotton. However, the cotton yarn spun by these mills will also not be purchased. (2) Each spinning mill allotted foreign cotton is expected to quickly place orders with registered and qualified imported cotton merchants. The foreign cotton allotment certificates can be issued to each mill according to the number, in order to apply for import permits. (3) The US government currently stipulates that special subsidies will be given as an incentive for US cotton shipped before June 30 of this year. Shipments after that date will not only not receive subsidies but will also be fined, so it is hoped that ordering and shipping procedures will be carried out as soon as possible.

Number of Bales of Foreign Cotton Allotted to Each Mill

### National Bank Denies Issuance of Parallel Line Checks

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Recently, it has been rumored in the market that the Central Bank will issue so-called parallel line checks or fixed-amount promissory notes, etc. According to the person in charge of the bank, the rumors are completely unfounded. However, recently, the government has been handling loans for the purchase of spring cocoons. In order to meet the needs of rural areas, the original plan was to issue promissory notes to farmers who needed to buy cloth, with which to pick up the goods. Later, in order to avoid complicated procedures, it was decided to issue cloth delivery notes directly, without using promissory notes. The misunderstanding in the market may have arisen from this.

### Hong Kong Promulgates New Export Methods

[Reuters Hong Kong, 24th] The Hong Kong government, in view of the fact that most of the foreign exchange obtained by exporters is not handed over to the government for allocation, but is sold on the black market with New York bank drafts, promulgated new methods today, stipulating that exporters must sign a statement when applying for export licenses to the Americas and the Philippines, stating that the foreign exchange obtained from exports will be handed over to a certain bank stated in the application, otherwise the export license will not be issued.

### Plentiful Taiwan Sugar Reserves Eliminate Sugar Black Market; Large Quantities of Granulated Sugar Soon to be Shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai

Since its establishment, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has consistently adhered to the Social Bureau's price-controlled rationing of sugar. According to a spokesperson for the company, the sugar black market in this city has now been completely eliminated. The company's current sugar rationing policy aims to increase the rationed price as much as possible, while maximizing the rationed quantity. With sugar merchants receiving ample sugar through rations, they no longer need to purchase from the black market, and black market transactions have gradually decreased.

Current sugar reserves exceed 600,000 bags, an absolutely plentiful amount. Agreements have already been reached with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to charter the "Haiping," "Haihu," and "Hailong" ships to transport sugar from Keelung. It is estimated that these three large ships can carry 10,000 tons of granulated sugar and 1,000 bags of crystal sugar, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of the month.

Furthermore, to expand its business, the company will be specially launching packaged sugar next month. This packaged sugar will come in two sizes, five pounds and ten pounds, and will be retailed through major department stores, at prices still lower than market prices.

Yesterday, the sugar market trended steadily, with fluctuations. The Sugar Merchants' Association's open trading showed initial weakness followed by strength for Peruvian sugar, priced at 400,500 to 409,000 yuan, later reaching 412,000 yuan, a gain of 4,000 yuan. No. 20 medium white sugar remained at 370,000 yuan. Three and a half trucks of white sugar, with sellers offering 100 bags, were priced at 380,000 yuan. Recycled Qing sugar was trading at 265,000 to 263,000 yuan, a slight decrease of 5,000 yuan. Shun Tak Qing sugar, with sellers offering several dozen bags, was priced at 255,000 yuan, showing a similar decline. Scattered transactions of Diao Qing sugar were at 240,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar at 380,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 280,000 yuan, with fewer than one hundred transactions.

### De-listed Sugar Merchants Allowed to Resume Rationing

After over seventy sugar merchants in this city were deemed ineligible by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and had their sugar rationing rights revoked, the Sugar Merchants' Association consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to conduct a re-examination in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It has been reported that this review was completed last week, and after careful review in recent days, it was determined that the internal organization of over twenty of these merchants was still acceptable. Considering their commercial difficulties, they were initially granted small-scale sugar rationing rights to observe their future performance. As for the remaining fifty-odd merchants, to avoid overlooking any deserving cases, a third investigation will be conducted starting next Monday to ensure thoroughness.

### Tea Merchants Requesting Tea Leaf Purchases

National Bank Requests Review from the Four Banks Joint Treasury

Tea merchants, facing difficulties in exporting tea leaves, have specially requested loans from the Central Bank for purchasing tea leaves, which will then be uniformly exported by the China Tea Corporation. These requests were sent to the Central Bank yesterday. According to responsible authorities at the Central Bank, they express deep sympathy for the tea merchants' difficulties and have decided to provide assistance. However, whether they can fulfill the tea merchants' hopes remains uncertain, as the matter still requires review by the Four Banks Joint Treasury.

It is understood that earlier this year, as the Ministry of Finance could not bear the profits and losses of purchasing tea leaves, the Central Bank consulted with the Farmers Bank of China, which agreed to increase tea leaf collateral loans. At that time, the standard predetermined loan amount was 80% of the new tea collateral price, with Qi Hong tea at 480,000 yuan, Tunlu tea at 400,000 yuan, and Pinglu tea at 320,000 yuan. Due to recent fluctuations in tea prices, the tea merchants hope to raise the purchase price, adding expenses since May to the above prices as the lowest possible purchase price, with the government responsible for the profits and losses. If this is not approved, they will seek alternative solutions.

In other news, concerning the Ping Shui tea that is typically favored by North and South America, the Wu Chang Tea Company inquired about the 1946 vintage yesterday. However, their prices were exceptionally harsh, insisting on around 400,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), while the sellers were reluctant to part with their goods due to cost considerations, resulting in a continued stalemate. Other teas remained unasked for, and the market remained quiet with a feeling of uncertainty. As for the various domestic teas, price changes were minimal, with a stable mentality focused on fulfilling any demand.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Tianxiang Trading Company's "Haimen Special" departed Shanghai for Europe today, carrying 6,600 boxes of tea leaves to France, 270 barrels of cottonseed oil to Spain, 70 bales of cotton yarn to Port Said, and 200 bales of cotton yarn to Harding.

### Huizhou: A Revolutionary City

— Guangzhou, 21st via airmail; Reported by Liang Feng, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper

Huizhou – a revolutionary city; anyone with even a slight understanding of modern history or China's heroic history should not find it to be a foreign place. It was discovered around the Song Dynasty, because Su Shi (Dongpo), the scholar known throughout the land in the time of Emperor Shenzong of Song for his prose, calligraphy, and painting, was demoted to the city of Huizhou after disagreeing with Wang Anshi. He spent a period of time here, leading a carefree life filled with poetry and wine, creating many immortal poems that have been passed down through the ages. As such, this place gained its fame because of this individual. After the founding of the Republic, due to the beautiful mountains and rivers, it bred many revolutionary patriots. The two honored gentlemen, Liao Zhongkai and Deng Zhongyuan, were born here. In particular, during the Northern Expedition of the Whampoa Military Academy's student army in 1925, a glorious and splendid page in revolutionary history was written here, laying the foundation for the revolution. As such, this famous city, which once radiated the light of revolution, has become a scenic destination admired by future generations.

This time, because of the completion of the Ma'anwei, I, as a reporter, accompanied Chairman Luo Zhuoying and a group of colleagues, and in addition to viewing the great water conservancy project of the Ma'anwei, we also took a two-day tour of this revolutionary place, which can be considered a very pleasant experience.

Feie Ridge, a Natural Barrier

We departed from Guangzhou by train, taking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for about two hours, and got off at the central station of Zhangmutou. There, a highway connects to the railway station, running from Zhangmutou to Huiyang. This highway spans the two counties of Dongguan and Huiyang, with a total length of thirteen kilometers. Public buses carry passengers back and forth, and the fares are not too expensive, costing only 8,000 yuan per person for the entire journey. The road surface is still relatively flat, and the scenery along the way is good, with fields and mountains that are green and pleasing to the eye. After driving for about an hour, we saw a majestic high mountain standing in front of us. This is the historically famous Feie Ridge, the natural barrier to the west of Huizhou city. The terrain is treacherous. Throughout history, armies attempting to take Huizhou by land had to seize this stronghold in order to control the entire city from a high vantage point. Hence, it is known as a strategically vital location. We bypassed the foot of Feie Ridge, and within a few minutes, we reached our destination. The entirety of this revolutionary city, and the panoramic view of the historically famous West Lake of Huizhou, was completely within our sight.

Huizhou City Faces the River and Rests Against the Mountains

"Huizhou" was simply the name of the prefecture government from the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. After the founding of the Republic, it was incorporated into Huiyang County, so Huizhou City is now Huiyang City. However, due to historical reasons, people still call it Huizhou City. If we look at the map, we can see that Huiyang is a coastal county in southern China, located in the lower reaches of the East River in Guangdong Province. Facing the river and resting against the mountains, its geographical features are naturally formed. It has always been an important outer stronghold of Guangzhou. During the War of Resistance, when the Japanese army invaded from the south, they first landed in Daya Bay in the county, using this as a base to advance towards Guangzhou. The local military and civilians rose up to resist the enemy, and Huizhou City was gained and lost four times. This shows the importance of this place. After the victory, the administrative commissioner's office of the Fourth Administrative Region of Guangdong Province was also established in Huizhou City, because it could guard the South China Sea and the East River to protect Guangzhou. The current commissioner's office within the city is the former site of the Guangdong Land Admiral's Office of the Qing Dynasty. On the central beam of the roof of the commissioner's large auditorium, we saw the inscription "Rebuilt in the tenth year of the Tongzhi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty by Wei Zuobang, the Gan Yong Baturu, General of the Yangjiang Prefecture and Commander of the Guangdong Land Forces." The fact that such a high-ranking military organization was not located in Guangzhou but in Huizhou shows that it did not ignore the military value of this place.

Visiting the Feng Lake, a Paradise on Earth

The most endearing aspect of our trip was the West Lake of Huizhou. It is one of the most famous scenic areas in the province. According to historical records, it was originally named Feng Lake. Because it was located west of the prefecture, people also called it West Lake. Its scenery is similar to that of West Lake in Hangzhou. However, locals say that West Lake in Hangzhou is merely an artificial beauty, while West Lake in Huizhou has a unique natural splendor. Although this statement may seem self-congratulatory, it is indeed a good place to visit. We drifted in a small boat on the lake, taking in the scenery. Among the sights were "Hundred Flower Island," "Fragrant Grass Island," "Liudan Pavilion," "Filial Son Xiang," "Xuanmiao Temple," as well as "Wild Goose Pagoda in the Evening Sun" and "Red Cotton Waterside Pavilion," all of which are indeed famous scenic spots with unique natural charm. I visited West Lake three times in two days, once even after dusk. At this time, everything was silent, and the night was cool as water. We lay on our backs in the boat, looking up at the stars and listening to the sounds of insects, which was an especially pleasant experience.

Dongpo's Concubine Chaoyun's Ancient Tomb

There is a "Su Causeway" on the lake, said to have been built by Su Dongpo. When he was demoted to Huizhou, he bought this area as a fish release pond and built a dam to hold back the water, so later generations named it "Su Causeway." In addition, there is also the "Tomb of Chaoyun," Su Dongpo's concubine, which is also a famous place. The tomb was rebuilt by Prefect Yi Bingshou during the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, and it is still not very old. The inscription on the tombstone reads "Tomb of Wang Chaoyun, concubine of Su Wenzhong Gong," and there are many inscriptions by famous historical figures in the surrounding area. There are two couplets at the tomb entrance that are worth reciting. The first is: "When coming from the South Sea, scripture scrolls and medicine furnace, a hundred-foot river tower flying willow catkins; after Dongpo left, night lamps and immortal pagoda, a pavilion of bright moon and cold plum blossoms," written by Chen Wei during the Guangxu reign. The other is by Xu Qi of the Guangxu reign: "The fragrant tomb still seems alive, a small plot of land is enough to make the mountains and rivers important; the jade ridge is clear and sleepless, sometimes the sound of jade pendants comes from the sky." After reading them, one cannot help but feel envy for the romantic and unrestrained scholar Dongpo, and extend infinite sympathy to the meager Chaoyun.

Five-Arch Bridge, Revolutionary Historical Site

At the northern end of the lake, there is a bridge called the Five-Arch Bridge, next to which stands a memorial碑 that is not very tall. This is the memorial碑 for the Whampoa Army's attack on the city. Here, there is a very heroic revolutionary historical site: In 1922, Chen Jiongming rebelled in Guangdong, using Huizhou as a base to attempt to capture Guangzhou. At that time, Sun Yat-sen sent troops to suppress the rebellion, but they were repeatedly unsuccessful. It was not until 1925 that Chiang Kai-shek (who was then a staff officer) personally commanded the student army of the Whampoa Military Academy, fighting hard for a month before finally occupying Feie Ridge. However, the defending army in the city was still strong, stubbornly resisting within the city. The city was surrounded by water, and the only connection to the city was the Five-Arch Bridge. The defending army heavily fortified this passage, causing great losses to the attacking Whampoa revolutionary army. Regiment Commander Liu Yaochen was killed in action here. Later, Chiang Kai-shek made the greatest determination, boosting the morale of the remaining troops, and under the drive of澎湃 revolutionary enthusiasm, they risked danger, bravely sacrificed themselves, and finally crossed the Five-Arch Bridge. Using people as ladders, they climbed up the city wall, and the staunch defending army was scattered at the first blow. From then on, the National Revolutionary Army laid an unshakable foundation and completed its great historical mission. Mr. Liang Jingqiu, a local revolutionary elder who had participated in the Huanghuagang Uprising, recounted the situation of the revolutionary army's attack on the city to us in a vivid and colorful way. Their great spirit of sacrifice is truly worthy of infinite admiration. Many of the high-ranking officials currently holding important military and political posts are believed to have participated in this battle. General Luo Zhuoying was one of them. However, Chairman Luo said that he was just a low-ranking artillery officer at the time.

Commercial Prosperity as a Distribution Center

In addition to enjoying the scenery of the lake, we also conducted brief visits to various aspects of this famous city. In addition to being a famous historical site and a military stronghold, it also has considerable economic value. Because it is located in the lower reaches of the East River, it is a thoroughfare for goods entering the province from Chaozhou and Shantou. Goods from the upper reaches of the East River are distributed here, and merchants gather in large numbers, making commerce prosperous. There are about twenty or thirty hotels in the city, which are almost always fully occupied by merchants from various places who come to purchase goods. The bustling atmosphere of the market here can be imagined. Moreover, the county has many harbors. If the fishing industry there can be greatly developed, it is believed that it will greatly contribute to the economic development of Guangdong Province. Local education is also quite developed. The county has ten middle schools, 386 primary schools, and more than 37,000 students. As for public security, this is a serious problem in the area. Previously, the communist army's so-called East River Column was concentrated in the Pingshan area of the county. Since the "Northern Withdrawal," the remnants, disguised as bandits, robbed and harmed the local population. Recently, the leader of the team, Zeng Sheng, secretly returned and has taken more organized actions, sabotaging government orders, obstructing grain and labor administration, disrupting the market, and harassing the villages, causing the people to suffer greatly. Although General Huang Zheng, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth Administrative Region stationed there, is an experienced old general, and many of the more organized bandits have been eliminated under his combination of suppression and pacification, the local area can generally be said to be more peaceful than before. However, sporadic bandits are still causing trouble everywhere, so the public security problem in the East River, although not very serious, cannot be said to be completely non-existent.

### Northeastern Communist Army Strength Still Largely Preserved, Recklessly Launches Full-Scale Offensive on the Periphery of Changchun

— Changchun, 10th via airmail; Zhao Zhan, Reporter for this Newspaper

It has long been evident that the Communist army in the Northeast is intentionally making a high-stakes gamble. This spring, they launched four large-scale southward offenses, suffering extremely heavy losses! It is estimated that of the 200,000 soldiers, over 50,000 were lost, including some highly skilled units. Although the Communist army has suffered repeated defeats, their ambitions remain undeterred. The battles in the Liuhe area along the Jilin-Qingyuan line, directed by Hua Te from mid-March to early April, can be said to be the finale of the Communist army's tentative harassment in the spring. Small-scale incursions still occur from time to time, and it is possible that new offensives will develop soon.

The Communist army uses "North Manchuria," a vast and complex terrain, as its base, with its command headquarters in Harbin and its arsenals in Jiamusi. In eastern Jilin and northern Andong, east of the Jilin-Qingyuan line, the Communist army uses the Changbai Mountains as cover, engaging in disruptive harassment. It can echo Songbei to the north, connect to Dalian to the south, and directly target the waist of the Nationalist army in the west. The terrain is quite advantageous, but the troop strength is weak. From Laoye Ridge in eastern Jilin, along the Second Songhua River to Wangfu in northwestern Nong'an, the Nationalist and Communist forces face each other across the river. After the Songhua River thaws, the Communist army is unable to launch a frontal southward offensive. Therefore, the main force of the Communist army has moved to the area west of Changchun and Nong'an, west of the Changtao Road, from Damai Fuyu southward. The Communist army is concentrated in Qian'an, Changling, and Liaoyuan, numbering about seven or eight divisions. Recently, new recruits have been transported from Harbin to Fuyu, and the railway from Damao to Wangfu is being repaired, indicating that the Communist army will launch an offensive from the west towards Changchun and Siping.

Siping's Defense Work is Strong

Chen Mingren, the commander of the Fifth District Pacification Headquarters, said, "The Communist army will target Siping." He frankly stated that the defense work in Siping has been done very well. Lü Zhengcao, the military officer in charge of this operation for the Communist army, frequently harasses the area from Liaoyuan along the arc-shaped line of the Xinliao River southwest to Kailu in Jehol, relying on "East Mongolia" as a stronghold. The Nationalist army is always vulnerable to attacks from Mongolian cavalry, but the threat is not significant.

Dalian in the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula is currently a crucial link. The Communist army has concentrated over 50,000 troops in Dalian, reportedly consisting of elite units. There is no doubt that the Communist army intends to use force to obstruct the Nationalist army from taking over Dalian. The importance of Dalian can be demonstrated by General Wang Yaowu's statement: "Receiving Dalian will allow the Shandong war to end six months earlier." It is said that the Chinese Communist Party considers Dalian to be the gateway to the entire "liberated zone." Judging from recent events, Dalian is bound to be taken over. After the final act of taking over the Liaodong Peninsula is completed, the focus of the war will be drawn to Songbei.

Analysis of the Nine Military Regions by Number

What is the strength of the Communist army in the Northeast? Based on the most recent accurate intelligence and numerical judgment: the Communist army in the Northeast has nine military regions, ten divisions, seven independent brigades, one column, one attached army, and one Korean Communist detachment. The strength of the nine military regions is about 70,000 people: the Jidong Military Region has 20,000 people, Jibei has 4,000 people, and Jinan has 2,000 people. The Liaoji Military Region has 11,000 people. The Liaoning Military Region has 10,000 people. The Suining Military Region has 6,000 people. The Jihei Military Region has 6,000 people. The Puppet Manchukuo Military Region has 8,000 people. The Songjiang Military Region has 2,000 people. The Jidong Military Region has the largest force. Of the four southward offenses by the Communist army in Songbei, the troops in this military region participated in three. The troops in this military region were involved in capturing Qitamu, Jiutai, and attacking Dehui. Only during the fourth offensive, the mobile warfare around Nong'an, did this military region remain inactive. It is rumored that there was friction between Zhou Baozhong and Lin Biao, and this was the reason. The ten divisions have a strength of about 60,000 people: the First Division has about 4,500 people and is stationed in Harbin. The Second Division has about 5,000 people and its location is unknown. The Third Division has about 4,500 people and is stationed in the Chalukou area. The Fourth Division has about 4,000 people and is stationed in Damai. The Fifth Division has 4,000 people and is stationed near Taolaizhao. The Sixth Division has 5,000 people and is stationed in the Wukeshu area. The Seventh Division is the largest, with three旅 under its command, totaling about 20,000 people. It is stationed in the areas of Wuchang, Shulan, and Baiqitun. The Eighth Division has about 3,000 people and is stationed in Dahuangou. The Ninth Division has about 4,000 people and its location is unknown. The Independent Second Division has about 5,500 people and is stationed in the Mengjiang area. The seven independent旅 have a strength of about 30,000 people: the 24th旅 has 3,000 people, the 25th旅 has 3,000 people, and they are stationed in the area east of Huadian. The Railway Police Second旅 has about 3,000 people and is stationed along the railway from Harbin to Shuangcheng. The Independent旅 has about 7,500 people and is stationed in eastern Jilin. The 38th旅 has about 5,000 people, the 47th旅 has 3,000 people, and their locations are not specified. The 359th旅 has about 5,000 people and is stationed in Fuyu. It is the Communist army's most elite backbone. It is said that the旅 Commander is concurrently held by Cao Lihuai. The Seventh Column, commanded by Wan Yi, has a strength of about 30,000 people and is responsible for field operations. Its mobility is very high and it is currently likely stationed in the Changling area. The attached First Army of the Democratic League and the Korean Communist detachment have a strength of about 15,000 people and their location is unknown. The total strength of the listed units is about 200,000 people. Adding the 50,000 people in Dalian and other armed work teams, the total strength of the Communist army in the Northeast is about 300,000 people. (Editor's note: According to a report from this newspaper in Shenyang on the 20th, a military official stated that the current offensive by the Communist army in the Northeast is a full-scale operation with a force of about 500,000, indicating that the Communist army has made new deployments.)

The Communist army in the Northeast can be said to be isolated, unable to establish close contact with the Communist army in the mainland. They are trying to open up the Inner Mongolia corridor to establish contact with the Communist army in northern Shanxi, and are desperately trying to hold Dalian as a beachhead to connect with Shandong. However, this attempt will not succeed. Dalian is indefensible, and Inner Mongolia is also unreliable.

### The Mourning of the Family of the Person Killed in a Car Accident

Dear Editor:

My husband, Zheng Yuelian, was 41 years old, a native of Ningbo, and resided at No. 6, Lao Xiu Lane, Baker Road. He worked at the Ma Le Shipyard in Pudong, leaving early and returning late, relying on this work to support the family. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, he set off as usual (he often took the No. 2 streetcar from Chengdu Road Station every morning), but he did not return home in the evening. The next afternoon, someone from the factory came to inquire, thinking he was missing, so they reported it to the Xin Cheng Police Station for investigation. Later, an plainclothes police officer from that branch came to notify us, saying that on the morning of the 2nd, someone was hit by a passing vehicle and injured on the road opposite the tram stop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road. He was sent to Hongren Hospital by the police car for treatment, and they did not know if he was the missing person from our family. We rushed to visit him and found that it was indeed my husband. He had suffered a severe brain injury, his jaw was tightly clenched, and he could not speak. He died on the morning of the 5th. I inquired with the Xin Cheng Police Station about the circumstances of the accident, and the bureau replied that when he was found, the injured person was already lying on the ground and could not speak, and the vehicle that caused the accident had already fled. The bureau also did not know the true circumstances. Alas! What kind of vehicle hit him? I am sure there were eyewitnesses. I implore you to speak out righteously and send a detailed letter with the offending vehicle's details (especially the license plate number) and the circumstances of my husband's injury, so that we can pursue justice and prevent the wrong from sinking to the bottom of the sea. Both the living and the dead will be grateful! (Zheng Shiyun)

### Map of Henan Northern Refugees' Flight

— Zhengzhou 20th Dispatch (Airmail) - Our Zhengzhou Correspondent Fan Shiqin

It is said that the 400,000 refugees inside and outside Anyang City all fled for fear of the Communist Party's "struggle." We shall leave aside whether or not they are all qualified to be "struggled" against, but in fact, under the dense artillery fire of the Communist army's siege, they are being "struggled" against.

Escaping from Anyang City

Groups of people's representatives, upon arriving in Zhengzhou, burst into tears, appealing to the military authorities to send reinforcements quickly and requesting all parties to rush grain supplies, shocking the general public in Zhengzhou. This situation is like a person jumping off the roof of a house surrounded by robbers, escaping to the street, and shouting for help, frightening passersby.

Immediately Rescuing Anyang Refugees

There is only one way: to send grain by plane. The provincial government contacted an airline, and the company proposed the following conditions: 34 million yuan for a round trip to deliver grain, and if the plane encounters an accident, compensation of US$30,000 in foreign exchange, and US$50,000 in cash. The provincial government agreed to all these conditions one by one. Indeed, if it were not for valuing life with heavy prices on the one hand and saving lives with heavy prices on the other, how would the importance of human value be demonstrated!

Although things were settled, not a single plane had been sent to deliver grain as of the 17th, more than ten days after Anyang was besieged.

200,000 Refugees Around Xinxiang

According to Li Hongyin, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, at least 80,000 of them are in dire need of rescue. The Henan Northern Refugee Relief Committee was established in Xinxiang on the 10th, and at least 2,000 refugees register every day. Refugee registration is currently being conducted in 25 counties in northern Henan. If the situation in northern Henan stagnates, then the people of northern Henan will definitely have to flee like the saints of Jerusalem.

More than 25,000 refugees who took 15,000 yuan in relief funds from Xinxiang arrived in Zhengzhou. People in Zhengzhou who have relatives and friends from northern Henan have recently felt a difficult burden to bear. If they don't entertain these relatives and friends who come to their door, it is against human nature; if they do entertain them, prices are so high that they can't afford it. Of these more than 25,000 refugees, only more than 2,000 go to soup kitchens for food, and the rest live with relatives and friends. This is a good source of information for those who study Chinese social issues to prove where Chinese social relations are built. The tragic scene of joyful reunions, if it could be put on stage, would also be a very good tragicomedy.

More Than 5,000 Young Students

Filled out applications in Xinxiang and other places, expressing their willingness to come to the rear to study, and also crossed south to Zhengzhou. Students in the graduating classes of junior and senior high schools have started school; other non-graduating students, some went home, and some, after participating in several ball games in Zhengzhou, returned to northern Henan feeling bored. It is said that half of the students have flowed back. The Ministry of Education has now sent people to Zhengzhou to help these young people, but those who have been sent need to be "rescued" first, because they have not found a house after a few days and cannot work.

Prices in Zhengzhou Have Surged

I asked a refugee, "Is it okay to hide at home and not flee?" The refugee replied, "I didn't want to flee, but that day a company commander of the Eighth Route Army arrived in my hometown (countryside of Tangyin) and insisted that I leave. I said, 'If I go out today, I will starve to death tomorrow. Where can I go?' The company commander said, 'Even if you are really going to starve to death tomorrow, you have to go out today!' This was his good intention, telling all the people in our village to leave."

Now Zhengzhou Has Become

A Place Where Refugees Intertwine

Probably those coming from the east are refugees returning to the Yellow River Flood Area, and those coming from the north are refugees forced out of northern Henan by the Communist army. There are one or two thousand people each day. Their current situations are different, but the pain they can understand from each other is the same. Now there are still some Communist troops harassing the flood area, and the refugees returning to the mud area of the Yellow River Flood Area have added a shadow to their hearts that only the tearful eyes of the refugees in northern Henan can see; the hardships of the refugees in northern Henan starting their wandering can only be understood by the hearts of the refugees in the Yellow River Flood Area who have been displaced for ten years.

The Provincial Government Has Decided on a Solution

Let the six counties of Yuzhong, Xiang, Jiao, Li, Yu, Ye, and Wu settle the refugees from northern Henan, and Zhengzhou is preparing to accommodate more than 10,000 people. The most problematic thing now is food. The Zhengzhou Emergency Refugee Relief Committee wants to request the United Relief Agency to allocate some flour. The United Relief Agency already has 2,200 tons of flour in Zhengzhou, which is prepared to help the Yellow River Flood Area. But at present, the Yellow River Flood Area is also unstable, and there is no way to transport and distribute the large amount of flour. If it is allowed to spoil in Zhengzhou, it is better to distribute it to the refugees in northern Henan. Now it depends on whether the United Relief Agency is prepared to save these unfortunate people.

### On Modern French Painting: The Feeling of Emotion and Reality

— Liu Shi

If we observe the forms of all things, not as a matter of visual form, but as the form sustained by the perceptual "lines," "colors," and "planes," we may also feel the material phenomena possessed by all things, but in order to express the reality of perceptual objects, the same is true in the realm of color. Therefore, if one tends to the extreme of perceptual reality, it possesses a power like a symbol or an emblem. To illustrate this with an example, the painting work of Dadaism is like this.

Needless to say, the work of Dadaism is anarchism in painting, but this is not a doubt born of ignorance, nor a negation born of ignorance, but an extreme extension of perception.

This tendency is expressed very strongly in the Cubist painting method. The so-called Cubist painting has fully transcended the so-called visual sensation, neither regarding visual pseudo-perspective nor requiring the necessity of visual perspective. It can be said that it only wants to apply the surface of matter to a picture through perception. What Cubism feels is no longer the visual sense of painting, and there is no emotion to speak of. It can only be said that it is a respect for the Connaisauce of painting, and an extreme drive of perceptual sensibility.

Dadaism is like this, and Cubism is also like this; most of the painters of the Paris School who grew up from such a tendency in painting emphasize perceptual sensibility. For example, even though Surrealism does not have the doubt and negativity of Dadaism, there is no problem saying that they drive the obvious perceptual sensibility to the extreme, so much so that it is like a symbol or an emblem. When Surrealist painters look at things, they pay special attention to Imagination, and even try to make it transform. Therefore, the so-called emphasis on imagination seems to be contrary to perceptual sensibility, but in fact it is not contradictory. The so-called use of imagination to transform the perception of things is nothing more than promoting perceptual reality. Therefore, we can say that the spirit of realism belonging to painting and the spirit of surrealism both belong to the perceptual realism of painting.

This phenomenon can be seen in all painters of the modern Paris School who paint based on Cubism. For example, Marcel Gromaire is like this, Giorgio de Chirico is also like this, and Eouconier and Fermard Leger are also like this.

We can examine the third type of painting attitude in response to the above two types of painting sensibility. Because the painter values the feeling of emotion and wants to express the reality felt by emotion in a "painting" way, we can call it the Realite de Sentiment.

It is worth saying here that since the creation of human culture, there has never been an era that respects human emotions as much as the modern era. The so-called primitive humans all painted with this emotion as the center. They could feel God as a lamb; they would also feel love for things as a goddess. Moreover, they did not feel anything new about this emotion-centered sensibility, nor did they need anything else besides it. However, with the evolution of human culture, it is almost impossible to judge or think about things solely based on emotions. Because of that long tradition, they have almost completely forgotten the point of emphasizing emotion in paintings. But in modern times, artists have once again placed great emphasis on this emotion.

That is because modern artists have realized that the world of art is a world of sensibility; if this sensibility is discarded, it is impossible to feel the so-called beauty of art. Therefore, painters do not trust all vision, nor do they consider it necessary to explore perception, but rely solely on their unique innate emotions as the only artistic compass. The painter's observation of nature and all things is by no means merely a mechanical reflection of vision. At the very least, it can be said that it is a reflection on the painter's heart and nature or all things felt by the painter's emotions. Therefore, even if it is not possible to truly resemble nature or all things, it will not become a painting problem. What becomes a problem is whether the painter's emotions belong to painting? The so-called "belonging to painting" means that painting is purified and tailored. The painter's emotions are in fact an innate quality, spirit, and state of mind.

If a painter can express the truth felt by his emotions, then that is his most unique expression and also his most personal expression. All objects can be observed and felt by the painter, but the so-called painter's emotions are the artistic conception that each painter uniquely senses. The truth felt by emotion is truly personal and unique. In the context of wanting to express the truly personal and unique, the work of emotional writing is worth studying.

Marc Chagall wants to transform everything felt from nature into what is felt by emotion, and then express it on the screen. If he feels the deliciousness of a fish and is fond of the contents of a cup, his thoughts will definitely fly into the air. This situation may not be able to be visually observed or perceptually conceived, but it can be clearly and freely felt emotionally. He wants to express his emotions freely and truthfully without changing the original shape. Therefore, when people see this situation, they may feel a bit imaginative and fanciful (Fantustic), but Chagall does not like people to say that his paintings are fantastic. Because he never thinks it is imagination, on the contrary, he thinks it is truth, and believes that he is a realist painter.

The so-called truth about painting's emotion actually contains the meaning of a painter's hymn from the heart. The painter feels the joy of life in praising his emotions. Gearge Reault regards this emotion as something religiously solemn, while Amedeo Modigliani feels this emotion in the pleasure of the senses. All of this proves that modern French painting is neither visual nor perceptual, but only a painting trend centered on emotion.

### Jin Songcen and "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"

— Shushan

The author of "Reading A Flower in a Sinful Sea," Yan Gu Laoren, a learned scholar of Qinchuan, whose surname is Zhang, given name Hong, style Yin Nan, has recently been recorded as saying: "Some people suspect that Yan Gu Laoren is the pseudonym of Jin Songcen, a famous old gentleman from Wujiang who died not long ago, because the first three chapters of the first collection of 'A Flower in a Sinful Sea' were originally written by Jin, and later completed by the Sick Man of East Asia..." That's right, Yan Gu Laoren is not Jin Songcen, but Jin Songcen's contribution to the initial draft of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was not limited to the first three chapters.

However, most of the current novels "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" are the revised editions of 1927, which are very different from the twenty-four editions before that twenty years ago, so even the Sick Man of East Asia, Zeng Mengpu himself, is no longer clear about how much of Jin's work still exists. Not only that, since Jin was the originator of this book, he must have had a full list of sixty chapters when he drafted the writing plan at that time, and he must have had many opinions participating in it. Looking at the preface to the revised edition written later by the Sick Man of East Asia:

"The motivation for the creation of this book was not me, but a lover of freedom. He is none other than my friend Jin Jun Songcen, named Tianhe. He initiated this book and had written four or five chapters. At that time, I was founding the Novel Forest Publishing House and advocating the translation and writing of novels. He sent me the manuscript to read. After reading it, I recognized it as a good subject matter. However, Jin Jun's original manuscript focused too much on the protagonist, only depicting a unique prostitute, with only a slight reflection of related current events... In my opinion, however, it was different. I wanted to use the protagonist as the thread of the whole book and accommodate the history of the past thirty years as much as possible... At that time, I told Jin Jun my opinion. Who knew that Jin Jun would go with the flow and unload the responsibility of continuing this book entirely on me. I was also honestly impolite. I dotted and altered Jin Jun's original manuscript of four or five chapters while proceeding non-stop. In three months, I completed twenty chapters in one go. In the first four chapters of these twenty chapters, there are quite a lot of Jin Jun's original manuscript mixed in. For example, the opening poem and a parallel prose are copied from the original manuscript without changing a word. The rest of the parts also have it everywhere, and even I myself cannot tell who is who. Even in the currently revised version, half of Jin Jun's original manuscript remains."

With this passage, it seems that it would not be impossible to print "Co-authored by a Lover of Freedom and the Sick Man of East Asia" on the book "A Flower in a Sinful Sea."

Furthermore, there is a reason why this old gentleman from Wujiang, Jin Songcen, could be the originator of this novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" with quite revolutionary ideas forty years ago. We must know that at that time, he was one of the financiers who funded the printing of "The Revolutionary Army," a book written by Zou Rong, a martyr who was most effective in promoting revolution. He was also known as Jin Yi. According to "A History of Late Qing Novels," he had seen two of his collections of essays, and he also compiled and translated "Freedom Blood," a history of the Russian Nihilist Party. "Thirty-Three Years of Fallen Flowers Dream" was also translated by him in the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, as described in "Anecdotes of the Revolution," Jin Tianbian also often engaged in revolutionary activities at that time, and after the Shanghai Patriotic Girls' School, he also returned to his hometown to run such a girls' school.

Also in "A History of Late Qing Novels," it is said that Jin Songcen was also a literary theorist at that time. He had guided a very important novel theory in the "New Novel" magazine, which was titled "On the Relationship between Love Novels and the New Society," thereby clarifying the value of novels for reforming society. He also mentioned his masterpiece "Women's Alarm Clock," but did not detail the author's name, while in "A History of Chinese Women's Life," it is said that it was written by "Jin Yi, a lover of freedom," thus revealing this "mystery." This is a booklet that promotes women's engagement in revolution, and its advocacy for equality between men and women is still very worthy of our admiration even today, forty-five years later. If one speaks of its enthusiasm, it can be said to be a "sister piece" of "The Revolutionary Army."

### Art Talks - After Viewing the Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition of Qian Jun and Xu Ju'an

— Xu Wei

Art is a kind of sensory education. However, the creation of plastic arts can transcend any man-made and natural restrictions, regardless of national borders or race. It has a wide and profound distribution in terms of region and level. A woodcut by a Chinese woodcut artist can be exhibited in the Soviet Union without explanation, and reap the effect of education and resonance. The pictures on the walls of the Altamira Cave in Spain in the early days can also be seen to have its function and desire in the eyes of modern people. Where the power of this written language cannot reach, plastic arts can reach very naturally and easily. Therefore, the higher the cultural level of a country, the more developed its plastic arts must be. Taking China as an example, China has a history of five thousand years, and we can see the accumulation of this historical wisdom from China's plastic arts. That is to say, as long as we see the kind of delicate brushstrokes and far-reaching layout of Chinese paintings, as well as the vigorous charm and ingenious changes of Chinese characters, we can very clearly infer its great wisdom.

This time, after watching the "Calligraphy, Painting and Seal Carving Exhibition" of Mr. Xu Ju'an and Mr. Qian Juntian at the Ningbo Fellow Association, I had such a feeling.

I have known Mr. Qian Juntian for several years, but I only know that he is a book cover designer and a pattern painter who is devoted to Expressionism. It was not until a few days ago that I went to Mr. Qian's bookstore to chat, and accidentally noticed that he was busy preparing for the exhibition, that I saw a large amount of Mr. Qian's ink and seal carving achievements. Today, after a conversation with Mr. Qian, I learned that his study of calligraphy has been nearly twenty years, and his seal carving has also been actively processed in the past five or six years. A total of more than one hundred pieces of calligraphy and seal carving were exhibited this time. In terms of calligraphy, it has the aura of Jin Dongxin's official script and Zhao Zhishu's Wei script, which seems to be full of vigorous and heroic consciousness. In terms of seal carving, he initially learned Wu Changshuo's style, and later gradually tended to Zhao Zhishu's tendency. But it is only a "tendency." Through the inevitable simulation stage of the learning period, he has been and is constantly working hard to create himself. In particular, the self-contained seal carving is very obvious. And the "white edges" of the stone carvings are also used in modern and simple texts. For example, in the piece "Helping Leisure," its "white edges" say: "In the past, Jiang Shantang criticized Luo Liangfeng for interacting with adults and gentlemen, which was actually helping leisure. Today, although I have not interacted with adults and gentlemen, I still help leisure when responding to the requests for calligraphy and painting from people in the leisure class. It is inevitable that I will be laughed at by the likes of Shantang, so I carve this." From this, we can clearly see the artist's distress, and Mr. Qian's view on art has already been clearly stated between the lines.

Mr. Xu Ju'an, a painter of traditional Chinese paintings who is from the same hometown as Mr. Qian and is also committed to plastic arts, exhibited a total of more than 160 pieces this time. Mr. Xu's engagement in traditional Chinese painting is entirely out of self-study. He has loved drawing since he was a child. After 1927, he went to Shanghai and began to associate with some traditional Chinese painters in Shanghai. Therefore, Mr. Xu's experience in engaging in traditional Chinese painting has been nearly forty years. And Mr. Xu only devoted himself to meticulous brushwork figure paintings in China, occasionally using landscapes as a background, but not devoted to pure landscape paintings. This focused direction has enabled Mr. Xu to achieve extraordinary achievements. Among the exhibited works, "Four Red Paintings" is the most outstanding work, and the author himself feels the same way. In addition, in "Eight Immortals Picture," the author fully expresses the different personalities of eight people on the same painting, which shows that the author's research on painting is not only superficial, but psychological; it is not only the configuration of colors, but also the expression of artistic conception.

Looking at Mr. Xu's paintings as a whole, we have a feeling of lightness and elegance; looking at Mr. Qian's calligraphy and seal carvings, we have a vigorous and heroic response; the former has a feminine beauty, and the latter contains a masculine strength. Comparing and reading them, each has its own merits, and it seems to be just right. This is naturally a congratulatory "harvest" of this exhibition.

But here, I should have reason to make a request to the two authors, that is: I hope that Mr. Xu's traditional Chinese paintings will collect more historical themes that can promote national consciousness in the future, so that traditional Chinese paintings will not only fulfill their duties in easy expression, but also be full of strong combativeness and promote more positive era significance. As for Mr. Qian's calligraphy, I hope to get rid of the old-fashioned inheritance as much as possible, especially the choice of calligraphy, and use self-created sentences or vernacular styles to express the author's emotions and intentions when necessary, because a brand-new form can be inlaid with brand-new content.

The life of art needs to be constantly infused with new blood!

(May 21, 1947)

### Bi Xiang Pavilion Lyrics

— Chen Jiaqing

Li Dongting asked me to inscribe on the Weiwanzai Building, saying that my hometown of clouds and water is good, thousands of miles of Dongting Lake; a vast expanse of blue waves, with guests exploring pearls. I live under Yueyang Tower, where the setting sun swallows the red light; I clapped my hands in surprise, embracing Lu Yang, how often have I dried my hair alone! Good times are passing, people are not old, the scenery is worth enjoying; Junshan is like a painting, smiling and looking at the scenery as it was in the beginning; leaving ten thousand acres of mulberry gardens, waiting to welcome the prosperity of the world, like unfolding the Wangchuan map. I am also half of the world, the rivers and seas remember water shields.

Partridge Sky: Lantern Festival to Sister Yu, Collecting Sentences from Baishi Daoren

Spring dots sparse plum branches after the rain, cutting lamp heart matters when it is chilly; now is the night for joyful travel, I am sad to return, there is moonlight left. Flowers fill the market, what a night! It has been a long time since the human world has been separated, and I am not sad. The railing stands on the back of the Azure Dragon, and the Feishui River flows eastward endlessly!

### Song

— Hu Ne

Songs, majestic and sonorous, ignite the sparks of my youth, making me not sad, not discouraged, and increasing my determination to work hard and fight.

Therefore, I love songs, because the majestic and uplifting singing voice penetrates my heart and boils my blood; the inspiring and sonorous singing voice penetrates my heart and inspires my confidence; I will wipe away the past trauma and abandon the decadent thoughts in the song, live in an active world, and work for work!

I remember that "La Marseillaise" once saved the disappointed French soldiers; "The March of the Volunteers" will always make the volunteers in the Northeast persist in their determination to resist Japan for more than ten years.

What a great singing voice! It is our life's stimulant; like rain and dew, it nourishes people's hearts!

Song is the driving force of life, and it is the brilliance of people's lives!

I love songs. In the singing, I want to rise up, work tirelessly, and leave some precious traces.

I need singing even more to nourish my life and enrich my life; sadness, decadence, discouragement... stay away from me, let the majestic and sonorous singing accompany me. Because I am still young, I want to work.

### Composer Li Zi

— Yang Shi

The personality of the famous composer Li Zi (Frank Lizt) was originally very gentle, but sometimes he did very inhuman things. One day, a young composer sent him what he considered to be his masterpiece for Li Zi to correct, and Li Zi pointed out the worst section and said to him, "This is impossible in music."

"But," the young man said proudly, "I did it."

Li Zi sneered, dipped the steel nib in ink and arbitrarily sprinkled it on his coat. "This can also be done," he said, "but can this be done?"

After he finished speaking, he ran out silently to buy the young man, who didn't know whether to laugh or cry, a new coat.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 517

— Ye Jingfeng

"I don't know. I just took a turn around the Wansui Hall and looked at your room with Miss Nakamura. There was nothing there... I inadvertently overheard the maids on duty revealing the news of the suicide, but no one explained the reason for the maid's suicide..."

"I do know!" Shouyi interjected when Zhengyan said this.

"You heard about it too?" He Jian, thinking that Shouyi hadn't been to Wansui Hall and that he hadn't mentioned the Korean woman to Shouyi, felt that Shouyi's words were somewhat abrupt, so he asked Shouyi this way.

"I just met that Korean youth again—the one who came to the hostel this afternoon—he told me that he had lost another helper. When I asked why, he said that he had two subordinates in the Wansui Hall, using the positions of maids as cover, paying attention to the Japanese movements, and one of them suddenly committed suicide; I guess that's the one Zhengyan is talking about."

"She committed suicide—the suicide note said she 'punished herself for dereliction of duty'! ...I guess it was because of Miss Pingzi's disappearance."...

"How is Pingzi's disappearance considered dereliction of duty?" He Jian felt that this "disappearance" had no connection with the Korean woman's suicide.

"Presumably, she thought she should have protected Miss Pingzi. When Miss Pingzi went out, she didn't report to headquarters, so headquarters didn't send anyone to follow and protect her..."

"I understand," He Jian seemed to realize something; "That letter in the morning must have been her route, sent by someone—the letter from the Korean patriots inviting Pingzi to meet at the Bund Park—since she was close to Pingzi, in principle, Pingzi's every move should have been watched at all times. Failing to report to headquarters, and failing to think of a way to send someone to follow and protect her, can indeed be considered dereliction of duty, but she shouldn't have committed suicide!"

"Their group rules are very strict, I think... Koreans have an unusually heroic temperament, especially under the oppression of the Japanese devils. She is a woman, naturally narrow-minded, so..."

Shouyi's argument was not yet finished when the car stopped abruptly. They had arrived at the meeting place in the Bund Park.

"Let me go and scout it out first, there seem to be two people under the shadows of the trees by the wall over there..." Shouyi said to He Jian and Zhengyan, and he got out of the car and walked towards the low wall of the park. In less than half a minute, he turned back and waved at the car, calling for Zhengyan. Zhengyan got out of the car and walked towards Shouyi. When the two faced each other, like worker ants delivering messages, they only touched once, their antennae touched, and they each walked away in opposite directions; Zhengyan walked towards the shadows by the wall, Shouyi got into the car and replaced Zhengyan as the driver; He Jian at this time crossed over the back of the seat from the back compartment to the front compartment, sitting next to Shouyi. The car sped off towards Hongzhen.

### Random Thoughts While Moored

— Wang Cong

A certain philosopher said:

"Separation" gives us a foreshadowing of death; "Meeting" gives us a foreshadowing of resurrection. Meeting an old friend in a foreign land is indeed one of the great joys of life. Even if they are people who have no relationship, if they have been separated for decades, and suddenly meet, that kind of joy is indescribable. This is nothing else, it is entirely because of the psychological feeling of resurrection.

A rich man went bankrupt and talked about his rich life in the past whenever he saw people. He remembered his past at all times.

A poor man became wealthy, and he forgot the embarrassing situation of crying in a cowshed in the past, and took three wives and four concubines.

These two situations exist very commonly in our society. I find it very strange, does "wealth" hinder people's memories?

I thought of a story:

A rich man went to visit a philosopher.

The philosopher's house was very simply furnished. There was a large mirror leaning against the wall, facing the mirror was a glass window, and through the window, you could see pedestrians coming and going.

The philosopher pointed to the glass window and asked the rich man, "What can you see through this glass?"

"Crowds of people," the rich man replied.

The philosopher pointed to the mirror again and said, "What can you see through this glass?" The rich man looked at the mirror, at his own chubby head. He simply replied, "Me!"

The philosopher sighed and said sadly:

"It is the same piece of glass, but this one has a little more silver, so you can only see yourself, and you don't know that there are crowds of people."

### There are Too Many Mad Dogs

— Qilou

The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau announced yesterday that, according to statistics, 3,287 rabies patients sought medical treatment from the Health Bureau last year, and 38 died from the disease. From January to April of this year, 976 people went to the bureau for injections, and 10 have already died. It can be seen that the threat of rabid dogs is extremely serious. The Health Bureau has now proposed three prevention methods, which will be approved and implemented in the coming days. We hope that these methods can be approved and implemented immediately, and that they will be implemented thoroughly and effectively.

Rabies is also known as hydrophobia. Patients become afraid of water when they reach a certain stage, and they are even afraid of hearing the sound of water. Hence the name. This is an infectious disease transmitted from rabid dogs to humans. However, those who suffer from this disease are not limited to dogs. Other animals such as foxes, wolves, weasels, and even certain sheep and birds can also be infected. In short, all warm-blooded animals have the possibility of being infected. Once they go mad, they will attack the other party as soon as they encounter stimulation, mostly with their teeth, but also with their hooves, horns, or even beaks. However, what we see most often are rabid dogs, so we call this disease rabies.

After a dog goes mad, its symptoms gradually evolve. It begins to show restlessness, likes to be alone, and collects grasses, ropes, and wood chips. It licks cold things such as iron and stones. Its sexual desire is extremely strong. After that, it swallows fur, wood, and even stones and soil, and its voice becomes hoarse. Finally, its limbs become weak, it staggers when walking, its head and tail droop, and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue. Then it slowly hides in a remote place and dies on its own.

Rabid dogs are scary because they bite people, and the people who are bitten will also go mad, and even die from madness.

However, what is even more terrifying is that even though the rabid dog is mad, it does not bite its owner. This is only because it is difficult to restrain it, and with a little carelessness, it will escape. Then, it will open its mouth and bite anything that is alive. If the rabid dog were to bite its owner, there would only be one victim, and it could be killed immediately, or even put to death before it bites. Now that it still retains this bit of "spirituality," it becomes a truly dangerous thing.

Rabid dogs also have two characteristics; first, they bite people silently, sometimes biting lightly, sometimes biting so hard that their teeth break and their gums twist, which shows their ferocity. Second, if they are unfortunately beaten, they can indeed "grit their teeth" and remain silent, unlike ordinary dogs that would scream loudly; even if a rabid dog is beaten until it bleeds and is injured, it can endure it silently. This is also a manifestation of ferocity.

The disaster of rabid dogs has been loudly called for prevention since last year, and it is unfortunate that this disaster is now rampant. The current methods used to prevent rabid dogs are inspection and injection. But there is also a simpler and more primitive method that we hope the authorities will adopt: during the period when rabies is discovered, all dogs must wear masks. Britain has not had rabies for more than 40 years since 1902. Their most effective method is to have dogs wear masks. The masks were not allowed to be removed for six months after the last rabid dog was discovered. Moreover, the scope of implementation at that time was extremely wide, including the entire three islands. We should adopt this method and disarm the rabid dogs.

### Strange Marriage Customs

— Zhongli

When Mongolians marry, the husband is always five or six years younger than the wife, so men marry very early. When they marry, they must first worship sheep, then worship heaven and earth, Lama Buddha statues, and parents and relatives. On their wedding night, they do not enter the bridal chamber, but spend it in another Mongolian yurt or shed.

There are some aborigines on the Malay Peninsula whose marriages are in the form of exchange, such as friends exchanging wives, and sending their sisters to friends as wives.

In Gansu, China, it is common for several brothers to marry one wife together. If they do not have the strength to marry together, they can rent one for a period of time from someone who has a wife.

In Siberia, if a husband wears a torn hat covering his face, the wife knows that the husband does not want her and proceeds with the divorce.

### Everyone is a Fool

— Translated by Zhuo Chao

Hubbard said: "Everyone is a fool for at least five minutes a day, and even smart people are no exception."

Therefore, I always keep a notebook titled "The Silly Things I Did". I look at it from time to time to help me solve the biggest problems in life.

Former Minister of Finance H.P. Howell started as a small clerk in a rural store, and later became the credit manager of Carnegie Steel Company. Once, he told me one of his secrets to success: "For many years," he said, "I always carried a notebook in which I recorded all my work. Every Saturday night, I would look through this notebook and carefully reflect on everything I had done since Monday morning. I would ask myself, 'What did I do wrong?' How should I correct the things I did wrong?' I analyzed myself in this way. Sometimes I felt that this habit was very boring, but other than this, I have never tried any other more effective way to succeed."

Obviously, Howell's secret to success was stolen from Franklin. Every night, Franklin had a strict self-examination, which resulted in the discovery of thirteen major shortcomings, three of which were: wasting time, devoting himself to trivial matters, and arguing in vain with people.

Every day, Franklin would declare war on one shortcoming and maintain it for a full week. The second week, he would declare war on another shortcoming. Continuing like this for two years, he wrote: "There are three hardest things in the world: steel, diamonds, and knowing yourself."

What if someone accuses you of being a "damned fool"? Here's Lincoln's method: Once, Lincoln issued an order to transfer a certain army. At that time, Secretary of War Stanton believed that this order was extremely wrong, resolutely refused to accept it, and accused Lincoln of being a "damned fool". When Lincoln indirectly learned of Stanton's words, he said, "Stanton is right, I should reflect on myself." Soon, Lincoln actually withdrew the order.

Most of us ordinary people hate those who criticize us, but this is not right. We should welcome them instead, because in fact, we can hardly do more than three out of four jobs correctly. Old Roosevelt in the White House especially liked to be close to Einstein, because Einstein could often point out that 99% of his work was "completely wrong."

Rochefoucauld said: "The criticism of us by our enemies is much more accurate than our self-assessment."

In short, everyone is a fool. Only people like Howell and Franklin can create a great man. Are you the same kind of person as them?

(Translated from the April issue of Reader's Digest, the original author is Dale Carnegie)

### Anecdotes of Our Predecessors

— Yunjian

Mr. Zhu Sishi, whose given name was Yunxin, was a Jinshi in the former Qing Dynasty, and was from the western countryside of Song County. He was a family friend of my family. He once told me before his death that his ancestor, Yicai, had bold literary talent and was thoughtful and discerning. Once pointed out, any article on scriptures and meanings would be instantly understood, so I often went to him for advice. One early morning, I went straight to his bedroom. Yicai had not yet gotten up, and I held the scriptures to ask him about difficulties. So he put on his clothes and got up, and explained it to me repeatedly and in detail. Just as he was talking eloquently, he suddenly wondered why he had lost a sock. I also inspected it for him, but could not find it anywhere. Finally, his grandmother found a sock for him in a box. The next morning, he said to me, "Last night when I went to bed, I couldn't get my sock off, which made me sweat a lot." When asked for details, he learned that he had been concentrating on explaining in the morning, so he had put both socks on one foot, so one foot had no sock. In the past, socks were made of earth cloth, and were double-layered, making them thicker and longer, reaching the knees, so he couldn't take them off when he went to bed.

There is another anecdote. One day, Mr. Sishi came to the city to meet guests. I went to tidy up my appearance. Just as I was getting a haircut, two or three people came one after another and sat waiting. The shop owner did not know what kind of person he was, and seeing that his clothes were plain, similar to those of a country person, he used a secret jargon in the industry, commonly known as "cut words," and instructed his partner, "This country person can be perfunctorily dealt with." Mr. Shi seemed to dislike it. Before long, the haircut and braid were finished. Mr. Shi gave him a string of copper coins, totaling seventy coins, commonly known as "one bull." In those days, an adult's haircut cost twenty copper coins, and a child's cost fourteen. No one would increase the price unless it was for a wedding or funeral. Now, the partner unexpectedly received a heavy reward for doing things perfunctorily, and was surprised and dared not accept it. Mr. Shi told him, "Don't be surprised, I am so-and-so, you can accept it." The shop owner then realized that he was Mr. Jinshi, and apologized sincerely. Ten days later, I went to get my hair cut again. The shop owner was very attentive and worked personally. The previous haircut took less than half an hour, but this time it took more than two hours, which shows his flattery. But Mr. Shi gave him fourteen coins, and the shop owner was even more surprised, thinking that if the previous perfunctory job was rewarded with seventy coins, why was he only given fourteen coins for being so attentive now? Mr. Shi then told him, "Don't be surprised, the money from before is a reward for today's diligence, and today's money is a penalty for yesterday's perfunctoriness." The shop owner had no way to respond, and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The humor of the predecessors was like this.

### "Three Full Bellies Out of Ten People"

— A Newsboy

Mr. Christensen, the director of the United Nations agency's information office, is truly heartless. He announced a tragic event at this International Food Producers Conference. He said: In this world, only three out of every ten people have full bellies.

How do the other seven people survive? Christensen did not explain. Probably some are only half full, some are digging up grass roots and bark, some are consuming their own fat, and some are obtaining calories from the sun? The way to survive is like this, so Christensen didn't say any more.

In our country, we understand the meaning of such news the most, especially when white rice prices are soaring to 400,000, we know that the fire of hunger is so unforgiving to its master. Although Adam and Eve had forbidden fruit to eat in the Garden of Eden, in this human world, every fruit tree has its ownership registered.

Naturally, when we think like this, we are extremely envious of the three people who can have full bellies. We are just worried that they may sometimes eat too much. If these three gentlemen use the food of ten people, then we really dare not think about it and cannot bear to think about it.

George Bernard Shaw said: "Seeing you is like seeing the cause of famine." We hope this is playful, not a testimony. It is very unpleasant and cruel for us to know that many people are hungry, while some are burping from being full.

### Turnip Silk Color Dress

— Feng Qiuping

In recent years, short knitted garments have been popular in the market. Most of them have the same style, and it is rare to find something unique. The short spring dress in the picture is more beautiful and unique with a turnip silk wide border on the pointed heart-shaped collar.

Materials: Twelve strands of fine yarn, and two strands of dark color for edging.

Tools: A pair of single-pointed knitting needles, a pair of double-pointed knitting needles, a crochet hook, and an embroidery needle.

Starting: First, start from the back, one hundred and twenty stitches. Arrange the pattern of five rows of peach blossoms, sixteen stitches per flower, with nine stitches of plain knit in between. Knit one foot long in plain stitch. On both sides, increase one stitch every five rows, until it is four inches long. Increase one stitch every three rows, until it is five inches long. Open the armhole, the same as the ordinary method. The armhole is five and a half inches. The back width is one foot.

Front: The method of knitting the waist and the pattern is mostly the same as the back. Cast on sixty stitches on one side of the left flap, arrange two rows of peach blossoms, still with nine stitches of plain knit in between. Ten stitches on the edge, knit garter stitch. Decrease one stitch every inch at the collar, gradually decreasing to the armhole, which is five and a half inches. Sew it together with the back. The right flap is the same.

Sleeves: Cast on thirty-two stitches on the shoulder. First use two needles, knitting on both sides. Decrease one stitch every row, until it is five and a half inches to the armhole. Use four needles, join the circle and knit it, like an ordinary small sleeve. Knit garter stitch at the cuff, which is three inches long. Decrease the stitches to finish the cuff. The second sleeve is the same.

For the turnip silk, please refer to the 13th to 16th combined editions of Qiuping's Wool Embroidery Knitting Method, page 85, for the pattern and instructions. Knit a two-inch wide border and sew it on with an embroidery needle.

Use a crochet hook to knit fourteen rows of single crochet stitches at the waist, four inches long. Open three buttonholes in the front, and it becomes the latest type of knitted spring dress. (This picture shows Miss Yu Suqiu wearing this style of new dress)

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

The small teahouse owner enthusiastically pulled out a wooden board for them to lay some bedding under the blue calico cloth, and they lay down randomly in the corner of the room. Lan herself still maintained her original calmness. Except for rapid breathing, she didn't show the kind of panicked and sorrowful expression that ordinary women have when they suddenly fall ill. She also declined the suggestion of another female troupe member and never took off her coat, which was due to her obsession with cleanliness.

Lu Qian found an opportunity to pull Lao Zhu outside the teahouse.

"Alas!" Before he could speak, he sighed first. "Lao Zhu, I think Mrs. Hu's illness is very serious! I just measured her temperature, didn't you see it too? It's already over forty degrees! The whites of her eyes are also very red. I'm afraid it's no use just taking a few aspirins. You have to quickly think of a way to help her!"

As he spoke, his eyebrows almost joined together.

Lao Zhu scratched his scalp wildly with his hand.

The bus they had taken earlier was clearly supposed to go to Jinchengjiang. Lao Zhu's original plan was to change to another bus after reaching Jinchengjiang, because he knew that Jinchengjiang was too small, and had been burned down twice in the past, so it was impossible to find a house to stay in. However, Lan suddenly fell ill, and so seriously, how could he have the courage to take her on the road again immediately?

"I just heard the teahouse owner say that there was another big fire here last night. A bullet car exploded, and all the houses were burned down! Alas, this unlucky place!" Crippled Lu reported another bad news.

Filled with unhappiness, Zhu Zhaonian scratched his scalp even harder; after a while, he looked at Lu Qian and shook his head, and said to him in a way that was both complaining and joking:

"No, Lao Lu, it should be said that China is unlucky!"

"Alas!" Lao Lu didn't say anything, but sighed again.

Zhu Zhaonian had now changed his mind. He believed that it was obviously impossible to stay overnight in Jinchengjiang, and that there would definitely not be suitable medical facilities in this small town, so the only way was to quickly find a car and continue to move forward according to the original plan.

He first went to the highway checkpoint and waited for about an hour, making friends with a few people in power. There were quite a few passing vehicles, according to what they told him, but it was rare to find an air force bus that could carry thirty or forty people at once; unless he divided the entire group into several groups, then perhaps there was still hope that half of them could leave today. However, this was precisely what Lao Zhu was most unwilling to consider, because not only was it economically unaffordable, but also this group of poor artists who had been wandering for six or seven years had never had the habit of rushing ahead or falling behind.

"You can go to the town to search." A military policeman suggested to him.
