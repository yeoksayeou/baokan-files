[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] Confirmed news: In order to promote the pacification work in the recovered areas, stabilize the people's livelihood, and complete the great plan of restoration, the central government has ordered the Pacification Area Political Affairs Committee of the Ministry of National Defense to organize a supervisory group to inspect various pacification areas, study the major issues pending resolution in the recovered areas, find solutions locally, and effectively supervise implementation to achieve substantial results. It is reported that the first batch of supervisory personnel will be personally led by General Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, to depart this week to inspect the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] Minister Bai is scheduled to arrive in Zhenjiang from Nanjing before the first of next month, leading a group of more than ten key members of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area Supervisory Group. Various agencies in the provincial capital are already preparing a grand welcome.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong is scheduled to accompany Minister Bai to inspect the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area at the beginning of next month.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] It is learned that the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Area Supervisory Group will stay in Zhenjiang for a short time before departing for the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu, holding a symposium with representatives from all sectors to hear reports from political, military, and party officials. According to the opinions of general public representatives, the timing coincides with the general assembly of the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council. Minister Bai may be invited to attend the meeting to listen to valuable opinions from various representatives regarding the overall pacification plan and related reforms.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 28th] It is reported that Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense will come to Jinan within ten days to inspect. The battle situation in Southern Shandong will rapidly unfold with Minister Bai's northern arrival and Hao Pengju's acceptance of the government's appointment.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, flew to Xuzhou on the 28th to inspect.

### Hao Pengju to go to Xuzhou Today for Instructions; Seven Counties Designated for His Department's Defense Zone

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Hao Pengju, leading his more than 20,000 troops, assumed the new position of Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Area and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Group Army, appointed by the National Government on the 27th, causing extreme panic and unease among the Communist army. Hao was originally scheduled to come to Xuzhou on the 28th for instructions but changed it to the 29th, departing from Haizhou.

[Our Newspaper Xinpu, 27th] Hao Pengju, who defected and surrendered, arrived in Xinpu by car from Baozhuang at 2:30 PM on the 27th. All sectors held a grand welcome ceremony and hosted a banquet to welcome Hao. He returned to his original location by car at 5:00 PM. The Ministry of National Defense appointed Hao Pengju as Commander of the Southern Shandong Pacification Area and Commander-in-Chief of the 42nd Group Army. The defense zone includes seven counties: Ju County, Mengcheng, Linyi, and Rizhao.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Hao Pengju's department's defection, the CCP office in Nanjing stated that they had not yet received this telegram and did not deny it. They did not express any opinion on Hao's public statement as reported in the newspaper.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 28th] After the news of Hao Pengju's defection spread, the situation in the Jiangsu-Shandong border area took a sharp turn. It is reported that a division of Hao's troops, after defeating a part of the Communist army on the northern side of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, is now joining forces with two other National Army units, advancing rapidly towards Tancheng on the Shandong border. The Communist army in Tancheng is now preparing to retreat hastily towards the Taierzhuang-Zaozhuang branch line.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 28th] After Hao Pengju's troops defected, they are now concentrating their main forces, preparing to attack Linyi, to destroy the Communist army's stronghold in Southern Shandong. Chen Yi is extremely panicked, drawing troops to defend. Furthermore, the National Army, which recovered Pi County, continued to advance on the 27th, reaching the line from Goushangji to the west of Yishui. The Communist army fled north in a panic.

### Bloody Fighting for Two Days and Nights; Single County Garrison Broke Through Yesterday; Communist Army's Feigned Pincer Offensive Against Xuzhou Remains Ineffective

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Over 10,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's Communist army in Western Shandong besieged Single County. The garrison fought bloody battles for two days and nights and broke through this morning, shifting positions.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 28th] Over 3,000 Communist troops attacked the Dragon King Temple, twenty miles southeast of Single County, on the night of the 25th. The National Army is intercepting and attacking. Furthermore, there are no major Communist troops disrupting the central section of the Jiaoji Railway. Only Li Feng's independent battalion of 400-500 Communist troops are active within the Shandong border.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 28th] As the Communist army launched another pincer offensive against Xuzhou, the prelude to the battle centered on Xuzhou has officially begun. The Communist army is still using Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng as the eastern and western pincers, but unfortunately, these two pincers have never achieved the effect of a coordinated attack. When Chen Yi fiercely attacked the Lin-Zao-Tai branch line, Liu Bocheng was held back by the National Army outside Jinxiang and could not escape south to spy on the Longhai Railway. Although Liu Bocheng has now approached the edge of the Longhai Railway, Chen Yi has been forced by the National Army's flanking maneuvers to stretch his main force from the Lin-Zao-Tai branch line towards the coast, expanding the front to 500 li. The battlefield is developing in a "centrifugal" direction, and the Communist army's two pincers are opening wider and wider. Strategically, the Communist army is already at a disadvantage. Tactically, the Communist army still relies on using a few to control the many and using the many to annihilate the few. In combat, they believe in their inhumane concept of using human waves to fill the sea of fire. Since the National Army's two forces in Northern Jiangsu and Southern Shandong joined forces, they have devised countermeasures for this.

[Another Dispatch] Liu Bocheng's Communist troops in Western Shandong are actively fleeing and attacking near the Longhai Railway, intending to cut off the Bian-Xu transportation to threaten Xuzhou. Currently, about 10,000 Communist troops have fled to the north of Jieshan and near Single County. Their advance troops, about a regiment, have reached ten kilometers north of Dangshan. Furthermore, 3,000-4,000 Communist troops were discovered twenty kilometers west of Feng County. Another Communist army force of two columns fled to the east and west sides of Minquan on the 27th, threatening to besiege Minquan. The National Army there is on high alert.

[Another Dispatch] More than a thousand Communist troops who fled from the north destroyed the nearby railway and destroyed a large bridge. Transportation in the area is temporarily cut off.

### A Certain Military Observer Discusses the Battle Situation in Southwestern Shandong

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 28th] The focus of the national war has clearly shifted to Southern Shandong. The so-called exaggerated decisive victories of the Communist army in Yixian, Chengwu, Zaozhuang, and other places have aroused widespread concern among the people of the country about the war in that area. For this reason, this reporter specially visited a military observer. According to the discussion, after withdrawing from Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army launched attacks on the National Army in three parts: (1) Using the regular troops withdrawn from Northern Jiangsu in conjunction with the original troops in Southern Shandong and the Fourth and Ninth Divisions in Central Shandong to launch fierce attacks on the line east of Lin, Zao, Yi, Tai, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in Xin'an Town. (2) Using the elite troops of Liu Bocheng's troops in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border area to launch a comprehensive advance in the Southwestern Shandong area, including Heze, Dingtao, Chengwu, and Jinxiang. (3) Using Zhang Taisheng's troops in the Su-Wan-Yu border area to harass Yongcheng, Boxian, and Guoyang, their entire attempt is to consolidate Southern Shandong and rebuild the Southwestern Shandong base, gradually damaging the Longhai eastern section of traffic, re-enter Northern Jiangsu, and further threaten Xuzhou. For more than half a month since the war began, the National Army has been restricted by the ceasefire order, and the military has been in a passive and defensive position everywhere. Except for the Communist army in the Su-Wan-Yu border area, which once occupied Guoyang, which was immediately recovered by the National Army, but still divided into attacks on Yongcheng and Luyi, on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Yixian and Zaozhuang successively fell, and Lincheng and Taierzhuang were surrounded. West of the railway, south of the Yellow River, the entire Southwestern Shandong, except for Jinxiang, Juye, Heze, Jiaxiang, Yutai, Dingtao, Dan, Cao and other eight county towns are still in our hands, and the rest have been occupied by the Communist army one after another. In summary, in the Southern Shandong decisive battle that has just begun, although the Communist army slightly gained a small advantage in the early stage, this is by no means a victory that determines the overall battle situation as the Communist army has publicized. Furthermore, the Communist army recently transferred two divisions of the Democratic Allied Army and an artillery regiment from the Northeast to land in Yantai, and continued to transfer troops south from Jin, Ji, and Cha, which shows the weight of their past sacrifices and that the real decisive battle period will be within the next few months, and the Communist army's blind faith in force and strict rejection of peace talks will inevitably lead to a repeat of the Changchun and Siping Street battles, and they will suffer the consequences and only make the people suffer.

### Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Among Communist Troops Transported to Yantai

[Central News Agency Qingdao, 28th] The Lutao troops of the Fourth Army of the Communist Northeast Democratic Allied Army have been transported from Dalian to Yantai.

### French Troops Landing on the Xisha Islands: We Have Lodged a Protest with France; The Vietnamese and French Authorities Claim the Islands Belong to France

[French News Agency Nanjing, 28th] According to reliable sources: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with French Ambassador to China Merillon regarding the landing of French troops on the Xisha Islands. At the same time, Chinese Ambassador to France Qian Tai has also sent a similar note to the French government. French sources here refused to comment on this, saying only that the protest lodged by China is currently under study.

[French News Agency Saigon, 27th] The French authorities here recently issued a statement to the press regarding the dispute over the Xisha Islands, saying: France had already prepared to occupy the islands two months ago, but the dispatch of ships was repeatedly delayed until now due to bad sea weather. The French warship "Tonkinois," which sailed from Toulon, carried a small number of troops. Part of them were ordered to land on Pattle Island, and the rest landed on Woody Island. The above two islands have military barracks, wharves, and weather stations built by the French army in 1938, which shows that sovereignty belongs to France. The "Tonkinois" arrived at Woody Island on the 17th of this month and learned that Chinese troops were stationed on the island. The French commander then informed the commander of the Chinese troops that this was French territory and that the Chinese troops had no right to be stationed on the island. The French troops were then ordered to re-land, and after anchoring near the island for 24 hours, they transported a part of the troops to Pattle Island to land on the 19th, and found that no one was stationed on the island. Official sources here also said that before the "Tonkinois" sailed to the Xisha Islands, Chinese newspapers carried news of a military occupation, but the French side sent planes to reconnaissance and did not see any traces of Chinese troops occupying the islands. Furthermore, the French Marines landed on the Xisha Islands in May last year, stayed for fifteen days, and did not encounter any Chinese.

### Communist Army on the Border of Anhui and Henan Provinces Intends to Disturb Hao and Wo Without Any Other Intention

### No News of the Missing China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane

### Accomplice of Pierson Scheduled to Go to Trial Tomorrow

[United Press Beiping, 28th] In the case of the rape of Peking University student Shen Chong by the American soldier Pierson, the first defendant Pierson was already tried and convicted by the American military court. The second defendant will go to trial on the 30th of this month, but the name of the defendant will not be announced before the indictment.

Yang Yi, deputy director of the Northern Section Administration of the Pinghan Railway, told reporters today that the loss was very heavy. The Baoding-Shijiazhuang section is now completely in the hands of the Communist army. In view of the difficulty of repairing the Ping-Bao section and the lack of materials, even if it is reopened with great effort, it is difficult to estimate the date of repair. It is also learned that Sun Lianzhong once telegraphed the Ministry to quickly allocate materials, and today received a reply saying that there is no way to do so at present.

### English Translation of China's Destiny

MacMillan Edition is the Authorized Edition; Zhang Pingqun Issues Statement in the United States

[Central News Agency New York, 27th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul in New York, recently issued a statement to American readers regarding the English translation of Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny," stating that: The only authorized English translation of Chairman Chiang's "China's Destiny" has been published by MacMillan in New York. In view of the fact that another bookstore has also published another English translation with the same title, and includes "Another work by Chairman Chiang, entitled "Chinese Economic Theory," I must inform the general readers that all other English translations except the English translation published by MacMillan have not been agreed or authorized by the author. Regarding the so-called Chinese Economic Theory translation, there has never been such a work published in China. The one that is barely similar to this work is only a private record of the outline of the progress of Chinese economic thought given by the Chairman to a research group when discussing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood ten years ago. This article was only used as reference material and was never published. This painting has not been seen in other translations, so the above-mentioned translations, except for the one published by MacMillan, cannot be regarded as representing the author's true opinions, so readers should beware of misstatements and inaccuracies.

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] The China Institute in America hosted a banquet tonight for representatives of fifty-one American industrial companies that trained Chinese students in industrial technology during the war. Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, submitted a letter of thanks on behalf of Chairman Chiang, stating in the letter: "American industrialists training Chinese students in production technology in the United States not only helps China solve the problem of reconstruction, but also deepens the friendship arising from this work, enhancing understanding and cooperation between the two countries. China currently desperately needs men and women with modern technical training, and we hope this training work can continue." Ambassador Gu also expressed this hope. Former Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces in China (now Commander of the Second US Army), General Albert Coady Wedemeyer, continued, "I have great faith in China's future. Chinese industrial learning technology is very agile." Wedemeyer continued to call on the United States to continue to assist China's rehabilitation and reconstruction. Robertson, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the recipient of the thanks, said, "Westinghouse will help China establish an electrified industry and can train 300 Chinese students to learn modern American manufacturing technology." Mallory, President of the China Institute in America, said in his welcoming speech, "The China Institute in America has been invited to be the host because it is non-political, and the Chinese government and people recognize that it has a significant responsibility to promote good and beneficial relations between China and the United States." Those invited today included some of the most famous figures in American industry and commerce, as well as He Yingqin, Guo Taiqi, General Jin Kai, former New York Mayor Lehman, and Lu Zuofu.

Chairman Chiang's Original Letter of Thanks

The full text is as follows: "On behalf of the Chinese government, I am pleased to thank you and the members of your organizations for your cooperation in training personnel selected by our country during the war to study production technology in the United States. Thanks to the efforts of the US State Department and the China Institute in America, you and other American industrialists and businessmen have contributed more to assisting our country in completing huge construction projects than you may realize. Moreover, friendship best promotes understanding and cooperation between our two countries, and this project will soon have this effect. Now that the wartime training program has come to an end, I sincerely hope that this important task can be continued by other means. China urgently needs men and women trained in modern technology, and as we face the important years ahead, we sincerely hope for the assistance of the United States."

### Peace Talks Have No Hope of Resumption, Wu Tiecheng Visits Leaders of Both Parties

The Democratic Socialist Party Reaches a Consensus on Joining the Government

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing and met with Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party for courtesy visits. When reporters visited Wu's private residence yesterday and inquired about the current situation, he said: "The government has never given up its efforts for peace talks, but since the CCP has firmly rejected this, there is no hope of resumption for the time being. The reorganization of the government is actively underway according to plan and should be realized in the short term."

[Our Newspaper] Lei Zhen visited Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party yesterday morning to exchange views on the reorganization of the government. Li Huang left after a short stay, and the rest continued to talk, but the content is unknown. According to Zuo Shunsheng to reporters afterward: "The conversation was not specific, and the reorganization of local governments and the selection of government personnel were not discussed. As for the rumors that the Youth Party has submitted a list of participants in the government, this is 'deliberate propaganda, absolute rumors.'" After Lei Zhen left Zuo's residence, he went to visit Zhang Junmai, and they met.

[Our Newspaper] The Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party continued to meet yesterday to discuss matters related to joining the government. According to spokesperson Sun Baoyi to reporters: "The opinions of the participants are very close, and a general agreement has been reached. There are still one or two minor details that will be decided at today's meeting. The content of all resolutions will be notified to Secretary-General Lei Zhen, who has been dispatched to Shanghai. A declaration on the current situation has been decided not to be issued, because it is deeply felt that the crisis of the previous month cannot be resolved by empty meetings. The government's intention to reorganize and reform is very sincere, and in principle, the prerequisites for the Democratic Socialist Party to participate in the government have been accepted. In terms of government reorganization, from the government's perspective, it is actually difficult to proceed simultaneously from the central to the local levels. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Sun believes that it is impossible to proceed under the current situation, and the reorganization of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference does not close the door to peace. The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly to formulate a constitution, whether in opposition or in power, will definitely support and endorse the work of constitutional governance."

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to continue its meeting at 3:00 pm today (29th) to discuss the basic principles of the party's participation in the government and the detailed methods of government reorganization. The final decisions will be made today, and the results of the meeting will be formed into concrete opinions and handed over to Lei to take to Nanjing. According to relevant sources: "The internal opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party on participating in the government have become consistent. The meetings in recent days have focused on studying various issues of how to reform politics, so as to ensure that the promotion of constitutional government will be unimpeded after the coalition government is realized." It is also heard that the Democratic Socialist Party will ask the government to present a reorganization plan as a basis for negotiation.

Democratic League Has No Intention of Mediating Peace

[Our Newspaper] A reporter visited Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League yesterday and asked whether the Democratic League is currently preparing to mediate peace. He replied: "It is still too early. The government has not expressed anything to the Democratic League. Although Chairman Chiang said to the Democratic League personnel in Nanjing, 'The government does not close the door to peace, and hopes that the Democratic League will make more efforts,' there are no concrete measures. The Democratic League is currently holding some internal meetings. The Democratic League hopes to achieve peace as soon as possible, but the current reorganization of the government will increase the difficulty of reopening peace talks."

### Subsidies for Tax-Exempt Counties and Cities, Ministry of Finance Decides on Standards, 20 Billion Yuan to Be Allocated First in Five Grades

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Ministry of Finance has decided on the standards for subsidizing tax-exempt counties and cities in the pacification zone. As the disaster situation in the recovered counties and cities in the pacification zone is serious, in addition to the inability to collect land taxes, the national treasury will provide appropriate monthly subsidies. The standards are: (1) For all recovered counties and cities, the province should apply to the central government for exemption from the current year's land tax if the disaster situation is indeed serious. The number of counties exempt from tax in each province should not exceed 80% of the total tax amount of each recovered county and city. (2) All recovered counties and cities will be subsidized according to the county level (1st to 5th grade). (3) The amount of monthly subsidies will decrease in stages, with three months as a period, starting from the date of recovery and ending at the end of the tax-exempt year of the 35th year of the Republic of China. (4) For partially recovered counties and cities, the national treasury will allocate one-quarter of the standard amount for the recovered counties to the provincial government for overall distribution. (5) Recovered counties and cities should selectively carry out various autonomous undertakings to the extent of their financial resources and should not impose arbitrary levies. Other undertakings that should be carried out should be done when the locality has legal income. (6) In addition to the statutory taxes and levies that should be levied in appropriate amounts, recovered counties and cities should follow legal procedures if special taxes are to be levied. The Ministry of Finance has now issued an emergency order based on the above six standards and will allocate 20 billion yuan first, and then verify and allocate the funds after determining the recovered areas, counties, and grades. The subsidy standards are divided into five grades: 153.2 million yuan for first-grade counties, 130 million yuan for second-grade counties, 110 million yuan for third-grade counties, 95 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 80 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The funds will be allocated in four installments, with three months as a period. The first installment will be 60 million yuan for first-grade counties, 50 million yuan for second-grade counties, 40 million yuan for third-grade counties, 35 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 30 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The second installment will be 43.2 million yuan for first-grade counties, 40 million yuan for second-grade counties, 35 million yuan for third-grade counties, 30 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 25 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The third installment will be 30 million yuan for first-grade counties, 25 million yuan for second-grade counties, 20 million yuan for third-grade counties, 20 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 15 million yuan for fifth-grade counties. The fourth installment will be 20 million yuan for first-grade counties, 15 million yuan for second-grade counties, 15 million yuan for third-grade counties, 10 million yuan for fourth-grade counties, and 10 million yuan for fifth-grade counties.

### Difficulties in the Transportation Office of the Third District Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Director Reports to Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 28th] Ma Junxian, Director of the Transportation Office of the Third District Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, recently hosted reporters and reported on the business, saying: "The office is responsible for the operation of the highways in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces, with districts in Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hengyang, Liuzhou, Zhanjiang, and Xingning, with a total of 716 vehicles, of which 64% were received from the enemy and puppet regimes. A total of 154 vehicles are distributed in Guangdong Province. The office has recently counted a total of 5,370 tons of freight and 763,470 passengers in the past three months, accounting for one-seventh of the national transportation volume." Ma also stated the difficulties of the office's business, saying: "The security of each route is poor, merchants and travelers are insufficient, and the highways are too damaged, making the parts easy to damage. Especially the transportation lines in the wood district have railway and waterway competition. For example, although the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway has been completed, it takes 11 hours from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, while the train takes only 3 hours and the plane takes only 40 minutes, so the highway has no way to compete. To overcome this difficulty, we will handle intermodal transportation between highways, railways, and waterways in various places."

### Twelve Executive Headquarters Sailing Vessels Encountered Bandits on the Way from Guangzhou to Beihai County, All Supplies and More Than 100 Personnel Missing

[Our Newspaper] The Executive Headquarters authorities recently received an unfortunate and shocking news. Twelve sailing vessels of the Executive Headquarters were carrying relief supplies from Guangzhou to Beihai County, Guangdong in September last year. On the way, they encountered bandits, and all 250 tons of supplies on board and more than 100 Executive Headquarters staff were missing. After receiving the report, the Guangdong Provincial authorities sent patrols to search nearby, but there is still no news. A hurricane occurred in the South China Sea at that time, and pirates took advantage of the wind to rob. Some ships may have encountered risks or been robbed. The Guangdong Provincial authorities believe that banditry often occurs near the Leizhou Peninsula, affecting the safety of passing ships, and have sent police to suppress them. However, the living conditions of the local residents have always been very difficult, resulting in some people being forced by livelihood to take risks. The Executive Headquarters has now allocated a large amount of supplies to relieve the local residents, and the number of beneficiaries before and after has reached about 100,000.

### The Scope of the UNRRA Organization in China to Be Reduced

[This City] There are varying rumors about the deadline for the UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters to end.

The UNRRA China Branch is scheduled to reduce its scope in March this spring, and the shipment of UNRRA relief supplies to China will end at the end of June, but after March this year, the scope of the UNRRA organization in China will be smaller than it is now. It is estimated that the number of UNRRA staff in China is as many as 1,200 to 1,300 people, and there are 700 to 800 people in Shanghai alone, while the number of staff in the national organizations of the Executive Headquarters is more than 15,000 people. (The news of the UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, scheduled to be held at 9:00 am today (29th), can be found in yesterday's issue of this newspaper.)

### The Nantong Corruption Case, the Chief of the 13th District Is the Most Suspected, Huang Qiming Is on the Run and Being Wanted

[Nantong Correspondence] Regarding the case of the 13th district of Nantong County embezzling bandit relics and apportioning cotton, involving Ji Fang, the county magistrate of the county, after the Su Province government received a telegram from Commander Li Moyan of the Pacification Zone, Chairman Wang immediately proposed a meeting of the provincial government and resolved to dismiss Yang Fang. At the same time, he secretly sent Mi Shi from the Department of Construction to Nantong to thoroughly investigate and transfer the entire case to the judiciary for handling, and ordered Yang Fang to surrender to the headquarters for interrogation. At this time, Yang Fang came to the province, and the provincial police bureau was immediately ordered to strictly monitor him and not allow him to leave without permission. During the process, all circles in the provincial capital paid great attention to the development of the case, and there was a rumor that Yang Fang had absconded with bail, which led to the punishment of Chuan Zhaoren, the director of the provincial police bureau responsible for monitoring, and Liu Chunyang, a major staff member of the security headquarters, who acted as a guarantor. After inquiring from all parties, the reporter learned that after the Bird Association Police Bureau was ordered to monitor Yang Fang, it found Yang at Liu Chunyang's residence and monitored him. Liu, because Yang was a close friend, strongly guaranteed that he would not leave the case and provided a written guarantee. The police bureau took the liberty of signing and submitting a request to the provincial government for approval and ordered him to continue to be responsible for monitoring, but Yang was no longer in the residence. Although it was said that he had gone to meet relatives and friends and would return soon, there was still some favoritism. After receiving the report, the provincial government severely reprimanded the person in charge of the police bureau and ordered Yang Fang to surrender by a deadline. Liu Chunyang was placed under investigation for privately guaranteeing the monitored person, which was purely a matter of responsibility. When Yang Fang surrendered himself after the matter was over, Liu was also released from custody. It is now heard that Commander Li has sent the case files and other documents to the province, and it is heard that Huang Qiming, the chief of the 13th district of Nantong, is the most suspected in this case, and has fled without a trace after the case was discovered. The provincial government has issued an arrest warrant for him. Before he is arrested, Yang is still necessary to be sent to the court for investigation and interrogation first. The provincial government has sent the police bureau chief to personally lead the police and comrades with the entire case file to the Suzhou High Court and reported the progress to Commander Li and reported to the central government.

### Hong Kong Population and Commodity Index Showed Signs of Decline Last Year

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] The Hong Kong Entry and Exit Department recently used the wholesale price index of goods in 1938 as a comparison base to create the wholesale convenience index of goods in 1941 and 1946. The food category in 1941 was 15.4 and in 1946 it was 708.95. The textile category in 1941 was 138.3 and in 1946 it was 769.25. The metal and mineral category in 1941 was 160.2 and in 1946 it was 295.6. The general merchandise in 1941 was 168.9 and in 1946 it was 604.45. Observing these figures, the wholesale price of food last year was seven times that of 1938, textiles were seven and a half times, metal and minerals were three times, and miscellaneous goods were six times. However, compared with the various indexes in the second half of last year, they all showed signs of decline, which indicates that the wholesale price of imported goods is gradually decreasing, and it is expected that the price of goods this year will tend to decrease further.

### Investigation of the Tani Hisao Case Completed, Corpses of Victims Exhumed, Piles of White Bones on Yuhuatai Hillside Are Shocking

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense has been opening a temporary investigation court at the District Office of the 11th District outside Zhonghua Gate since the 25th of this month, summoning the family members of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. More than 100 people went to testify every day, and the last investigation court was opened on the 28th, and the number of people who testified was even more crowded, reaching more than 180 people. Chief Judge Shi Meiyu personally presided over the investigation every day, divided into three courts for interrogation, from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm. According to Chief Judge Shi to reporters: "The work of investigating witnesses has basically come to an end. More than 600 people have come to testify in recent days, all of whom are civilians living in the Zhonghua Gate area, which shows that the long-term enemy army massacre was the most tragic in this area. According to the records of the Nanjing Branch of the World Red Swastika Society regarding the burial of corpses, the burial team of the association buried more than 40,000 corpses in this area, which were buried near Yuhuatai Hillside. A large tomb behind the District Office of the 11th District, buried more than 2,000 corpses. The family members of the victims collected the bodies by themselves, or the more than 5,000 victims in the ordnance factory were first massacred and then burned, and there were no corpses to collect, which is not included." The Chief Judge, at about 1:00 pm on the 28th, accompanied by citizens and the person in charge of the former Red Cross Society who handled the burial of the victims, went to the back mountain of the District Office of the 11th District to exhume the corpses of the victims. In just one moment, more than ten skeletons were seen. According to nearby residents: "There are more than 400 corpses in the common tomb, all of whom are innocent civilians who did not have time to hide when the Japanese invaders entered the city." The tomb is divided into upper and lower layers, all of which were buried by the Red Cross after the victims were killed. It is heard that Shi also plans to allocate more civilians to exhume the corpses on the morning of the 29th, and concentrate all the excavated skeletons to be presented as evidence during the public trial of the Tani Hisao criminal on the 6th of next month, so as to avoid the criminal's cunning denial.

### Editorial: Analysis of the German Problem

Since the opening of the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference in London, active discussions have begun on the German peace treaty. Not only have the relevant countries, especially the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland, etc., put forward their demands on Germany, but the opinions on the German issue also differ between Britain and the United States and France and the Soviet Union. This has caused great difficulties for the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference, and it cannot be said at this time whether it can complete its preparatory tasks for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Moscow on March 10. The German peace treaty is at the core of the European issue, which is related to the future safety of Europe. At the same time, the contents of the German peace treaty are an example for the Japanese peace treaty. Therefore, for the sake of European peace and for the sake of Far Eastern peace, we must pay special attention to the resolution of the German issue.

In order to accelerate the resolution of the German issue, the Soviet Union has submitted a procedural plan to the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference for the German peace treaty, dividing the work of drafting the German peace treaty into three stages: (1) After listening to the opinions of the relevant Allied countries, the four major powers draft a draft of the German peace treaty; (2) After the establishment of the German central government, convene a conference of the Allied countries to allow the German government to send representatives to the meeting to present their opinions, and then discuss the draft of the German peace treaty; (3) The four major powers determine the final terms of the German peace treaty, which are then signed by the countries, and then submitted to the governments of the Allied countries for approval, which will take effect.

It is not known what the views of the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France are on this proposal, but from these three procedures, it can be proved that the establishment of the German peace treaty is not easy. What's more, the opinions of the Allied countries are extremely inconsistent due to different interests and different positions. How to seek common ground while reserving differences in divergent opinions? And after seeking common ground, how to eliminate the small differences of various countries? These are all very serious issues.

The most important issues in the German peace treaty are: one is the total amount of German compensation and the method of payment; the other is how to control Germany? In the active aspect, it is necessary to re-educate the German people and eliminate the Nazi anesthesia and its residual poison suffered by the Germans, so that Germany can also become a peace-loving country and no longer pose a threat to European peace; in the passive aspect, it is also necessary to supervise Germany's military and economic disarmament, so that Germany will not be able to rise again and invade again in a few years. However, since Germany surrendered, it has been controlled by the Allied countries for nearly two years. As for the results of the control? Different people have different opinions. According to a report published by the International Research Association for European Issues, the work of eliminating the Nazis has completely failed in the past two years. Nazi remnants are still preserved in Germany under the control of the Allied countries, trying to use funds escaping abroad to help the future revival of the country. Although this report cannot be completely believed, it is worth pondering by the authorities responsible for controlling Germany. How to control Germany in the future to prevent the resurgence of German aggression? It is indeed necessary to discuss it at length.

Since the New York Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and the closing of the Second United Nations General Assembly last year, although the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union has shown signs of improvement, opinions on many issues, especially the German peace treaty, have not yet been unified. When the Allied Control Council for Germany met on the 20th of this month, Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, delivered a speech at the meeting, accusing the representatives of Britain and the United States of obstructing the drafting of a joint report by the council, trying to prevent it from being drafted. Although the British official has denied this and expressed the view of the British government, which is also the same as Marshal Sokolovsky's opinion; however, the inconsistency of the German policy of Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union can also be clearly demonstrated here. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press, U.S. Secretary of State Marshal will propose at the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in March to conclude a four-power alliance treaty prohibiting Germany from rearming for 40 years; it is difficult to predict at this time whether Marshal Ma's proposal will be adopted by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The treaty prohibiting Germany from rearming for 40 years was proposed a year ago by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. Although Marshal Stalin also expressed his approval in principle, it was shelved invisibly due to the opposition of Foreign Minister Molotov. Now, Secretary of State Marshall is reviving the old issue. Although he has obtained the understanding of the Soviet diplomatic authorities in advance, and the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference agreed to include this four-power alliance treaty on the agenda of the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, whether it can be adopted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference and established will depend on the relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union. In all fairness, the four-power alliance treaty proposed by Marshal Ma is the best way to prevent the resurgence of German aggression.

In short, although the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference has encountered many obstacles in discussing the German issue, if the Four-Power Foreign Ministers can look ahead and take world peace as their priority, then any thorny issue can be easily resolved. Marshal Sokolovsky's accusations against Britain and the United States clearly show that the Soviet Union still lacks the spirit of mutual trust and mutual tolerance with Britain and the United States. Today, when the world is looking forward to the four powers cooperating to resolve the German issue as soon as possible, we cannot help but express our regret.

### Unusual Cold in North China, Freezing Outside Dagu Port, Heavy Snow and Traffic Obstruction in Northern Hubei

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] According to the report of the North China Meteorological Observatory: Since the Siberian cold wave invaded North China, Beiping has been within the control area of this cold wave for several days, and the temperature has dropped sharply for several days. Last night, due to the clear sky, the radiation of heat from the ground increased, and the snow surface on the ground continued to expand and absorb the heat of the air. Therefore, the temperature dropped further, dropping to minus 19.5 degrees Celsius at 2:30 this morning. This low temperature continued for about an hour before gradually rising. Because the wind was extremely weak at that time, and it was in the middle of the night, people felt it slightly. This low degree has not been seen in Ping City in the past 20 years. Now the force of the cold wave is gradually weakening, and the temperature should rise slightly.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Tianjin has been experiencing severe cold for several days, with a low temperature of minus 16.6 degrees Celsius, which is a rare cold in the past ten years. The sea outside Dagu Port is frozen for 30 nautical miles, which is the first time since mid-February 1936. Many ships have been frozen in, and are currently being rescued. The newly completed gate of Xingang has also been frozen and damaged. The port of Qinhuangdao has also been sealed, and more than ten ships cannot enter the port.

[This newspaper, Hankou, 28th] Heavy snow has fallen in the Xiangyang area of Northern Hubei. It has not stopped from the 19th to the 25th, and traffic is blocked, which is only seen in the past ten years.

### Sericulture Season Approaching in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; 30 Billion Yuan in Cocoon Loans Planned

[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] In order to develop the domestic silk industry, the China Sericulture Corporation is planning for spring silkworm loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year, with a planned loan amount of 30 billion yuan. In addition, the issue of Japanese cocoon transportation to China has been rumored in the market for several days. It is learned that last year, the China Sericulture Corporation proposed a barter method to Marshal Lai's headquarters to exchange our country's edible salt for Japan's surplus dried cocoons. At that time, the planned cocoon price was a stable US$1 per pound. By September of last year, Japan overturned the previous agreement and did not transport the surplus dried cocoons to China, and no result was achieved after repeated negotiations. It was only recently decided to sell 10 million pounds of dried cocoons to our country at a price of US$2.77 per pound, but the cost of each pound of raw silk on average requires at least 3.5 pounds of dried cocoons. The current market price of raw silk is only about US$6 to US$7 per pound. If each pound is valued at US$2.77 to produce raw silk, the cost of each pound of raw silk will exceed US$8, which is far from the current market price, and most of the domestic silk mills have recently suspended operations. Therefore, the issue of Japanese cocoon transportation to China is still difficult to expect.

### Conversations with Two Leaders of the Jiangsu High Court: A Summary of the Handling of Traitor Cases; Prosecution Office Accepted More Than 5,500 Cases; More Than 1,600 Cases Transferred to the Criminal Court

Among them, 1,352 cases have been adjudicated separately, and the remaining 281 cases are being tried.

Confiscated Traitor Property to be Organized

According to Chief Prosecutor Han, the county governments in this province have separately checked the real estate of those suspected of being traitors in their respective jurisdictions. Up to now, more than 1,000 cases have been reported to this office, requesting instructions on disposal methods. However, although the owners of the real estate were reported by the county to have filled puppet positions, they did not send evidence of being traitors to the office for investigation, nor did they file a complaint with the office. According to law, they cannot be confiscated. Therefore, it is urgent to organize them. The steps decided are to first order the counties to submit concrete evidence of the crimes of the original owners of the confiscated real estate. If the investigation is true, it will be transferred to the Criminal Court for trial and judgment. If the confiscation is abnormal, it should be returned to protect property rights. The reporter then asked that if the traitors who are at large cannot be brought to justice, will the confiscated property remain in a state of detention, or will other disposal methods be determined? He replied that according to the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, the property of traitors who are at large after being wanted originally had the stipulation of being confiscated by a special division, but there is no precedent for doing so. Therefore, this office has now submitted a special case to the Ministry of Justice for explanation.

### Yongjiao Ship Sinks, 20 Casualties

### Hui Ni Bingshi Retried, Original Not Guilty Verdict Overturned

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 28th dispatch] Hui Ni Bingshi, who had served as the head of the police training center of the puppet Wuxian Special Bureau, was previously pronounced not guilty and released by the First Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court. The public opinion in Muyi was in an uproar, and the prosecutor also refused to accept it and filed an appeal. He was once reported to the Control Yuan, alleging that the personnel handling the case were derelict in their duties. Therefore, all circles in Suzhou are extremely concerned about the outcome of this case. Now the Supreme Court has ruled to overturn the verdict of innocence and returned it to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. The Criminal Court has now scheduled to summon Hui Ni for retrial on February 7.

### A Puppet Secret Agent in Wuxi Still Carries a Gun and Runs Wild, Captured by the County Government

[This newspaper, Wuxi dispatch] Xu Yunsheng, a resident of Wuxi, served as a liaison officer and intelligence agent in enemy and puppet organizations such as the Liaison Office during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, he has not had a proper occupation. Recently, he often carries a handgun and specializes in extortion. A Chinese and Western medicine doctor, Cao Chunnian, was extorted 500,000 yuan in Taosha Lane a few days ago. The day before yesterday, Xu went to the Oriental Garden Hotel in Tongxiang Bridge and stayed in the room overnight. The tea attendant, Tang Aquan, was asked to provide a guarantee and collect the room fee. Xu used a gun to shoot a hole in his head. After the incident, someone reported it to the Criminal Police Team of the County Government. Captain Wang Yiming sent personnel to arrest Xu, and both the person and the gun were taken to the county for interrogation.

### Bandit Alert in Chenmu Township, Repelled After Two Hours of Fierce Fighting

[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] Around the Lunar New Year, the wind of theft was rampant in the four townships of Suzhou, and cases were frequently reported. At 10 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Zhou Siguan, a habitual bandit from Chenmu Town, led more than 50 people, carrying various long and short guns, on small boats, trying to land and plunder.

### A Huge Mansion in Gusu Destroyed by Fire Due to Careless Worship During New Year's Eve

[This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] A huge Chinese-style house at No. 41 Weidao Guanlong, Pingjiang Road, Suzhou, is the old residence of the Pan family, a large family in Suzhou. It has four courtyards inside and outside, with more than 40 rooms. It also has gardens, flower pavilions, bridges, and study rooms. The structure is exquisite and has always been praised by the people of Suzhou. At about 3 a.m. on Lunar New Year's Eve, the residents were awakened from their sleep due to the uncleaned ashes of the offerings to the heavens, causing a fire. They were unable to save anything and only escaped with their lives. By the time the fire brigades from various districts arrived to put out the fire, the fire had spread uncontrollably. As a result, 18 rooms in the second, third, and fourth courtyards of the house, as well as flower pavilions and large halls, were burned to the ground. The fire was extinguished at about 6 a.m. The losses are huge and difficult to estimate for the time being.

### Thriving Financial Industry in Haining Stone: Three New Money Shops Open in the Spring

Since the Lunar New Year, three money shops have opened one after another, namely Tongyu Money Shop, Henglong Money Shop, and Dacheng Money Shop. Since the victory in Shi, only Jinyuan Money Shop has established an office. The establishment of these three shops this time has greatly helped the industrial and commercial sectors. Before the war, there were a total of seven money shops in Stone Town. Now there are four. In addition, the Bank of China, the Local Bank, and the Farmers Bank have all established offices in Stone.

### Four Unregistered Money Shops in Jiaxing, Including Tongyuan, Close Down

[This newspaper, Jiaxing dispatch] The four money shops in the urban area of Tongyuan, Jianxing, Dada, and Shengda were previously ordered to suspend operations by the County Government because their registration was not approved.

### Pan En Ship Arrives in Hangzhou from Shanghai, Successful Trial Voyage at the Mouth of the Qiantang River

[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th dispatch] The Pan En ship, a 222-ton vessel of the Executive Yuan, arrived safely at Sibao, Hangzhou City at 8:22 yesterday, setting a new record in the history of the Qiantang River. Due to the shallow water level at Zimen, Shanghai ships could not enter the Qiantang River. The ship and another auxiliary boat made six trial voyages from Shanghai, and finally entered the Qiantang River after much hardship. According to Captain Geng Pushan, if navigation signs are installed in the vicinity of Sancha and Shibao, and the water depth is measured at any time, then ships with a deadweight of 600 tons and a draft of 6 feet can enter and exit the Qiantang River at high tide without any problems. The ship is going to Tangshan to transport stone, and Hangzhou Mayor Zhou specially hosted a banquet.

### Changshu Strictly Pursues Those Who Resist Tax Payment, Large Grain Households Summoned and Taken into Custody to Pay Taxes

[This newspaper, Changshu dispatch] The collection of tax grain here to meet military needs has slightly improved after the Ministry and Provincial sent personnel to Changshu to supervise, but it has not yet reached the planned quota. According to the numbers reported by the offices of the various districts to the county, the results of the Liantang and Tangqiao districts are better, followed by the three districts of Zhitang, Shazhou, and Dongtang, the Chengguan and Meili districts are very different, and the Wushi district is the worst. The historians Qian Erxian and others who were taken into custody to urge collection have been released on bail. Large grain households who stubbornly resist will be summoned and taken into custody to pay taxes starting from the 27th, in order to report and resolve the issue.

### Surcharge for Late Payment of Land Tax Extended to March

[This newspaper, Jiaxing dispatch] The land tax collection in this county was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of January. If it is not paid within the time limit, a surcharge will be added from February 1. Now the surcharge period is approaching in an instant. The County Council believes that the collection of grain tax this time has been delayed in practice due to planting reasons. In addition, it has been raining continuously in recent days, and the fields are wet and unable to operate. Even if it is delivered, the collection office will refuse to accept it because the grain is wet and easy to damage. Moreover, the time limit is also at the beginning of the Lunar New Year, and farmers have the habit of enjoying themselves for several days. Therefore, the Council sent a telegram to the superior authorities to extend the collection period to February 1 to add a surcharge in order to help the people in need.

### Tense Tax Collection in Wuxing

[This newspaper, Wuxing dispatch] The County Government received an urgent telegram from the Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the collection of land tax in 1946 is closely related to the supply of military grain, the finances of the province and county, the regulation of civil food in the coming year, and the stabilization of prices. Recently, it also received an order from the National Government to collect the full amount on time for military grain allocation as quickly as possible, so it should be expedited to complete the task. The annual land tax in the county must be collected in full by the end of January, and the bonus and penalty criteria are that those who exceed 90% will be rewarded with preferential treatment, and those who are less than 80% will be severely punished. Now that there are few days left until the deadline, all civil servants of the County Government and townships should be mobilized as soon as possible, cooperate with local gentry, and actively urge collection so as not to delay, etc. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Yuan ordered the townships to collect the full amount within the time limit without any delay, so as to emphasize the importance of orders.

### Joint Defense Department of Jiahe Chutian Xu Postpones Withdrawal

[This newspaper, Mingguang dispatch] The Joint Defense Headquarters of the five counties of Jiahe Chutian Xu, under the Eighth Pacification Zone, recently received a telegram from Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, stating that the establishment of the Department has reached its expiration date, but due to the uncleared banditry, and the winter defense period, the Department will be extended by two months to facilitate suppression.

### Henan Native Cloth Industry

(This newspaper, Suzhou dispatch) The Ministry of Finance has stipulated the method of reducing or exempting the 食业 and 祝免 taxes for the sake of 식업. For all native cloths, whether spun by farmers by hand or manufactured by 工厂, those who sell them directly are exempt from tax, and it is scheduled to take effect from January 1947. As for the native cloth sales industry, except for those who pick up loads to sell, all others should be taxed uniformly. The food industry will continue to be exempted for one year from October last year to the end of September 1947. Since the preparation situation in the transportation industry has gradually returned to normal, it will continue to be taxed in accordance with regulations. Henan Province is a cotton producing area. Most of the cotton produced each year is spun by farmers by hand, except for foreign exchange. Therefore, the native cloth weaving industry in southern Henan has always been very developed. After the victory, it declined due to the impact of prices, which was a major blow to the rural areas. According to people in the native cloth industry, now that the government has explicitly stipulated that native cloth weaving is tax-free, if it can be improved, improved, and the cost reduced, it can restore its past glory.

### Minhang Town Plans to Organize a Cooperative

The plan is being actively implemented in accordance with the Promotion Measures for Consumer Cooperatives issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and has been supported by the County Chamber of Commerce. It is heard that a general meeting of members will be convened soon to begin organizing.

### Economic Hardship Fully Exposed During Suzhou's Lunar New Year: 20-30% of Businesses Bankrupt

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Following Suzhou's ingrained customs, the emphasis remains on the old year. The sounds of firecrackers have not ceased in all directions these past few days. Shops are closed, and residents brave rain and snow to visit and offer New Year greetings. The streets are filled with sightseers. Government offices are effectively on holiday, entertainment venues are thriving, and gambling is also rampant. However, due to the influence of high-interest loans and excessively heavy taxes, coupled with substantial expenses, high costs, stable prices, and the public's weak purchasing power, the 500 million yuan industrial and commercial loan is a mere drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Approximately 20-30% of businesses have tragically declared bankruptcy. Last spring, due to the government's crackdown on underground banks, unregulated mutual aid societies flourished everywhere. Ultimately, because the methods of bidding lacked a foundation of trust, and the funds acquired could not generate normal profits, it was like drinking poison to quench thirst. People were passing around the "poison," and as the year's end approached, poverty was fully exposed. In teahouses everywhere, people were demanding repayment of already-dissolved association funds, creating a noisy atmosphere devoid of smiles. Even during the New Year, sounds of scolding and quarreling could still be heard in the streets, fully revealing the hardship of the social economy.

Those who only earn commissions by acting as agents for buying and selling can barely manage, but they are few in number. Consequently, the number of bankrupt and closed businesses is remarkably high. Statistics show that dozens of businesses throughout the city have ceased operations, an unprecedented situation.

### The Scenery in Songjiang During the Spring Festival is also Desolate

[Our Songjiang Dispatch] Since the Lunar New Year, Taiyi County has experienced continuous rain and snow, leading to a bleak market situation. Even the most bustling Yue Temple market is deserted. The overall scene is nothing like it used to be. In the commercial sector, losses far outweigh profits, resulting in business closures across various industries, including silk fabrics, oil, pastries, water tobacco, grain, dried goods, meat, and local produce. All have reported losses. Banks and money houses have also found it impossible to make a profit due to high expenses. Only the brewing, paper goods, incense, and traditional Chinese medicine industries have seen profits. Soap, cigarettes, and Western medicine businesses are doing averagely. As for the rice and grain businesses...

### Suzhou Celebrity Extortion Case: Granted Amnesty, Trial Halted

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The famous extortion case involving celebrity Fan Junbo, which had captured public attention, has been halted. After the county court prosecutor's office filed a public prosecution, the criminal court conducted a public trial. However, following the promulgation of the amnesty decree and because the case fell within the scope of the amnesty, the criminal court has decided to halt the trial and issue a dismissal of the charges. Furthermore, another case involving suspicion of corruption by Fan Junbo was investigated by Prosecutor Sun, who concluded that there was insufficient evidence of wrongdoing and has decided not to prosecute.

Water Shortage in Daxu Lane

Daxu Lane on Roberts Road is not particularly remote, yet access to tap water is very difficult. Most of the residents work in factories, and there is crowding when fetching water and washing rice, which wastes valuable time. Although there is well water available in the lane, it is muddy and unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, I request that the Public Works Bureau quickly improve the situation. (Yang Jiemin)

Requests for Cleanliness on Changshou Road

I am a junior high school student, and I must pass through the intersection of Wohua Road and Changshou Road every day on my way to school. However, two weeks ago, a large pile of garbage suddenly accumulated at this intersection. At the time, I thought that the Sanitation Bureau might be temporarily storing it here because they were unable to move it in time. But to this day, not only has the garbage not been removed, but it has accumulated more and more, taking up a large portion of the road. This area is a necessary route for workers leaving nearby factories. It is not only inconvenient to walk but also the stench is unbearable and harmful to health. There are also many dead babies' coffins discarded on top of the pile. I ask the sanitation authorities to pay attention. (A Reader from the Western District)

Views on Elected District Chiefs

With the promulgation of the Constitution, the whole country rejoiced. To realize a democratic system, there is the election of district chiefs, which is the initial step in returning power to the people. The heads of Baojia, as representatives of the people, share the joys and sorrows of the masses, and people of high moral character and reputation should be carefully selected to fill these positions. As for the existing heads of Baojia in the city, some held false positions during the enemy puppet regime. After the victory, they continued to maintain their position and still behaved in the same old way, arbitrarily exercising power. The public should expose them, and the authorities should thoroughly eliminate them to achieve lasting peace, lay the foundation for self-governance, promote democracy, and not let them do as they please. As far as I can see, I dare to express my humble opinion, hoping to help cleanse the soil. (Xia Shoufu)

### Japanese Cabinet Resigns En Masse: Shigeru Yoshida to be Commissioned to Form New Coalition Cabinet; Nationwide Demonstrations Held Yesterday to Overthrow the Cabinet

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Shigeru Yoshida Cabinet has resigned en masse. Yoshida will be commissioned to form a new coalition cabinet. The formal announcement is expected to be made at 2 PM today.

[Kaizo News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida decided that a coalition cabinet could be formed. Today, he is determined to convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting and implement a mass resignation after the Socialist Party expresses its final stance. However, Socialist Party Chairman Katayama stated today that the government has not formally or informally expressed any intention to the Socialist Party. Regarding the issue of a coalition government, the Socialist Party insists on changing Finance Minister Ishibashi's financial policy. The establishment of a new regime must be jointly negotiated by the Liberal, Progressive, Socialist, Cooperative, and National parties. These points are absolutely non-negotiable. If the government can accept the Socialist Party's proposals, the Socialist Party will gladly negotiate. Otherwise, the Liberal and Progressive parties should resolve the crisis themselves. The Liberal Party insists on keeping Finance Minister Ishibashi in office, so the Ishibashi issue has become a major obstacle to forming a coalition cabinet.

Approximately 400,000 People Participated in the Demonstration

[Kaizo News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] With the date for the planned strike by the Japanese labor sector, February 1st, fast approaching, and the Yoshida Cabinet tottering, the Cabinet Overthrow Implementation Committee and the Japan National Trade Union Joint Struggle Committee held "National Rallies to Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and Break Through the Crisis" across the country today. In Tokyo alone, approximately 400,000 members of the industrial associations, the General Federation of Labor, and the National Association of Public Servants gathered at the Imperial Palace Plaza at 11 AM. Kato Kanji, a leftist leader of the Socialist Party, was elected as the chairman of the rally. A representative of the National Public Servants Association stated in a speech that the Yoshida Cabinet had rejected their minimum demands. They must resolutely overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet and move towards the establishment of a democratic people's government. They will strike on February 1st to achieve their goals. Communist leaders Tokuda Kyuichi and Nosaka Sanzo also delivered impassioned speeches. Starting at 1 PM, the entire procession began a demonstration march, passing by the Prime Minister's official residence and the Metropolitan Police Department, lasting for two hours. In Osaka, 150,000 people participated in the rally, carrying slogans such as "Oppose Harsh Taxes and Evil Laws," and marched through the city. In Nagoya, 50,000 people participated in the rally, starting the demonstration march at noon. In Kanagawa and Yokohama, 50,000 people participated in the rally, shouting slogans such as "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet," and marched through the city. In Kobe, 30,000 people participated in the rally, and after the meeting, they marched in demonstration. In Kyoto, 30,000 people participated in the rally, carrying a large flag with the words "Overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet," and marched through the city.

### Japanese Militarism Difficult to Eradicate Immediately

Views of the Chief Advisor of Our Delegation to Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Shen Jun, the chief advisor of the Chinese delegation to Japan, stated recently that the repatriation of Japanese soldiers is progressing smoothly "in form," but their militarism will be difficult to eradicate in the short term. Therefore, we still need to closely monitor whether the feudal traditions that are the roots of Japanese militarism can be thoroughly eliminated first. The Chinese delegation will cooperate in all aspects regarding Japan's disarmament and democratization, so that Japan can become a peaceful country, which will benefit Asia and the world. The recent claim by the Moscow newspaper that about 100 Japanese officers, with the consent of the Japanese authorities, will go to China to assist the Chinese government army is "pure fabrication." Furthermore, our delegation has no knowledge of the rumor that many Japanese officers, disguised as Chinese officers, are working in the Nanjing army. Secondly, regarding the situation in Japan, we should now investigate whether there are any demobilized soldiers infiltrating society. Today, the Japanese police department is employing many of these soldiers, which is a natural outlet for demobilized soldiers, but the consequences should also be noted. For example, the Shibuya incident last year, where police officers shot and killed six Taiwanese people and injured 20 others, shows that they have not shaken off their violent nature. The article in the Japanese Constitution that condemns war is worthy of praise, but its true value still depends on whether it can be faithfully implemented. China will strongly urge Japan to respect this article. Regarding the international disarmament plan, I have always regarded it as one of the most noble goals for humanity and also one of the major working goals of the United Nations. When Japan has the qualifications to join the United Nations, its right to self-defense will become a "delicate" issue, but the efforts of major country politicians to curb war will not be in vain, so it will not put Japan in a difficult position. China is a peace-loving country and hates the outbreak of a third World War.

### A Portion of Japanese Assets to be Distributed as Reparations Soon; Full Reparations Issue Still Difficult to Resolve

[United Press, Washington, 27th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that a portion of Japanese assets will soon begin to be distributed to countries that have made requests as reparations. According to the current decision, the assets to be distributed include 1,100 military factories. The method of distribution will be executed by the United States issuing instructions to MacArthur, as the United States is the main occupying country of Japan and therefore has this power. However, the immediate dismantling and distribution of Japanese military factories will not solve the entire reparations issue. Disputes will continue to arise among the countries of the Far Eastern Commission. Although the commission is keeping silent about the distribution work, United Press reporters dare to say that all parties related to the reparations issue can indicate that the commission and other related parties have largely agreed on determining Japan's post-war equipment needs based on the 1931 Japanese industrial standard. Japan's wartime industrial development, focusing on steel and related parts, will not affect the entire reparations plan determined based on this standard. 1931 was the year Japan initiated the Mukden Incident, starting its aggression and adventurism. The United Nations will draft a reparations plan based on the situation before the incident. Recently, the United States proposed that countries of the Far Eastern Commission submit suggestions for this to accelerate the process, but some countries in the commission are unwilling to participate, so progress is slow. It seems that various countries believe that once they acknowledge the United States' proposal, the entire issue will be controlled by the United States, and they believe that the basic purpose of the United States' recent proposal is to avoid the Soviet Union's attacks on the Japanese reparations issue.

US and Soviet Views Clearly Different

The Far Eastern Commission initially attempted to convene a meeting to resolve this issue, but it was suspended due to Soviet opposition. Later, the United States Department of State considered convening another meeting, but it gave up on this idea because the Soviet Union refused to consider the "war booty" obtained by the Red Army in the eastern nine provinces of China as reparations materials. Some countries have raised doubts about the temporary distribution of reparations materials, believing that it may not meet the current needs of the countries receiving reparations. Japanese factories have advanced technical equipment that requires technical personnel to operate. It is doubtful whether the countries that receive these factories have enough skilled personnel to use them effectively. As for the countries accepting reparations materials, although they have not been designated, China and the Philippines are of great importance.

### US Delegation Arrives in Japan

### Sudden Action by a Japanese Person: Meeting MacArthur Like an Assassination Attempt

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Reliable sources informed our correspondent today that when MacArthur entered the Allied headquarters on the morning of the 26th, a Japanese carpenter, holding a long package, rushed forward, intending to throw the package at MacArthur, but MacArthur personally caught him and seized the package. Inside the package was a wooden sword and a letter requesting assistance. It briefly stated that the Japanese people have been in dire straits since the defeat in the war. He requested MacArthur to provide more assistance and hoped that MacArthur would create a democratic Japan. He would not regret being shot dead by the guards. Afterwards, MacArthur instructed an American military police officer to teach him proper etiquette and immediately released him. However, the wooden sword has been given by MacArthur to his 11-year-old son as a souvenir.

### Greece Announces Foreign Policy: Willing to Maintain Friendship with Neighboring Countries; Determined to Use All Efforts to Reduce Domestic Guerrilla Forces

[Reuters, Athens, 27th] The seven-party coalition government formed by the new Prime Minister Maximos announced today that the new government intends to conduct a policy of equal friendship with the Allied powers and maintain friendly relations with the Balkan and Mediterranean neighbors. Mr. Maximos declared in the House of Representatives that Greece's foreign policy is formulated based on its historical and geographical position. Greece is both a Balkan country and a Mediterranean country, so it is willing to maintain friendly relations with its Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean neighbors and establish commercial ties to seek mutual benefit. Mr. Maximos also declared that the government intends to take a resolute approach to the guerrilla forces in the country. The government has decided to amend the previous method of deporting enemy overseas Chinese back to their countries. The order regarding the deportation of women and children will be suspended, and an amnesty will be granted to traitors who surrender within the deadline.

This afternoon, another 16 ministers and seven secretaries swore in. The new government is still incomplete because the National Party, led by former right-wing guerrilla leader General Zervas, has not yet decided on candidates for the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The seats of the new government are distributed according to the strength of the seven parties in the House of Representatives. The new government has 16 members from the People's Party (Royalist), four from the Liberal Party, three from the National Liberal Party, four from the Social Democratic Party, and one from the Workers' Union Reform Party and the National Union.

### Soviet Ambassador to the UK Meets with Bevin

Likely Related to Alliance Treaty

[Our Report] London, 28th Broadcasting: According to officials, British Foreign Secretary Bevin reviewed the issues involved in the recent exchange of letters between Bevin and Stalin during a meeting with Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Zharovin, in London yesterday, but that side did not specify the nature of yesterday's talks.

At the same time, according to reliable sources, the Anglo-French alliance treaty is being drafted in the Foreign Office, but it has not yet been submitted to the Cabinet. On the one hand, it is discussing with the French authorities the best way to conduct formal negotiations.

### At the Far East Military Tribunal, Japanese War Criminals Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to try Japanese war criminals today. The defense lawyer for former Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Central China, Matsui, submitted a plea on behalf of the defendant in the Nanjing Massacre case, stating that the order to attack Nanjing was issued by the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters. Matsui's headquarters was located in Suzhou and was not aware of the killings and rapes by the Japanese army. Former Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, stated that he only worked in the Japanese diplomatic circle and had no connection with the Japanese military's aggression. He opposed the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Japan, and Italy, and he was only responsible for conveying the United Nations' protests against the Japanese army's mistreatment of prisoners of war, and nothing else.

### Secret Stories of World War II

The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the only two the United States had at the time.

[United Press, New York, 27th] Former Secretary of War Stimson stated in an article published in this month's "Harper's Magazine" that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 were the only two the United States possessed at the time. Military authorities firmly believed that unless atomic bombs were used, the war could not end until the second half of 1946 at the earliest, which would mean the United States military would suffer at least one million more casualties.

America Keeps Secrets, Japan Unaware of the Facts

The United States kept the atomic bomb a closely guarded secret, and the Japanese were unable to ascertain the true situation. They believed that our ability to carry out atomic attacks was unlimited and that we could attack with large formations of aircraft simultaneously whenever necessary. Consequently, they decided to surrender. In reality, we had exhausted our entire supply. Comparing the lesser of two evils, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the great war and fully demonstrated that we must never have war again.

Stimson also stated that from 1941 to 1945, he never heard President Roosevelt or other government officials express any intention that atomic energy should not be used in the war. On April 25, 1945, he told President Truman that the United States was capable of manufacturing and utilizing atomic bombs, something other countries would not be able to achieve for many years.

Japan Still Had Five Million Troops at the Time

In the summer of 1945, Japan's total military strength was five million soldiers and five thousand kamikaze aircraft. By July of that year, the Japanese navy was almost completely destroyed, except for what was needed to contain the American fleet attacking its homeland. The United States included atomic bombs in its plan to invade the Japanese mainland. If we had followed this plan and invaded Japan on the planned date of November 1, 1945, the loss of Japanese life and property from B-29 Superfortress bombings alone, plus five major bombing raids, would have exceeded the casualties from the two atomic bomb attacks. However, the psychological impact of the atomic bombs was even greater.

Stimson also said that the manufacturing process of atomic bombs was complex, and only a few people knew the details. In a memorandum to Truman on April 25, 1945, Stimson announced that other countries would not reach the United States' level for several years. He also said that it may not be possible for smaller countries to manufacture atomic bombs in the future, or for larger countries to manufacture them in a very short period.

Truman Decided to Use Atomic Bombs

[United Press, Boston, 27th] President Truman personally decided during the war to use atomic bombs to attack Japan. This was revealed in a letter from the President to the President of MIT, Compton, in the February issue of "The Atlantic Monthly." Compton had written an article in the magazine saying that atomic bombs had saved the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Americans and Japanese and shortened the war by several months. The President's letter stated: "The article in the 'Atlantic Monthly' is a fair analysis of the actual situation. However, the final decision had to be made by the President and was thoroughly reviewed in advance. The Japanese received wireless warnings and were informed of the surrender terms before the atomic bombs were dropped. These terms were eventually accepted, and I believe this was the achievement of the atomic bombs." Two months before the atomic bombs were dropped, Compton had been working at MacArthur's headquarters in Manila. Reportedly, conversations with Japanese scientists after the war proved that most Japanese believed they were winning the war until the surrender was announced, when they woke up as if from a dream.

### Establishing a Collective Security System Depends on Controlling Atomic Energy: Austin Announces No Change in US Policy

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Austin, told reporters after meeting with Secretary of State Marshall today that the United States' policy on international control of atomic energy will not change. It is understood that Austin and Marshall met for one hour and forty minutes. Regarding the postponement of the discussion on disarmament and the control of atomic energy to February 4 by the Security Council, it is said that Austin has decided not to request another postponement at that time. The United States has always advocated disarmament and is now even more active in doing so.

[United States Information Service, New York, 27th] UN Security Council Representative Austin recently gave a speech to the New York State Bar Association, saying that establishing an international control system for atomic energy and other armaments, including provisions for punishing violators, is an important task in establishing a collective security system. He said that establishing a collective security system is an urgent task. If this system can be established and effective international controls (including international inspections) and provisions for punishing violators can be in place, we can obtain some assurance that all countries in the world can safely reduce their armies. Without this system, no country in the world can achieve security or reduce its army. The cost of establishing this system for all countries in the world is to further delegate sovereignty, and this matter is related to civilization. Humanity's choice is no longer who will win the next great war. The choice now is to prevent a third world war and avoid the harm of atomic bombs and other, even more destructive, potential weapons. We cannot hide, ignore, or exaggerate the obstacles in our future. We cannot misinterpret the basic concepts and necessary conditions of our time. The foundation of the United Nations is laid on reality, and the potential power of its charter and its affiliated organizations is far beyond general speculation. Austin reiterated his position that the United States opposes any changes to the principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council. He further pointed out that Article 1 and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter contain provisions to prevent permanent members from easily using their veto power to prevent the Security Council from expanding its work.

### Soviet Union Lacks Sincerity

Secretly Engaged in Scientific Research - US Senator Shea Criticizes

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Senator McMahon, chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and the person who drafted the domestic atomic control plan, spoke in the Senate today, urging the establishment of an international control agreement. He said that atomic knowledge must be controlled immediately. It is not dangerous for us to possess this bomb, but it will be fatal if others have it as well. Today, we cannot know how advanced other countries are in the manufacture of atomic weapons, but we know that other countries are researching day and night. If we continue to lack accurate knowledge, we will be troubled by terror and suspicion. For example, not long ago we received a report from the Soviet Union stating that the country's nuclear physicist, Kapitza, had been exiled to Siberia for committing some kind of crime. From my point of view, it is better to interpret this as Kapitza now being behind the Ural Mountains, busy building an atomic fission laboratory. If the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to ban atomic bombs and other large-scale destructive weapons, it should accept the United States' control plan. The position of Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Joint Committee has now been succeeded by Republican Senator Hickenlooper. The committee will conduct research with President Truman's Federal Atomic Energy Commission next Monday.

### Atomic Energy Can Be Used for Industry Successfully in Two or Three Years

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Gordon, director of the Science and Technology Division of the Department of Commerce, announced today that atomic energy should be used as a source of industrial energy in two or three years. There is no doubt that thorium and uranium (atomic materials) can be used as fuel to emit heat, steam, and electricity.

### Powerful Radio Station Built Northwest of Manila, Broadcasting American Programs to China and the Soviet Union

[United Press, Manila, 28th] State Department telecommunications experts have built a powerful radio station 25 miles northwest of Manila to broadcast American programs to China and the Soviet Union. It is now complete and ready for testing. This radio station has been under construction for years, but officials have not announced its purpose. However, according to reliable sources, this is a state-of-the-art, most powerful device that can broadcast three programs simultaneously to any location in the world. According to the tentative plan, the Philippine government will use it for domestic broadcasting during the day, and at night it can broadcast programs to China, Siberia, and Southeast Asian countries, including India. It is said that American radio programs can only be clearly received through this rebroadcast.

### Eisenhower Delivers Speech

[United Press, Washington, 27th] US Chief of Staff General Eisenhower said in a speech to a women's club of an American newspaper today that the people of the Soviet Union are very willing to establish friendship with the United States. He said that Russians have a deep love for their country and added, "A Russian told me that Soviet leaders know very well that the Soviet people will fight for Russia even if they do not fight for the Communist Party." Eisenhower asserted that no major power is truly provoking war, because no country is ready and no country can endure war, but this does not mean that war will not happen.

### Viet Minh Troops Retreat Northwest of Hanoi

### Indian Foreign Ministry Announces: No Foreign Envoys Will Be Selected for the Time Being

[United Press, New Delhi, 27th] The Indian Foreign Ministry announced today that domestic and foreign reports that India will select foreign envoys are purely speculation and have no basis. Much of the speculation has focused on the possible appointment of Nehru's sister, Mrs. Pandit, as ambassador to the Soviet Union.

### Bevin Announces: British-Egyptian Negotiations Officially Break Down

The British-Egyptian alliance treaty will expire and become invalid in 1956, and Egypt will naturally abide by it.

[Reuters, Cairo, 27th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy announced in the House of Representatives tonight that his cabinet had decided to submit the British-Egyptian treaty issue to the United Nations. The members then passed a vote of confidence in the cabinet by a vote of 175 to 15, with six abstentions. The members of the opposition party all voted in favor of the vote of confidence.

### Polish Note to Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference: Submits Requests Regarding Germany; Two Proposals on Austrian Peace Treaty Passed

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] The Polish Ambassador to Britain submitted another memorandum to the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference this afternoon, making several requests regarding Germany and advocating the liquidation of Prussia so that it would no longer pose a threat to European peace. The specific measures include the following: (1) Even after the implementation of the peace treaty with Germany, Germany should still be controlled by the Allied countries until Germany's peaceful and democratic revival. (2) German industry can only be developed for peaceful purposes, and the Allied countries must guarantee that assisting the war-torn countries should take precedence over assisting Germany. (3) Regarding the border between Germany and Poland, Poland has the right to submit detailed plans in the future. (4) Poland can also demand equipment from Germany as compensation. (5) Poland requests that the peace treaty with Germany be signed in Warsaw, because Poland suffered the most from German aggression. (6) Germany should quickly disarm. The work of eliminating the Nazis has also been unsatisfactory.

[United Press, London, 27th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference unanimously adopted the proposal made by General Clark, commander of the US occupation forces in Austria, to establish a military subcommittee to quickly consider the military clauses of the draft peace treaty with Austria in the British and American proposals. The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference also adopted the Soviet representative's proposal that the Allied Control Commission in Vienna should submit an accurate report on the disarmament and restriction of Austria's military potential.

### Group Portrait of Republican Leaders Who Control the Fate of the United States

— Translated and Described by the Newspaper's Information Office

Although there is only one president in the White House, Washington has many behind-the-scenes rulers who wield collective power, and that is the Republican leaders in Congress. In this Congress, the Republican Party has returned to Washington with the power of parliament after an absence of sixteen years. Now they are the actual decision-makers of American domestic and foreign policy.

The most familiar Republican leaders in Congress to the American people are Taft, Vandenberg, Ball, and Martin. They are all congressional figures who can directly influence national policy. At the same time, they have the power to decide on next year's tax revenue, armaments, construction, and labor policies. They hope to reduce government administrative expenses, limit the power of the federal government, abolish Washington's commercial intervention policies, and greatly change the current labor laws.

Here, let us give a brief introduction to these Republican leaders:

Taft is the leader of the Republican senators in the Senate, and he has the power to influence domestic legislation. Taft's attitude is gentle, kind, and approachable, like a teacher. In the last Congress, he made great contributions to the revision of various major regulations. He also strongly criticized President Truman's price control bill. Last summer, when President Truman used military force to suppress the railway workers' strike, Taft also stood in opposition. He is the leader of the conservative faction in the Republican Party and presides over the Senate Education and Labor Committee. Taft is now the Republican Party's spokesperson on domestic issues.

In terms of diplomacy, the most important figure in the Republican Party is naturally Vandenberg.

Vandenberg is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has a great influence on the determination of foreign policy. This person is open-minded and can be said to be the most "one world" thinker in the Republican Party other than Willkie. Vandenberg was a journalist. Because he is good at speaking, he has made a lot of headlines in the Senate. Now, in Congress, he is more passionate about opposing isolationism than any other Republican. However, tracing his past, he was indeed a complete isolationist. Even in 1940, when the German army occupied France, he and most Republicans still opposed the arms program. It was not until the Pearl Harbor incident broke out that he broadened his vision and adopted an internationalist policy.

Next, we talk about Martin. Martin has considerable power in the House of Representatives and may become the Speaker of the House in the future. He is also very kind, has organizational skills, does not smoke or drink, and advocates strengthening party discipline and stopping rebellions. Examining Martin's past, he is also an isolationist like Vandenberg. Therefore, in 1940, he was strongly criticized by President Roosevelt.

Martin started as a newsboy at the age of five, was a reporter for a newspaper at the age of eighteen, and was the publisher of the Chronicle Evening News at the age of twenty-four. He never received higher education. His concept is:

"The responsibility of the Republican Party is to save the country to maintain the American way of life."

Finally, let's talk about Ball. Ball is tall and rough. He worked as a journalist and entered politics in 1940 because of Stassen's introduction. He attracted the attention of people all over the United States with his advocacy of promoting international cooperation. Later, he also engaged in a movement to weaken the power of labor groups. Ball is forty-two years old. His wife, Betty, helps him handle political affairs. They do not use a maid at home. Mr. Ball helps his wife wash the dishes when he comes back from Congress.

In short, from now on, most of the fate of the United States is indeed in the hands of these powerful congressmen, but the traditional American system of "checks and balances" still exists effectively.

The three key members of the US Republican Party, from right to left, are Vandenberg, Martin, and Taft. (Special photo sent by the New York Times of this newspaper)

### British High Commissioner for Palestine Orders Jews to Hand Over Kidnapped Englishmen

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 27th] The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Cunningham, informed Jewish leaders tonight that if the two Englishmen currently detained by the Jewish terrorist group are not safely returned within the specified time, civil administration and various conveniences will be withdrawn in certain areas and placed under military control. The two Englishmen are a former major in the army and a judge in the local court. It is said that they have been ordered to return within forty-eight hours. This "ultimatum" was addressed to Mrs. Myers, a member of the Executive Board of the Jewish Public Association, and Logashu, the mayor of Tel Aviv. Jewish terrorist groups in the Tel Aviv area are becoming increasingly rampant, and the overall situation is quite serious. From dusk to dawn, the entire Jewish city is under strict curfew. It is said that British civilians who are not Jewish are now leaving the city to avoid being kidnapped.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 28th] Large numbers of soldiers from the British 6th Airborne Division flew to Tel Aviv this morning and began searching for Wyndham, the Chief Justice of the District Court who was kidnapped yesterday morning.

Arab Representatives Oppose Partition

[United Press, London, 27th] The vice chairman of the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine, Husseini, addressed the session of the Palestine Conference here today, severely criticizing the Jews' attempt to establish a state in the Holy Land and declaring that the Arabs will do everything possible to oppose the so-called Arab-Jewish partition plan.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] Dr. Gurion, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish National Movement, held talks with Jones, Minister of the British Colonial Affairs Department, today.

### The Four Lines Barracks' Lone Army and Returning Soldiers - Fighting the Enemy and Establishing Merit - All Sectors Express Respect and Admiration - Enthusiastic Participation in慰劳 - Two Wives Narrate Hardships of Life, Breaking Down in Tears

[Our Report] A Shanghai municipal各界慰劳 conference for the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and soldiers returning from Australia was held yesterday at the Military Friends Society on Zhapu Road. More than 500 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Chairman Fang, and representatives from various agencies. According to the arranged慰劳 program, at 9:00 AM, people were sent to the residences of the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers to welcome them. At 10:00 AM, the movie "Ode to the Police" was screened at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall to entertain the attendees. At noon, lunch was provided to all attendees in the Military Friends Society auditorium, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. During the meal, Chairman Fang delivered a speech, stating that Hongkou District was the origin of the "August 13th" War of Resistance. The comrades of the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers from 淡 were all meritorious in the War of Resistance, and gathering here had even deeper significance. Fang specifically pointed out that the 19th Route Army were national heroes of the War of Resistance, and others participating in the War of Resistance were also national heroes. Mayor Wu continued with a speech stating that those who fought in the War of Resistance to save the nation were national heroes. Those who quelled internal strife, helped the government stabilize social order, and worked hard to increase production were all nameless heroes of the Chinese nation. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, expressing his deep慰劳 to the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the returning soldiers. Finally, he said that the construction of world peace depends entirely on one's own strength. Soldiers can be prepared but not used, but they cannot be absent for even a day. Therefore, he deeply hoped that all sectors of Shanghai would assist the government in promoting the conscription system, and he hoped that the citizens of Shanghai would enthusiastically participate in military service. Following speeches by Hu Xiyuan, Shui Xiangyun, Zhu Wenda, and Qian Jianqiu, Xie, the widow of the late Regiment Commander Jin Yuan, and Huang, the widow of the late Brigade Commander Mei Xingfu, reported in great detail on Regiment Commander Xie leading the Four Lines Barracks' lone army in fighting in Shanghai, and Brigade Commander Huang being the first to die in battle in Shanghai on August 14th.

When the two wives described their current difficult living conditions, they were overwhelmed with sadness and spoke while weeping, and the entire venue was filled with sorrow. Mrs. Xie also made four requests for relief, which Mayor Wu answered one by one. Ms. Weng Huihua immediately pledged to donate one million yuan to the Four Lines Barracks' lone army as the first contribution. Then, National Assembly Representative Tao Jitian stood up and suggested that the municipal government mobilize social forces to provide widespread and planned relief for the Four Lines Barracks' lone army and the families of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance. Mayor Wu and Chairman Fang agreed to consider accepting this proposal. Finally, Wu, the leader of the soldiers returning from Australia, reported on the situation of all the soldiers after being captured and after returning to China. After lunch, singing, harmonica solos, dancing, magic, women's jiu-jitsu, comedy, Peking opera, and other entertainment programs were performed, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

Madam Xie Jinyuan presents four demands

As for the four requests for relief for the lone army made by Madam Ling Weicheng, widow of Xie Jinyuan, they included: (1) Please have the municipal government quickly allocate wharf work; (2) Please have the Central Trust Bureau follow the Chairman's instructions and quickly allocate housing for residence; (3) Quickly provide relief to the old and disabled members of the Four Lines Barracks' lone army; (4) Request the authorities to nurture the orphans of the fallen. Mayor Wu responded to each request: (1) The allocation of wharf work will be considered after the Municipal Council approves the wharf law; (2) The housing problem will be relayed to the Trust Bureau for notification; (3) and (4) The two items will be handled comprehensively after consulting with various sectors. In addition, the widow of the late Brigade Commander Huang requested the municipal government to repair Brigade Commander Huang's tomb, and Mayor Wu also agreed to repair it.

### Attention Should Be Paid to Circumstances Favorable to the Defendant - Not Just to Excel at Exposing and Uncovering Villains - Ministry of Justice Instructs High Courts of Provinces and Cities

[Our Report] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has recently issued instructions to the presidents and chief prosecutors of high courts in various provinces and cities regarding matters that should be noted when handling cases. The main points are as follows: (1) Not only should they excel at exposing and uncovering villains, but they should also pay attention to all circumstances favorable to the defendant. (2) They should carefully investigate whether the accusations and reports are maliciously framed or abused before proceeding. Unless necessary, the defendant should not be summoned. (3) Defendants without a fixed residence, who are at risk of fleeing, who may conceal or collude with witnesses, who have committed crimes punishable by death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of five years or more as the lightest principal sentence, and who are suspected of committing a serious crime, may be detained or arrested without summons or detention. Those who meet the statutory requirements for detention but do not necessarily need to be detained may still be released on bail or restricted from residing elsewhere. (4) Defendants who are detained and currently suffering from a disease that is unlikely to be cured without medical treatment outside prison, who are seven months pregnant or more, or who have given birth less than one month ago, and whose crimes are punishable by imprisonment of six months or less, detention, or a fine, shall not be rejected if they apply for suspension of detention with bail. (5) When interrogating defendants, not only should they avoid violence, coercion, enticement, fraud, and other improper methods, but they should also treat them with a sincere attitude and give them the opportunity to clarify the suspicion of crime and make continuous statements about the beginning and end of the matter. (6) If the evidence of the crime is clear and there are circumstances under Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law or Article 74 of the Criminal Law, they may still not be prosecuted or granted probation. All of these provisions are intended to reduce the harm of being implicated. As for major social 巨 and national 蟊賊, it is not appropriate to show slight leniency.

Recently, movie ticket prices have risen by 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and the highest ticket price for Peking opera has risen from 20,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan, which seems excessive.

During the dinner, Pan gave a speech saying: "Today is the 'January 28th' in the Gregorian calendar. Looking back fifteen years, it was when our army bravely fought the enemy in the Battle of Shanghai. This glorious date is worth our deep commemoration. At the same time, today is also the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, which coincides with 'Human Day.' Under these two meanings, it inspires us to strive hard, be good people, and the reason why this gathering is held in Hongkou is to urge us to be vigilant. Its significance is even greater as the country moves forward in construction.

Today, I am hosting comrades from Shanghai's news, literary, writer, and drama departments. Due to space limitations, I regret that I cannot meet everyone. In the future, I plan to continue to meet with each department separately so that we can have more opportunities to connect and exchange opinions. Recalling the past during the War of Resistance, all comrades in the cultural circles have adhered to their posts and served the country. During this time, they endured hardships, and their unyielding spirit is worthy of our heartfelt admiration."

### Style of Hanging National Flags - Ordered to Pay Attention to Improvement - Yuanfang Vegetable Vendor's Stall Case - A Suitable Location Has Been Determined Separately - Municipal Government Responds to the Municipal Council

[Our Report] The Municipal Government has begun to implement and respond to the resolutions of the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council one after another. Regarding the Council's suggestion: (1) Please order the Police Bureau to rectify the way national flags are hung to ensure uniformity.

(2) It is requested that the Yuanfang Road Vegetable Market stalls continue and that the small triangular site be leased to set up stalls.

The Health Bureau and the Police Bureau have now verified that there is a Tongzhou Road vegetable market nearby that can be used to set up stalls, and it has been determined that an open-air stall can also be set up in the Dongyuyao Road vegetable market. Therefore, the Yunshide School site does not need to be leased. (3) The Council requested that the Women's Education and Rehabilitation Center be established quickly. According to the Social Bureau's report, it has already ordered Chen Xiaying and Li Yuanjiu to be the director and deputy director on November 23 last year, and they have been working in the old Tongzhou Road sex 　city market since December 1.

### Acquainted with a Dancer - Two Hearts Entwined - Tobacco Merchant's Love Affair Dispute - Each Has His Own Story About Chasing the Diamond Ring

[Our Report] Pang Liansheng, General Manager of Lianji Tobacco Company and Chinese Manager of Sino-American Lianhe Rainy Tobacco Leaf Company, is over fifty years old and resides at No. 6, Block B, Lane 1451, Xinzha Road. Before the Lunar New Year, he became acquainted with Meng Yunwei, a red dancer from Guangdong at the Dadong Dance Hall (pictured, 25 years old), and the two hearts were entwined. Pang opened a long room at No. 505 of the Dadong Inn. Meng said that she had no residence, so Pang opened Room 408 of Dadong on New Year's Eve for her to sleep in. The two were near the water and the tower, and often visited each other. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Pang presented Meng with a diamond ring weighing 1.95 carats, valued at 4.5 million yuan. According to Pang, he told Meng: I am specially offering this as an engagement ring for both parties, hoping to enhance our relationship and grow old together. Meng nodded and accepted the ring and left. Unexpectedly, Pang suddenly regretted it after Meng left, and that night he went to the Lao Guan Branch to accuse Meng of stealing his diamond ring. The branch immediately sent officers to the Dadong Dance Hall to investigate the truth. At that time, Meng Yunwei happened to be at the Yangzi Dance Hall for tea dancing, which was contrary to the police officers. It was not until about 8:00 PM that Meng arrived at Dadong. After being asked about the diamond ring by many handkerchief friends, she was also told that the police had come to investigate the case. Meng suddenly realized and was unhappy. It was not until about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon that Meng went to the Lao Zha Branch and told the whole story, admitting to the ring as a gift. Later, the bureau sent police to summon Pang to the bureau for individual interrogation. According to Pang, the ring was sold to his wife at home, and she paid for it after seeing it. He brought it to the room of the Dadong Inn, but unexpectedly it was stolen by him. According to Meng Yunwei: It was indeed given by him the day before yesterday, intending to get engaged. After I accepted it, he made a further request, wanting to do something indecent. After strict refusal, he broke up unhappily. Not long after, I went out in anger. Who knew that he became angry and reversed the facts, coming to the bureau to falsely accuse me of stealing the diamond ring. After interrogation, both parties insisted on their own stories, and they were ordered to go out temporarily for further investigation and verification.

### A Tragedy on the Lower Level of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company's Elevator - Worker Repairing the Switch - Elevator Driven Down and Crushed

Shen Xingen, a Ningbo native, who lives upstairs at the Guofeng Cigarette and Paper Store on Xiaoshadu Road, is 40 years old this year. He has been working as a repairman in the lighting repair department of Jardine Matheson & Co. At 1:30 PM yesterday, he was ordered to go to the lower level of the elevator of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company at No. 249 Chongqing South Road (i.e., Luban Road) to repair the light switch (according to the company's usual practice, the elevator is stopped from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM). At that time, the elevator happened to be stopped on the third floor. Unexpectedly, Li Yonggen, a native of Baoshan, who was the company's messenger number seven, 26 years old, and lived at No. 2 Tingluli, Xietu Road, finished lunch on the third floor and then took the initiative to start the elevator, wanting to go downstairs to rest.

### Two Thieves Back in the Legal Net 36 Hours After Being Released from Prison

[Our Report] Wu Fusheng, a boatman, and his wife, Liu, both from Danyang, who reside at No. 64 Huaxing Lane, Xicang Street, in the city, were suddenly visited by thieves at about 3:00 AM the day before yesterday.

### Guo Taiqi's Property Lawsuit: Tenants Refuse to Move, Appeal Filed with the High Court

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the victory, the housing shortage in our city has been severe, and the practice of demanding gold bars as "key money" is rampant, leading to frequent disputes between landlords and tenants. Recently, a property in Shanghai belonging to Guo Taiqi, an important figure in the party and the country, has also been involved in a lawsuit due to a lease relationship. It is said that Mr. Guo owns four houses on Tai'an Road and two houses on Wukang Road in this city. These properties were formerly managed by the real estate department of Wu Shang Gong and Yangxing. After the victory, the management was transferred to the Shanghai Bank Trust Department. Several months ago, the tenants were notified in writing, on the grounds that the landlord needed to reclaim the property for personal use, that their leases would not be renewed and they had to move out by a deadline. The tenants, due to the severe housing shortage, were unable to move and did not do so. The landlord then filed a lawsuit in court, which ruled that the tenants must move out and granted immediate enforcement. However, the tenants, citing that they have lived in the premises for many years, that the government has repeatedly stipulated protections for tenants, and that Mr. Guo's family members already live in one of the houses, were dissatisfied with the judgment and have appealed to the High Court.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Visits Child Refugees, Encourages Them to Study Skills Diligently: Over 1,600 Street Children Find New Life in Shelter

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] When you enter the Caohejing Shelter, you will see a vast drill ground, orderly buildings, and hundreds of children, from seven or eight years old to eighteen or nineteen years old, all dressed very neatly. They wear light gray cotton scout uniforms, black sneakers, white socks, and white gloves. Their faces are rosy, and they are energetic and orderly during drills. You will also hear the small military band practicing enthusiastically and the choir singing loudly. The reading room is crowded with children grabbing books, and they listen attentively to the lecturers in class. During free time, they put on roller skates and skate around, making you feel full of life and vitality. However, can you believe that most of them were once beggars, pickpockets, petty thieves, "little thirds" (referring to those involved in petty theft as part of a group), "water rats" (referring to those who steal from ships), or juvenile delinquents? When this reporter visited the shelter yesterday, 60 "street children" had just been sent in from the Bi Han Shelter. Some had run away from home after being abused by their stepmothers, and one young monk had run away from the temple because he could not endure the abbot's abuse and had resorted to stealing to survive. Some had scabies, and others had unkempt hair. Most of them had dirt on their faces, hands, and clothes. Compared to the children on the drill ground, they were very different. In fact, it is said that the well-trained children were even worse off than the newcomers seen yesterday when they first arrived, because the new arrivals had already been fed and clothed at the Bi Han Shelter for three months.

The child refugees come from different places. Some are street children sent in by the police, some are unruly children whose parents cannot control them, some are lost, and some are abandoned. In the past year, under the diligent leadership of Director Zhou Zuwang, the shelter has taken in over 4,000 child refugees. There are currently 1,600, including a few adults and over a hundred girls. When new children arrive at the shelter, the first thing is registration, followed by shaving their heads, bathing, disinfection, changing clothes, physical examination, and finally, they are sent to the psychological rehabilitation room for numbering.

The shelter is well-organized and disciplined. The children take care of all their activities themselves. Apart from a few staff members, washing clothes, cooking, and management are all handled by several "grand uncles" (older children) or refugees. What is most interesting and admirable is that they have their own "small court." This small court is completely democratic, and the three or four "judges" are all "elected by Wu." When reporters visited yesterday, the small court was hearing a case and was quite careful and thorough. It is said that when larger cases arise, the judges must consult with other jurors before announcing the verdict. The most serious crimes are stealing items from companions (such as pencils, erasers, etc.), cheating companions out of candy, and attempting to escape. The punishments are confinement in a "black room" for up to two weeks, or solitary confinement, etc.

The children are divided into various teams, with many team leaders of various sizes, even scabies team leaders, who are in charge of children with scabies. Those with serious illnesses are isolated for treatment.

Learning Skills to Serve the Country

Yesterday, the children were particularly excited because a distinguished guest arrived: Education Director Chiang Ching-kuo. Accompanied by Wu Shaoshu, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Youth League, and Cao Jun, the secretary-general, Director Chiang visited the shelter at 11:30 AM. He first inspected the teams, visited various activities, and delivered a speech, stating briefly: "I hope you will not be discouraged because you are poor. You should study useful skills well and serve the country in the future."

Indeed, who can say that among these many children, there will not be a standout figure in the future! Even in the present, these children are not without contributions to society. In addition to transforming themselves into new children, they also help the citizens of Shanghai by cleaning up piles of garbage every day and organizing teams to dredge the sewers.

However, moral guidance alone is not enough; they must also be provided with material support. The shelter authorities, especially Director Zhou, have great hopes for these children and have long established various plans. However, without the help of people in society, the work is difficult to carry out. The shelter's monthly expenses are about 30 million yuan or more, and the flour for food is supplied by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The municipal government, limited by its finances, provides very limited subsidies each month. Other income all relies on successive donations from enthusiastic philanthropists. After visiting the shelter last year, Mayor Wu's wife was very moved and often sent meat for the children to eat, because normally they only eat some vegetable noodle soup for each meal. They sleep on cement floors at night, but they all have straw mats and each person has a cotton blanket. The cleanliness and discipline are no less than that of the military. No wonder Director Chiang said that their training is so orderly and even better than that of the Air Force Preparatory School.

Great Philanthropist Donates Huge Sum

Director Zhou hopes to renovate the shelter this year and lay flooring so that the children will not be too cold when they sleep. In addition, he plans to conduct national education. Fortunately, the school building is not a problem, and a certain great philanthropist has pledged to donate 200 million yuan to build it. In addition, he plans to conduct national education and, for vocational training, plans to establish (1) a young automotive driving and repair class, (2) a papermaking and printing class, (3) a music, drama, dance, and recitation class, (4) an applied art class, (5) a young textile class, (6) an agricultural class, (7) a sewing and leather making class, (8) a radio management class, (9) a construction class, (10) a waiter class, (11) a nursing class, (12) a typist class, (13) a telephone operator class, and (14) a barber class. However, according to Director Zhou, major factories and businesses in this city have helped to solve the problems of other classes, but the automotive driving and repair class cannot be opened, and it is also a job that the children like the most, so he is racking his brains for this matter!

A Commemorative Banner Received with Shame

When the reporters visited the shelter yesterday, they also received a warm welcome from the child refugees and were specially presented with a banner inscribed with "Turning Decayed into Living." We dare not use this as propaganda for the shelter, but we want to take the position of compatriots and the position of humanity to call on people in society to extend your hands to save these lovely children, give them the courage to behave well and be good people, and give them the opportunity to learn a skill!

The meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu. The Mayor stated in his speech: A major fire occurred on Seymour Road and Wuding Road on the night of the 22nd of this month (Lunar New Year's Day). The Municipal Government and the Police Department deeply regret this unfortunate incident. Regarding rumors from the outside world that firefighters were derelict in their duties, the speaker, along with Police Department Director Xuan and Fire Department Director Zhou, both believe that the matter concerns the public interest of all citizens, and the investigation and handling must be absolutely open. The Municipal Government and the Police Department will not whitewash anything and should thoroughly investigate. The fire brigade should have a spirit of volunteerism. The speaker has now ordered the Fire Department that they must strive to put out fires in the future. Those who have made meritorious achievements may request special awards, but any malpractices must be strictly prohibited. The purpose of organizing this investigation committee is to clarify the truth and hope to prevent the recurrence of malpractices in the future. Therefore, all those present should be brave in testifying.

Regarding the tasks of the Investigation Committee, Mayor Wu believes that there are the following three items: (1) Administrative investigation, such as when the fire started, when the alarm was reported, when the fire brigade arrived, what was the situation during the firefighting, whether there was no oil or water, and whether there was any damage to the machinery. (2) Extortion, for this point, representatives from the Municipal Council, Jiangning District Baojia Chiefs, and affected residents are invited to fully investigate and report. (3) Looting, if any looting during the fire is verified, it will be severely punished.

Regarding how the Investigation Committee will proceed, it will be presided over by Director Ge. Mayor Wu especially suggested the following points: (1) Inquire with the affected residents. (2) Invite the newspaper reporters and American soldiers who arrived at the scene to testify. (3) Inquire with the commander and members of the fire brigade who arrived at the scene.

Mayor Wu concluded: China must move towards democracy. For this major event, it must be open and solemn. It is hoped that the investigation will be clear within three days from tomorrow to serve as a basis for handling the matter.

Zheng Zaijian Narrates the Actual Situation of the Fire

Zheng Bijian, the victim, then narrated the situation at the time of the fire, stating briefly: On the evening the fire broke out, the speaker was playing chess and enjoying himself with his nephew. Suddenly, he heard someone shouting that the house next door was on fire. He went upstairs, pushed open the window, and saw that the fire was raging. He immediately told his family to move the boxes and valuables downstairs. But soon the fire seemed to subside, and he thought it was over, so he moved the boxes and trunks back upstairs. His family all rejoiced. Unexpectedly, the fire suddenly spread to the adjacent residence of Wang Yunfu, causing them to flee again in a hurry. At that time, the fire was raging and could no longer be brought under control.

The speaker was always at the scene when the fire was spreading and only saw three firefighters attempting to rescue. And their attitude was very leisurely. When asked why they did not save No. 29, which had already been affected by the fire, one firefighter replied angrily, "There is no water in the hose, what do you know?" When the fire had spread to all three floors of No. 29, the firefighters simply stood by and watched, saying, "Damn it, let it go!"

Taking Sundries at Will, the Police Smile Bitterly

Zheng also said that at the time he also witnessed a firefighter enter No. 29 at will and steal two thermos bottles, and then calmly left for Gordon Road. Zheng immediately grabbed the policeman at that intersection and asked: "The firefighter is robbing things, why don't you arrest him?" The policeman only shook his head and smiled bitterly, doing nothing.

Two Questions

Zheng then raised two questions: (1) The firefighters were all completely inexperienced. After the fire hydrant on Seymour Road was opened, it was first connected to a water pressure machine, resulting in a violent water flow and the belt could not be connected, which wasted time. (2) The fire truck has a ladder equipment, but why was it never used? If a water hose had been used to vigorously pour water from the upper and lower floors of No. 29 when the fire first started at the coppersmith's shop, then it could have been insured and nothing would have happened. Zheng concluded that the matter concerns the interests of the public, and the authorities must thoroughly investigate it!

Mayor Encourages Reporting As Much As Possible

When Zheng described his experience in detail, Mayor Wu nodded repeatedly in agreement and encouraged those present to report as much as possible. Therefore, the attendees at the meeting were agitated, and Jiangning District Head Hou Junren also said angrily: If Wang Yunfu had no property, this disaster would not have happened! Although I dare not say definitively that the firefighters were extorting money, the fact that the safe was opened and the jewelry box disappeared is indeed true!

Preventing American Soldiers from Rescuing

Jia Chief Zhang Zhiwen also reported that when the fire was raging, the American barracks to the south released a hose in an attempt to rescue, but it was stopped by the firefighters at the scene. Later, the American soldiers had to run the hose across two houses in the compound and then spray water. Zhang also listed examples of firefighters making frivolous and teasing remarks when women from the affected area carried sundries to escape.

Bao Chief Cai Guoliang said that he knew for sure that Wang Yunfu's house had a fluorescent lamp and a flashlight, which a firefighter borrowed to use for firefighting, but it was never returned. According to Miss Wang, there was a wardrobe in her room that was not affected, but afterwards she found that it was full of axe marks, and a jewelry box inside had disappeared. The box contained many valuable items such as diamond bracelets, and its value cannot be estimated for the time being.

Hoping for More Assistance from Citizens

After listening to the reports from all parties, Municipal Council Representative Zhang Nai Zuo expressed his opinion, saying: There have always been rumors about the city's firefighters that "you have to talk about gold bars before fighting the fire." This rumor has not been dispelled to this day. After this incident occurred, Mayor Wu personally presided over the investigation. It is firmly believed that the truth will come out. If the discipline of firefighters can be rectified in the future, malpractices can be eliminated. However, citizens must provide practical assistance. Chinese people are often accustomed to thinking that "it is better to do nothing than do something," entrusting everything to fate, so that even the victims are unwilling to come forward and testify. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that citizens will be able to provide more assistance this time.

Steps Decided for Investigation

Finally, Director Ge reported on the tasks of the Investigation Committee and decided on the following investigation steps: At 9:00 AM on the 29th, gather at Cai Bao Chief's office (No. 350, Xiaoshadu Road) and depart to the disaster area to conduct an on-site investigation and draw a map of the disaster area. At 2:00 PM on the 29th, gather at the above location again and convene all the fire victims to express their opinions. If the fire victims are unwilling to attend, the committee will visit them in person. Continue the above visits on the morning of the 30th. Visit the fire brigade in the afternoon of the 30th. Visit the American soldiers on the morning of the 31st to investigate the situation at that time. The committee also welcomed reporters from various newspapers to participate to show the Municipal Government's intention to be open in everything.

Supervisory Envoy Cheng Pays Close Attention

Yesterday morning, Supervisory Envoy Cheng received Deputy Director Yu of the Police Department to hear various reports about the fire case, and at 11:00 AM, accompanied by Deputy Director Yu, went to Wuding Road to inspect the fire scene, inquired with the owners and neighbors at the fire scene, and Wang, Section Chief of the First Section of the Fire Department, explained the rescue situation at that time. It is heard that the Envoy Office is continuing its investigation.

### Three Prosecutors Inspect the Fire Scene: Wang's Wardrobe Smashed, Valuable Jewelry Disappeared; Fire Hose Pinned Under Collapsed Wall

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Three prosecutors from the District Procuratorate, Yang Shoucheng, Shen Zushou, and Huang Daping, led seven people, including a recorder and bailiffs, to the fire scene at No. 660, Seymour Road yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to inspect the scene and interview the affected residents to investigate whether the firefighters were derelict in their duties. They first went to Wang Yunfu's house, which suffered the most losses. Wang himself was out, and a female relative led the prosecutors to various places to investigate and stated that a jewelry box was indeed missing, containing items such as small gold bars and diamond rings. The jewelry box was hidden in a wardrobe on the third floor. Afterwards, it was found that the wardrobe had been smashed, and a piece of wood from the chopped off cabinet door was still left in the room. The prosecutors believed that this piece of wood had considerable value in proving the crime, so they immediately ordered the bailiffs to collect it and take it back. Next, they went to Yongqin Rubber Factory to inquire. According to one of the employees, because the factory was equipped with fire extinguishers, they were used during the fire and were quite effective, so the damage to the factory was relatively light. As for whether the firefighters demanded money, he had no way of knowing. It was also discovered that a large fire hose was pinned under a collapsed wall. The prosecutors believed that this point was also of great research value, because if the firefighters had been working hard to put out the fire, they would have been able to take care of the water hose at any time. According to eyewitnesses who reported to the prosecutors, the firefighters did not put out the fire at all and simply placed the fire hose on the ground. Later, the houses in that area caught fire, and the walls collapsed, so the fire hose was also buried. The three prosecutors returned at about 11:00 AM and will summon relevant personnel today as needed to prepare for voluntary reporting.

### Three Defendants Interrogated in Court in Case Involving Suspicious Sale of Materials

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The case involving the suspicion of corruption in the sale of materials by the Municipal Government's Receiving Materials Management Office and the Police Department's Police Welfare Committee, which was ordered to be thoroughly investigated by the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek) in a secret order, was heard behind closed doors again at the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The defendants Pan Shufan, Xu Jingbo, and Liao Gongshao, each accompanied by their defense lawyers, arrived in court on time. After presiding judge Huang Xianyu called the roll, he first questioned Pan Shufan, who stated: "As the Deputy Director of the Management Office, I am responsible for the routine work in the office. I only learned about the accusation after reading the case file. As for the number of fabrics sold, I no longer remember. According to the 'Measures for Selling Materials,' only public notices were posted and no advertisements were placed in newspapers. The supervisors at the time of the bidding were sent by the Police Department, and everything was reported to and approved by the superiors, and there is a record to check." Shen Shihua, the Director of the Material Management Office, was not present in court, but a lawyer acting on his behalf presented a statement stating that although he is the Director of the office, he really has no time to take care of everything, and all matters are handled by the Deputy Director and his subordinates. Xu Jingbo was then questioned and stated: "I am the Chairman of the Police Department's Police Welfare Committee. The purchase of cotton cloth was intended to enrich the foundation of the Welfare Committee. At that time, it was signed and submitted to the bureau for approval." Lawyer Li Aokui presented a copy of the signed submission.

Liao Gongshao stated: "As the Chief of General Affairs of the Police Department, the purchase of cotton cloth was for the benefit of the public, because at that time the police needed funds for issuing rice loans. The sale and purchase were all approved by Mayor Qian (Daxin)," and he said that Mayor Qian probably also approved it by the Chairman (Chiang Kai-shek), and both the Police Department and the Municipal Government have records to check. Xu Jingbo also stated: "After the batch of cotton cloth was purchased, the market price suddenly fell back, which was lower than the bid price. Therefore, some people opposed it at the meeting of the Police Welfare Committee and did not recognize it, such as the current new...

### Shanghai Prison Releases Inmates Busily: Returning Deposits, Taking Fingerprints, Repeatedly Admonishing Against Reoffending

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the fifth day of the Shanghai Prison releasing inmates eligible for the amnesty decree. The Shanghai Prison, after several days of painting, has a completely new appearance. The four characters of the horizontal plaque on the main gate, "Shanghai Prison," are painted in gold. The second gate is painted with the large character slogan "Understand Propriety and Righteousness, Know Integrity and Shame, Take Responsibility and Observe Discipline" in white characters on a blue background. A blue and white striped flagpole stands tall on the roof of the main gate. The national flag flutters in the wind, seemingly congratulating the inmates regaining their freedom. Family members of the inmates stood anxiously on both sides of the entrance, carrying bundles of clothes for changing, constantly looking inside. The prison's offices were unusually bustling. Warden Bai Qilin personally questioned the released inmates, first asking for their name, native place, and where they would go after release, and admonishing them not to reoffend in the future. Then, they took their fingerprints. After the procedures were completed, another bailiff gathered four or five inmates, holding exit permits, and led them out of the prison gate. Those who had deposits in the prison received their money back immediately upon presenting their passbooks, without the slightest error. Yesterday, a total of twenty-eight inmates were released, mostly for drug addiction and theft. The reporter also interviewed the person in charge of the Shanghai Prison to inquire about the total number of inmates released from the prison in the past five days. It was reported that on the first day, 281 inmates were released; on the second day, 612; on the third day, 25; on the fourth day, 84; and together with yesterday's 28, a total of 1,030 inmates eligible for the amnesty decree were released. Sub-bureau chief Zhuo Qingbao and former secretary Chen Shaoying both attended, which can prove it. As a result, the batch of cotton cloth was sold successively, and not only was there no profit, but there was a loss. All the incoming and outgoing funds are recorded in the public relief and can be checked. Judge Huang then summoned two witnesses, Wen Guangfeng and Dao Xianmo, the former deputy group leader and the current group leader of the former Property Management Office, to inquire about the bidding situation. They both said that they were acting on the orders of the director and deputy director at the time. The bidding price of the cotton cloth was 25% off the market price, and Rongmao Cotton Cloth Store won the bid. As for the owner of Rongmao and who introduced them, they all claimed not to know. The court stated that the case still needed to collect evidence and ordered a postponement for another hearing. Pan's defense lawyer, Wang Shanxiang, stood up and offered his opinion, stating that the defendant was acting under orders and whether the bidding procedures were legal or not should not be determined by newspaper announcements. Pan was particularly upright, so he asked the court to quickly investigate the evidence to clarify the truth as soon as possible. Finally, the court turned the three defendants over to three lawyers and ordered that they should be present whenever summoned for future court sessions and not evade them.

### Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau: Devoted to Modernization Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau is currently devoted to a military-proposed modernization plan, the focus of which is to expand stations, strengthen the repair capabilities of the locomotive plants, order new types of vehicles and locomotives, and increase electrical signals.

The first phase of the Railway Bureau's restoration plan expired at the end of February, and thereafter, it will devote itself to modernization work. However, for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, it was originally planned to replace more than 300,000 sleepers, but due to the difficulty in obtaining sleepers, only 10,000 to 20,000 sleepers have been replaced so far.

### Former French Municipal Council Chinese Staff Savings Fund: Awaiting Resolution by the Liquidation Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] Former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council petitioned the British Consulate in Shanghai to request the return of their pension and savings funds. However, since the city already had an organization called the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official Property Rights and Debt Liquidation Committee after the victory, the issue was transferred to the committee for handling, but it has not been resolved to date. Recently, former Chinese employees of the French Municipal Council also made the same request, asking for the return of their savings funds over the years.

Appointing Representatives to State Opinions

They appointed Xu Yaoting and Shen Weibin as representatives to attend a meeting of the French Concession Sub-committee of the Shanghai Municipal Former Concession Official Property Rights and Debt Liquidation Committee to explain the situation, stating that there were a total of 2,149 Chinese employees of the former French Municipal Council, and about 2,100 people have now registered to request the return of the savings funds. Many of them are from Henan and Shandong provinces and are now stranded in Shanghai, and their current situation is very difficult. Therefore, they hope that this issue can be resolved as soon as possible.

French Side Stated: No Salary Deduction

However, according to the French side, when the puppet government took over the concession, the Municipal Council originally intended to distribute the savings funds to the Chinese employees, but the puppet government was afraid that all the employees would resign after the distribution, which would lead to the collapse of the original organization. Therefore, they requested the Municipal Council not to distribute the funds, and this savings fund was a part of the budget set aside by the Municipal Council each year, assuming that 10% of the Chinese employees would retire, and this retirement fund was included in the budget as an expenditure, and was not deducted from the salaries of the employees.

The Liquidation Committee has now ordered the representatives of the former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council to compile a complete list of all personnel, indicating their Chinese names, addresses, the amount to be distributed, and whether they are still serving in the police bureau, and plans to determine a solution after reviewing the past relief register of the French Municipal Council.

### Export Promotion Committee to be Established in the Near Future: Providing Convenience to Merchants in Terms of Capital, Wholesale Purchasing and Sales Absolutely Untrue

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to reliable sources, the Export Promotion Committee will be established in the near future, and official news is expected to be announced at the beginning of next month. The committee will establish an executive committee in the Bank of China Building, and it is said that Bei Zuyi will serve as the chairman and experts from relevant industries will be hired as consultants. The purpose of the committee is to encourage exports, and it plans to provide as much convenience as possible to export merchants in terms of capital and shipping, and will discuss export subsidy measures, so that China's export industry can actively develop under the government's encouragement. The traditional notion of wholesale purchasing and sales from the outside world is absolutely untrue.

It is also learned that the Import Management Committee, in order to cooperate with the encouragement of exports, will list certain commodities related to alkali exports, such as lace and bleaching powder, which are used for the embroidery and pig bristle bleaching of China's exports, as examples of unlimited imports.

### Rice Prices Turn Flat, Oil Market Declines Quietly

Yesterday, about 3,000 piculs of grain arrived in Shanghai's South Gate and Zhabei, and Saigon rice continued to be supplied. A total of 330 packages were traded in the North and South Markets. Although the source of high-quality japonica and indica rice was scarce, shopkeepers saw their appetite waning due to high prices and difficult retail sales. The Central Trust Bureau shipped 86,000 packages of Thai rice by sea, which is being unloaded and will be distributed by the Social Affairs Bureau. As a result, people's hearts were weakened, and japonica and indica rice fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan in the black market, and the situation has turned flat and tired. The oil market has also been quiet because vegetable oil factories are distributing oil, and off-market prices have plummeted by more than 10,000 yuan, with few official transactions in the market. Soybean prices have been rising steadily, and the more expensive they are, the more solid they become, rising by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Oil factories have been buying from Shantou and inland areas, and the market is still bullish. Soybean cake has been continuously shipped to Taiwan and Shantou, rising slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran has been stable and rising. Flour and starch have continued to be supplied. Unified flour has continued to be supplied, and the market has stabilized. However, local flour has continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan due to high prices in the inland areas. Corn has been scarce in terms of arrivals and sales, and prices have remained unchanged. Red beans have been ordinary, mung beans have also been unchanged, and raw peanuts have been actively traded in Guangzhou, continuing to rise sharply, rising by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

### Social Affairs Bureau Sells Over 10,000 Packages of Saigon Rice

Since the Spring Festival, the supply of rice in the city has decreased, and rice weevils have been causing problems, so rice prices have risen. Yesterday, the black market price of white rice reached 80,000 yuan. In order to suppress rice prices, the Social Affairs Bureau released more than 10,000 packages of Saigon rice in the North and South rice markets yesterday. The price was still 63,000 yuan, and the retail price was limited to 70,000 yuan. It is learned that the quality of the Saigon rice released by the Social Affairs Bureau is relatively poor, and most Shanghai citizens are accustomed to eating white rice, which is another reason for the rise in white rice prices.

### China Trust Bureau Purchases Silk: Sichuan Silk Arrives in Shanghai Steadily

Since the China Trust Bureau began purchasing Grade D autumn silk and other baked spring and autumn silkworm silk on the 21st of this month, as of the previous day, the Loan Management Office has delivered 635 piculs of autumn silk and 235 piculs of other baked silkworm silk, totaling 870 piculs, which is more than half of the total amount of autumn silk. Yesterday, the Raw Silk Inspection Institute delivered 100 piculs of raw silk inspection forms that passed the inspection to the Loan Management Office, which will be delivered to the China Trust Bureau in a few days. It was previously estimated that the purchase would be completed within a month, but if the delivery proceeds smoothly as planned, it may only take two weeks to complete.

In addition, the spring and autumn raw silk produced in Sichuan last year has been steadily shipped to Shanghai. A total of more than 150 piculs have arrived this month, and it is said that another 300 to 400 piculs are also on the way, which will all be purchased by the China Trust Bureau.

### Tianjin Merchants' Appetite Declines: Green Tea Sales are Desolate

According to people in the industry, the Dafang Zhulan and Shuangdang green teas, which used to be popular in Tianjin, have been quiet since the New Year. The reason is that actual sales there are currently very sluggish, so imports have been declining. And among the local industry in this city, before the tea has been sold out, it is difficult to develop the market based on the current situation.

### Edible Oil and Rubber: High Prices and No Market

In the city markets after the Spring Festival, red boards have opened for almost everything, but the edible oil and rubber markets remained unopen yesterday. The edible oil market's limited prices are so low, it is hard to break the logjam, and the market can not be opened. Outside the market, the very rare transactions prices are shockingly high. Rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and crude oil are all as high as 150,000, and soybean oil is even as high as 200,000. People from the other provinces are bulk buying bean cake at the market. People in the rubber market are expecting high prices, but customers are mostly afraid to make deals at the outside prices, and the factories are in a hurry to ship their products. It is said that the authorities are paying close attention to the freezing stagnation in these two markets, and have expressed that they will not allow black market trading at high prices.

### Private Industrialists Demand Compensation from Japan: Plan to Establish Ten Factories

[Our Newspaper's Report] Our country's demand for compensation from Japan has a plan written up about compensation from Japan on the side of privately owned industries. According to Zhuang Zhihuan, the general director of the Industrial Association, there are two points of significance in the demand for compensation from Japan: first, what are the present needs of our country? Second, what is a possible number for compensation by Japan to our country? Under these two major premises, composing a plan will not be too big and unachievable. At present, the total sum of compensation by Japan to our country is yet unknown. The sum of compensation possibly gained by the privately owned industries may be 20 percent of the total sum. If machines of this compensation is at all possible, they will be used to establish ten factories, which are categorized as below: (1) shipbuilding factory; (2) bearing factory; (3) machine factory; (4) electric machinery factory; (5) electric appliance factory; (6) steam boiler factory; (7) steam engine factory; (8) internal combustion engine factory; (9) hydraulic machinery factory; (10) agriculture tool factory. These factories are planned to be established in Shanghai or the regions close to Shanghai. The machines required are said to be between 5,000 and 8,000. The shareholders will be the manufacturers who suffered damages during the war. The stocks will be distributed in proportion to the size of the losses suffered. This final plan is to be presented to the Economic Ministry in a week's time.

### China Trust Bureau Distributes Goods as Before: Rayon Prices Plunge

### Regulations of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department on the Handling of Foreign Cotton Purchases

Regarding the application for import licenses and foreign exchange settlement for cotton imports, the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank recently notified all designated foreign exchange banks that the settlement of transactions for cotton imports already concluded by the state must be handled in accordance with the following regulations: (1) From now on, cotton import licenses can only be applied for by yarn factories. After approval, the license will be issued directly to the yarn factory. (2) For transactions concluded before November 17, 1946, the import licenses will be issued to the respective yarn factories after prior approval by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department. (3) All other license applications already submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department will be regarded as applications made after November 17. These will be returned to the designated banks by this department for delivery to the original applicants, who should follow the designated methods of the Import Cotton Allocation Committee. All applicants should pay attention to the following procedures: (A) Each applicant should directly apply to the Import Cotton Allocation Committee for an import license, which will issue a cotton allocation certificate. The designated subcommittee will issue the certificate to each yarn factory based on their actual needs (calculated according to the number of spindles already in operation), after deducting the existing cotton inventory and the quantity already approved for import. (B) If the raw cotton purchased by a yarn factory is classified as a transaction after November 17, the yarn factory can use the allocation certificate to apply for import. However, the quantity stated on the license shall not exceed the quantity stated on each allocation certificate. (C) Importers must pay attention to the following points: (1) Goods already sold to non-yarn factories must be resold to yarn factories. (2) Goods already shipped and en route but not yet sold as of November 24, 1946, can be sold to yarn factories. (3) All transactions classified as after November 17 must apply for and be issued import licenses based on the allocation certificate. The sale of such goods must target yarn factories lacking cotton. (4) Import licenses will not be issued for cotton not yet sold or shipped as of November 24, 1946. (5) The Central Bank reserves the right to settle and sell foreign exchange for the above-approved cotton imports, unless it believes that the applicant has no foreign exchange position and cannot obtain foreign exchange from other sources. (6) All future transactions for purchasing cotton from abroad must be handled in accordance with the regulations for transactions after November 17. Ge Zi Bi Zou was quoted at 500 yuan, Hua Zhong Zou at 3,600 yuan. Sheng Huo goods had listed prices but no transactions. New Hang Zhou goods were also high, and Luo Fang still had a way to go.

### Weak Clearance of Cotton Cloth, Cotton Market Remains Buoyant

In the cotton cloth market, Shi Lin cloth was scarce due to limited factory output, and there was a slight clearance of goods from local merchants. Therefore, the asking price rose by 2,000 yuan per bolt. Fine cloth and Si Jun Zi Pi Ji were scarce on the market, but fortunately, purchases were not smooth, so the price was slightly firm. Other cloths were stable.

Among cotton textiles,絨衫 (velvet shirts) were out of season and the market declined. However, socks woven with 32-count yarn were selling strongly, and the market was very firm.

Also, in the cotton market, small yarn factories made some purchases. Bai Luo cotton and Da Zhong Ji fine lint cotton each sold two to three hundred bales, and the market was very buoyant.

### New York Market Survey Demand and Prices for Chinese Export Goods in the United States

[United Press, New York, 27th] The United Press recently surveyed the demand and prices for Chinese export goods in New York, with the following results:

Sheepskin—The sheepskin market is expected to stabilize later, but it is currently not doing well. Market prices have fallen, but sellers' asking prices are high compared to US price trends.

Rabbit Skin—The situation is generally the same as for sheepskin, but with larger import volumes.

Feathers (Duck Feathers for Bedding)—The market is highly competitive, and values have plummeted, partly due to too few bedding covers and partly due to competition from many synthetic products. The quality of imported goods deters buyers, and quantities are inconsistent. The situation is the same for patterned goods, which were imported from China before the war, but their demand changes with women's preferred styles.

Rhubarb—Prices are being manipulated by speculators. The price for consumption is US$1.40 to US$1.45 per pound, including freight. The market price will trend downward.

Musk—The competition from synthetic musk is increasing. However, dry goods are being offered up to US$85 per tael when transported to the US by air, but transactions must be based on inspection of the goods. Chinese offers have recently been as low as US$78 per tael, including ocean freight or delivery at Chinese airports.

Tung Oil—The standard product sells for US$0.38375 to US$0.395 per pound in the United States, but Chinese sellers are asking for US$0.40 per pound. American merchants are unwilling to import at this price due to high freight and insurance costs.

Pig Bristles—Government surplus goods were disposed of on January 6. American merchants hope to buy them at lower prices and are currently unwilling to import them from abroad.

Beeswax—Currently, only crude beeswax can be sold. Prices vary depending on the source, ranging from US$0.48 to US$0.54 per pound for delivery in New York to US$0.50 to US$0.53 per pound for delivery at African ports. According to a major buyer, purchases will resume when beeswax prices return to the normal level of US$0.20 to US$0.30 per pound.

Gallnuts and Myrobalan are being inflated by speculators. After the war, common gallnuts in New York were as high as US$0.46 per pound, but have recently fallen back to an average of US$0.20 per pound. Freight costs are US$40 per ton, and insurance is US$1.03 per US$100, plus other expenses. Chinese merchants consider this price too low.

Raw Silk—Chinese raw silk shipped to the United States is very small in quantity compared to Japanese silk, and prices are also restricted by official prices.

### Large Quantities of Fertilizer Shipped to China

The Executive Yuan's relief agency (行總) collaborates with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in handling agricultural and fishery materials. Last year, the UNRRA shipped approximately 100,000 tons of agricultural and fishery materials, with fertilizer accounting for the majority and fishery equipment coming in second. However, the amount of fertilizer shipped by UNRRA has been decreasing, making it difficult for the ministry to allocate it. The demand for fertilizer in various regions is very urgent. UNRRA has telegraphed Washington, D.C., urging them to ship the full amount as soon as possible. It is reported that UNRRA may ship 3,000 tons of fertilizer to China this spring. The ministry has detailed plans for the utilization of agricultural machinery and will strive to implement them this year to increase agricultural production in various regions.

### Ample Cigarette Inventory, Market Prices Stabilized

Yesterday's cigarette market was stable, with the exception of Yizhong Company cigarettes, which were slightly popular, because the inventory of fellow merchants was ample and sales were not brisk.

Among daily necessities, Gu Ben and Arrow Brand soap had strong demand from local merchants, and prices continued to rise. Mei Li Feng Huang (Beautiful Phoenix) matches were scarce on the market, and prices were firm.

### Manufacturers Requesting to Lay Off Workers, Social Affairs Bureau Lacks Countermeasures

Amid the economic downturn, factories have made it through the Lunar New Year, but some factories have not yet resumed operations after the Spring Festival and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to approve layoffs. It is reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has received more than ten applications from manufacturers to lay off workers in the past two days. The Social Affairs Bureau attaches great importance to this issue and is currently discussing countermeasures.

### Scarce Arrivals, Sellers Hesitant, High New Quotation for Jiaozuo Lump Coal

The coal market for white coal Jiaozuo lump coal was characterized by scarce arrivals and sellers being hesitant. Therefore, the opening price was delayed. Yesterday, a high price of 840,000 yuan was quoted, an increase of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Later, it rose to 860,000 yuan, with strong demand. Other white coal Hongji lump coal, etc., followed the previous trend with no fluctuations. Transactions of bituminous coal Kaiping lump and fines were smooth, and market prices were stable. Coal briquettes from large and small factories all increased by 20,000 yuan per ton, with large factories quoting 380,000 yuan ex-factory and small factories quoting 360,000 yuan ex-factory.

### Cotton Yarn Resumes Shipping South, Guangzhou Factories Resume Operations

Previously, the suspension of cotton yarn shipments to the south led to the closure of over 300 textile factories in Guangzhou. Now that cotton yarn has resumed shipping south, yarn prices have fallen, and supply and demand are balanced. Many merchants from Southeast Asia have come to Guangzhou to order cloth, and the factories have resumed operations one after another.

### Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee Actively Developing Work

The Shanghai Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee, jointly organized by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Trust Company, and the China Silk Company, provides raw materials to the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture, which produces various types of silk fabrics. The committee then ships these fabrics to England, France, India, and Southeast Asia for sale to earn foreign exchange. The committee's work is now actively underway. It is reported that the cost of raw materials accounts for half of the export price of these manufactured goods, with the remainder being labor costs, which can double the foreign exchange earned compared to exporting raw silk alone. If China's total output of qualified raw silk this year reaches 30,000 bales, and half of it is used to weave silk fabrics for export, it can be worth US$30 million. For example, the committee's first phase of providing 1,400 bales of factory silk to the Joint Venture costs approximately US$1.12 million, and 2,400 cases of rayon cost approximately US$860,000, totaling US$1.98 million. After three months, over 80,000 bolts of wide-width export silk fabrics can be woven, which can be worth around US$5 million at current overseas market prices. The remaining US$3 million represents labor costs that can also be converted into foreign exchange.

He also briefly commented on the works of Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Forster, and Lawrence.

Mr. Xiao compared and studied the intellectual and emotional state of Chinese writers with British writers, believing that there are some fundamental differences between the writers of the two countries. For example, British writers loathe machinery, while Chinese writers praise heavy industry; British writers such as Forster focus on private relationships, while Chinese writers regard this as a source of nepotism and corruption. Mr. Xiao concluded that the reason why Chinese and British writers have these differences is not due to the different languages, but because our country still needs to work hard to overthrow the "Corn Laws" and strive for the "Reform Act." The gap between China and Britain is at least one century.

### Shaanxi North Road National School Holds Post-Disaster Meeting Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] The National School on Shaanxi North Road in this city suffered extensive damage in the major fire during the Lunar New Year holiday. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a post-disaster meeting was specially convened at the National Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau to discuss related issues. Attendees included Mr. Zhu Junti, Lu Guanliu, Ge Chenghun, Shen Caizhang, Wu Hanyuan, Hou Junren (represented by Feng Xi), the head of the Twelfth District, and Pan Wenzhen, the principal of the school, among others. Principal Pan first reported on the situation after the fire, stating that only about two classrooms' worth of desks and chairs remained. Additionally, a piano and the library books had been salvaged. It was reported to the police that the school had suffered losses of approximately 300 million yuan, and the faculty and staff had suffered losses of approximately 80 million yuan. The temporary relief fund of 2 million yuan allocated by the municipal government had been distributed to the affected teachers and staff. After the school was destroyed, parents of students came to inquire, and a temporary office has now been set up at Xin Zha Road Elementary School. Following this, Director Zhu Junti reported that Director Gu had proposed at the municipal government meeting to find ways to rebuild the school, with the construction cost estimated at 200 million yuan, which could be allocated from existing funds in the Municipal Bank. The Land Administration Bureau would be responsible for allocating a piece of public land for the new school site.

The school has approximately 700 students. After consultation, the following temporary relief measures were determined: before the new school building is completed, students will temporarily attend classes at nearby municipal schools. The arrangement is as follows: Xin Zha Road Elementary School will lend four classrooms, with classes held after 4:00 PM. Changde Road Elementary School will lend three classrooms, with classes held after 3:30 PM. Singapore Road Elementary School will lend four classrooms, with classes held after 4:00 PM. Yanping Road Elementary School can accommodate forty to fifty students in the intermediate and advanced grades. Experimental People's School and Municipal Girls' High School have also agreed to lend classrooms and are currently in contact. In addition, the Changde Road Bethlehem Home and the Wuding Road Orphanage still have vacant rooms, and it was decided that Principal Pan would first contact the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Two British Female Educators Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Early Next Month to Give Public Academic Lectures in Various Places

The British Council, in order to strengthen cultural ties between China and Britain, recently hired two renowned female educators from Britain, Dr. Clarke and Miss Greer, to come to China and give public academic lectures for four months. They are about to arrive in Hong Kong and will transfer to Shanghai. The British Council has sent a representative to Hong Kong to meet them, and they are expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month. It is currently planned for them to give lectures for ten days at universities and academic organizations in the city, and then go to Beijing. Afterward, Mr. Boster, the Council's representative in Western China, will accompany them to Hankou, Chongqing, Beiping, and other places to give similar lectures. The lecture content will cover women's education and careers, English language teaching, the relationship between industry and women, as well as economic, historical, and other issues.

Miss Lynda Greer developed a strong interest in economics and modern art at a young age. After graduating from the Department of Oriental Studies at Cambridge University, she worked at her alma mater. After the outbreak of World War I, she taught economics at Cambridge, becoming the first woman to teach at the university, which caused a sensation nationwide. In 1921, she became the principal of Margaret College at Oxford University.

Dr. Mary Clarke, a Scottish national, studied education and medieval and modern linguistics at Aberdeen University and Girton College, Cambridge University. Afterward, she served as the principal of Edinburgh Ladies' College and Manchester High School for Girls for a total of twenty-one years. In 1942, Aberdeen University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 1931, she was one of the British female principals who visited universities in Canada, and is thus well-known in educational circles around the world.

### London Actively Preparing for Next Year's World Games: Accommodation for 5,000 Athletes Becomes a Problem

[Translated by our Editorial Office from Reuters, London] The next Olympic World Games will be held in London in 1948, from July 29th to August 14th. The World Games Organizing Committee has recently issued a formal announcement, initially announcing the details of the preparations, stating that 5,000 well-known athletes from 25 countries (Germany and Japan have not been invited) will participate in the competition. The accommodation problem for this large number of athletes must be resolved with the assistance of the government. It is expected that a new Olympic Village will be built specifically for athletes to reside in, but the government has not yet decided on the location. Organizational work has now begun. A new road is being paved from Wembley Station to the sports field, and special changing rooms, showers, and bathing facilities are also under construction. In addition, an open-air swimming pool and a special track for athletes are also planned to be built.

Torch Relay: The second difficult problem is to light the Olympic torch. This torch must continue to burn during the Games, regardless of wind, rain, or sunshine, and must be visible during the day, and only be extinguished on the closing day. The torch will be lit on Mount Olympus in Greece using a giant magnifying glass to capture sunlight, and then carried by athletes in running, cycling, and equestrian events in a relay race across the European continent, and finally placed in the sports field as a decoration for the opening ceremony.

Building a New Village: But the most difficult problem to deal with is the accommodation and meals for the 5,000 athletes and staff. The construction of the Olympic Village does not seem to be a problem, but its location is still unknown. The choice of location must be based on the standard that all houses can be used for civilian or military purposes after the Games are closed. The new village must also be as close as possible to Wembley Station and the sports field. It has been suggested that the United States and other countries can use large postal ships to transport athletes to London and moor them on the Thames, allowing them to stay on board during the conference. The United States adopted this method during the 1928 World Games in Amsterdam, but the dock there was closer to the sports field, while the London dock is farther from Wembley.

Air Transportation: It is heard that the United States is currently considering using airplanes to transport athletes in batches during the competition. In this way, the food and accommodation problems of the athletes can be easily solved. This method is very convenient for amateur athletes who cannot leave their jobs for a long time, but athletes who can get a vacation oppose this method. Finally, there is a piece of news that all long-distance runners around the world do not want to hear, that Mr. Watterson, the British long-distance runner who won the European 10,000-meter race championship in Oslo, the capital of Norway last year, reiterated his determination not to participate in international competitions.

Competition Program: [British News Agency, London, 28th] Preparations for the World Games to be held in the United Kingdom next year have begun. The British government has established a committee to discuss the housing problem for the 5,000 athletes from all over the world, and it is generally expected that this is the biggest problem faced by the organizers. The sports program will include seventeen items such as equestrian, rowing, fencing, shooting, boxing, swimming, football, basketball, and weightlifting. Art competitions such as literature, sculpture, music, architecture, painting, and woodcut will also form part of the Games program as usual. Readjustment of the Executive Yuan

### US Policy Toward China: A Grand Debate!

— Autumn Goose Sends from New York

Airsmail dispatch dated 14th

This is a speech from August 20th of last year, and it seems outdated. However, despite differing opinions, it still represents many Americans today. The participants' demeanor is also admirable. Since China is now moving in the direction of democracy, we must naturally learn their debate methods.

Organizer: American Air Forum (Radio Broadcasting Organization)

Debate Topic: What Should We Do About China?

Debaters: Forman (Harrison Forman), writer and explorer.

Dr. Kennard (Dr. J. Spencer Kennard), former missionary to China.

Ms. Utley (Freda Utley), writer.

Dr. Kohlberg (Dr. Alfred Kohlberg), member of the American-China Policy Association.

Chairman: Dr. Ray (Dr. Joseph M. Ray), Director of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.

Reporter: Is our China policy leading to world peace? Should we withdraw? Should we side with one party? What should we do about China?

This important question is being discussed again today on your American Air Forum (applause).

Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! From your capital city of the Shoreham Hotel, the Mutual Broadcasting Company is proud to present the pioneer of American free radio broadcasting services, the American Air Forum, founded eighteen years ago by Mr. Granik, a prosecutor and arbitrator. Every week, the American Air Forum raises important issues and invites people with the power to influence decisions to hold debates.

Today, Mr. Granik is away on assignment, and we have specially invited a guest to serve as chairman, Dr. Ray, Director of the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland.

Chairman Ray: Good evening!

The verbal disputes in Paris are very fierce, and the gun battles in Asia continue. The blood-soaked land of China has no chance to dry. The Chinese have not seen peace for almost ten years. Today, there is no foreign enemy that unites all Chinese people against foreign aggression, but rather a civil war that tears China apart.

The basis of China's disputes is the long-term feud between the National Government and the Communist Party. Today, this feud seems farthest from being resolved. Our representative to China, Marshall, reportedly said last week that he has abandoned hope for a short-term solution. This morning, the Communist Party headquarters in Yan'an ordered full mobilization to wage a full-scale civil war against the National Government. They said that this decision was made to destroy the offensive of Marshal Chiang Kai-shek.

Our China policy, according to President Truman's statement when he sent General Marshall, is to help China rebuild into a unified and democratic nation by all possible means, capable of shouldering its responsibilities in the Pacific and as a member of the international family. There is no dispute over the purpose of this policy. However, informed members of American public opinion have great disputes over how to achieve this goal.

One group believes that our policy only increases the conflict between Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the Communist Party. They believe that the State Department is strengthening what they call a fascist faction while pursuing this policy, and they believe that the Communist Party is a reformer.

They demand that we stop this policy and should aid the people of China, not aid a faction that they believe is unwilling to give the people basic democratic ideals.

Another group is equally resolute and equally familiar with the situation in China, and argues that we should continue to support the National Government as the greatest bulwark against Russian domination of the country. Their basis is our traditional open-door policy. They say that if the Communist Party gains power, this policy will be lost.

The entire American foreign policy in the Pacific is being questioned. It was in the Pacific that the seeds of war were planted. We must not go wrong now to avoid future disputes.

Tonight, the American Air Forum continues its important discussion on international issues, inviting four authorities with first-hand experience and understanding of the China issue. From their different opinions, we believe that you can obtain enough facts to form your own opinions.

Now, they are here. First, Ms. Utley, a well-known writer of many books on China. Ms. Utley! Please speak!

Ms. Utley: The situation in China today is similar to that of Spain before the Second World War in many ways. I think we should give our ally, the legitimate government of China, full and effective support to resist the red fascist spies who are trying to destroy China's independence and all hope for the development of a democratic country, in order to turn China into a vassal under Russian dictatorship. We should stop forcing the Chinese government to share power with the Moscow spies, the Chinese Communist Party, whose purpose is to keep China divided, weak, and poor, as long as the Chinese government is friendly to the United States.

The lessons we have learned in Europe should warn us not to be deceived again and not to be fooled again. We have already sold Mikolajczyk and the Poles, allowing the Russians to laugh at the Atlantic Charter throughout Europe.

Instead, we should use all our strength in the hands of China's true freedom fighters. When we assume that the Communist Party is a transformer of democracy, we are saying the opposite. Naturally, since we have recognized red terror and totalitarian dictatorship as being mixed with the word democracy, the reactionary elements within China have also raised their heads.

Chairman Ray: Thank you, Ms. Utley. Next, Mr. Forman, writer and explorer. Mr. Forman!

Mr. Forman: Dr. Ray, I believe that in the mess of Chinese politics, who is right and who is wrong is no longer worth discussing. The continued presence of American troops in China, against the wishes of millions of Chinese people (regardless of whether they are red, white, or blue in politics), can only be explained as an undisguised and blatant plan for our country to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.

Moreover, giving weapons and military transportation equipment to one Chinese faction to oppose another Chinese faction is not only a hypocritical act that is exactly contrary to our mediation mission, but also fundamentally immoral no matter how it is measured.

If I were to give those weapons to the Chinese Communist Party, I would also consider it equally immoral. Because in the end, you cannot explain handing a gun to one Chinese person to let him kill his Chinese compatriots, regardless of who is right and who is wrong in their mutual quarrel.

Let us return the Chinese people to the Chinese people.

Chairman Ray: Thank you, Mr. Forman. Next, Mr. Kohlberg, a member of the American-China Policy Association. Mr. Kohlberg!

Mr. Kohlberg: Basically, Dr. Ray, the situation in China is extremely simple. Germany is the first, and China is the second, in Russia's process of conquering the world. Conquering Germany is for its industry; conquering China is for its manpower. The Chinese Communist Party, like the Communist Party anywhere, is a trained tool of Moscow. The question facing the United States today is whether to help Russia conquer China or to adhere to America's traditional foreign policy, namely, the open door and the independence and territorial integrity of China.

Chairman Ray: Thank you, Mr. Kohlberg. Now, Dr. Kennard, a missionary who has been to China. Dr. Kennard!

Dr. Kennard: Let us admit that the Russians believe that their own way of life is good, just as the British and Americans believe that the British and American way of life is good, and the question is how to spread that particular philosophy. I believe that the method we are currently using to maintain the reputation of the United States is very bad. We are now arming fascist factions, which will turn against the United States in the future. Forcing the Chinese people to take the path of communism, so that the Chinese people have no way to avoid foreign (American) military domination except for this, is very bad. Stopping normal economic activities (trade) and stipulating what kind of government form the Chinese must have, making the civil war never stop, is also very bad for the United States. We need those happy 500 million customers. Expanding a war in Asia, as we are doing today, giving encouragement to stubborn factions, is very bad for the United States. This war may become global. World War III has already begun!

### China Has Russia Behind It; Russia Attempts to Wrestle America Out

Chairman Ray—Thank you, Ms. Utley and gentlemen. Now the problem is clear, and the positions of both sides are understood.

To start the discussion, Mr. Foreman, do you think we should withdraw from China?

Mr. Foreman—Dr. Ray, a resounding "yes." Involving Russia in the China issue is like adding a red herring to the picture. Unless we are willing to stain our hands with the blood of 50,000 innocent Chinese people, who will and have already died under American-made guns and bombs, let us withdraw from China, and quickly!

Chairman Ray—Ms. Utley!

Ms. Utley—I would like to ask the two gentlemen on the other side, especially Mr. Foreman, a question, because they have spoken about strengthening the military power of the Fascist faction. Before we continue the discussion, I think we should first clarify what they mean by Fascist. So I would like to ask Mr. Foreman if he agrees with Mr. Ehrenberg's definition: that anyone who opposes Communist Russia is a Fascist. If so, do you believe that any Chinese and Americans who oppose Russian aggression or domination are Fascists?

Mr. Foreman—Ms. Utley, Mr. Ehrenberg's and your definition of Fascist reminds me of the current American definition of Communist? Today, anyone who disagrees with you is a Communist.

Ms. Utley—I asked if you agree with Mr. Ehrenberg's definition. I never said I agreed with it.

Mr. Foreman—I disagree with Mr. Ehrenberg, and I disagree with you.

Ms. Utley—Could you please give your definition of Fascist? I mean when you use that term in relation to China.

Mr. Foreman—A Fascist is someone who does not give people a democratic way of life.

Ms. Utley—Then the Chinese Communists are also Fascists, because they follow Russia, and Russia completely denies people a democratic way of life.

Mr. Foreman—I agree in part. The Chinese Communists, according to my definition, may be partially Fascist, but I disagree with your statement that they have any connection with Russia.

Mr. Colberg—Dr. Ray, it seems to me that we have already reached the heart of the matter. Mr. Foreman believes that the Chinese Communists have no connection with Russia. However, from 1921 until the Comintern was ostensibly dissolved in 1943, they were members of the Comintern. They could not have been members for so long unless they were extremely disciplined and obedient.

Moreover, I would like to read to Mr. Foreman what the boss or dictator of the Chinese Communist Party, if you will call him that, that is, Mao Zedong, Mr. Foreman's hero, himself said: "The whole world today expects Communism to be their savior, and so does China. The conflict between socialist Soviet Russia and imperialist Britain and America is becoming increasingly tight. If China does not stand on this side, it must stand on that side."

Mr. Foreman—Mr. Colberg, I personally applaud Mr. Mao Zedong for being so frank in expressing his views. But what you read was said by Mr. Mao Zedong some time ago. Few people in the United States know what Chiang Kai-shek said two years ago in "China's Destiny." Anyone who has read that book says it is the most xenophobic work ever published in China. This "China's Destiny," with Chiang's approval, is required reading for millions of Chinese people, just like Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in Germany. But—

Ms. Utley (interrupting)—Please pay attention, Mr. Foreman!

Mr. Foreman—But in America, they don't allow people to read it. Please forgive me for a moment. Let me finish this, okay? Here, in the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C., there is an English translation of "China's Destiny," but it is marked "Top Secret."

Ms. Utley—I want to say that we have strayed from the topic. Naturally, a country like China, which has suffered from the aggression of various powers for a hundred years, will inevitably have a certain degree of xenophobia. The problem today is that it is completely wrong to say that millions of Chinese people want Americans to withdraw from China, as you two have said. My experience in China is exactly the opposite. You may have heard that the first American journalists to arrive in Manchuria were welcomed by the local residents, who patted their epaulets and asked them to save them from the Russians and the Communists.

Mr. Foreman—May I show you a photo, Ms. Utley, of 100,000 students in Shanghai demonstrating against the American troops in Shanghai, demanding that they withdraw from China.

Ms. Utley—You can do anything.

Dr. Kennard (interrupting)—May I add that even in my school, West China University, in order to get students to demonstrate against Russia, the president had to first grant a thirty-day vacation to those who were willing to participate.

Mr. Colberg—Mr. Foreman, you told me that 100,000 people in Shanghai demonstrated against the government. Where else…

Mr. Foreman—I didn't say they were against the government, I said they were against the U.S. military staying in China.

Mr. Colberg—Yes, and also against the government.

Mr. Foreman—I didn't say they were against the government, Mr. Colberg.

Mr. Colberg—Outside of China, which Fascist country has ever had 100,000 people demonstrate against the government's policies?

Mr. Foreman—That's a strange way of arguing, Mr. Colberg, you're twisting things. What I'm saying is that the Chinese people don't want the U.S. military stationed in China, you can't twist that into saying that there is democracy in Chiang Kai-shek's government.

Ms. Utley—Did you ever agree to give up the war against Japan? Because Wang Jingwei represented many of those who advocated "letting the Chinese run their own affairs." Why should we fight Japan? Are you willing to let China be ruled by a Japanese puppet?

Mr. Foreman—Please make it clear, who are we still fighting in China today?

Ms. Utley—As I have explained, we all know perfectly well that Russia is behind it. Russia is trying to wrestle America out, close the door to China, and make China part of its totalitarian empire.

Mr. Foreman—I agree with you, the situation is just like in Spain; unfortunately, we replaced Hitler and Mussolini with armed intervention.

Ms. Utley—Good heavens! Did we ever go to Manchuria to plunder? Did we move machinery from Manchuria? Did we do those things? Am I wrong?

Mr. Foreman—Are you willing to compare Russian looting with American murder? The American navy is killing Chinese people.

Ms. Utley—Please pay attention! Did you ever approve of lending arms to Russia? It is now not only using these arms against its own people, but also against our allies of yesterday!

Chairman Ray—Please wait a moment. Let us bring Dr. Kennard into the process here and let him answer a question addressed to him. Do you believe that the principles of open door and territorial integrity should still be the basis of future American foreign policy towards China?

Dr. Kennard—I most certainly believe that the open door is the policy we should pursue in China. However, I now see that we are forcing the Chinese to implement a government and an economic system of our choosing, which in fact results in closing the door. The 500 million people who could be American customers in times of peace and normal open door policies are today being forced to boycott American goods, and the past open door policy will no longer exist.

Mr. Colberg—Dr. Kennard, you should leave the business matters to me. That's my line of work. Your line of work is religion. May I suggest that we don't have to be too upset about the problem of 500 million customers. We will wait until the iron curtain replaces the open door, as the Communists have already done in North China and the Northeast, and then there will be no need to worry about customers anymore.

Mr. Foreman—Mr. Colberg, the difficulty is that today our merchants with pistols hidden on their bodies are bound to force the Chinese to do business with guns, and this kind of rogue behavior can easily cause riots, worldwide riots, and many innocent bystanders will be killed by atomic bombs in Kirkuk, Odessa, Coventry, and Marseille.

Ms. Utley—I have never seen such a reversal of right and wrong, using force to force people to buy things! The Chinese, whether rich or poor, are in desperate need of goods and trade after eight years of war against Japan, and the Communists are blocking trade by destroying railways. The problem is entirely that they cannot afford the American goods they desperately need.

Dr. Kennard—I simply cannot agree, Ms. Utley. We are keeping China in a state of chaos, because if peace is to be achieved in China today, the question is whether to allow the Chinese themselves to continue to maintain the only semblance of democracy in some Chinese villages and cities? The only issue in dispute between the Communists and the central government is whether some areas, such as those in which we Americans have elected county magistrates and local officials, will be allowed to continue to exist in a democratic form?

### Ms. Utley's Challenge: Clarify the True Path to Democratization

Ms. Utley—You call that democracy? In a place where only one party is allowed to exist, as in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists?—Only one party, one newspaper, one radio broadcast, only the Communist Party!

Dr. Kennard—Please forgive me, I know from all my investigations, and Mr. Foreman can testify.

Ms. Utley—I've been there too.

Dr. Kennard—In every place controlled by the Communist Party, I have always investigated this point again and again. I have also been to Shanghai…

Ms. Utley—I challenge you to name any newspaper or radio station other than the Communist Party's in the Communist area.

Dr. Kennard—The key is, when the majority of people in the whole village voted for a newspaper or a radio broadcast, can this newspaper and radio still be called Communist?

Ms. Utley—Please pay attention, Dr. Kennard. I have lived in Russia, I understand this.

Dr. Kennard—China is different from Russia. I don't know about Russia. But I know that in these areas of China (Communist areas), they have democracy.

Mr. Foreman—Here comes the red herring again!

Ms. Utley—This is not a red herring.

Chairman Ray—Are we going to talk about whether the problem in China is really communism?

Ms. Utley, here is a question for you to answer. If communism is the real problem, why does the central government ban the Democratic League or liberals, even those industrialists who oppose dictatorship?

Ms. Utley—First, I do not agree with this statement. The Democratic League is a small group of dissatisfied intellectuals who follow the Communist line. The much larger and more important political parties are independent, such as the Youth Party, which opposes the government in some places, but agrees with the government on the point of opposing the Communist Party. It is not true to say that the government has banned the Democratic League, etc. In the capital of China, half of the newspapers are against the government, and the other half are also against the government half the time. In the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists, you cannot find anyone who is allowed to say a word against the government!

Mr. Foreman—You're right, Ms. Utley, they don't need to ban those Communist liberals who disagree with Chiang Kai-shek—they just carry out assassinations. Read your newspaper!

Ms. Utley—Does this mean that the United States has no democracy, because some people "lynch" criminal black people?

Dr. Kennard—It's not a question of "lynching" a few black people.

Ms. Utley—That hasn't stopped the progress of American democracy. I'm not saying that China is already a democratic country. I am saying that China wants to become a democratic country under Chiang Kai-shek.

Dr. Kennard—China cannot become a democratic country under Chiang Kai-shek's faction, because those factions are the result of the combination of landlords, which will be automatically resolved.

Ms. Utley (interrupting)—Do you support resolving the landlords?

Dr. Kennard—I don't support resolving anyone.

Mr. Colberg—Dr. Kennard, I don't understand what you mean by trying to convince the audience here that any Communist area has democracy. A year ago, you might have been able to do it. Today, it's going to be hard work to convince the audience of that.

Chairman Ray—Here is a question related to this point, addressed to you. Why are all Chinese students in the United States only allowed to study science courses?

Mr. Colberg—That's not the case. I know many Chinese students who are studying literature and social sciences (various liberal arts). The wording of that question is wrong.

Ms. Utley—Too many are studying literature and social sciences. They need to study science to build the country. This is the only reasonable way. They have very little money, and they desperately need engineers and the like, and doctors, more than they need lawyers.

Dr. Kennard—They need all kinds of people. But you know perfectly well, Ms. Utley, that Chinese students must first be carefully examined before they come to the United States to see if they are in line with the way of thinking of Chen Lifu—and his faction. After they arrive, their courses are also closely monitored. There are hundreds of detectives scattered among the students on our Columbia Hill (the location of Columbia University).

Ms. Utley—You should go to a Communist country first, experience the real taste, Dr. Kennard, taste a little tyranny!

Mr. Foreman—I happen to have something on this issue. In front of me, there is an English translation of a Chinese Ministry of Education document regarding the management of students studying in the United States, Article 14…

Mr. Colberg (interrupting)—When was it?

Mr. Foreman—November 14, 1943. Article 14 states, "During their stay in the United States, students studying at their own expense should accept the guidance and control of the inspectorate of the embassy regarding their thoughts and actions."

Mr. Colberg—I would like to talk about these "reactionaries and fascists" in China. I know them. Among them are two famous generals, often mentioned by people on your side, General He Yingqin and General Zhao Lin (?). They are all my friends, and I have dealt with them.

Chairman Ray—I'm sorry, Mr. Colberg, time is up. If we can stop for a moment, let's summarize tonight's arguments. Mr. Foreman, can you summarize your side's views?

Mr. Foreman—Dr. Ray, I think the important thing for us is to decide what the current problem in China is. The "anti-Russian" people in the United States are putting in too much effort. I'm not explaining for the Russians, but I still insist that the red herring should not be dragged into the China picture. The question is, should we stay in China?

Yesterday, the "New York Times" had a telegram, and this morning, the "New York Times" had another telegram, saying that a New York Times reporter visited the American Navy stationed in China, and according to the answer, they themselves did not know what they were doing in China, and they wanted to leave China very much. I clipped it out, and the headline is "Navy is unaware of their work in China. Many are said to sympathize with the Communist Party." The article says: "The Navy has expressed its disappointment with the current Kuomintang government and its institutions, and most notably (this is important to me) that despite the fact that they are often attacked, insulted, kidnapped, and even have their lives endangered while carrying out their missions in China, most of the American Navy secretly sympathizes with the crisis faced by the Communist Party. (The Navy is certainly not Communist) They believe that the situation today could not be worse."

Chairman Ray—I'm sorry. Your time is up, Mr. Foreman. Ms. Utley, can you summarize your side's views?

Ms. Utley—I think the other side's arguments are mostly focused on whether the Chinese government is democratic. I have never said it is democratic, and I don't think it is democratic now, but I insist that this is the only government in China that can achieve democracy. If we only talk about how incompletely democratic it is, I think it is beyond the scope. No country that has experienced what China has experienced in recent years can be democratic immediately.

Mr. Foreman often talks about the red herring that we brought to the table. To summarize our point of view, I dare say that we believe the red herring is already there, big and stinking!

I would like to answer this navy question. Because a few months ago, I was still in the American military area in North China, and I returned across the Pacific by American military plane. My experience is completely different from that reporter's. Almost every naval officer and soldier I talked to said, "Do you think we should stay here? It's obvious that Russia wants to take on America."

They know it very well. They have only heard the Communist Party radio from Yan'an say that the difference between the two imperialisms, the U.S. and Japan, is that the U.S. is stronger and more civilized on the surface. The naval officers and soldiers, I know them, I was with them everywhere I traveled in North China for two months, they are absolutely resentful of what Russia is doing. They know the situation very well, that Russia is behind the Chinese Communist Party.

The main point, I think, has not been discussed sufficiently, and has not actually been talked about, is how will the situation change if the United States withdraws its support for its ally, the Chinese government? The other side often avoids this point, they neither explain it nor admit it. If it is to return China to the Chinese people, I absolutely agree with them. That would be the best thing. But according to our experience in Europe, this is to hand China over to Russia and its puppet, the "Chinese Communist Party!"

Chairman Ray—I'm sorry, our time is up. (Applause)

What you have heard is the American Air Forum, a debate on "What Should We Do About China." The speakers are Mr. Foreman, writer and explorer; Dr. Kennard, former missionary in China; Ms. Utley, a famous writer who has written many books about China (referring to "Japan's Feet of Clay," etc.—Editor's note); Mr. Colberg, member of the American Association for the Criticism of Chinese Policy. We welcome you to write to us if you wish. This is your reporter, Mr. Carl Bates.

Reporter—Thank you, Dr. Ray!

### Italian Fascism Returns - Giannini: A Second Mussolini?

— Translated by Zuo Xi from This Week magazine

In Italy today, there is a stout, red-haired former Fascist member who, with great ambition, is actively organizing his own political party, preparing to take on the Italian government. This man is the editor and commentator Giannini. He dresses neatly in short shirts and sportswear, wears a monocle, carries an automatic pistol at his waist, and walks with the swagger of a German army major.

Not long ago, Giannini met with a reporter from the United Press, blaming Roosevelt for the outbreak of World War II. Recently, rumors have circulated that someone intends to harm him. When another reporter asked for his thoughts on this, he patted the pistol at his side and said, "I have this fellow as my bodyguard!"

The insightful Italian political commentator Alfarro once told me, "Despite people's fears about the Soviet Union, communism will not immediately gain an advantage in Italy. The real crisis in Italy today is a new form of fascism." Recent events have proven his words to be true. A new fascist party is expanding and may soon seize power.

Decline of Communist Prestige

One night last April, four people broke into a cemetery near Milan, stole Mussolini's body, and left a letter stating, "The leader is with us again. Soon the leader lying in the coffin will parade on the streets of Italy..." The letter was signed "Democratic Fascist Party."

Now these grave robbers are in jail; but recently in Gorizia, crowds shouted "Leader!" and tried to disrupt an anti-fascist demonstration. This emerging fascist party is not operating underground but is active in public.

The Italian Communist Party was originally unaffected by setbacks. However, when Stalin supported Tito's demands for Trieste, which the Italians were unwilling to cede, he destroyed the pillar of the Italian Communist Party. As a result, the Communist Party's prestige declined, and in the election for the Republican Constituent Assembly, it received only 4,284,000 votes out of 28 million, less than 20 percent of the total. The Socialist Party received over 387,000 votes. But Giannini's new fascist party, the "Common Man's Front," surprisingly won 1,198,000 votes, 30 seats in the Constituent Assembly, only five votes less than Mussolini obtained in the last election before his march on Rome in 1922.

New fascist groups are spreading throughout Italy, with Giannini's party being the most powerful, mixed with many old Fascist members of Mussolini, totaling about two million people. Professor Peri, a guerrilla leader who served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945, criticized them as "not a political party, just a mob. They are a disorganized group of discontented people, likely to be agitators for another totalitarian regime."

Their starting point is Giannini's "Common Man" weekly newspaper. Published in Rome, it has an average circulation of 500,000 copies per issue, sometimes reaching 800,000, making it the best-selling newspaper in Italy. The newspaper is filled with defamatory and abusive language, maliciously attacking the government, the United Nations, and the Communist Party.

Life's Greatest Hatred: Democracy

Giannini, editor of the "Common Man" weekly, advocates organizing an "administrative" state directed by "common people" rather than "politicians." Giannini is an eloquent speaker. His gestures are lively and his tone is impassioned when he speaks. He hates democracy with a passion. He and his followers favor a strong leader who uses decisive means to govern the country.

At this moment, Giannini has not yet used iron-fisted policies, but most Italians have joined his party. This does not mean that Italians do not need democracy; on the contrary, most of them are working hard to achieve it, but Italy's new democratic government is divided and unable to solve various problems, causing them to become disillusioned with it. Under the threat of chaos and the approach of winter, the Italian people yearn for urgent relief.

The core of Italy's entire reconstruction problem lies in the food issue. To obtain food, Italy's industry must produce agricultural tools for domestic use and manufacture goods for export. To get factories running, coal is needed. However, Italy cannot even mine the 120,000 tons of coal it can produce each month because miners have to stop working and beg for food to feed their families. Italy's bread ration has been reduced by half, and Italians receive fewer calories per day than the people of any other country in Europe.

Italy: Past and Present

Once the new fascism raises its head, the history of the past will inevitably repeat itself today. Twenty-five years ago, Mussolini convened the first Fascist Party Congress in Rome. At that time, the nation was deeply resentful of unfavorable peace terms, and the Fascist Party seized this opportunity, calling for relief from unemployment and inflation, and recruited thousands of members. In less than a year, Mussolini's armed march moved towards Rome, and Mussolini leaped to become Prime Minister of Italy.

Dr. Curley, an American problem expert and aide to the late President Roosevelt, who lived in Italy for two months, recently said, "The general economic conditions that led to the rise of fascism still exist in Italy today. Just as after World War I, Italians today are denied the right to control Trieste and Fiume in the peace treaty. France has taken away small pieces of land in northern Italy. Italians feel that their declaration of war against Germany and their contribution to the victory of the United Nations should not be ignored.

Just as in 1921, Italy is currently experiencing inflation and widespread unemployment. The country has a population of only 45 million, but 2.2 million people are unemployed. Strikes and riots are increasing daily. Last autumn, thousands of unemployed people in Rome besieged the Viminale Palace, the seat of government. Afterwards, the police authorities found that the instigators of the riot were two Fascist members. The current government cannot prevent riots, just as in 1921.

A Second Mussolini?

Under all these circumstances, Giannini's "Common Man's Front" is likely to become the dominant political party in Italy. On October 28, the anniversary of the march on Rome, thousands of Fascist members carried black flags and handmade bombs.

Giannini gives me the impression of being almost entirely a second Mussolini. With the qualifications of a third-rate playwright, he was appointed editor of a film magazine in 1926, held a minor position in the propaganda department in 1930, and officially joined the Fascist Party in 1941.

A few months after the fall of Rome in 1944, Giannini first published the "Common Man" weekly as his mouthpiece. The first issue had a print run of 20,000 copies, which sold out on the same day and was reprinted three times. For a time, the whole country followed suit, and the government became very wary and prosecuted him on charges of being a Fascist, advising him to suspend his newspaper temporarily. At the same time, the British Parliament strongly condemned Giannini. But the Italian court acquitted him.

Giannini has the support of two wealthy brothers who hope to restore the monarchy because the monarchy supported Mussolini and made them rich. Giannini's "Common Man's Front" convened its first national congress and joined the monarchist party.

Italy's Only Hope

Italy's political parties are self-serving and disunited. If the parties do not unite early, Giannini may have a successful day.

Currently, Italy's only hope rests with the current Prime Minister Gasperi, a courageous anti-fascist who leads Italy's most powerful party, the Christian Democratic Party. Unfortunately, Gasperi represented Italy at the peace conference and failed to win favorable peace terms, missing the opportunity to restore Italy's prestige. He is now seeking a compromise with the style of a capable diplomat to maintain his precarious cabinet. However, the most important thing is to solve the problem of people's food and curb inflation. He believes that after the East is settled, Italy must obtain assistance from abroad to maintain factory production, otherwise fascism will inevitably return.

The Attitude of the United Nations

Why does the United Nations allow the new fascist party to grow in an Allied-occupied country? That is because the fascist party's discipline is usually lax, and it cannot be suppressed except for a few key figures. Moreover, the publication of the "Common Man" newspaper was permitted by a new cabinet control mechanism in Italy, and the Allied forces have given up their control over this mechanism.

So far, Giannini has not done anything that would warrant Allied intervention. However, if he does launch a coup, then according to the armistice treaty, British and American troops can immediately move out. Apart from this, the only way to prevent Italy from suffering again is to help its people rebuild a sound and prosperous country.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Opens - The German and Austrian Peace Treaties Have Begun!

— Chu Yukun

The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union opened in London on the 14th, presided over by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who personally extended a welcome to the Deputy Foreign Ministers of various countries, hoping that the situation that would allow Germany to make a comeback would not be created again in the future. Starting from the 15th, the draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria will be officially discussed, and an agenda will be prepared for the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held in Moscow on March 10. Therefore, this Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting is actually the prelude to the German and Austrian peace talks. Standing at the beginning of 1947, we have to express our earnest expectations for the first international conference this year. Because this meeting has a very important relationship to the development of the international situation in the future.

The German and Austrian Issues Will Be Dealt With Separately

Germany is the culprit of World War II, and the Allied countries should severely punish Germany, order it to compensate for the losses suffered by various countries, and at the same time pay special attention to the re-education of its people, so as to eliminate the anesthesia and residual poison of the Nazis received by the people, and make it also become a peace-loving country, no longer threatening the peace and security of Europe. As for Austria, she is the victim of Hitler's aggression, and the Allied countries should assume the obligation to help her independence. Not only must its independence be allowed in words and writing, but it should also be given economic assistance in practice to make it a stable force in Central Europe, a bridge between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, so the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' discussion of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria will take the method of discussing them every other day, so that they can be dealt with separately.

Britain Proposes a Plan for Austria

The German and Austrian issues are the most complicated issues in Europe today. The four major powers do not agree on this, that is, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Czech Republic and other countries have their own opinions, and before the opening of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting, they have successively issued memorandums, putting forward many requirements on political and economic terms, making the work of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting even more difficult. We predict that the German issue will not be easily resolved for a while, and it will not be possible to have a successful agreement until the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting. However, the opinions of the major powers on the Austrian issue are relatively close, and it is not difficult to establish a solution plan. The draft peace treaty proposed by the British representative is expected to be adopted in principle, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Restore the free and independent Austria; (2) All Allied troops stationed in Austria should withdraw and return home; (3) Freedom of navigation on the Danube River; (4) Allow Austria to join the United Nations organization as a member state; (5) Restore the boundaries of Austria in 1938; (6) Do not recognize the territorial demands on Austria put forward by South Czech Republic; (7) Do not demand reparations; (8) Freedom of religion, freedom of trade, and no discrimination. The French National Congress

The French Political Situation - Britain and France Conclude an Alliance

The French National Congress and the Senate held a joint meeting on the 16th to elect the President of the French Republic. The leader of the Socialist Party, O Lihe, was elected with an absolute majority of 452 votes; the Blum Cabinet, which had just returned from London, submitted its resignation to President O Lihe in accordance with the provisions of the French Constitution. O Lihe then appointed Lai Madiai, an important figure in the Socialist Party, as Prime Minister to discuss cabinet formation with all parties. The new cabinet was established with the joint support of various parties, and from then on, the French political system also came to an end of the provisional regime and embarked on the right track of democratic constitutionalism.

### The Arab World in Turmoil

— Cheng Cong

The Middle East is in a time of trouble. In the newspapers, we read about all kinds of turmoil, such as the Palestine bombing case, the riots in Cairo, and the demonstrations spreading in various Arab countries. The situation in the Middle East has a great impact on the world, and it can determine what kind of world we and the next generation will live in, because in these disturbances, the interests of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States directly clash. Millions of Arabs, in this era of rebirth, are in turmoil, and have not yet decided where to go: to the East, or to the West? To communism, or to democracy?

Arabs are undergoing drastic changes. In Damascus, there are girls wearing veils and studying in the inner chambers, while modern women next door are wearing the most fashionable Hollywood costumes, driving their own cars, and going to the city to participate in women's conferences to fight for women's suffrage.

The chiefs of the desert-dwelling river people wield the power of life and death over a people. When happy, they can burn their wives and concubines to death with fire, and sometimes after killing people like this, they take a plane to Cairo to pray to the teachers.

In a certain city in Syriac Arab City, the entire process of the Industrial Revolution is displayed. On the one hand, there are weavers weaving cloth with old-fashioned looms behind the kiln-style shops. The daily income is only worth five U.S. dollars. On the other hand, at the other end of the same area, there is a modern spinning mill with 1,200 workers and the latest machines, as well as self-service restaurants, showers, hospitals, and dormitory facilities.

Outside most cities in the Middle East, feudalism still exists. The entire village and town often belongs to a landlord. He and other chiefs unite. Many chiefs of the same level then pledge allegiance to the larger chiefs. But there are also some progressive places. Like in Iraq, where the feudal situation is the worst, the chiefs have 100,000 acres of limited good land. The Iraqi government does not have the power to confiscate these properties, so it implements a plan to divide the wasteland downstream of the Tigris into farms with an area of 85 acres per plot, and distribute them to people who are willing to cultivate them for free. After five years, this field will be his property.

What needs to be improved is the labor aspect. Arab workers still have no legal protection. Child labor is also not restricted by law. The excellent and famous Oriental carpets are woven by the tender hands of child laborers. They sit on the narrow planks in front of the loom, step on the loom with their feet, and work for more than ten hours a day, causing skeletal malformation. The factory owner treats the factory as a school, and education is compulsory. One and a half hours a day is spent reading, writing and arithmetic, and nine and a half hours is spent weaving carpets.

Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, almost all Arabs in Palestine were illiterate. Now 120,000 people are enrolled in school. There is a university in Jerusalem. In the past 25 years, Egypt has established two national universities.

Oppose Judaism - Distrust the British Empire

The Arabs do not trust British imperialism. In the past, the entire Arab economy was controlled by the British, and foreign trade was mostly limited to British goods. Although they themselves admit that once the British forces withdraw, the impact will not be beneficial, they always want to obtain the opportunity for self-determination.

They have even deeper resentment towards France. In the process of entrusting the rule of Le Pono and Syria, France used force to deal with the Arabs and even bombed Damascus in 1945. All kinds of measures have long made France's connection with the Middle East desperate.

The Arab world is extremely opposed to Judaism. The Palestine issue is difficult to resolve peacefully. Various Arab countries are very united. After the riots in Cairo, there were demonstrations everywhere. France's actions in Damascus stimulated the entire Arab world to erupt. Judaism has further united the Arabs.

Where are the Arabs going? Turning to the Soviet Union? The Soviet Union is indeed paying very close attention to the Arab states. In every city, the scale of the Soviet embassy is larger than that of the British and American embassies, although its commercial relations are smaller than those of Britain and the United States. Every Soviet embassy is the Soviet Union's propaganda center. Recently, the Kremlin seems to be very concerned about the Muslims in the Soviet Union, and is doing everything possible to link them with the Arab Muslims. Many Soviet people have also participated in the Islamic University in Cairo.

Eastern culture originated in Arabia. When the followers of Muhammad united the peoples of the southeastern Mediterranean to form a single religious empire 1,200 years ago, Arab culture reached its peak, but later it was conquered by foreign peoples. In the four hundred years of Turkish rule, progress was halted. The period when Western culture flowed into Arabia was still stagnant.

World War I gave Arabia the opportunity to resist Turkey. They fought side by side with the Allied Powers, believing that they could gain freedom. However, after the war, the Allied Powers Conference entrusted Palestine, Outer Jordan, and Iraq to British rule, and Syria and Lebanon to French rule. Egypt became a British protectorate.

The Arabs have opposed this rule. The result of the negotiations was that they gained little and did not achieve true independence. After World War II, Britain and France still wanted to stay there. The Arabs expressed that they were not welcome. Now the British and French forces are withdrawing, leaving part of the gap.

During the war, the United States provided them with material assistance. Now only commercial airlines and educational undertakings remain. (Translated from Reader's Digest)

Spring and Autumn

### The Style of Women

— Jiang Xingyu

More than 2,000 years ago, King Fuchai of Wu and King He　of Wu left behind many beautiful stories in the city of Suzhou. One of the famous women in Chinese history, Xi Shi, spent her youth here; more than 2,000 years later, the city is densely covered with river ports, ponds and ancient wells, overgrown with jasmine, roses and violets, and everywhere is clear water and lush flowers. Water and flowers symbolize the temperament of the men and women who grow here.

Jiang Yan is a typical Suzhou woman. Her work "Microwave Words" is a manifestation of a skillful and feminine style. Her narrow circle of life reminds us of caged finches and goldfish in glass tanks.

From the point of view of the language of poetry, or from the point of view of the form of poetry, Jiang Yan is still stuck in the stage of the May Fourth era. She has been too influenced by old poems and cannot get rid of the constraints of those outdated words, and even wrote such empty and obscure sentences as "Like the ancient flying dragon galloping, I laughed at the swiftness of the falcon in high autumn" (Ode to the Air Force). In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, her language and style have a kind of liberation that can more freely express her emotions and vividly describe her materials, but the liberation has a limit, just like people who bind their feet cannot fully restore the natural beauty after removing the foot-binding cloth.

The real world is so vast, and the real society is so rich, Jiang Yan only lives in an environment beautified by her own imagination, so she writes:

Bottled flowers linger with a gentle fragrance,

The soft quilt is also all gentle.

A slight illness has a leisurely taste.

The whispers beside the embroidered pillow are low,

Some warmth, some pitying eyes,

Today you have more gentleness,

Your voice is lower and lower

I can't hear clearly, what, a kiss?

Darling, you can, but be gentle,

"A slight illness has a leisurely taste" can best summarize Jiang Yan's ideology, fully showing her aesthetic and hedonistic tendencies. In ancient times, Xi Shi was appreciated because of her morbidity, but today, Chinese intellectual women have progressed to taking disease as their own enjoyment!

A poet must have a philosophical foundation in his thoughts to achieve the fullness of content, to enter the realm of art, and to deeply understand the true meaning of life. And she only has the tender love of young children, and this kind of love does not allow her to have the opportunity to calmly observe the real world and the real society when she is engaged in poetry creation.

The tenderness of women may be determined by physiological conditions, and the atmosphere of tenderness in the works of female poets may be unavoidable, and even unnecessary, but too much tenderness is undoubtedly a serious morbidity for a woman, and it is even more a strong anesthetic for poetic art. In addition to giving satisfaction to readers with abnormal psychology, it has no meaning whatsoever.

Jiang Yan has described the Anti-Japanese War, although the description is so conceptualized and so alienated, it can actually be regarded as a kind of progress, and it is not entirely futile. After this kind of attempt, or rather test, she should know how far away she is from this scientific and mass era? And how incompatible is the skillful style with this arduous and magnificent national war!

Female writers and female poets often exude lofty motherhood in their works. Maternal love is a kind of purely giving love. When we read Bing Xin's "To Young Readers", it is as if our mother or sister is talking to us kindly. The tenderness that Jiang Yan expresses is only feminine. In the poem "Infant", she tries to express maternal love, which is not only forced, but also completely in the tone of an adult, without a trace of the natural outpouring of maternal love.

"Microwave Words" and its author are lonely, just like a potted flower, blooming lonely and falling lonely in a greenhouse, emitting fragrance lonely, only people who live in the greenhouse appreciate it.

From the Saturn Pen Club to the Chinese Poetry and Art Society, this group of them has always had a group of poets with aesthetic tendencies, and now, the organization itself is completely disintegrating, which makes people feel a sense of the past and the present. Sun Wangchang, Ren Xia, Zai Mingzhu, Lin Yongquan and Jiang Yan were the five most promising poets in the Chinese Poetry and Art Society. For the sake of readers and for the Chinese poetry movement, I hope they develop their own new bottom roads.

I heard that the bell in Hanshan Temple in Suzhou was stolen during the period when the enemy and puppets occupied the area. I think this is a symbol that Suzhou should end its past history and start a new page of life.

I hope that in Suzhou ten years from now, chimneys that are as dense as forests will stand on this flat field, and countless factories will be opened to build for China's industrialization, and the residents of Suzhou will no longer be intoxicated by the gentle and leisurely mood, but will walk out of the narrow circle of life and work hard to engage in production. I wish the poet Jiang Yan and her hometown well.

### Casual Chat on Couplets

— Zhan Weng

Although couplets are a minor art, there is much to appreciate in them. Yu Quyuan said: "Couplets are the most difficult. One must possess both boldness and elegance to create a masterpiece." He cited two couplets as examples. One, a couplet from the Five-Story Pagoda in Guangdong, reads: "For countless eons, this precarious tower has stood; I ask, who plucked stars from the Dipper, casting a disdainful gaze upon the past and present? Where are the ancient lords of five hundred years ago? Only I lean on the railing, gazing at swords, shedding tears for heroes!" The other, a couplet from the Guanyin Pavilion on Yuexiu Mountain, reads: "Manifesting the incarnation of the Great Being, I ask, in whom does the karmic connection to immortals and Buddhas reside? Lamenting the relics of King Yue, from ancient times, heroes have inspired much emotion." This was composed by Li Dihua of Siming, possessing both boldness and elegance. Quyuan's admiration was not accidental.

### Deserted Island

— Jiao Ben

For millennia, it has been utterly still and silent,

A deserted island, uninhabited...

Yet one year,

Green grass sprouted on the deserted island,

And within the green grass, a graceful girl appeared,

Like a tiny white cloud on that deserted island,

Joyful and innocent,

She lived her life there,

Without sorrow, like the green grass.

The sunlight brought her warmth every day,

The ocean waves brought her coolness every day,

Thus nurturing her passionate and serene character,

And lofty thoughts—slowly brewing and growing in her mind.

Yet one day,

A hurricane blew from across the sea,

Blowing in an old man—her father.

In one night, he recounted to her

The story of how he had left her on this deserted island.

With a sorrowful tone,

He spoke of how the past few years had gone by.

Like a stream in the dead of winter,

He babbled on about his life—he wept.

His daughter wept even more sorrowfully,

At this moment, the sky was very dark...

Then another hurricane,

Blew in a wealthy man,

Wearing a fur hat on his head,

Dressed in fur clothing,

And holding a leather whip in his hand,

The leather whip inlaid with a piece of shiny gold—

He gave the old man a knowing look,

And the old man handed the girl over to him,

As if exchanging an object.

The deserted island trembled in panic,

The sea churned madly...

### The Unemployed

— By Herbert Shaw, Translated by Yu Zhongxin

Three months of unemployment had made him crude and reckless; his cheeks were so gaunt as to be unbelievable, and everywhere he exuded an aura of weariness and exhaustion. He had barely touched a crumb of bread for nearly two days, and the food from those two days ago seemed to dazzle before his eyes, oh! How he missed food!

His right hand was thrust into his pocket, gripping his only possessions—two pennies—tightly, as if fearing he would lose them. Although he had racked his brains and exhausted his thoughts trying to shake off the thought, hunger would not forgive him, which made it somewhat unbearable, and he would occasionally utter a few complaints. As for his gaze, it often shot towards the shop windows, staring blankly at the various bright and alluring colors, which seemed to give him some solace!

The biting cold wind stabbed into his heart like a sharp blade, causing him to tremble involuntarily. Suddenly, sparks of anger burst forth in his heart, spreading through his veins. A secret desire directed him to cross the road and hide in front of a house, quietly watching his only hated enemy—the shop owner—loitering at the bus stop. As for his various sufferings—hunger, cold, unemployment, etc.—were they not all inflicted by this enemy, everything created by a cunning merchant?

Three years ago, the air of cannon fire filled the world, and the tide of recession flooded in all directions. His shop tottered precariously in this storm, and only through his efforts and struggle did he manage to weather the danger. However, his shop was already dilapidated; before long, unfortunately, misfortune descended upon him once more. It turned out that the cunning merchant, relying on his nimble skills, colluded with officials, using despicable means to forcibly buy up his shop, leaving him wandering the streets, setting up a small stall alone to make a living. But now, he no longer had the capital to continue setting up his stall…

In the crowd, he followed the merchant onto the bus, took out his last two pennies, and exchanged them for a ticket. He then casually chose a seat near the merchant, his eyes fixed on the merchant's leather bag, knowing that the bag was stuffed with money.

Before the bus reached its destination, he had already planned his scheme:—

He knew that after the merchant got off the bus, he would have to walk along a pebble path leading to his office. It was a secluded place, rarely patrolled by the police, and that would indeed be a good opportunity to strike—he planned to rob the bag. As for the miser's life, he could be spared.

—A series of smug smiles appeared on his face. He did not feel the baseness or cruelty of this means, only that it was the punishment the cunning one deserved.

A jumble of voices interrupted his thoughts:

"Nonsense, I clearly gave you a shilling, and the military notes and change are all in my wallet!" a fashionable woman said angrily to the ticket seller.

"Madam, you must be mistaken!" the ticket seller said coldly. "If you've already bought a ticket, then where is it?"

She rummaged through her wallet for a while, but still couldn't find the ticket, and had to admit her mistake, pay the fare again, and get off the bus.

Suddenly, he noticed a tiny gleam flickering beside his foot. He glanced at it greedily, then bent down. By the time he straightened his body again, he had a shilling clutched tightly in his palm. He looked around and let out a triumphant laugh, then looked out the window again, and a prominent advertisement reflected in his eyes, and he laughed happily as if everything was alright. The thoughts of robbery and revenge he had held only seconds ago had already been assimilated by joy.

The bus gradually slowed down, slowed down… until it stopped. He looked at the huge advertisement for the hotel across the street, stood up, and hurriedly ran off the bus, stepping onto the sidewalk.

A thick and enticing fragrance mingled in the noisy atmosphere, and he tremblingly pushed open the hotel door. Ah! How he missed food!

### Ice by the Yalu River, Third of Random Recollections from a Paper Window

— Ye Dingluo

The Yalu River can be said to be a river that divides China and Korea. Indeed, the water of the Yalu River is as green as the feathers on a duck's head. But in winter, this river is completely frozen. Andong is the hub of land and water transportation where it borders Korea. From the name Andong, one can imagine the glory of the ancient Tang dynasty conquering Goguryeo. Across the river from Andong is Sinuiju in Korea. The Japanese once built a railway bridge across this river. Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans walked across this bridge, differentiating themselves. Western suits, kimonos, gowns, and white jackets were the distinguishing features of the people of these countries here. From June onwards, the Yalu River is covered in snow. The river mouth is blocked by ice, and the ice on the river surface is very thick. Snow is added to the ice, and the snow freezes into ice. The ice blocks on the riverbank are jagged, and it is easy for people walking on the road to slip and fall. However, the people there often cross the river on the ice. Not only can people walk on the ice, but also large carts pulled by animals can pass over the ice, and even cars drive over it. It's a beautiful sight. On the snow-white ice surface, black figures come and go densely, like sesame seeds sprinkled on white flour. But the most beautiful sight is the Koreans. In winter, they also wear white outer garments, and their hair is wrapped in white cloth, each one resembling a filial son in mourning. Most of them carry things on their heads, walking on the ice. Even more beautiful are the Korean girls. They wear crimson tops, white skirts, short belts, and their hair is tied in a bun, giving them a special charm. If it is said that Korea is descended from Jizi, and their clothing has not undergone any changes, then this greatly is the demeanor of ancient women.

Watching the hurried pace of pedestrians coming and going in this snowy landscape evokes special feelings. But one must never assume that their habit of treading on ice is without danger. Often, ice blocks suddenly crack open, and people fall into the water. Sometimes you can see people climbing up from the ice, but sometimes, people disappear after going down.

Walking across the iron bridge from Andong is Sinuiju in Korea, and that is the local customs of Korea. Row upon row of not very tall houses with surrounding corridors are in the gaps of rows of evergreen trees. The construction of the houses is in the style of small pavilions, without the barrier of outside walls. At night, people sleep in such houses, and they can spend the night simply by closing the door. I really wonder if Korea is still a country where doors are not closed at night and no one picks up lost items?

Listen, clear and pleasing, round and like pearls, and the women are especially beautiful, slim and graceful, somewhat resembling Suzhou. On the Songhua River, there are dugout canoes. These are entire tree trunks, hollowed out to be used as a means of crossing the water. Therefore, the boat is especially long. Those who sit in the boat should be two in a row, two in a row, sitting inside in a double-row column, which is very orderly. At night, the dugout canoes are all docked on the riverbank. With a few friends, buy some wine and dishes, sit in the belly of this dugout canoe, as if riding a big fish, watching the moon rise from behind the South Mountain, gradually rising to the middle of the sky, shining on the river water, like a piece of blue glass, "moonlight reflects water, water reflects sky," in this situation, sing loudly the line "The general fixed Tianshan with three arrows, the brave man sang a long song to enter the Han pass," and then have a Jilin girlfriend, hey! You will feel that the three northeastern provinces are extremely beautiful!

### The Falling of Dongting, Fourth of Random Recollections from a Paper Window

— Previous Person

What is strange is that many Hunan friends do not talk much about the beauty of Dongting, but I, to this day, cannot forget Dongting Lake. It was more than twenty years ago, sitting on a steamboat, sailing to the northern mouth of Dongting Lake and dropping anchor. It was evening, and the sun hung in the western sky, more than ten feet above the lake surface, shining on the city walls of Yuezhou Mountain, like the face of a drunken old man. Commonly known as "eight hundred miles of Dongting," the water surface of Dongting Lake is indeed very wide. On the side opposite Yuezhou, there is no visible boundary, it is a line where the sky and water meet. The water is as yellow and turbid as the Yangtze River, and it has dangerous waves. Facing this lake, it is like floating on the sea. The setting sun shines on the lake surface, with ten thousand rays of golden light, sparkling and undulating, it is really magnificent. In the distance, you can see the southern mouth of the lake, with many green mountains floating on the water surface. Going in from there is the Xiang River, Changsha, Hengshan, which contain many famous cities and historical sites, and when the sunset over Dongting Lake gradually falls from the water, in the distance, standing tall in the heart of the lake, like a crouching lion, is Junshan Mountain, which gradually disappears into the darkness of dusk. It seems that there are many secrets hidden in that mountain, and a few fishing lights flicker on the lake surface.

Once, I took a boat from the side of Yueyang Tower to Junshan. The boatman rowed for almost a day, and as we approached Junshan, it was again the time when the setting sun was low on the lake surface. Climbing up from the slippery and messy rocks, it was another world inside. Junshan Academy, built on the mountainside, had long been dilapidated. Turning past the dilapidated Dragon King Temple, I found the tomb of the concubine of the Xiaoxiang River, and nearby were clumps of spotted bamboo. It is said that the bamboo has spots because the concubine once shed tears on it, and from this one can imagine the concubine's heartbreak, and why the bamboo is precious. Although this is just an old legend, I often imagine it to be true, and everything inside Junshan seems to be more meaningful. Here you can see rice fields, fishing boats, villages, reeds, and forests, as well as oxen and fishing nets, but not many people live here, and they live an exceptionally simple life. When hungry, you can't find a restaurant. You negotiate with the fishermen, give them some money, and ask them to cook some noodles, but it is just heating up the dried black noodles and adding a handful of salt. They actually have fish, but they want to keep it to sell in Yuezhou, and they will never take it out to entertain guests from afar. The surroundings of Junshan are endless reeds, being washed by the water and blown by the wind, swaying and swaying, showing the dangerous terrain here. In autumn, the boundless reed catkins sway in the autumn wind. Here it is solitary and desolate.

On Junshan Mountain, by the side of Dongting Lake, one often thinks of the stories of Qu Yuan, the ancient Shun, Ehuang, and Nüying, which can evoke more fantasies than thinking of these stories elsewhere.

### Fragments

Fireflies

Flickering fireflies with a faint blue luster, how many sentimental poets have written for you how many magnificent poems containing a rich melancholy.

Those who trek in the dark, groping on the dark road, the boundless dark current of night, flooding the mountains and fields, a blur. The road is gone, the road is swallowed by darkness. The trekkers cannot find the road they should be heading, they anxiously await a spark of light. But in this desolate and empty wilderness, where to find light!

So they think of fireflies, and they rely on that spark of faint light from the fireflies to complete a long, rugged and steep night road.

Waves

The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl thinking of her lover who is fighting the storm at sea.

The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl grieving for the bleakness of life at sea.

The waves are the tears shed by the boat girl witnessing her only boat being robbed by savage pirates and having no way to make a living.

Those surging and tumbling waves! Do you know how many miserable lives of the children of the sea, crawling under the whip of life, watching the sea all day long, have you once engulfed? They were born at sea, grew up at sea, gave their precious youth and those pearl-like golden days to the sea, lived with the sea, and breathed with the sea.

But their lives are sad.

Their lives, as sad as their lives, are destroyed in the overturning of the ruthless waves.

Sail

Living on a southern island gave me many beautiful memories; those sails floating on the sea, people accustomed to sea life, hoist a wandering sail and fight against the monstrous waves, they used their blood to write down many heroic battles and tragic sacrifices of those heroic and moving poems. People who grow up on the seashore, each of them admires the sails on the sea and the bright shining lighthouse. Often when they see the lighthouse shining on the dark sea, they will think of the story of the sail that lost its way on a clear night and was almost swallowed by the sea, and many people thank the lighthouse at sea. Therefore, the lighthouse is missed by sailors.

Seagulls

I miss those sails that fight the waves. But I miss even more the seagulls that fly around the sails, flapping their wings and splashing the waves. They soar on the sea all year round and sing on the sea, and they are brave in battle.

The storm is coming, and they still fly peacefully on the sea, a pair of strong wings stir up countless white foam waves, dancing a mysterious seabed dance, and I am lost.

From then on, I missed the seagulls.

Now it's been eight years, I haven't seen the sea, I don't know if the seagulls are still singing around the sails?

### Speaking of Pure White Snow in the Bitter Cold

— Chen Xiang

Goose Feather Snow Accompanies the God of Wealth

On the day of the legendary "God of Wealth Descending," goose feather-like snow fell incessantly. Is it pouring a bucket of cold water on the hopeful people? Or is "Heaven" scattering a shower of six-petaled flowers to bid farewell to the "God of Wealth"?

We are all familiar with the feelings that accompany wind and snow. The serenity, the low-hanging clouds that produce wind and snow make people melancholy; but as soon as snowflakes flutter and descend, excitement replaces melancholy. In our nerves, brain cells, and bodies, we react to this sudden change.

The shapes of snowflakes are so endlessly varied that it can be said that no one has ever seen two completely identical ones. In one snowstorm, an American scientist once estimated that one acre of land was covered with ten quadrillion snowflakes. Each one is a tiny crystalline flower. Some are so small that they are only one-hundredth of an inch long; even the largest ones do not exceed half an inch in diameter.

The countless snowflakes in a cluster of snow reflect nature's bottomless creative power. It is individual. But each snowflake is shaped by its past experiences. An expert peering through a microscope can discover the beginnings of a snowflake and the signs of its subsequent variations and strange events. Although many things about snowflakes and life remain a mystery, it is much clearer than the period when the Greeks called snowflakes "woolly water."

Every lead-colored winter cloud is a huge warehouse storing crystalline products, and behind it the work of making snowflakes is in progress. A snowflake is usually a tiny, frozen fragment of a winter cloud. The raw materials are the invisible steam and moisture in the atmosphere.

How is the Pure White Cotton Formed?

In the past, the basic rule of snowflake structure was that they were hexagonal, like the cells of a honeycomb. Former scholars believed that this rule had no exceptions. Now, we know that variations such as triangular snowflakes also occur frequently. But among the hundred thousand types of snowflakes recorded in films and pictures, they are indeed all miniature six-petaled flowers, and each corner is almost invariably sixty degrees.

Paradoxically, pure white snow is not truly white. At least, it is not white when it crystallizes in the air. Most of it is transparent, like glass. But when it falls to the ground in heaps, the crystals reflect light in all directions, creating a perception of pure white.

Many scholars and scientists are equally dedicated to studying the private lives of snowflakes, one of whom is Vincent Schaefer, a scientist at the General Electric Research Laboratory in New York State. In recent years, he has invented a method of preserving the delicate form of snowflakes, which is simple: let the snowflakes fall into a transparent plastic liquid that can quickly harden, turning the snowflakes that fall into it into fossils that do not change shape. These "fossilized snowflakes" can be filed into glass slides one by one for observation under a microscope or photography in one's spare time. They are permanently preserved, unaffected by changes in time or climate.

To collect snowflakes for his students, Schaefer once went to the summit of Mount Washington. On one occasion, he collected snow crystals in an Army bomber flying 200 miles per hour through a snowstorm 10,000 feet above the ground.

Snowflakes Symbolize Fleeting Moments

In art, the shape of snowflakes represents the briefest and most ephemeral quality, it is the ultimate representation of beautiful fragility. In all the snow-covered areas, among the countless crystalline armies of poetry falling from the winter clouds, only a relatively few thousand forms are preserved by pen or camera. The rest are lost forever, even unknown in human memory.

But in nature, this beautiful fragility does not cause sighs. Nature does not erect monuments. The snowflakes that fall and disappear in heaps from the lead-colored weather do not ask for or deserve our pity. You assume it is what it is. Aren't the feelings towards snowflakes completely different for those who appreciate the snow around the stove and those who shiver in single clothes?

### Tail

— Shu Shang

A large group of Soviet rats fled back from China. The Soviet hen asked them:

"Why did you flee back?"

The group of rats replied: "The Chinese like our tails very much, and we were almost all had our tails cut off!"

### The Sound of New Year Drums Echoes in the Tail, the Tight Drumbeats Shake the Ground

— Kang Shi

At the end of the year in China, the sound of New Year drums, "peng peng peng!" East also "peng peng peng"! West is also "peng peng peng" beating, it really feels very lively, full of "atmosphere of prosperity".

But the New Year has passed for several days, and the sound of the New Year drums is about to become an "echo in the tail"!

What replaces it is the "war drum" of the battlefield, which is being beaten so "tightly"! The tone of this kind of war drum is "Fight! Fight! Fight!" "Light! Light! Light!" "Fight until it's light! Fight until it's light! Fight! Fight! Light!"

The tones beaten out by the New Year drums and the war drums are obviously very different. One is "singing and dancing in prosperity," while the other is "the chaos of war"!

Of course, we like to listen to "the New Year drums of singing and dancing in prosperity," and we hate "the war drums of the chaos of war!"

### Beware of the "Pai Gow Scammer"

— Jian Hua

During the Lunar New Year, Shanghainese people, in addition to watching plays and dancing, whether in shops or homes, are all happily playing mahjong and pai gow. Fortunately, the shop assistants, workers, nannies, and others have their pockets filled with year-end bonuses and are enjoying themselves in time, and they don't care about winning or losing a few dollars. Therefore, the pai gow scammer seizes this opportunity to find a way to join the battle formation and make some extra money from you.

The other day, the newspaper reported that at the Tianhe Dyeing Shop on Zhenjiang Road, various employees were gambling on pai gow in the shop. A person named Wu Xuequn, accompanied by two unknown persons, went to participate. After about half an hour, a person named Sun Xindong had already lost more than 300,000 yuan in cash on the spot. One of the gamblers, named Fu Zhiliang, suddenly said that the people who came were suspicious and were probably pai gow scammers. Wu Xuequn and others were exposed and ran out the door, etc. Judging from this news, this kind of pai gow scammer must be a person of inferior ability, so he was exposed. Highly skilled pai gow scammers are only willing to show their skills on tables with hundreds and thousands of dollars, and they rely on these few days from New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival for their livelihood throughout the year.

What is a pai gow scammer? They have a pair of sharp, limited eyes and ten nimble fingers. A deck of thirty-two dragon tiles, most of which are made with bamboo backs, and on the bamboo backs are faint lines and bamboo veins. The bamboo veins of each tile are different. In the eyes of a pai gow scammer, as long as he flips through them two or three times, he can recognize each one, no different from a penetrating X-ray. His fingers also have great power. He is confident that he can flip two dice to make them turn over and determine how many points. Gamblers with this kind of exquisite skill are truly invincible. I advise those who are addicted to gambling to be careful and vigilant, and not to be scammed by the pai gow scammer again.

### The Story of Roosevelt

— Chunliang

Hitting a Wall

One of the most endearing stories about Roosevelt is about a visitor to the White House who criticized Roosevelt, saying, "Mr. President, how were you able to attain such excellent patience in this world—you encounter so many troubles and disputes every day?"

Roosevelt answered sharply, "If you spend two years learning how to hit a wall, hitting it until your toes are swollen and aching, then you will gain patience."

Age

On the last day of the Yalta Conference, there was a break for everyone to socialize. Douglas, Cornell, came to chat with Roosevelt and asked, "Mr. President, how old are you now?"

Roosevelt replied, "According to the calendar, I am sixty-two years old, but when it comes to doing work, I am thirty-five years old."

Everyone is Right

A story tells of two disputing people who received the same answer when reporting to the President. At one point, a senator presented his reasons to Roosevelt, and Roosevelt said to him, "Yes, you are right!"

Later, another senator came and presented the reasons for the opposite argument, and Roosevelt said to him, "Yes, you are right!"

Mrs. Roosevelt, who had been standing nearby, later said, "But you can't possibly agree with two completely opposite reasons!"

President Roosevelt reportedly replied to her like this: "Yes, you are right!"

### Not a Joke

— Shuxiang

When a thief was about to be executed, the policeman, holding a gun, said to him, "I have no choice but to make a living killing people, so don't resent me after you die." The thief said, "I am also dying to make a living, why would I resent you?"

After the Subei region was purged, the people returned to their hometowns. A child saw a portrait of ××× on the wall and asked his father, "Who is this person?" "This is ×××." "What did this person do?" "This person was liberating us, liberating our chains." "What are chains?" the son asked strangely again. "Chains are your mother's gold chain and my silver watch chain."

A new recruit on the front line had his hand blown off by a shell and shouted, "How could this happen, my life is over!" A comrade beside him said, "That's a small matter, look at Wang Desheng, his head was blown off and he didn't make a sound."

In the pavilion in front of Feilai Peak at Lingyin Temple in West Lake, there is a couplet that reads: "When did the spring become cold, from where did the peak fly?" Someone added a line below: "Instruct the Hangzhou Municipal Government to investigate and report."

### "Air-Belt"

— Yuqiang

Waterproof · Heatproof · Coldproof · The Contribution of War

Since the end of the war, there has been a new secret weapon that newspapers have never mentioned a single word about, and even six months after Japan's surrender, only a few scientists know about it.

This mysterious thing is neither radar nor an atomic engine. It is a piece of fabric! A new type of fabric with strange and exciting properties, called "Air-Belt."

A coat made of Air-Belt can prevent cold, heat, and water.

Liquid "Air-Belt glue" can be sprayed onto the interior surfaces of your car (including the glass), making it suitable for the hottest summer climates or the bitterest winter cold. There is no danger of suffocation because Air-Belt can "breathe," in other words, it allows air to enter and exit its surface.

The Best Material for Sportswear

The Air-Belt industry is already solving the clothing problems of athletes everywhere. If you wear tropical material plus Air-Belt apparel while hunting in the tropics, you won't get too hot. Conversely, if you wear a fitted Air-Belt sweater in cold regions, it will protect you from the cold and frost.

Trout fishermen know that rubber boots are not entirely satisfactory. Adding Air-Belt can create a pair of warm, waterproof boots that will keep your feet sweating even if you are standing in water two feet deep.

If, while boating, you accidentally fall into the water, and the water depth exceeds your height, you don't need to swim frantically. Air-Belt material has complete buoyancy and can save your life.

In addition to the above advantages, Rebeck said in "Motor News": "Air-Belt can be sewn into any thickness, style, or color of clothing. The possibilities for this new material to protect humans against climate and humidity are limitless."

Two professors at the University of Michigan, Dr. Newburgh and Dr. Bartell, are the great contributors to the creation of this new magical fabric. When Newburgh was a researcher at the "National Institute" during the war, he saw an urgent need for simple clothing that could protect our pilots at changing altitudes or when forced to land in water.

No known material was satisfactory. Wool has excellent warmth retention, but it cannot resist moisture. Rubber is waterproof, but very scarce and has very little cold-proofing effect.

Newburgh and Bartell worked long hours in laboratories labeled "secret," with the assistance of military and civilian researchers, and finally invented Air-Belt in September 1944.

Unfulfilled Ambitions, the War Ends

A transport plane took off hastily, carrying the first batch of cargo to Okinawa. There, the soldiers enthusiastically received this defensive, strange new material. However, before Air-Belt could be delivered to all the battle lines, the war ended.

Today, high-powered machinery is mass-producing Air-Belt, supplying it to the armed forces in peacetime America, as well as unexpectedly meeting civilian needs.

According to experts, this new fabric will be used as a lining for two commonly used materials (such as cotton, rayon, or silk), so that a garment can resist the attacks of climate and humidity.

The details of manufacturing Air-Belt are still a secret. However, we already know that the basic raw material is a common chemical called "silicon latex." At the same time, it has also been revealed that at a certain stage in the manufacture of Air-Belt, it is combined with a down-like substance to make a surprisingly good filling for life belts, because its buoyancy is greater than that of cork or kapok (the floss from the seeds of the kapok tree).

"If this material had been ready before the Allied invasion of Europe," Baker said, "eight thousand soldiers would not have ended up in the hospital; leather combined with Air-Belt could have protected feet on the battlefield."

Civilians have already inherited the enjoyment of this secret weapon made for the armed forces. This will grant humanity greater health and happiness. (Translated from the February issue of Reader's Digest)

### Ode to Gold Bars (Yu Meiren)

— Sui

True gold bars are not afraid of fire,

Gold is refined from fire.

The moon is dark and the wind is high, red everywhere,

Water without gold is useless!

The five elements restrain and generate each other,

Transactions depend on public success.

What is more important than protecting your family and saving your life?

Stock up on gold bars so you don't cry to heaven in a crisis!
