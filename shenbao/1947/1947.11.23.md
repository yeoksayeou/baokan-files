### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Votes for a Member of a Rival Party; The Democratic Socialist Party Expresses its Respect
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] A spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party recently commented on Madame Chiang Kai-shek's vote for Wang Yongde of the Democratic Socialist Party as a National Assembly representative, saying: "Our party deeply admires Madame Chiang Kai-shek's actions. This non-partisan approach of Madame Chiang Kai-shek truly demonstrates the good spirit of cooperation between friendly parties. We sincerely hope that the three parties can continue to strive in this spirit to promote constitutional government and jointly seek national prosperity."

List of Legislative Yuan Candidates; Party Portion in Stalemate
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is still in a stalemate. The Kuomintang originally planned to allocate one-sixth of the total number of seats to the two parties, but it is said that this has now been increased to about one-fifth, with each party receiving more than thirty seats. The two parties may consider this, but the difficulty lies in the Democratic Socialist Party's insistence on being equal to the Youth Party, while the Youth Party insists on having more seats than the Democratic Socialist Party.

[Another Dispatch] A proposal that incumbent Legislative Yuan members and political councilors be automatically listed as Legislative Yuan candidates was discussed at the Central Executive Committee meeting on the 22nd. However, it was unanimously believed that there were too many practical difficulties, and a resolution was made to retain the original plan.

[Another Dispatch] The Youth Party previously submitted a list of candidates for the Control Yuan election, which was returned by the Kuomintang on the 21st. According to a key Kuomintang figure speaking to reporters, this was because Control Yuan members are elected indirectly, and the party nomination method cannot be used.

A Traitor, Xi Shuji, Discovered Among Legislative Yuan Candidates in Nanking; Capital High Court Has Initiated Prosecution
[Central News Agency, Nanking, 22nd] After the list of Legislative Yuan candidates for Nanking was announced, the Capital High Court discovered that Xi Shuji, a regional candidate, had previously held a puppet post. On September 19th of this year, the High Court sentenced him to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights for the crime of colluding with the enemy to plot resistance against the country. However, the sentence has not yet been carried out because he is in the process of applying for a retrial. The High Court has now submitted a request to the relevant authorities for their opinion. According to judicial circles, according to the regulations on restrictions on candidates and appointments for personnel who served in puppet organizations or their affiliated institutions and groups, promulgated by the Executive and Examination Yuan on August 9, 1946, Xi Shuji is not qualified to be a candidate. The law also stipulates that "those who knowingly recommend or employ personnel who should be restricted according to these regulations shall be disciplined according to law," so this matter is worthy of attention.

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan election office for the third district of Jiangsu Province reviewed all registered candidates and announced on the 22nd that four people in the district are qualified to participate in the free election: Lu Jingmin from Kunshan, Xi Mengqi from Chuansha, Yan Hanwen from Nanhui, and Yan Xinqi from Wuxian.

Salaries for Civil and Military Officials; To Be Paid According to Index Starting Next Year
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] The committee for adjusting the salaries of civil and military personnel recently held a meeting presided over by Director Xu of the Budget Bureau. The meeting decided to base salaries on an index using 30 yuan as the base, starting from January next year. There was a proposal during the discussion to use 50 yuan as the base and abolish in-kind distribution, but it was not passed. A decision has not been made on the proportion of payments above 30 yuan. It is hoped that this will be discussed at next week's meeting. Regarding regional divisions, some advocate using the current regional divisions, while others advocate separate calculations for provinces and cities. For example, Nanking and Shanghai would be one region, Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, would be one region, Chengdu would be one region, and Chongqing would be one region. However, no final conclusion was reached on this point. Regarding the salaries of military personnel, most believe that civil and military salaries should be unified, but there is no need to divide military personnel into regions.

Executive Yuan Allocates 3 Billion Yuan to Relieve Refugees in Yantai and Weihai
[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 22nd] The Executive Yuan recently allocated 3 billion yuan in relief funds to urgently aid refugees in Yantai and Weihai. Wang Qianchuan has been dispatched by the Ministry of Social Affairs to oversee the distribution. Mr. Wang has now arrived in Qingdao and will soon go to distribute the funds with Yang Lianying, the director of the Shandong Social Affairs Department.

Additional Mixed Train Added on the Xuzhou-Yanzhou Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway
[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 22nd] The Xuzhou-Yanzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration has added a mixed train at 11:20 a.m. daily, in addition to the regularly scheduled train departing at 7:50 a.m. every morning, to facilitate the transportation of passengers and goods to and from the north and south. In addition, a mixed train still departs between Yanzhou and Tai'an at 2:30 p.m. every day. The unfinished work between Tai'an and Jinan is less than 20 kilometers and is expected to be completed and open to traffic as scheduled by the end of the month.

Government Values Creditworthiness; Principal and Interest on Domestic and Foreign Debt are Repaid on Schedule
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] According to the Ministry of Finance, the government has always valued creditworthiness and repaid the principal and interest on various domestic and foreign debts on schedule. Regarding foreign debt, with the exception of some pre-war foreign debt that needs to be cleared up and has not yet resumed repayment, all wartime and post-war foreign debt has been repaid on schedule in accordance with regulations. As of the end of June this year, a total of more than 651.3 million US dollars (including pre-war debt that has already been repaid) has been repaid in principal and interest on various foreign debts. Domestic debt is divided into four types: national currency, customs gold units, US dollars, and British pounds. As of the end of October this year, the total amount of principal and interest repaid on domestic debt was more than 4.1918 billion yuan in national currency, more than 32.3 million yuan in customs gold units, more than 73.4 million US dollars, and more than 6.009 million British pounds.

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] It is said that the principal and interest already repaid on domestic debt accounts for about one-quarter of the total, while the principal and interest already repaid on foreign debt accounts for about one-half of the total. In terms of foreign debt, pre-war foreign debt is less than wartime and post-war foreign debt. Most of the foreign debt recently repaid is repaid with barter.

No American Airmen Missing During Wartime Are Stranded in the Lolo Region; General Lucas Announces Investigation Results
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] General Lucas, the head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, held a press conference at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd in the group's conference room. His spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Ballriet, stated that this news release would be more detailed than what Washington would release and hoped that reporters would ask questions within the scope of the report. General Lucas then stated that the speculation in the newspapers in recent days about the facts he was about to announce was purely fictitious. These facts had little to do with China and were the result of an investigation into whether American soldiers who went missing in western China were still enslaved and living in the Yi region. He stated: "After a long and arduous investigation, it has been proven that none of the American airmen who went missing during World War II were enslaved by the Lolo tribes in western China. Similar reports during and after the war were all rumors." (Continued on page 2, column 4)

Wang Maogong Returns to Zhenjiang from Xuzhou; Funding for Xuzhou's Defense Works is Secured
[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 22nd] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, who had just returned from Xuzhou yesterday after negotiating matters related to the suppression of bandits, received reporters from the provincial capital and other places on the 22nd. He then met with this newspaper's reporter alone, saying: Xuzhou is the gateway to Jiangsu and the northern gate to the capital, related to the safety of 30 million people in 36 counties in northern Jiangsu and neighboring counties in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Commander-in-Chief Gu and I have decided to strengthen Xuzhou's defenses in order to protect the safety of 30 million people and consolidate the capital's defenses. The entire defense line is 140 miles long and requires 30 billion yuan. We plan to request 10 billion yuan from the central government and raise 20 billion yuan from all sectors of Xuzhou. After my negotiations with all sectors in Xuzhou, 14.5 billion yuan has already been secured, so the funding for the entire project is generally not a problem. I hope that the people of the entire province, especially the people of Jiangnan, will emulate this spirit of willingly donating and demonstrating the spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance, and contribute everything to build fortifications on the Yangtze River, Lake Taihu, and the cities of various counties to defend our homeland.

Exchange Rate Between Taiwan Currency and Legal Tender Changed to 1:79
[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The Bank of Taiwan announced that, starting on the 22nd, the exchange rate between Taiwan currency and legal tender will be changed from 1:76 to 1:79.

Weekly Forum: The Trend of Joint Efforts by National Medical and Pharmaceutical Professionals During the Implementation of the Constitution by Hu Dingan
The implementation of constitutional government is just around the corner! We are delighted with the implementation of the fundamental law of the country, and we pray for the country's rejuvenation, social stability, and the prosperity of all industries, so as to thoroughly realize the new China of the Three Principles of the People. Medical and pharmaceutical professionals, standing at the forefront of scientific work, will undoubtedly be a pillar of the national construction project. Their past glorious contributions need not be mentioned again, but on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, what should our future direction be? I believe:

First, we must strive to increase funding for medical and pharmaceutical education. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." The advancement of medical technology, the improvement of national health, and the fruits of eugenics and strengthening the race are to be harvested from medical and pharmaceutical education. And the development of medical and pharmaceutical education, in addition to teachers, first requires financial resources, and second, still requires financial resources. At this stage, general education is in a state of anemia, and medical and pharmaceutical education is even more so. This is because medical and pharmaceutical education emphasizes experimentation and the development of research, and its costs are completely different from those of liberal arts subjects. All of us in the field, for the sake of our country's medical and pharmaceutical academics in the future, want to reach the world's first class, and we must strive to increase funding for medical and pharmaceutical education significantly. Therefore, in the future, in the 15% of the national budget allocated to education, we should strive for a considerable amount for medical and pharmaceutical education, so that quality and quantity are equally emphasized, and the promotion of medical education is strengthened.

Second, we must promote the strict revision of the Medical Practitioners Law. Since the promulgation of the Medical Practitioners Law on September 26, 1943, all of us in the field have lamented that it is even more ambiguous than the separate regulations for traditional Chinese medicine in the past. Obviously, academics have no borders, and medicine is the product of all mankind. Moreover, scientific medicine (doctors and dentists) has gone through four to six years or more (four years for specialized studies, six years for university), and there is no reason to be able to claim to be a doctor without instruction from a teacher, without standards, or arbitrarily. In this atomic age, how should we, as scientific workers and medical colleagues, consistently urge the government to pay attention to strictly revising the Medical Practitioners Law, so that medical academics can be promoted and put on the right track, and consistently move towards the avenue of science. I have been entrusted by the National Medical Association Federation and the Jiangsu Provincial Medical Association to be responsible for the entire revision points and prepare to provide opinions.

Third, we must urge the government to establish medical associations and pay attention to business protection. Doctors are independent professionals, and their business is to protect human lives, which is equally important as lawyers' protection of human rights. They must constantly improve their skills and unite and cooperate in their duties. However, the government has promulgated association laws for agriculture, industry, commerce, fishing, and mining. The current Medical Association Law is not perfect, so the joint organizations of medical associations in various places often have inconsistent methods, and the connections are not satisfactory. For the sake of consolidating the cooperation of our colleagues, we should ask all colleagues to consistently urge the government to revise the Medical Association Law and the Pharmacists Association Law, so that the strength is concentrated, the will is strengthened, and the business protection and unwarranted lawsuits in the future can be facilitated and reduced. Furthermore, Article 24 of the current Medical Practitioners Law stipulates: "If a doctor has improper conduct in business or is mentally abnormal and unable to perform his duties, the health authority may order the revocation of his business license or give him a suspension of business." The so-called "improper conduct" is too broad in meaning, and the wording is too vague, and if the execution is slightly arbitrary, damage is unavoidable. For the sake of business protection, this clause must be urged to be revised. As for compensation for wrongful imprisonment, it should be required for doctors, but there is no clear provision in the Medical Practitioners Law, so it should also be promoted together.

Fourth, we must assist in the implementation of the public health system. Medicine belongs to all mankind. We have received the legacy of our predecessors, the cultivation of the country, and the influence of society. Medicine is about benevolence and art, and its purpose is to benefit people. The implementation of the public health system is originally intended to meet the needs of the country and society, so that medicine becomes a gift to the public, without allowing selfishness or self-interest, and is aimed at remedying the shortcomings of the past and the present. My colleagues should already have a deep understanding and recognition of the public health system. Therefore, for the sake of national construction, for the sake of national health, and for the sake of our generation and future generations, I have strived for it in the First National Congress, and there are clear provisions in the Constitution. Whether the public health system can be implemented in the future depends on the consistent promotion and assistance of my colleagues and medical personnel at all levels.

Fifth, we must promote the popularization and advancement of forensic medical services. Lawyers protect human rights, and doctors protect human lives. The combination of law and medicine for application is forensic medicine. Scientific verdicts require the forensic medical community to take on this mission. We want China to be modernized, and the popularization and advancement of forensic medical services, to eliminate the unscientific and non-standard abuses of the old-style coroners, is also something that all of us should advocate.

Sixth, we must promote rural medical and pharmaceutical facilities and strengthen farmers' health. "Culture to the countryside" and "science to the countryside," at this stage, have become beautiful slogans and moving terms due to various reasons. However, the importance of the vast number of farmers in the proportion of national construction has been generally recognized. However, recognition is just recognition, and the facts remain the same. The low level of culture, the bitterness of living conditions, the ignorance of health concepts, the lack of modern medical and health care, and the absurd and backward shamanic customs still exist among the vast population in the countryside, causing terrible disease rates and mortality rates. This is what we scientific doctors should consider a matter of great concern. In the future, when society is stable and the constitution is implemented, my colleagues should also not lag behind in promoting rural medical and pharmaceutical facilities and strengthening farmers' health care.

Seventh, we must enrich and advocate industrial hygiene. To modernize China is to industrialize China. We can say: "The foundation of the country lies in industry." Obviously, whether it is civil industry or national defense industry, none of them do not need to strive for development and enrich national strength. Industrial hygiene has many departments. In order to fully build the source of national manpower, we should promote industrial hygiene, eliminate occupational diseases, protect workers' health, strengthen work efficiency, enrich national strength, and enrich people's lives. This is what our medical community should strive for with all our strength.

The above seven points are just a few of the larger ones. (Such as participating in national defense and relief work are omitted.) Now, as the constitutional government is approaching, I would like to offer my humble opinions and ask for guidance from my colleagues across the country, and I hope that experts at home and abroad will teach me.

Second Day of National Assembly Delegate Elections

Suzhou [Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 22nd] On the second day of the National Assembly Delegate general election, the methods of candidate activity have already reached the stage of direct confrontation. The election advertisements in various newspapers are becoming more and more peculiar, and the amount of space they occupy can be said to be the most in the country. Female candidate Xu Xianmin even drove five large trucks around the city and suburbs, distributing colorful promotional materials. The various members of the county election office continued to inspect the polling stations. At various polling stations in the Wu West District, it was discovered that the district chief Liao Yanfu had illegally appointed election instructors in various townships and towns, and there were cases of illegal cover-ups of the election. Member Gu Baiyu arrested Du Zhongcheng, the instructor dispatched to the Fengqiao Township District, and sent him to the county government for legal action. At the same time, disputes also occurred in the Dongwu Town in the urban area. The staff of the town forced voter Jian Xiaozhong to elect a certain candidate, but they failed and tore his gown. Jian then filed a complaint with the local procuratorate, accusing Lu Zhicheng, the mayor of Dongwu Town, of violating electoral will and obstructing freedom.

[Another Dispatch] The voting work for the National Assembly Delegate general election by the Suzhou Journalists Association has been completed. There were a total of 604 votes. It is estimated that Zhao Junhao received more than 200 votes, Feng Youzhen received more than 300 votes, and Zhan Wenhong received more than 10 votes.

Wuxi [Our Correspondent in Wuxi, 22nd] The National Assembly Delegate election for reporters in this county was held at Duoshoulou in the park at 1:00 p.m. on the 22nd and ended at about 4:00 p.m. Newspaper publishers and news correspondents from the entire county came here to vote in an orderly manner. According to statistics, out of all the more than 600 ballots, Feng Youzhen received more than 300 votes, Zhao Junhao received more than 190 votes, Zhan Wenhong received about 40 votes, and Ma Xingye received 14 or 15 votes.

Changshu [Our Correspondent in Changshu, 22nd] In addition to the regional elections, the occupational and women's groups here held general elections as usual on the 22nd. Zhao Junhao, Feng Youzhen, and Zhan Wenhong received the most votes in the journalist category.

Zhenjiang [Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 22nd] On the second day of the general election, the enthusiasm of the people in the townships and towns for voting was even more enthusiastic. Zhao Dihua still received the most votes for regional representatives. Others who received the most votes were Lu Xiaobo from the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zhenxian and Wu Changyun from the Farmers' Association, Qi Yangxi from the Labor Union, and Zhao Junhao and Feng Youzhen from the journalist category.

Hangzhou [Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 22nd] In order to comply with the orders of the President, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters has taken strict sanctions against party members who violate party discipline and freely compete for National Assembly Delegates. According to reports from the Hangzhou and Shaoxing Party Headquarters, party members Zhu Chengde, Lou Zhaoyan, Wu Gangqian, Jin Lin, Tian Jingru, and Dong Huixian, without being approved by the Central Committee, freely competed for election. After repeated persuasion was ineffective, they requested instructions on how to deal with the situation. The provincial executive and supervisory committees have separately dealt with the cases. Zhu Chengde and Jin Lin did not listen to persuasion and openly advertised their campaigns in the newspapers, violating the President's order, and should be reported to the Central Committee for expulsion from the party and should first be suspended from party rights for six months. The other four people's circumstances were lighter and will be investigated further before a decision is made.

Zhengzhou [Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd] On the second day of the general election in Zhengzhou, except for a minor disturbance when Jing from Yongkang Town requested to exchange voting certificates with election rights certificates, the situation at other polling stations was good.

Beijing [Our Correspondent in Beiping, 22nd] Hu Shi cast his "pure vote" at Peking University at noon today, but did not announce who he voted for. After voting, he forgot to put on his felt hat and walked out. Because he wanted to maintain order, he did not go back, but asked someone else to send it to him. At 3:00 p.m., he went to visit various polling stations with Zhang Foquan and Wang Shugin, the leaders of "Civic Governance." Afterwards, Mr. Hu told reporters: "Generally speaking, it's not bad and can be considered satisfactory. The Municipal Education Association has received more than 40,000 votes, which shows that the understanding of people engaged in education is different from others. The local women's groups are so crowded that they can't get through, which also shows their high political interest. There were fewer voters in the national women's groups, and I saw a small dispute in Xishiku District, which also shows that people take the election seriously." Mr. Hu continued to praise the secrecy of the screens used in the Peking University polling station to separate it from the outside world, believing that this allowed voters to freely write down the people they truly wanted to elect.

Tianjin [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd] On the second day of the Tianjin general election vote, the weather was even colder than yesterday, with water dripping and freezing on the streets and a biting cold wind. However, the voters were even more enthusiastic than yesterday. The voters in the slums in the southern part of the old city in the urban area were even more enthusiastic. The crowds in front of the polling stations were overcrowded, but they entered the polling stations in an orderly manner.

Shenyang [Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 22nd] The enthusiasm for the National Assembly Delegate election in Shenyang City was not high. A "ticket scalper" was discovered at a polling station. The source of the "black ballots" is still under investigation. Various circles have many complaints about the municipal government.

Taiyuan [Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] The vocational groups in Bing held a vote on the 22nd to elect National Assembly Delegates. The municipal election office used three mobile vehicles with ballot boxes on them, which departed at 8:00 a.m. to the factories and east and west coal mines in the suburbs to collect votes from the workers.

Chongqing [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The Chongqing Municipal Women's Groups National Assembly Delegate election was held simultaneously in two districts of the suburbs at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd. Zheng Xiuqing of the Youth Party was nominated by the party as a candidate for the Chongqing Municipal Women's National Assembly Delegate. Wang Lubing (a member of the Kuomintang), the chairman of the Municipal Women's Association, in order to assist the candidates from friendly parties, gave up her own opportunity to run and called on the members of the association to do their best to help. Before voting this morning, Wang Lubing personally led tens of thousands of members to the Kai Xuan Road polling station and lined up. Wang Lubing first wrote the three characters Zheng Xiuqing and put them into the box. Most of the members then voted for Ms. Zheng.

Chengdu [Our Correspondent in Chengdu, 22nd] The 22nd was the second day of the Sichuan general election. The voters were even more enthusiastic. Chairman Deng and others personally went to the election site to inspect, and the order was good. The situation in Rong is becoming more and more clear. Sun Yu in Chengdu and Zhang Qun in Huayang have gained overwhelming advantages. Yesterday, only Xinjin in the entire Sichuan Province discovered bribery, and the rest were quiet.

Xining [Our Correspondent in Xining, 21st] The National Assembly Delegate elections for the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui people's professional groups in various counties and cities of Qinghai Province began on the 21st. The candidates enthusiastically launched election campaigns in various ways to win over voters. At 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, voters in Xining City enthusiastically went to various election districts to vote, and the order was good.

Ningxia [Central News Agency, Ningxia, 22nd] The general election entered its second day. Today was the voting day for the citizens (Xiang Min) with special living habits here. The number of voters was small, but the voting was very enthusiastic.

Taipei [Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The polling stations in Taipei were still extremely crowded on the 22nd. More than 1,500 railway workers rushed to vote from the Songshan Depot and nearby stations, making the polling station at Zhongshan Hall even more crowded. The elections were also held enthusiastically and in good order in various counties and cities throughout the province, such as Keelung, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan. Reporters constantly saw voters wearing new clothes to vote, respectfully and meticulously, which was very prudent.

Chiang Tingfu's Remarks in the Philippines

(Continued from page 1) He then discussed the issue of economic stability in various countries in the Far East, saying: "In terms of foreign exchange, only India and the Philippines are in a favorable position. In other respects, the economic situation in various countries cannot be analyzed in a few words. However, India's situation is even better than the Philippines. India suffered almost no losses during the war, while China and the Philippines suffered heavy losses." When meeting with foreign reporters in San Francisco, Mr. Chiang admitted that he had discussed the issue of the Soviet Union. He stated that the Far East Economic Commission meeting did not have a veto, and as for the issue of the Indonesian representatives attending the meeting (the Indonesian delegation, which has now arrived in Manila, is requesting to participate, but the Dutch authorities here are opposing it), Mr. Chiang said: "I am not aware that the Indonesian delegation has come to the Philippines." The news reported in the local newspapers that Mr. Chiang had finally decided to come to the Philippines to attend the meeting made Philippine government officials quite embarrassed, as it had already been decided that the Philippine Chief Representative Guaderno would act as chairman in Mr. Chiang's place. Chiang Tingfu said: "The fact is that the decision to come to the Philippines was made ten days ago, and this decision has been notified to Romulo, the Philippine representative to the United Nations. It is irrelevant who chairs the meeting. The main thing is whether this meeting can produce a feasible plan and have fruitful results."

Lucas Receives Reporters

(Continued from page 1) Lieutenant Colonel Fischer, the leader of the search team, reported on the progress of the investigation under the leadership of Colonel Kearney, the director of the American Military Fallen Soldiers' Cemetery. Major Smith, the leader of the search discovery team, reported on the process of his liaison with Chinese officials to conduct the final investigation. He expressed his gratitude to Jones, the captain of the 332nd Squadron of the U.S. Air Force Transportation Corps, and his subordinates for their enthusiastic assistance, and expressed his satisfaction with the kindness and hospitality of the French missionaries and Yi people. Finally, Captain McAlister, who had entered and exited the Yi area the most times, answered reporters' questions. Their work had been going on for years. They first used a C47 aircraft to conduct reconnaissance photography and select appropriate locations to land. Then, they established communication agencies, opened up external channels, and then conducted mobile visits and inquiries, which ultimately proved that no American soldiers were captured by the Lolo people as slaves. They also escorted 35 American airmen out of danger during the war. Foreign reporters were very interested in this report and asked about the customs of the Yi people. Chinese reporters (including four who came from Shanghai) were very disappointed.

Plan to Host Transit Troops

(Continued from page 1) Director Chen then reported on the plan to set up hospitality for transit troops throughout the country. It is planned to set up 16 reception centers in key cities across the country, and first set up seven places including Nanjing. It is hoped that the necessary accommodation, sanitation, libraries, entertainment, and other services for transit troops will be facilitated as much as possible. However, how to make the public enthusiastically participate together still needs to be discussed. After continuing to exchange opinions with each other at length, it was decided to first organize a transit troop reception committee and set up a general association in Nanjing. The Chinese Red Cross General Association, the Women's Guidance Committee, and other public organizations will launch local branches to assist in promoting the work of local reception centers. As for the detailed methods and the relationship with the慰勞總會, Guo Qian, Gu Zhenggang, Li Weiguo, Chen Yuguang, and Huang Renlin were appointed on the spot to organize a planning and drafting team to discuss the matter at the Lizhi Society at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd and submit a well-drafted proposal for a decision at the meeting.

UN Water Conservancy Expert Lin Jishi Returns to the Netherlands; Provides River Management Plan Before Departure
[Report from this newspaper] UN water conservancy expert Lin Jishi was previously hired as a consultant by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission of our Water Conservancy Department. Now, as the UN is about to end, Mr. Lin left China to return to his native Netherlands a few days ago. Before leaving China, Mr. Lin reported to the authorities, stating that the Yangtze River situation may become China's "second worry" besides the Yellow River floods, but if we think about its water power and geography, an urgent plan can prevent floods. He has submitted a detailed plan to the authorities for reference. He analyzed that the key points to pay attention to for flood prevention are four: (1) In terms of water power, evaporation, condensation, and diversion projects should be adopted; (2) In terms of meteorology, attention should be paid to the climate conditions of most of the land on the earth; (3) In terms of geology, attention should be paid to the structure of the rocks and the soil quality of the Yangtze River basin, and the scope should be as large as possible; (4) Soil erosion.

Fifth-Class Jingxing Medal Awarded to Those Who Contributed to the Successful Closing of the Yellow River Breach
Chief Engineer Todd to Return Home at the End of the Month
[Report from this newspaper] The government authorities awarded a third-class Jingxing Medal to Huo Doushu, the director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to commend him for his contribution to helping the Ministry of Water Conservancy complete the closure of the Yellow River breach at Huayuankou. In addition, fifth-class Jingxing Medals were awarded to Hua Fengxiang, the chairman of the Industrial and Mining Committee of the Administration; Sun Dehe, the vice chairman; Wang Fusheng, the director of the Distribution Department; and Huang Qiang and Chen Hongduo, the members of the Beijing Time Committee. Xue Baokang, the director of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau, and Liang Zuyin, the deputy director, were also awarded. The award ceremony was held at 9:15 a.m. yesterday at the weekly meeting of the heads and staff of various departments of the Administration, and was personally presided over by Director Huo.

[Another News] Chief Engineer Todd, who made the greatest contribution to the closure of the Yellow River breach, will return to the United States on the "Gordon" General on the 27th of this month because his mission has been successfully completed. Mr. Todd not only made a great contribution to the Yellow River breach closure project, but also made great achievements in China's water conservancy in general. He has been in China for 19 years and is an expert on Yellow River water conservancy.

Internal Instructions on the Issuance of National Identity Cards; Six Key Points
[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 22nd] The Ministry of Interior believes that the national identity card is an important tool for realizing the effectiveness of household registration and is related to the people's exercise of rights and the performance of duties. Since its implementation, most provinces, cities, and counties have actively promoted the production and issuance of national identity cards in accordance with the law, and the results have been significant. However, in some cases, the household registration has not been completed, which has hindered the production and issuance process, or the people are not intelligent enough to issue them universally, so the progress of this year's handling is uneven. Those who have completed the issuance have not been able to give full play to their effectiveness, and strict inspections to prevent abuses are urgently needed to be improved. Therefore, we specially sent letters to the provincial and municipal governments, providing six key points: (1) Areas that have completed the production and issuance should always pay attention to inspection and give full play to their use efficiency. Areas that have not been produced and issued and new political restored areas should complete the household registration or population census in accordance with the law. (2) Each province and city may formulate its own measures for the use and inspection of national identity cards in accordance with local conditions and report them to the interior for record. (3) The collection of material costs should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Interior Ministry's Household Letter No. 1193 of November 18, 1946. (4) If it is a provincial card style, it should be replaced in accordance with the central government's regulations. (5) In areas close to bandit areas, photos should be affixed and steel seals should be affixed. Other areas where photos are not affixed should also be gradually improved.

Sichuan River Transport [Our Correspondent in Shashi, 13th] Sichuan River transport usually refers to the section of the Yangtze River from Junqing to Yichang. The opening of the Sichuan River route was during the late Guangxu years. Due to the abundance of products in Sichuan Province and the strong purchasing power of rural areas, the import and export of materials along the Sichuan River are frequent, and shipping has increased daily. By the time of the Anti-Japanese War, it had become the only major domestic route. After the victory, it undertook the sacred task of repatriation, accelerating the completion of repatriation work. Sichuan River shipping is usually divided into two periods: the high-water season from May to October. During this period, the water level of the Yangtze River is high, and the transport volume of ships is also large. November to April of the following year is the dry season, with low water levels and a sharp reduction in transport volume. Considering the existing equipment of the shipping companies operating on the Sichuan River, the maximum transport volume during the flood season is about 30,000 tons per month, while the minimum transport volume during the dry season is only 2,000 to 3,000 tons per month. During the dry season, due to the varying depths of the Yangtze River, segmented transport is required. The segmentation standard is from Chongqing to Wanxian as one segment, and Wanxian to Yichang as another segment.

Flood Season
Generally, Sichuan River freighters can travel directly between Shanghai and Chongqing, which does not directly affect transport volume. Therefore, an overview of the transport situation during the dry season makes it easier to understand the real situation. During the dry season, the Minsheng Company has the most ships operating on the Sichuan River, totaling about ten. The China Merchants Bureau only has one ship, the "Jiangqing," suitable for navigating during the dry season. In addition, shipping companies such as Qianghua, Huatong, Hezhong, Yongxing, Xieyu, and Qinghua each have one or two ships. Statistically, the total number of ships suitable for navigating the Sichuan River during the dry season from the above companies is no more than twenty. The average transport volume per ship is about 100 tons. Assuming three round trips per month, the monthly transport volume shipped from Chongqing is no more than 6,000 tons. Currently, Sichuan River transport is still affected by the domestic military situation, and the allocation of shipping capacity must be pre-arranged by the shipping companies in Chongqing. The companies included in the allocation are Minsheng, China Merchants, and Qianghua. Ships from other companies are temporarily assigned based on the situation. The priority order for allocation is: 1. Military supplies, 2. Grain, 3. Sichuan salt, 4. Public goods, 5. Export goods, 6. Ordinary commercial goods. The allocation ratio is roughly 30% for item one, 30% for items two and three, and the remaining three items, due to the small quantity of item four, account for about 20% each for items five and six. The above allocation situation and ratios are not fixed and may be slightly adjusted depending on the changing military situation and the quantity of commercial goods supplied. Before the war, Chongqing was a city with import surplus. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, with the internal relocation of the industrial and commercial center, Chongqing enjoyed wartime prosperity and became a city with export surplus after the war, and the situation remains the same now. In addition to large-scale export goods such as tung oil, bristles, and medicinal materials shipped to the lower Yangtze River, other goods such as flour, homespun cloth, and cotton are also shipped in large quantities to county towns along the Sichuan River for sale. Ships returning from the lower Yangtze River often sail empty. Currently, the export volume of Sichuan River ships sailing downstream can be divided into the following three categories in descending order: 1. Military supplies, 2. Troops, 3. Tung oil. Other items such as bristles and medicinal materials account for a negligible amount.

The transport fee for general commercial goods downstream is 2.765 million yuan per ton. Currently, because there are very few ships sailing directly between Shanghai and Chongqing, most goods must be transferred in Yichang, which requires an additional transshipment fee of 100,000 yuan per ton. Also, because there are more goods than ships sailing downstream, but many empty cabins on ships sailing upstream, the downstream freight rate must be increased by 20% for return freight based on the original freight rate. The upstream freight rate has a subsidy phenomenon to attract commercial goods. At its peak, the commission reached more than 30% of the original freight rate. (Special Correspondent Hu Longchang)
### Underground Organization Cracked in Dongtai "Secretary Xue" and Others Provide Clues
[Our Correspondent in Dongtai, 15th] Secret personnel from the 9th District Team of the County Youth Work Team were ordered to operate in the Zhongxin Township area the day before yesterday. In the Xuejiashe area, they encountered a local cadre named Ding Cunshu, who was ordered by bandits to falsely sell cotton in the city to contact his underground organization. The secret personnel of the work team claimed to be of the same kind and established contact. Ding did not realize the situation and revealed the truth, saying that he would go to the Xieji Grain Store to contact "Secretary Xue" (pseudonym Geng Xudong) for important business, and the cotton was sold to exchange for newsprint and other materials. After learning the truth, the staff took Ding to the city to the team for detailed interrogation, and then supervised Ding to search for "Secretary Xue" in the city. They found Geng in the Fuxing Flower Shop in the county. After Ding's clear identification, they arrested him and sent him to the county government for interrogation. Geng provided many clues, and dozens of people have been arrested and are being strictly interrogated by the county government.
### Fierce Battle Leaves Three Dead and Six Injured Refugees Seize Guns in Haining Youshu Town, Leading to Fatal Incident
[Our Correspondent in Haining, 21st] A bloody incident occurred in Youshu Town in this county yesterday, in which refugees passing through seized police officers' firearms, resulting in three deaths and six injuries. The six injured refugees were treated at the Youshu Town Health Center today. The local procuratorate also scheduled an autopsy today. According to reporters, the truth is as follows: At about 3:00 p.m. on the 19th, an old woman reported to the Youshu Town Government that she could not stand the disturbance caused by more than 200 Anhui refugees coming from Qingyun Town. For safety reasons, the town government sent self-defense forces to be on alert. At about 4:00 p.m., the refugees arrived in the town and sent representatives to request relief of one stone of rice and some national currency. The town government agreed to the request but urged the refugees to leave quickly. However, they insisted on staying overnight south of the Nan Da Bridge in the town. The town government had no choice but to send telegrams to the police stations in Chengxiang, Guodian, and Xiejiao and the self-defense forces to send personnel to coordinate defense north of the bridge, and sent four sentries to guard the bridge. Fortunately, no incident occurred that night. Unexpectedly, at dawn, the sentries changed shifts and the defense was slightly lax. Suddenly, many refugees rushed towards the north of the bridge. The sentries retreated from the bridge, but the refugees had already crowded in, twisted the sentries and tried to seize their firearms. They failed to seize the guns, but they seized the bayonets and prepared to commit violence. Just as the relieving sentries arrived, they saw the situation was not good, and fired a warning shot. However, the refugees did not retreat, and the trapped sentries broke free, raised their guns, and fired at the refugees. The leading refugee was killed on the spot. The refugees were still fierce. After a fierce battle, the refugees realized they could not win and retreated south of the bridge. As a result, three refugees were killed and six were injured. No police officers were injured.

At the time of the incident, the residents of Haining were panicked. It was during market hours, and shops closed one after another, as if it were wartime. After the incident, the town government immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Ling for instructions. County Magistrate Ling sent Secretary Yu Xianglin to investigate the truth of the incident together with personnel from the local procuratorate. More than 200 refugees were escorted out of the county by police and military forces and headed north along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. The county government is handling the aftermath of the dead and injured refugees.
### Luoyang Becomes a City of Refugees
[Our Correspondent in Luoyang, 15th] Recently, Linru, Dengfeng, Yifeng, Jiaxian, Yicheng, Nanzhao, Lushan, Fangcheng, and other counties have fallen into the hands of bandits one after another. Luoyang has added tens of thousands of refugees out of thin air, plus the wanderers from northern and western Henan, the total number is over 200,000. Except for the refugees in northern Henan who have received government relief, the refugees in western Henan who have fled to Luoyang have no way to survive. Their suffering is being reported to higher authorities. They hope to receive active relief from the government. The force of the northern wind is more unbearable than anything else!

Luoyang schools have been ordered to open, and Luoyang High School and Luoyang Vocational School have already started classes. Due to the nearby occupied areas and blocked roads, there are only 70 or 80 students in Luoyang High School and 20 or 30 students in Luoyang Vocational School. Luoyang Teachers College has not yet opened because the school buildings are outside the city, and private schools are still suspended because no one is willing to pay tuition fees. None of the schools that have moved out have returned. This is a serious problem in Luoyang.

Elections in Luoyang have come to a standstill. Many counties in western Henan may hold elections in Luoyang according to regulations, but the fact tells us that doing so will cause many unavoidable disputes, and it will not be the true will of the people, or even the true will of the government. Under the situation in Henan, the election is at a standstill, and the Senate has already sent a proposal to the central government.

Luoyang has become a city of refugees, and the refugee problem itself needs to be resolved urgently. (Our Correspondent Fan Hong)
### Guangxi Political Affairs Supervision Group Departs for Wuming, then Guixi
[Our Correspondent in Nanning, 18th] The First Political Affairs Supervision Group of the Guangxi Provincial Government has departed for Wuming and will then work in the Guixi area. The supervision group has taken two practical actions to strengthen the anti-banditry work: The first action was to replace the magistrate of Heng County, giving a warning to other county magistrates and township chiefs who attempt to evade responsibility and work ineffectively. The second action was to resettle surplus and retired military officers, so that they have work places and are no longer idle. According to group leader Zhang Weixia, the group will go deep into every corner of the areas where bandits are rampant as much as possible.
### Sichuan River Boats and Shaanxi Cotton Ideal Monthly Capacity Estimated at 500 Tons
[Our Correspondent in Shashi, 13th] Most of the fine-staple cotton needed by Shanghai cotton mills is supplied by northern Shaanxi. In previous years, the shortcut for shipping Shaanxi cotton was via the Longhai Railway, which was economical in terms of both time and cost. Now that the Longhai Railway has been cut off in many places, most of the Shaanxi cotton, except for a very limited portion that can fortunately be flown to Shanghai, still has to rely on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway to transport to Chongqing and then transfer to Shanghai via the Sichuan River. However, the cotton season coincides with the dry season of the Sichuan River. The already limited shipping capacity of the Sichuan River boats is further reduced by the large proportion of military transport, so the amount of cotton transported is often very limited. According to the most ideal estimate, being able to transport 500 tons of cotton per month is considered the peak shipping capacity. Based on the current price, interest losses along the way, and all transportation costs, the cost of each Shaanxi cotton from Xi'an to the factory in Shanghai is more than 4.5 million yuan. However, recently, the prices of cars and gasoline on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway and the freight rates of Sichuan River boats are brewing to increase, so the cost of Shaanxi cotton arriving in Shanghai still has a tendency to rise to a peak!

### Northern Section of Qingxin Highway to Be Completed by Mid-Next Month
[Our Correspondent in Lanzhou, 19th] The Qingxin Highway starts from Daotanghe near Xining in the east, connects with the Ganqing and Qinghai-Tibet highways, and crosses the mysterious and dangerous Qaidam Basin to Mangya on the Qingxin border, which is the southern section. This section is 1,071 kilometers long and is being built by the Qinghai Provincial Authority, which was completed in mid-September this year and has been test-driven smoothly. There is also a section from Mangya to Hongliugou, which connects with the Southern Xinjiang Highway, which is the northern section, and is being built by the Sixth District Highway Engineering Administration (formerly the Xinjiang Highway Bureau). This section is 225 kilometers long and is currently being built at an accelerated pace. Liu Liangzhan, Director of the Sixth District Highway Engineering Administration, recently came to Lanzhou from Dihua and went to Dunhuang to inspect the progress of the northern section of the Qingxin Highway. The reporter interviewed Director Liu at the Lanzhou Office of the Administration in the Second New Village in the Northwest, asking about the general situation of transportation in Xinjiang and the progress of the northern section of the Qingxin Highway. According to Director Liu, "Regarding the Xinjiang section of the Qingxin Highway currently being built, it starts from Hongliugou on the Southern Xinjiang Highway and reaches Mangya, connecting with the southern section of the project. The entire section is divided into three general sections for construction, employing more than 1,000 civilian workers, and there is an engineering battalion of the 19th Engineering Regiment, equipped with new road machines to assist in the work. Two-thirds of the project have been completed, and some road surfaces have been paved with sand. The central government attaches great importance to this road project and has approved an additional 12 billion yuan in public funds. All the road construction workers are now working hard in the harsh climate, taking only a short nap at noon each day, and working hard with torches burning high at night. It is estimated that the entire line can be completed by mid-next month. This important northwest national defense transportation artery connecting Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang will be completed and opened to traffic."

### Fengxian Requests to Establish Agricultural Warehouses
[Our Correspondent in Fengxian, 21st] The County Council and the County Government, in order to prevent cheap grain from harming farmers, invigorate the rural economy, and adjust the people's food supply next spring, had previously sent several letters to the China Farmers' Bank to establish simple agricultural warehouses without success. Now that autumn has passed, farmers are in urgent need of funds and are selling agricultural products such as grain at low prices, which will inevitably lead to a grain shortage next spring. Therefore, we are sending another letter to the Shanghai China Farmers' Bank, requesting that loans be approved quickly to establish agricultural warehouses to facilitate finance and benefit the people's food supply.

### Anhui Baiyu Actively Repaired and Rebuilt Su Palace
[Our Correspondent in Bianyuan, 15th] Qiyun Mountain, also known as Baiyu, is located between Peifeng and Xihuan in Xiuning County, and is a famous Buddhist holy site in southern Anhui.

The palace has been in disrepair for many years, and the beams and tiles have partially collapsed, and a corner of the building is in danger of collapsing and needs to be repaired urgently. The cost of the project was estimated years ago and was quite far off. Shi Dansheng, the director of the Mountain Cleanup Committee, has purchased all the wood in recent years, and this spring it has been transported from northern Xiuning to the foot of the mountain, not far from the mountain bandits. In order to prevent damage over time, he recently convened the heads of the Wuxiang Town of Tunxi to discuss and actively send personnel to the mountain to raise donations from pilgrims and move the wood into the mountain as soon as possible, so as to start construction next spring and avoid deepening the damage to the palace, and at the same time restore the scenic spots of the famous mountain as soon as possible.

### Taiwan University Library, a "Cultural Treasure"
[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 21st] When the reporter attended the annual meeting of the Chinese Geological Society, he visited the National Taiwan University Library, which is known as the "Cultural Treasure." The library was established at the same time as the founding of National Taiwan University in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The Japanese used Taiwan as a springboard, and the library became a veritable research base for ideological, cultural, political, and economic aggression. Its rich collection and perfect equipment are not only among the best in China, but also rare in the Far East. It is said that there are 600,000 volumes of books in the collection, but in reality, due to the large number, it is still impossible to obtain an accurate number. If detailed cataloging is done, it would require 6 million characters with ten characters per volume, which is a very arduous task. Precisely because it cannot be cleared up for a while, Morizawa Gen, the Japanese administrator who has been working for 20 years, cannot be allowed to be sent back to China. Only he can understand where a certain volume or each type of book is located on a certain shelf. The most valuable books in the collection are the stock deficiency contracts and commentaries of Zhenjiang Ye Yusen, the recording of oracle bone inscriptions of the Henan Museum, oracle bone inscriptions, and the Complete Collection of Chinese Ink Marks, all of which are ancient books more than a hundred years old. Regarding Chinese paintings of past dynasties, there are five major parts of Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Famous Works, Tang People Riding Horses Hand Scroll, Eight Great Mountain Men's Complete Genealogy, Southern Song Treasure Book, and even more Taiwanese historical materials. Such as the French Taiwan Records, the Qing Dynasty's Dongzheng Collection written by Lan Dingyuan, Platform Records, Dutch documents (the original archives are in the National Archives in The Hague, taken by Japanese Professor Kawamae, a total of 75,000 pieces), Zheng Chenggong's edict on Luzon paintings, and Ryukyu rubbings are all very valuable. The rare Chinese and Western handbooks include genuine handwritten

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 22nd] The National Defense Ministry's Jiujiang Command Post will soon be established. The internal organization will consist of eight sections, including the General Staff and Adjutant's Office. The leading personnel have been internally selected. Minister Bai (Chongxi) may come to Xun in the next few days to inspect defense matters and oversee command of the bandit suppression effort. The main force of Liu's bandit troops, which had been causing disturbances in the Jiangbei area, has now moved north to the Yingshan area. Only local communist factions, such as Zou Yiqing and Cai Qiong, are entrenched in Guangji and Susong and other places.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] Military news: Fierce battles have been unfolding in eastern Hubei for days. After Liu's bandit's 1st column of more than 10,000 men captured Xinzhou on the 20th, the National Army lured the bandits deep into the area. They then launched a coordinated land and air counterattack near Kaoshanpu and Xiadian, eventually defeating the bandits. The bandit's 6th column of more than 5,000 men attacked Liuzigang on the evening of the 20th. After reinforcements arrived and launched a pincer attack, the bandits were cut into two sections and are now surrounded in the Xiadian and Baliwan areas.

After being strafed and bombed at low altitude by the air force, more than half were killed or wounded, and the remaining bandits scattered. Furthermore, bandits who crossed the Jushui River from Macheng to invade the west have been cleared out of the areas they had gathered between Lijiaji and Xiadian through days of National Army sweeps. Another group that crossed the river and fled back to Xinzhou was subjected to a fierce attack by National Army pursuing troops in Liuzigang and Qiting on the 21st, and scattered in two groups, fleeing east and west.

### Continuing Good News from Western Henan; Siege of Neixiang County Relieved; Comprehensive Suppression Launched in Southern Shaanxi

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The National Army in western Henan continues to achieve victories. The remnants of Chen Geng's 4th bandit column were again jointly attacked by the National Army and local militia around Zhenping at 1:00 PM on the 21st, resulting in more than 5,300 bandits killed or wounded and more than 1,500 rifles captured. The remnant bandits collapsed and fled in two groups westward in the evening. One group of more than 2,000 men appears to be threatening Xichuan, while the other group of more than 4,000 men fled towards Xixiakou through Chimei City, apparently intending to join forces with Kong Congzhou's bandit troops in southern Shaanxi. The National Army is pursuing in separate columns, and local militias and the public are also rising up to defend themselves. Furthermore, a small group of bandit troops fleeing south between Zhenping and Neixiang is also being pursued by the National Army.

Xue urgently telegraphed the provincial government to report the victory, stating: Communist bandit Chen Geng personally supervised more than 10,000 remnant troops, concentrating artillery fire for days and fiercely attacking the northwest, south, and three sides of the county town, day and night. Our defending officers and soldiers calmly responded, waiting for the majority of the bandits to approach the suburban trenches before retaliating with concentrated fire. The bandits suffered 3,000 to 4,000 casualties, abandoning piles of corpses. The main force of the bandits advanced wave after wave. Four sections of the west, north, and south city walls were collapsed by bandit artillery fire, with very large gaps, making the situation extremely precarious. County Magistrate Li Rishang, militia leaders Cui Qinruo and Cao Zhongshan took the lead and bravely supervised the battle, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the bandits approaching the gaps for five hours. The bandit's momentum was thus thwarted. At the same time, National Army troops arrived to participate in the battle, using superior artillery fire to concentrate and fiercely attack the bandits, who then collapsed and fled. Our more than ten mobile regiments in various outlying strongholds are taking advantage of the situation to separately track, encircle, and annihilate them.

### Madame Chiang Invites Various High-Ranking Officials to Discuss Hospitality for Troops Passing Through

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Madame Chiang is concerned about the lives of soldiers fighting on the front lines, and pays particular attention to the hospitality for soldiers passing through. She personally went to Xiaguan and Pukou on the 5th of this month to慰勞 national army troops passing through.

First, Madame Chiang pointed out the importance of this work, saying, "The civilians in our rear can live in peace because the soldiers are fighting on the front lines, but this is often overlooked. It should be known that the soldiers' physical and mental health is more important than the supply of munitions in determining the outcome of a war. Since we cannot go to the front lines to express our gratitude to the soldiers fighting, we should do our best to contribute our respect and enthusiasm to the troops passing through. Therefore, I have invited you all here today to "discuss solutions". (Continued on page 2, column 5)

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Overseas Chinese in the United States began voting for National Assembly delegates on the 21st, generally held in Chinatown Overseas Chinese schools. The United States is divided into three electoral districts, with a total of six National Assembly delegates to be elected. There are a total of six candidates participating in the election in the western United States, with a quota of three National Assembly delegates. There are two National Assembly delegate quotas in the eastern United States and one in the central United States. Among the candidates participating in this election, some are nominated by the Kuomintang, and some are participating in the election as non-partisan individuals. Among them, the Kuomintang candidates have a superior position, but the strength of these candidates will depend on the number of votes they can mobilize from their respective families, and not on the support of political parties. Another characteristic of the overseas Chinese election in the United States is that the candidates generally hold the same popular election platform, which is to promote the welfare of overseas Chinese. In New York, 5,000 registered voters began voting this morning in a quiet and orderly manner. No public campaign movements have been launched for this election, and on the other hand, it has not been interfered with by local authorities. The other 3,000 registered voters in the eastern United States are also voting in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, and Newark. Among the candidates are Wu Tiansheng, a member of the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang branch in this area, Chen Zonghai, chairman of the Chinese branch, Li Juezhi, a member of the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang branch, and Chen Zhaomin, a leader of the Fujian overseas Chinese in Baltimore.

Marshall's requested amount of aid to China is to curb China's inflation, but to enable China to be self-reliant, more U.S. aid is still needed.

There is currently no hope for peace in China. If the Communist Party maintains its army, reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is impossible. China must be unified, and various political parties must not build their own armies.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] The reporter learned from reliable sources today that the United States has submitted a new plan on Japanese reparations to the Far Eastern Commission, which is composed of eleven countries here.

The reporter visited Hong this evening and asked him to talk about the start of the preparatory work, etc. Mr. Hong said: The date of the opening of the conference is now very imminent, and the most difficult thing is the accommodation problem for these more than 3,000 delegates.

It is expected that the first meeting must be convened before the 3rd of next month. Mr. Hong expressed extreme humility during the conversation, but after receiving the order, he has asked all parties to provide opinions for guidance.
