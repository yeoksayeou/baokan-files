### Shandong Western Newly Recovered County Assemblies Send Representatives to Beijing to Petition

Strengthening River Defense and Building Local Armed Forces

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The county assemblies of the newly recovered counties in southwestern Shandong have dispatched representatives to Beijing to petition the government to strengthen river defenses and assist in building local armed forces. They held a press conference at 3 PM on the 5th, where Guo Junqing, speaker of the Heze County Assembly, Lian Ruan, member of the Pu County Assembly, and Zhang Chunting, member of the Dingtao County Assembly, reported separately. It was claimed that the purpose of this petition is threefold: (1) To request the rapid consolidation of river defenses, as the Communist forces entrenched on the north bank of the Yellow River are constantly planning to create artificial breaches. According to reliable intelligence, the Communist forces are actively building boats, with over a hundred already completed that can hold two hundred people, ready to flee to the south bank at any time. The people of southwestern Shandong are eagerly hoping that the government will send more troops to take responsibility for river defense and quickly allocate more funds and materials to repair the south bank dikes in the area controlled by the Nationalist forces from Lanfeng to Shou Zhang. (2) To request the government to quickly assist in building local armed forces. Currently, the Nationalist forces are concentrated in several garrisons, and Communist forces are still found in the villages, even subjecting them to their reign of terror. All parties cannot tolerate its harm, so they rise up empty-handed and launch joint village self-defense. However, they suffer heavy casualties due to the lack of weapons. If the government can allocate firearms and ammunition to assist in building local armed forces, the situation will definitely greatly improve. (3) To request the government to order the garrison troops and border Nationalist forces to pay market prices when requisitioning grain. Southwestern Shandong has suffered a decade of disaster, with the people impoverished and wealth exhausted. The grain requisitioned by the Nationalist forces is paid at less than one-third of the market price, which affects the income of the people and makes their livelihoods more difficult. It is heard that they will petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and other relevant agencies in the coming days.

### Siege of Longhua in Western Rehe Lifted; Comfort Mission to Chengde to Offer Condolences

[Central News Agency Chengde Dispatch, 5th] The Nationalist forces moving north from here defeated the stubborn resistance of the Communist forces along the way and joined forces with the garrison of Longhua at 8 AM on the 4th. The remnants of the Communist forces fled north. The county seat, which had been besieged for sixteen days and nights, was finally relieved.

[Another Dispatch] After the Longhua siege was lifted, General Shi Jue, commander of the Rehe Western Suijing District, told reporters: The Communist forces' offensive in Western Rehe this time, like the May offensive of Yunnian, was aimed at annihilating the 13th Army and occupying Rehe. However, its failure is exactly the same as in Yunnian. More than half of the five brigades of the Communist forces were casualties, and the total number annihilated should reach two brigades. The remnants are retreating towards Wangtaifu (under Chifeng). The Nationalist forces are still pursuing and suppressing them. Shi continued: The Communist forces have been heavily damaged, and they probably dare not face Western Rehe directly again.

After the Maojin Ferry on the north bank was recovered, the Nationalist forces continued to capture Guanzhuang and have approached the suburbs of Xia County.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Ruicheng in southern Shanxi was recovered yesterday afternoon. The Da'an Village and other ferries on the north bank of the Yellow River have all returned to the hands of the Nationalist forces. Also, the Nationalist forces outside Ji County in western Shanxi have recovered San Ai in southern Jing and are attacking Xiang Ning in the vicinity.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 5th] The situation in southern and western Shanxi is not as optimistic as rumored. In addition to recovering Maojin Ferry, Ruicheng, Jiexian, Pinglu in southern Shanxi and establishing contact with Anyi, Yuncheng, and Xia County, there are no new developments. Western Shanxi is only defending Ji County, and the focus of the battle is now on Xiangling, with a tendency to turn to Linfen. The telephone communication in Xiangling and Linfen was interrupted on the 4th. A portion of the Communist forces in Xiangling has begun to move towards Linfen, and the signs that the Communist forces are trying to attack Linfen as a group are obvious.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 5th] After the Communist forces captured Fencheng, they continued to attack Xiangling with three brigades, 10th, 11th, and 24th, starting on the 3rd.

The small arsenal in Tutancun, Lingqiu, has also been moved to Xiaguanzhen (east of Pingxingguan).

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] It is reported that after the Nationalist forces in northern Shaanxi launched another offensive against Mizhi, they broke into Mizhi city yesterday, and street fighting is fierce.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou Dispatch, 5th] The Nationalist forces garrisoning Anyang launched an attack on the 5th and recovered the Anyang airport. They are currently repairing the equipment.

The grain industry believes that the source is smooth and should not be restricted, and they are asking the municipal government to open the grain market and restore normalcy.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 5th] Shenqiu, which was occupied by Wei Fenglou's troops, has been recovered, and the Communist forces have fled back to Luyi.

### In Response to the Current Economic Situation, Zhang Qun Plans to Propose a New Plan; To Be Submitted for Discussion at Today's State Council Meeting

[Our Nandong Dispatch, 5th] The Financial Committee of the National Economic Commission held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the issue of industrial downsizing. It is heard that the amount of subsidies will be reduced as much as possible, and the expenses of government agencies will also be tightened.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] It is reported that the Premier of the Executive Yuan, will propose a new plan to resolve the current economic chaos at the State Council meeting on the 6th, but he did not reveal the contents of the plan.

### Minister of Finance Talks to the Press on the Issue of Principal and Interest on Public Bonds

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun hosted the press tonight and said that the government will redeem public bonds issued before and during the war at face value. The government has redeemed public bonds during the war at face value, including principal and interest. The National Political Council's proposal that the government pay double the principal and interest on public bonds at face value is unfair to those who have not redeemed the bonds. Also, since public bonds can be transferred, if double the amount is paid to those who currently hold the bonds or those who were not the original purchasers, only a limited number of bondholders will benefit, while taxpayers will bear a heavier burden.

### Stabilizing Chinese Currency Requires Economic Assistance, Cheng Tianfang Says in the United States

[United Press San Francisco Dispatch, 4th] Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese representative attending the Paris meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, announced here today that stabilizing China's currency and postwar economy requires a large amount of funds, and the $500 million designated for loans to China will be the first installment. Cheng did not want to speculate on how much more money might be needed in the end. However, he pointed out that when the Export-Import Bank initially designated $500 million, the official Chinese exchange rate was 2,000 yuan of legal tender to one U.S. dollar. Now, the official exchange rate is 12,000 yuan, and the black market rate is 33,000 yuan. Unless the United States makes a decision on this loan before the end of June, the U.S. Congress will inevitably re-discuss the loan issue. Republican Congressman Jute and other congressmen recently told me in Washington that they will urge Congress to make a decision before the end of June. Secretary of State Marshall did try to achieve an impossible reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists, but the Chinese Communists never tried to reconcile. They never wanted to cooperate and only pretended to do so to buy time and deceive the outside world. The deteriorating cycle of inflation is further worsened by the continuing conflict with the Chinese Communists, resulting in repeated exacerbations of inflation. Cheng concluded by saying that he will travel in the United States and Canada for several months before returning home.

### Dalian Industry Being Dismantled

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] It was learned today that the government's mission to inspect Lushun and Dalian arrived in Dalian on the 4th and discovered that most of the heavy industry had been dismantled and transported to the Soviet-occupied areas of Korea as "war booty." The rest was transported south to Yantai, which is under the control of the Communist forces.

### All Newspapers in Wuxi Suspended Publication; Liabilities Exceed Assets and Cannot Be Maintained

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 5th] Due to the impact of rising prices, five newspapers in Wuxi, namely Wuxi Daily, Youxi News, Renbao, Daxi News, Jiangsu Minbao, and Daobao, have liabilities exceeding the total value of their assets. Advertising and distribution costs cannot be increased proportionally. For the past half month, each newspaper has been losing an average of one million yuan per day. The wages of printing workers and staff cannot be paid. Today, the Daily Newspaper Association held an emergency meeting and decided to suspend all publications from the 6th and apply to the county government to seal up the assets and sell them to repay debts. According to the Daily Newspaper Association, there are two reasons for the suspension of publication: (1) The income and expenses of the newspapers have not been able to offset each other in the past. High-interest loans have been borrowed, and the burden of interest alone is unbearable. (2) The wages of printing workers were originally 12 to 22 yuan before the war. After the victory, wages are calculated in terms of rice, averaging from 2.2 dan to 3.3 dan. As a result, each newspaper has difficulty bearing the costs and has repeatedly consulted with the workers, suggesting restoring the pre-war basic salary and paying it at 70% of the cost of living index. The workers insisted that it must be calculated based on the original basic salary converted to the current market price of rice. The opinions of the two sides differed greatly, resulting in a deadlock.

### Inside Story of the Chinese Communist Aviation School

— Central News Agency Reporter Wang Wanjun

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] The Chinese Communist Party has begun its attempt to bomb Nanjing with aircraft. Although this attempt is far from materializing due to the CCP's current lack of an air force and its distance from possessing the means to utilize transport or reconnaissance aircraft, CCP members are currently relying on external assistance to establish an aviation school in the mountainous areas near Dong'an City on the northeastern border. Their dream air force's cradle is currently located at 45 degrees north latitude and 133 degrees east longitude, west of the Ussuri River on the southeastern Sino-Soviet border of Hejiang Province, north of Lake Khanka, in the northwestern mountains of Dong'an City on the Hulin to Linkou Railway. According to the puppet Manchukuo meteorological reports, this area is in the northern frigid zone, frequently experiences cold currents, has a maximum temperature of 42 degrees, first clouding up in late autumn, thaws in April, and experiences frequent storms in spring and summer.

After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CCP immediately dispatched its only aviation contingent from Yan'an, led by Chang Qiankun, who had studied piloting in the Soviet Union. They crossed the sea from Longkou, Shandong, to Zhuanghe in eastern Liaoning, and from Zhuanghe, they continued by rail to Shenyang and then to Tonghua. There, they transferred approximately forty Japanese training aircraft obtained with the assistance of a certain party and established an aviation headquarters. Subsequently, with Tonghua about to be captured by the National Army, the team moved to Mudanjiang in Songjiang Province. In early 1946, to facilitate supplies, the team moved from Mudanjiang to Dong'an in Hejiang Province and was formally renamed the Aviation School, with Chang Qiankun as the principal. The school currently has over one hundred students. Only one class has graduated from the flight program, all of whom were selected from the Communist army who were graduates of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (Juxian, Shandong), specifically, all forty-two members were selected from the Fifth Cultural Work Team of the university's fifth class. A few months ago, one student was killed by a train, and another was injured and dismissed for other reasons, so only forty pilots graduated. A second class was established, the mechanics program, with seventy students. The mechanics program students were mostly selected from "loyal and reliable" Communist army cadres. Although there are aviation talents in the Northeast Communist army, they are not selected. The CCP maintains absolute secrecy about its only aviation school. Even cadres are unaware of its existence, and outsiders have no way of knowing the inside story. The school's external designation is "Unit 61."

The school is organized with a school affairs office, an education office, and a political department. The education office has flight and mechanical departments. The head of the flight department, Wang Lianzeng, was sent to the Soviet Union from Yan'an to study aviation. The head of the mechanical department is a Korean Communist, transferred from North Korea. The leader of the pilot squadron, a Mr. Liu, also studied aviation in the Soviet Union, and the deputy leader is Xian Jin. There are approximately ten instructors, all of whom are Japanese forced to remain by the Communist army. One is Korean, and the rest are Japanese. The school also has a maintenance team (managing aircraft) and two repair shops, staffed mostly by Japanese, except for the supervisors. As for the training method, because the instructors are Japanese, Korean, and Soviet-trained, they adopt the Japanese and Soviet systems, and the lectures are translated into Chinese from Japanese and Soviet aviation school materials. Training is divided into basic and advanced levels. Academic subjects include flight repair, flight science, mechanics, physics, political science, and mathematics. The aircraft used for training are all Japanese trainers left behind in the Northeast, mostly Type 91 single-engine aircraft. Their so-called "twin-engine" aircraft number only four or five. The school has a total of about one hundred relatively complete and damaged aircraft. The aircraft are old, and the fuselages have been moved frequently, with bullet holes everywhere. None are intact, making them extremely difficult to control. The engines are difficult to start, so accidents during training occur more than ten times a month. Many of the trainees are afraid to practice takeoffs. Almost nineteen of the graduates have never flown an aircraft in the air.

The Chinese Communist Party attempts to seize power by force, but it is deeply troubled by the weakness of its ground forces, so it is plotting to train pilots. Once the time is ripe, it can obtain strength from the air, fulfilling its treasonous ambitions. Their hopes are pinned on this aviation school on the Ussuri River. However, what is even more noteworthy is that the CCP established this school in Dong'an because the area has convenient transportation. Therefore, it can exchange large quantities of grain and materials for aircraft and aviation equipment without obstacles, making procurement convenient. Moreover, if the school site is threatened by the National Army, it can be quickly moved elsewhere by rail. This is also part of their calculations. This article is written based on the accounts of Wang Jingchuan, a graduate of the school's first class who recently defected to the National Army, and Sun Shanshu, a student at the school. Wang Jingchuan was a student in the fifth class of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Shandong and a member of the Communist Party. According to his own account, his academic performance was quite excellent. He said that the Communist Party's call in northern Shaanxi for a "ceasefire after the victory of the war against Japan" has not been honored over the years. Instead, there has been intensified roaming and infighting, causing the people to suffer. Therefore, he resolutely defected to the National Army. The following is an excerpt from Wang's remarks, used as the conclusion of this article: "The Communist Party's senior leaders attach great importance to and cherish our school, but although we have been studying aviation for nearly a year, we are still laymen in aviation. The reason is that the aircraft we are learning to fly are all broken and dilapidated aircraft left behind by the Japanese. They dream of one day being able to let us fly aircraft to bomb Nanjing. The students all secretly find this ridiculous. It is simply as absurd as a myth. However, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, I would like the government to pay attention to one point: the Communist Party will stop at nothing to obtain aircraft. In addition to exchanging grain and other materials, they can offer conditions that sell out the interests of the motherland to get everything they need. Our principal has repeatedly told us that although the training aircraft we are using now are dilapidated, after we complete our studies, there are many aircraft with good performance waiting for us to use in a certain place in the country. He also said that our aviation equipment is not good now, but as long as we work slowly and continuously, we can train a huge air force in the future to help us reach our destination. As for whether the destination is Nanjing or the heads of all 450 million kind Chinese people so that they can taste the taste of bombs, I (Wang Jingchuan speaking) do not know."

### Kātayama Tetsu Speaks: Japan Plans to Send Delegation to China, Says Relations Should Be Revised

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Kātayama Tetsu told Central News Agency reporters today that the Japanese people hope to restore relations with China on the basis of candid and sincere cooperation and peace. He will take active steps to organize and send a delegation, after the peace conference (if he is still serving as prime minister at that time), to apologize to the Chinese people on behalf of the Japanese people for the pillage by Japanese troops in China. The reporter said: When the war ended, Prime Minister Higashikuni also had similar plans, but was blocked by the opposition. Will such figures still block this delegation from going to China? Kātayama said that when Higashikuni was prime minister, some officials and bureaucrats responsible for the war held positions in the government, but they have now been purged. He believes that the Japanese people should support the delegation to China. Kātayama also said that past Japanese talk of Sino-Japanese cooperation was mostly false. However, in the future, the Japanese people should demand that they maintain proper relations with China and avoid the recurrence of the past. Because of the lessons learned from the last war, the relationship between the Japanese people and the people of other countries, especially China, should be revised.

Central News Agency hosted a luncheon for Kātayama Tetsu this afternoon, the first time Kātayama has attended a private banquet since taking office as prime minister. He said that he will do everything possible to make the Japanese people and people all over the world understand any actions of his government. He wants to make it impossible for anyone to suspect that Japan and the Japanese people have any secret plans like the Germans did after World War I. Regarding the terms of the peace treaty, the Japanese government does not intend to engage in secret activities to influence any Allied country. The reporter asked if he understood the Chinese people's concern about Japan's true intentions and their concern about Japan's desire to restore its dominant position in the Far East's economy. Kātayama said that he believes that China should use its resources to improve the lives of the people of Asian countries and hopes that Japan can demonstrate its new attitude of true friendship and its desire to seek genuine cooperation for mutual benefit and prove that it is qualified to participate in the community of nations. Regarding the restoration of Japanese industry, Kātayama said that certain industrial activities are necessary for Japan to survive in the modern world. The textile industry is the most important, but this is only one of the most important economic problems facing the country today. His government will mobilize efforts both internally and externally, mobilize the people, and curb black market activities and the extravagant lifestyles of some people. Kātayama said that he believes he has the support of the people, and the people can make the government's policies on these issues effective. He believes that the people follow the government, and the past government's use of force has had no significant effect because the people do not like this bureaucratic attitude. Moreover, under the current circumstances, a coalition of various parties is most beneficial to Japan, but the Liberal Party seems to be unable to join his government.

### Lin Shuyan Suggests Methods for Absorbing Overseas Remittances

Satisfactory Results Achieved in Consultations in Beijing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Lin Shuyan, Chairman of the Nanyang Chinese Remittance Association, came to Beijing via Hong Kong and Xiamen some time ago to investigate the situation of overseas remittances and request the authorities to formulate measures to absorb overseas remittances.

(2) In areas with many overseas Chinese dependents, the government should urge banks to pay attention to the supply of funds for overseas remittances at any time to avoid the accumulation of overseas remittances and affect the lives of overseas Chinese dependents. He has visited the relevant authorities for several days and presented various requests in person, and the results can be said to be satisfactory.

### Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices Approves Increased Cocoon Loan Amount, Assistance to Proper Commercial Enterprises

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Four Joint Offices held its 345th board meeting on the morning of the 5th, chaired by Vice Chairman Zhang Qun, to discuss important cases as follows: (1) The spring cocoon collection loan in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area had been approved for implementation. The Zhejiang portion had already started the cocoon collection process and the results were excellent. The Jiangsu portion had just started, and a large amount of fresh cocoons was pouring in, but the original loan amount was insufficient for purchasing. The cocoon season was urgent and fleeting. The issue was discussed in detail at today's meeting of the Board of Directors. In order to assist in completing the cocoon collection plan, it was approved to increase the loan amount and continue to urge the various banks to cooperate in handling the matter in order to seize the time. (2) The Resources Committee has been handling the export and sales of tungsten and antimony, making many contributions to supplementing foreign exchange resources.

This was approved by the office. The meeting also presented a report on the establishment of a rediscount committee by the Central Bank. It was generally agreed that national banks could provide financial assistance to commercial firms with good credit, strict compliance with government laws, and proper business operations, to assist them in meeting their funding needs for production.

### Carp Gift Tour Series 3: Qufu, "Not Knowing the Taste of Meat for Three Months"

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Zhang Shengzhi

Following a dirt road from Yanzhou, I embarked on the territory of Qufu County, the hometown of Confucius. On the way, I encountered many brand-new ten-wheeled trucks, fully loaded with military supplies. This series of convoys is precisely the sole condition demonstrating the advantage of the National Army in the battle of southern Shandong.

The construction of the highway is unexpectedly smooth. Because there are not many bends, it can be described as a "shortcut." This is originally a characteristic of the Shandong Plain: there are no rivers, no mountains. Drawing a straight line on the road easily becomes a flat highway.

Because the weather is too dry, many small rivers have dried up. The fine sand of the riverbed is fully exposed to the sunlight. Looking from a distance, the color is white, making it look like a cement-built highway.

On both sides of the highway, the vast and boundless layer of sand and soil relies solely on a few graveside trees as the only decorations. From this, we think that the severe drought in southern Shandong is related to the lack of forests. However, reality and ideals are inversely proportional. The original trees in southern Shandong, because residents are in a fuel shortage and need wood for construction in years of battle, have not only not been cultivated, but have even been uprooted.

What is most regrettable is that, especially on the "Sacred Imperial Road" outside the scenic city of Qufu, many of the tall poplar trees on both sides have also been cut down. What remains is only a white root head, which looks particularly glaring. Thinking of the past scene of lush shade-lined roads, how much there is to curse!

Qufu, a small city that became famous because of Confucius, is unique in that it is full of ancient and fragrant sentiments. Ancient cypresses that are hundreds of years old, and elderly people with long gowns trailing on the ground and white hair fluttering, similarly evoke nostalgic feelings. If there were no military vehicles speeding through the streets, how "quiet" and "civilized" it would be!

Looking at the door plaques and household names on the people's houses, it is not difficult to find many descendants of Confucius's disciples. When I was a student at the elementary school, I would casually meet several elementary school students surnamed Kong. Talking about it, it turned out that they were the young masters inside the "Holy Mansion."

The prices here are not proportional to the low standard of living because of being located in a remote area. On the contrary, when we asked the residents in the city about the price of rice and meat, we were given a heartbreaking answer. A housewife said, "We can't afford these things, so we don't know the price!"

Unexpectedly, two thousand years ago, Confucius, in an environment of poverty and contentment, said the callous remark "not knowing the taste of meat for three months" after listening to music. Now, two thousand years later, in his hometown, due to the chaos of war and the decline of people's livelihood, they truly "do not know the taste of meat." Moreover, the time is more than the short "three months" that he said!

At the county government, I met County Magistrate Wang, a big shot who had fought guerrilla warfare in Shandong. He is fat, of imposing stature, and speaks quite frankly. In his conversation, in addition to reporting on some county government work, he also hoped that reporters would appeal for him to get some relief supplies. Everything is as expected, and is the same as the tone of any county magistrate, saying that they cannot leave behind the word "poor."

Regarding the situation in Qufu, we can see a general picture from the checkpoint at the city gate: a sentry does not lightly let us pass just because the county magistrate is with us. Whether leaving or entering the city, he insisted on writing down our names and numbers, although we did not do so in the end. In addition, the sentry reported a piece of "intelligence," saying that two people in military uniform with weapons and two "plainclothes" had driven into the city. Afterwards, after listening to his words and seeing his nervous look, we couldn't help but laugh. It turned out that the two "plainclothes" were colleagues who were touring together this time. The other two armed people were Commander Zhang of the Third Regiment of Military Police and the Information Director of the Eighty-fourth Division.

Editorial

### The Achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The third session of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been discussing various important bills since its opening on May 26. It was originally scheduled to close on the 3rd, but due to the large number of proposals that had not yet been discussed, the meeting was repeatedly extended and finally closed successfully on the afternoon of the 5th. This meeting was held at a time of turbulent student movements and social unrest. All council members focused their attention on the "stability" aspect of Shanghai's future municipal construction, especially the measures taken to guide the student movement, which are worthy of our praise. Shanghai was able to safely overcome the difficulties of "June 2." This city council was able to mediate between the citizens and the government, and worked hard to guide the student movement so that the authorities and students would not go to extremes. This has made a great contribution. Anything that truly represents the will of the people will have considerable gains, and this can be clearly proven here.

However, we silently observe that what the general public is most interested in regarding the resolutions of this city council is not so much the major national affairs and municipal plans, but rather the many trivial issues that have a direct impact on their lives. Because politics is the business of the people, and the highest principle of managing the affairs of the people lies in being able to increase the happiness of the people and reduce the suffering of the people. The advantage of modern democratic politics is that the public's feelings can be conveyed, and the people, whether in terms of material life or in terms of spiritual boredom, have their elected representatives as their spokespersons, calling out for them and urging them to be relieved. Before the opening of this city council, Speaker Pan specially went to various districts of Shanghai to visit citizens and explore public opinion. At the same time, he also held seven days of municipal forums in various districts to exchange opinions on municipal construction and reform, so as to submit them to the council for discussion and come up with a concrete plan to be implemented by the municipal authorities. This method is worthy of praise.

Speaker Pan summarized twelve practical problems based on his inspection of the administration of various districts and provided them to the city council for discussion. These twelve practical problems are generally related to the daily life of citizens, seem to be lacking high-sounding theories, and have nothing new. (1) Determine the functions and status of the people's representative assemblies and the district offices in each district to establish the foundation of local autonomy; (2) solve the office space of the people's representative assemblies, district offices, and guarantee units in each district; (3) promptly confirm the demarcation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government; (4) quickly supply tap water to poor areas so that the general public can drink it to avoid epidemics during the summer; (5) develop transportation roads and water and electricity supply in the suburbs so that people can move to the suburbs; (6) quickly repair the roads in each district to facilitate the travel of citizens; (7) promptly solve the garbage and manure problem in the city to restore public health; (8) guide and correct the construction of shacks by the poor to prevent fires; (9) increase the number of ferries between Puxi and Pudong to improve transportation; (10) the land occupied by the airport should be requisitioned and paid for or returned separately, and other civilian land, houses, and warehouses that have been occupied should also be returned through negotiation to ensure the safety of the people; (11) quickly clear the floating coffins in the suburbs; (12) quickly allocate land for each district to build schools to launch the school donation movement. These issues related to the lives of citizens do not need to be explained with profound theories, but only require the municipal authorities to implement them earnestly. Perhaps these trivial and ordinary problems are not valued by those who talk about municipal administration, but we feel that they are very important.

We should see that although today's Shanghai is superficially draped in a prosperous and beautiful coat, in reality, it has long cast a dark shadow of depression in all industries and people's lack of livelihood! Especially in the remote suburbs or in places where the poor live, if compared with the many places of wine, women, and wealth, it can be seen that today's Shanghai has been divided into two completely different worlds: one is heaven, where individuals are fortunate enough to live a luxurious life, the so-called gold-selling dens where money is spent like dirt; the other is hell on earth, where people are not fed enough, their clothes are tattered, they have no roof over their heads, no land under their feet, and they are barely surviving under the pressure of high prices, without knowing what the next day will bring. If we want to prosper the market, and if we want to seek stability in Shanghai, and seek progress in stability, then the Shanghai municipal authorities must set an example for improvement to raise the living standards of the common people, because in today's Shanghai, the number of citizens living a luxurious and extravagant life in heaven is very small, and the vast majority of citizens are forced to struggle under the heavy burden of life, almost unable to breathe! They are urgently hoping that the municipal authorities can pay attention to their inhuman lives. The mayor and the heads of various bureaus and departments are officials who are close to the people. If they also take turns going to various districts for on-the-spot inspections, we believe that they will definitely be able to understand more about the citizens who are struggling on the starvation line. Due to the activation of their compassionate hearts, they will actively stand on the side of the majority of the common people and try to improve their lives, then there will be a significant change in Shanghai's municipal administration.

Secondly, we especially admire the city council's vision and the decisiveness of its resolutions. For example, the review report on the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan and the resolution of the General Assembly, although only a few, the determination that the plan must be coordinated with national defense and the construction of the Oriental Port, as well as the decision on the principles of zoning, and the establishment of a standing committee for reviewing urban plans, are all long-term plans related to the future development of Shanghai, and are worthy of being a great goal of starting from small places and acting from nearby places. For example, the proposed organization of the "Committee for Investigating Activities that Violate the Interests of the Chinese People" starts from Shanghai alone, but it can affect the entire country in the future. On this point, the city council has pointed out an important work that all true people's institutions in the country should jointly strive for in the near future. Looking at this work from the perspective of the country and the people, it is extremely important to do it carefully and correctly so that there are no longer lurking terrifying elements in Chinese society who are bent on violating the interests of the Chinese people and engaging in activities that destroy the motherland. The U.S. Congress already has an organization called the "Committee for Investigating Un-American Activities." They investigate the activities of people who violate American interests in great detail, and the reports they publish are valued by the world. The U.S. government often uses the reports of this committee as important reference material when implementing national policies. In the past, our country did not have the people or people's representatives automatically standing up to do this kind of work for the country, but this time, the City Council Assembly was able to initiate it first, which shows their vision and decisiveness. We hope that the citizens can fully and sincerely, under the promotion of the council, take on the responsibility of accurate investigation, and their contribution to national peace and social stability will be extremely significant.

[U.S. Information Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The State Department announced today that it has requested the U.S. representative on the Allied Control Commission for Hungary to seek a copy of all information submitted by the Soviet chairman of the committee to the Hungarian government, "because all sources consistently believe that the resignation of Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy was the result of the Soviet Union submitting this information." A State Department spokesperson explained that this type of document is in the interests of the British and American governments, and according to the provisions of the Control Commission, the United States has the right to request a copy of this document.

[Central News Agency, London, 5th Dispatch] The British representative on the Allied Control Commission for Hungary has taken consistent action with the United States to request that the Soviet representative provide the documents submitted by the Soviet Union to the Hungarian government that caused former Prime Minister Nagy to resign. According to a Hungarian reporter, Nagy's resignation was purely due to the "political blackmail" of the Hungarian Communist Party, which had obtained full Soviet support.

[Associated Press, New York, 4th Dispatch] People here commenting on the political situation in Hungary say that the forced resignation of Prime Minister Nagy and the establishment of a pro-Soviet government in Hungary can be regarded as Moscow's first counterattack against the Truman Doctrine. The United States has now stopped lending money to Hungary, which is enough to deal the most serious blow to anti-Soviet elements in the country. President Truman and Marshall believe that this measure is futile and will only provide an excuse for the Soviet Union to establish a labor camp in the country. Washington also intends to issue a protest to the Soviet Union, but observers doubt whether this move will be effective, as delaying the matter will allow the Soviet Union to take the opportunity to consolidate the bases it has already acquired in order to finalize its control of Southeast and Central Europe. After Hungary is controlled, the Soviet Union can cut off Romania's contact with the West, and it will be impossible for the country to implement Western democracy. The Czech Republic, which has always wanted to become a hub for balancing the forces of the East and West, will also be under Soviet pressure as a result. What is most important is that Austria will also be trapped, unable to promote democracy. Yugoslavia to the south of Hungary, whose leader Tito recently delivered a speech and predicted the intention to form a federation with the Southern Slavic tribes, all of which should be noted.

### Marshall Frankly States that the Situation in Europe Is Very Serious and Opposes Any Government Enslaving Other Countries.

[News from our agency] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: Marshall delivered an important speech at the Harvard University Alumni Association today, urging European countries to unite and carry out great reconstruction work, saying that the United States will do its best to assist in this regard. At the same time, Marshall pointed out: "The United States will oppose any government that hinders the reconstruction of other countries." Secretary Marshall did not specify any country, but said that anyone who wants to enslave others for their own benefit will be met with fierce opposition from the United States. Marshall added: "In the next three or four years, Europe must obtain more assistance, otherwise, there will be economic and political collapse. The policy of the United States is not directed at any country or doctrine, but at poverty, famine, and turmoil. The United States must do its best to promote the economic recovery of the world, because without economic recovery, there can be no political stability, and without political instability, there can be no peace. Before the United States implements more assistance, European countries must reach an agreement on the needs of the situation to clarify their respective responsibilities." Finally, Marshall emphasized: "In Europe, an extremely serious situation is now rapidly developing, which is very unfavorable to the world. The failure to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian peace treaties has greatly slowed down the recovery."

### American Congressman Criticizes Soviet Interference in Hungary's Internal Affairs

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The Senate continued to debate the peace treaties of the former German satellite states today. Senator Eastland, a right-wing senator from Mississippi, strongly protested the Soviet Union's making Hungary its "dependency" and advocated that United Nations agencies take action to maintain peace and guarantee the freedom of the Hungarian people. He also said that if the breakthrough is only to submit a protest, it will not appease the Soviet Union. Britain should take a positive stand and action, such as taking measures to expel the Soviet Union from the United Nations agencies. Finally, the Senate decided to make a final decision on the approval of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania tomorrow morning. It is said that Senator Tranmi Blythe, a Democrat from Arkansas, and many other senators are attempting to delay the approval of the peace treaty with Italy until January 25 next year, but it is expected that their strength will not be enough to prevent the passage of that peace treaty.

### Lu Chuan Discusses New Cabinet's Foreign Policy; Japan Covets Okinawa and Other Islands; American Banks Consider Lending to Japan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tokyo, 5th Broadcast: Japanese Foreign Minister Hidetoshi Ashida hosted foreign journalists today. He stated that Japan has no intention of rearming but only desires "to recover some small islands such as Iwo Jima and the Ryukyus." Ashida also said that Iwo Jima is not economically important to Japan, but the entire country "due to sentimental reasons" strongly desires to recover it. Regarding the peace treaty, Japan agrees to start negotiations as soon as possible.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Hidetoshi Ashida, in a meeting with reporters today, said: If the Allied nations allow Japan to have the necessary police force, equipped with machine guns and pistols, then the Japanese government will definitely be able to maintain public order and security after the signing of the peace treaty. "We have no intention of raising the issue of rearmament, because we have already abolished war under the new Constitution." When asked if the Japanese government is considering preventing aggression, Ashida replied: "We may rely on the United Nations, although we do not yet know whether the United Nations will immediately allow us to join after the signing of the peace treaty." Ashida also said that he does not yet know when preliminary peace talks will begin. So far, Japan has not had any meetings with representatives of the Allied nations on this issue. He stated that the Japanese government has made "full preparations" for the peace treaty proposals. In answering reporters' questions, Ashida said that territorial and economic issues may be one of the important items in future peace treaty negotiations. Japan's borders were determined long ago by the Potsdam Declaration, but there are still some islands, such as Okinawa, the Kuril Islands, the islands east of Hokkaido, and the small islands south of Kyushu, that have not been determined. Ashida also strongly insisted that the issue of reparations must be "realistically resolved." He pointed out that the German reparations settlement under the Treaty of Versailles after the last war was completely unrealistic.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Ashida emphasized when hosting foreign reporters today that Japan's greatest hope at present is to quickly enter into normal international relations. Ashida said: This is not only necessary in terms of world peace relations, but also for the revitalization of East Asia. It is also a new starting point for rebuilding friendly relations between China and Japan. Regarding the issue of reparations, he hopes to learn specific plans as soon as possible, such as what factories and what products will be used for reparations. Finally, when Ashida discussed the international situation, he believed that the most concerning US-Soviet war would not occur because there is no major issue between the US and the Soviet Union that cannot be resolved by means other than war.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] The issuers of the two banks willing to lend 50 million US dollars to Japan said today: This matter is still in an undecided state. A spokesperson for New York's Henry Schroder Bank, commenting on a New York Times Tokyo dispatch that the bank and the Bank of America in San Francisco had offered General MacArthur a loan of 50 million US dollars to Japan, said: The negotiations only discussed the nature of the loan, and the amount of the loan has not been determined. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Bank of America said: This news came about because various parties are trying to discuss ways to fund Japan's import and export business. All the facts are still in an undecided stage. According to a New York Times Tokyo dispatch: This loan is related to MacArthur's recent proposal that Japanese banks' gold be used as collateral to fund the import of various capital raw materials for Japan, because Japan's industry must increase some imports and exports.

Also, Liberal Party President Shigeru Yoshida recently gave his first speech in his capacity as party president, saying: "Without an opposition party, there is no way to make progress.

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 5th Broadcast: The seven major Indian leaders who accepted the Indian partition plan held a meeting with the Indian Governor-General today to discuss the establishment of a committee to study ways to establish two autonomous dominion nations. According to official statements, one or two more meetings may be held in the future to discuss the establishment of the Indian-Pakistani Boundary Commission and other issues. The provinces preparing for partition will soon encounter various problems, such as the division of assets and liabilities, the division of police agencies, courts, and other provincial agencies.

### US and Argentina Decide to Establish Friendly Relations; Brighton's Resignation Approved; US Ambassador to Argentina May Also Resign

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] President Truman accepted the resignation of Under Secretary of State Brighton today, 24 hours after the United States decided to re-establish friendly relations with Argentina. Brighten had frankly criticized Argentina's policies and will step down at the end of this month. According to well-informed sources, there are two ways to fill the vacancy of Under Secretary of State. One is that Secretary of State Marshall will appoint a person with extensive diplomatic experience to preside over Brighton's Latin American policy and various political departments. The other is that Marshall will lead Assistant Secretary of State to directly handle non-Western Hemisphere affairs, and another new Under Secretary of State will be found to specialize in Latin American affairs. At the same time, the US Ambassador to Argentina, Messersmith, is in poor health and is expected to resign, bringing an end to the dispute between Messersmith and Brighten.

[United Press, Capital City of Argentina, 5th Dispatch] Argentina is very pleased with the news of the resignation of US Under Secretary of State Brighten, but officials are unwilling to express their opinions on the matter.

### US House of Representatives Passes Bill; Decides to Restrict Union Activities; President's Attitude Deserves Attention

[United Press, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The US House of Representatives, believing that it can win against the president's possible veto, today passed the compromise union control legislation by a majority of 320 votes to 79, prohibiting unions from launching strikes, making the most thorough reform of labor law in the past 12 years. It is expected that the Senate will take final action on Thursday so that the bill can be delivered to the president for signature on Thursday evening or Friday. Taft of the Republican Policy Committee expects that the Senate will also pass the bill by an overwhelming majority in order to crush the president's veto power. If President Truman signs this labor law amendment, he will finally abandon the pro-labor policy left by Roosevelt's New Deal. He will also sacrifice labor votes in the next presidential election. The bill was finally drafted after several consultations between the Senate and the House of Representatives, which has removed many of the strict provisions of the original House of Representatives to restrict union activities, restoring a more moderate form, but is still stricter than the labor management plan that Truman submitted to Congress in January this year. American organized unions have already spent a lot of money to call on public opinion to oppose this bill.

### Passing Through Dangerous Waves; Senate Meeting Closes

Speaker Thanks Authorities for Meticulously Maintaining Order; City Government's Administration Should Focus on Key Points and Construction

[Our Newspaper's Report] The third meeting of the first session of the City Council was held from the 26th of last month to discuss various proposals, review the city government's administrative report, determine the budget, and guide the student unrest. It lasted for ten days and closed at 8:45 pm yesterday. First, Speaker Shen gave a closing speech, which briefly stated: The third meeting of this council lasted for ten days. During the ten-day session, the council and various subcommittees fulfilled their respective responsibilities. During the meeting, Shanghai was also at its most tense moment in society. We had to discuss proposals on the one hand and take into account social dynamics, especially the student unrest issue. Fortunately, with the cooperation of the security authorities, the situation in Shanghai was transformed from unrest to stability. This is a very gratifying thing. The government authorities' meticulous efforts and the appropriateness of the response methods are worthy of praise from the citizens. Although we heard some parents of students occasionally criticize the authorities' measures, for the sake of the public's security and the protection of young people, we cannot but understand the government's measures. During this period, the Special Committee for Guiding Student Unrest of this council issued a message and went to various schools to guide, fully expressing the enthusiasm for protecting young people and the hope for young students. This point is also very comforting. The city's 30% budget re-compilation and comprehensive budget review have also been reviewed and approved, and it is recommended that the city government focus on key points and construction projects in future administration, and tighten up institutions. These points are all very important.

Efforts in Urban Planning

There are also resolutions on the Shanghai urban plan. Although the resolutions are not detailed enough, we are very ashamed, but the special committee of the council has done its best. In the future, a standing committee will be established, which can contribute even more to promote the implementation of this plan step by step. If we can build a metropolis according to plan now, our descendants will definitely benefit greatly in fifty years. As long as the entire country is unified and peaceful, the Shanghai urban plan will have many opportunities for development, whether by our own strength or with the assistance of international personnel. It can be completed according to our ideals in less than ten or eight years.

Mayor Wu's speech at the closing ceremony of the City Council (photo by this newspaper)

Three Points in Mayor's Speech

Mayor Wu then gave a speech, saying that he had a few thoughts: (1) The proposals of this conference were concrete and the discussions were in-depth, which has benefited me a lot and made me feel the great responsibility of the city government even more, and I cannot but work harder. (2) Although the Shanghai urban plan seems to be just talk on paper now, if there had been a plan for the construction of Shanghai a hundred years ago, today's transportation and other issues would not be so chaotic. As the speaker said, as long as China can truly be peacefully unified, the urban plan can be completed within ten years. Otherwise, if Shanghai continues like this, future generations will blame us.

Thanks for the Cooperation of the Council

(3) Regarding public security, I am very grateful to the City Council for various guidance, so that this major difficulty can be overcome safely. Now that the matter has passed, but what I can report to you is that there was a great danger on June 2, thanks to the efforts of the military and police authorities and the Council that stability was achieved. As for the city government's arrest of students, it was by no means reckless. The list was drawn up very carefully. There are a total of 45,000 students in Shanghai. After a year of investigation, more than 80 people were identified, but due to many disadvantages after disclosure, it is not intended to be disclosed unless necessary. However, all the evidence is very solid. One of the students had participated in riots elsewhere, with evidence to prove it. Others publicly posted the charter of the "Anti-Japanese University" run by the Communist Party in their bedrooms and wanted to introduce classmates to apply to the school.

Rehabilitating the Arrested Students

Some people advocate sending the arrested students to court, but in order to protect young people, we did not send them to court, because after sending them to court, according to the evidence, both military law and judicial law can be convicted. These students are all promising young people of the country who are being used by others, so we do not use legal sanctions but emphasize humanity. We originally intended to send them to the CCP area, but in order to comply with the opinion of the City Council, we decided to keep them for rehabilitation, so that they can all become pillars of the country in the future.

### Leading with Justice; Serving the People

Finally, Councilor Tao Baichuan, on behalf of the city councilors, said: I have one feeling about this conference, that is, we discuss proposals, from small to a school or a district, to large to the country, and the world. Someone mentioned that small matters do not need to spend a lot of time and solemnly discussed. But I believe that the Council should ask about and discuss big issues, and also ask about and discuss small issues. Both principles and techniques should be taken into account. The so-called "small things of the government are big things of the people". We believe that there is no lightness or heaviness. For each individual, it is a big deal. The Council represents justice and is a banner of justice. There is too little sense of justice in society today. We must exercise justice for the citizens, otherwise all plans and all proposals will become "just talk on paper". The colleagues of this council have this spirit and deserve to continue, with "small things of the government are big things of the people" as the premise, with "justice" as the guiding spirit, not afraid of difficulties, and serving the people.

### Amended and Passed Standards for Deferment of Conscription; Street Vendors' Illegal Goods Shall Not Be Confiscated

[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Shanghai Municipal Government's Standards for Deferment of Conscription for Sole Breadwinners of Families in 1947" drafted by the Municipal Government was submitted to the City Council by Speaker Pan. After discussion at yesterday's meeting, the following was resolved to be amended: (1) For those who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families and have no siblings, the following items should be prepared: 1. Those who are responsible for the living of one or more family members; 2. Those whose average annual income per person is less than 6 Shi of rice (the same applies to those who have no land and whose other income is less than the value of the above-mentioned rice). (2) If there are two brothers, one of whom is disabled and has been approved for exemption from military service, and the livelihood of the whole family depends solely on one person, the standards for deferment shall apply to the provisions of Article 1.

Other cases submitted by the Speaker, which were discussed by the conference, included: (1) "Whether or not to respond to the Qingdao City Council's telegram, suggesting that the central government change councilors to salaried positions, and request discussion". Resolution: Retain. (2) "The second conference of the council, unresolved temporary motion: For street vendors who violate police regulations, their goods shall not be confiscated". Resolution: Send a letter to the municipal government ordering the police bureau that the goods of street vendors who violate police regulations shall not be confiscated, and shall be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on punishment of police violations. (3) "The unresolved motion of the second conference of the council: Regarding the case of private misconduct of garbage trucks transporting vegetable vendors in the Health Bureau, requesting a public decision". Resolution: Send a letter to the Health Bureau to strengthen management in the future to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents.

### Shanghai Urban Plan; Establishment of a Standing Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Council discussed the "Shanghai Urban Plan" yesterday. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau reported the main points of the plan, followed by councilors expressing their opinions. Finally, it was passed: (1) The special committee for reviewing the case was changed to a standing committee to facilitate progress. (2) Supplementary opinions, that is, Shi Bangfan's request to pay attention to coordinating with national defense, and Jiang Huaishu's request to coordinate with the Eastern Port plan. (3) Add Shi Bangfan, Zhu Fujiu, Jiang Huaishu, Wang Ziyang, and Zhang Yuliang as members of the special committee. (4) Xi Yuyu suggested that Nanhui Chuansha be included in the urban area, and if other councilors have any opinions, they should be submitted to the committee for discussion after the special committee is established. Also, regarding the case of "requesting the municipal government to return to the original site", it was also resolved to be submitted to the committee for discussion. In addition, the "Provisional Regulations on the Location of Factories in Shanghai" was passed by the conference in principle, and the amendment of the articles was submitted to the special committee for review.

### Administrative Review Report; Amend the Wording for Reply

[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Council's review report on the city government's administration has also been generally passed, and Li Wenjie, Tao Baichuan, and Zhu Wende were selected to amend the report's wording for submission to the city government for handling. In addition, 53 important resolutions of various committees during the adjournment of the second conference have also been retrospectively passed by the conference. In addition, regarding legal regulations, the city government submitted to the council for review nine kinds of the city's various tax collection rules and audit methods. The conference resolved that the legal regulations and finance committees, after considering the opinions of the councilors, would deliberate and submit them to the next conference for retrospective approval.

### Pre-War Term Deposits; Please Set a Repayment Method

Suggest the Central Government Consider Reorganizing Old Public Bonds

[Our Newspaper's Report] During the final stage of yesterday's meeting, Zhuang Ping and others raised a temporary motion: "It is recommended that the central government stipulate a method for repaying term deposits absorbed before the war and implement it quickly to protect national assets." The original method suggested that the central government repay according to the current cost of living index. Some councilors and Vice Speaker Xu advocated retaining it, but the original proposers opposed it. As a result, it was resolved to cancel the method of following the cost of living index and petition the central government to stipulate a repayment method. At the same time, Wang Weiyi, Shao Yongsheng, and others insisted that the public bond case should also not be retained. After the resolution, it was: "It is recommended that the central government consider reorganizing old public bonds."

In addition, several temporary motions were passed: (1) "Please instruct the first district office to move to the original site of the Civil Affairs Office for office work as soon as possible to facilitate work and correct appearances." (2) "Please instruct the municipal government to take back the public property of the French Concession and allocate it to Jiangwan District and Gaoqiao District for the development of education funds". Resolution: Send it to the municipal government for consideration. (3) "Please instruct the Public Utilities Bureau to distinguish between three-wheeled vehicles transporting goods and private vehicles in accordance with business vehicle licenses to maintain the livelihood of three-wheeled vehicle towing workers, distinguish work, and avoid disputes". Resolution: Send it to the Public Utilities Bureau for consideration.

### Lou Guowei Goes to Beijing and Does Not Attend

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lou Guowei, director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, was originally scheduled to attend the council again yesterday to continue the report, but because Lou was summoned to Beijing yesterday morning, he did not attend.

### The Index Cannot Be Issued Honestly; Disputes in Various Industries Fluctuate

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the publication of the May cost of living index, most capitalists expressed that they could not issue it honestly, especially in the machinery, casting, and electrical industries. The Machinery Industry Association also notified its members to issue according to the April index, but the profit and loss situation of each factory is different, so some have reached an agreement and some are still deadlocked. Yesterday afternoon, both labor and capital went to the Social Affairs Bureau to state their difficulties and are being mediated by the bureau.

Machinery Industry in the Fourth District

The district includes 40 manufacturers, of which 23 have decided to issue 23,500 times in one lump sum or in installments. The remaining Zhongxing, Yuanfeng, Samsung, Qiujing, Chen Xingji, Shanghai Zhengji, Huangpu and other factories said that they would still only issue 14,800 times. Labor and capital are still in dispute. China Textile Machinery Company recently caused workers to strike over the index. Under the mediation of Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, it was decided to issue 70% according to 23,500 times first, and the rest will be negotiated again. The workers expressed satisfaction and have returned to normal.

Machinery Industry in the Seventh District

Because the capitalists all issued according to the association's notification of 14,800 times, the workers specially sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, claiming that if it could not be resolved, it might cause a strike.

Tailoring Industry

Regarding the tailoring industry, the seamstresses of 13 companies including Nanjing West Road's Peiqi, Cairo, Wuxingchang Ruji, Zhaofeng, Wanhexing, Kailin, Longmao, Raymond, Radar, Peimeng, Youlian, Hengtai, and Guangming went on strike because the capitalists did not agree to pay according to the index.

Also, the capitalists in the machinery industry met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting to change the basic salary, which was rejected by Director Wu, who believed that the basic salary had been set. If it is changed now, it will only cause disputes. At present, we can only think of ways to appropriately increase working hours or discount from the basic salary.

### Public Buses of the Transportation Company Once Went on Strike and Then Resumed; The Two Demands Were Resolved After Consultation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The public buses of lines 1 to 11 of the Public Transportation Company under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau went on strike yesterday morning and did not fully resume operation until 11:00 am.

Because the company is a business agency of the municipal government, all employees' salaries are based on the treatment of public education personnel. In addition to the current 340,000 yuan, the basic salary is calculated at 1,800 times, plus a business bonus of 40%. Since the publication of the May cost of living index, more than 700 drivers and ticket sellers of the company gathered to discuss at 11:00 pm the night before and decided to demand two items from the authorities: (1) Issue in accordance with the existing basic salary and the cost of living index. (2) Implement an 8-hour work system. After hearing the news, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau rushed to consult that night. The workers insisted on the request, which was not resolved until yesterday morning. All the drivers and ticket sellers gathered at the trade union at 959 Gongping Road waiting for a reply and did not go to work, causing all buses on each line to be suspended. At around 9 o'clock, Director Zhao went to consult again. Regarding the salary issue, because the Public Transportation Company is not a private enterprise, it is still treated as civil servants, and it is also allowed to be allocated in kind. Everything is handled in accordance with the municipal government's regulations, and it is promised to issue a difference between the market price of the allocated items and the market price of the allocated items, which is 300,000 yuan per person before the actual items are received. All the workers were satisfied and immediately went to work in each army. The vehicles on each line came out of the factory and ran as usual.

### Regarding the Index Issue: Wu Kaixian's Remarks on Establishing Unified and Flexible Measures, Which Seem Impossible in the Current Situation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Wu yesterday addressed the labor unrest caused by the unfreezing of the index, stating: The government should certainly consider the difficulties faced by the industrial sector. However, establishing unified and flexible measures seems impossible because the prosperity and decline vary across industries, and the production and business conditions of each factory within those industries also differ. Those who can still afford it should continue to issue wages according to the stipulated index. For those who genuinely face difficulties, adjustments should be made based on their specific circumstances. Forcing uniformity would only create obstacles and make things difficult. Therefore, if factories truly cannot afford to pay wages according to the index, they should resolve the issue individually, through negotiations between labor and management to agree on discounted payments or extend working hours as compensation. It is hoped that each factory will submit this issue for discussion at factory meetings, and the factory should also make its production costs and business conditions as transparent as possible to enhance understanding between labor and management and overcome the difficulties together. When the government announced the freezing of the workers' cost of living index in February, all the workers in the city uniformly complied, hoping that prices would not rise further. This spirit is highly commendable. For two, three, and four months, there were no complaints. Now, because prices continue to soar, causing real hardship for workers, the government has established new wage adjustment measures. At the same time, it has also considered the situation of the production sector. Therefore, in addition to discounts, the measures also include Article 5, which stipulates that if businesses genuinely cannot afford it, labor and management can negotiate a reduction. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be submitted to the Labor-Management Arbitration Board for a fair decision. The government has already provided detailed measures. Now, some union branches do not know how to properly guide the factories to implement these measures separately, enabling each factory and union to negotiate openly and honestly. Instead, they are using other impractical methods, which only increase disturbances and cannot solve the problem, which is truly inappropriate.

### Xue Gengxin and Jiang Hongjie: Re-trial Postponed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Xue Gengxin, a key member of the puppet police bureau suspected of being a traitor, was heard for the third time at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Xue argued that he was working underground while serving in the police bureau, and He Shizhen, the former president of Chizhi College, and Hu Qi, an underground worker, testified in court, all in favor of the defendant. After the court hearing, due to the need for further investigation, a retrial was scheduled.

Also, Jiang Hongjie, the former Minister of Transportation of the puppet Provisional Government, was tried for the first time in the High Court yesterday morning. The defendant tried his best to defend his past crimes. After a long hearing, due to the need for further investigation, a retrial was scheduled.

### Summons Witnesses in the Fubo Ship Case: Passengers to be Questioned on the 17th

[Our Newspaper's Report] In addition to the previous trial of the defendant Dai Rulin in the Fubo ship tragedy, it has now been decided to reopen the trial in the Second Criminal Court at 9:30 AM on the 17th of this month. The defendant Dai Rulin will not be brought in for questioning, but only passengers of the Haimin ship, Luo Qian, Li Chunlin, Jiang Jixin, Li Xiuming, and Lin Ruwen, will be summoned to testify in court. The summonses were sent out yesterday morning.

They entered at 5:00 PM and left around 6:00 PM.

Accompanied by Warden Tian of the detention center, Chu Fengyi and Sun, the head of the section, first went to Qu Yuan's cell. Miss Qu was combing her hair, wearing a floral silk cheongsam, and was small in stature. When she saw her teacher arrive, she bowed deeply at 90 degrees, tears welling up in her eyes. Dean Chu comforted her, saying, "Don't cry. The court is now hearing the case, and everything should follow legal procedures." Miss Qu said, "I hope the trial starts soon. I don't have any books or newspapers to read here." Warden Tian interjected, "Yes, as long as your family sends them, we will forward them to you immediately." Dean Chu said, "Do you have enough clothes? Are you cold? Are you sleeping comfortably?" Qu said, "It's okay, I just feel bored." At this point, she started crying again. After Dean Chu comforted her for a while, they went to the other students' cells one by one to comfort them. They did not leave the detention center until around 6:00 PM.

### The United States Respects Our Country's Judiciary

An American Youth Files for Divorce in His Own Country; His Wife in Shanghai Asks Our Court to Serve as Agent for Transmission

[Our Newspaper's Report] An American youth, Lao Baituo (male), and Pai Tuolixiya (female), married in Shanghai on April 27, 1946, and returned to New York. Soon after, Lao discovered that Pai was having an affair with another man. Pai came to Shanghai alone in November 1946. Lao filed a complaint against his wife in the local court of Oulai, a major city in New York, seeking a divorce. The case was later transferred to the New York High Court. However, the female party is being tried in Shanghai. According to international law, if one party is in their own country and the other party is in another country, the laws of the other country should be respected, and the notification of the trial should be issued by that country. On the 3rd of this month, the US Consul General in Shanghai, Stevens, sent a letter to the city's local court requesting that the notification from the American court be delivered to the female party. If Pai does not return to the US within 20 days, the divorce will be finalized. This is the first case of a foreign country respecting our country's judiciary.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Xing Company's Fuxing ship, loaded with foreign rice from Siam on the 7th of last month, ran aground near Turtle Island in the Xiamen Sea. Fortunately, the bow of the ship floated, and the rice that was not submerged was unloaded by Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper.

### Wage Discounts Above 100 Yuan Can Be Agreed Upon by Each Factory

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai wage adjustment measures passed by the National Price Conference stipulated that the amount of base salary between 30 yuan and 100 yuan should be divided into levels of 10 yuan each, with a 10% discount for each level. However, it was not specified how to calculate the amount above 100 yuan. Wu Kaixian, the head of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Social Affairs for clarification. He received a reply from Minister Gu yesterday, stating that the original measures did not specify discounts for base salaries above 100 yuan. This is because there are very few workers in this category, and they are mostly senior technicians with important positions and a significant impact on the future of production. Therefore, discounts for the portion above 100 yuan should be determined by each factory, with labor and management agreeing on the provisions based on their circumstances, which would be more appropriate. If there are disputes, they should be submitted to the Labor-Management Arbitration Board for a decision.

### Shanghai Branch of the Production Promotion Association Assists in Transporting National Products to Southeast Asia

In order to develop trade in Southeast Asia, the Shanghai branch of the China Production Promotion Association has conducted surveys of the production and sales conditions of its member manufacturers, as well as the sales conditions in Southeast Asia, in order to expand trade in Southeast Asia. This is currently underway. Recently, Li Zhifu, the commercial commissioner stationed in Singapore by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, telegraphed that hot water bottles, enamelware, glassware, cotton yarn, and other goods produced in the city are very popular in Southeast Asia and should be shipped south as soon as possible. Before the war, the number of goods shipped from Shanghai to Southeast Asia each year was extremely large, and the foreign exchange recovered was quite substantial. After the victory, overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia repeatedly telegraphed to order goods, but due to control regulations, some goods could not be freely transported and sold to Southeast Asia, which greatly affected the business of manufacturers. Recently, overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia have successively telegraphed to urge the shipment of these goods. The association has decided to assist manufacturers in transporting and selling them to various parts of South China.

They were accusing Xia Guanshun of counterfeiting legal tender. The police took everyone back to the station for questioning. Xu and others confessed to falsely accusing Xia of counterfeiting legal tender in order to extort money. They also admitted that they were the ones who arrested Lu Ronghui that morning.

It was also learned that on the 2nd, armed men and men in plain clothes went to a certain house in Shizi Lane in Nanshi to look for Yang Zhen, taking the opportunity to falsely accuse him of using counterfeit money. Yang was not there, so they took away a woman holding a baby. Whether this was also done by Xu and others is still unclear. It was also learned that Lu Ronghui was released at 11:00 AM yesterday and went to the Laozha Police Station at around 3:00 PM to report the incident.

### Enlarged Investigation of the Jin Chao Case: Bei Zuyi Interrogated; Conference Hall Used as a Court; Repeatedly Called Reporters "Old Friends"

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office has expanded its investigation into the Jin Chao case, which has caused a national sensation. Yesterday, it summoned Bei Zuyi, the former Governor of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, the former director and deputy director of the Business Bureau, Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and cashier director, and Zhan Liansheng, the chairman of the Gold Industry Association who is in custody, to court to investigate the "disruption of finance." At 9:05 AM yesterday morning, Bei Zuyi arrived at the District Prosecutor's Office in a green private car accompanied by lawyer Duanmu Qi. Bei was wearing a gray suit. When he got out of the car, the cameras were busy taking pictures. Bei did not go to the registration room as usual, but went directly to the reception room on the third floor of the office to wait. The conference hall was then used as a court. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Ding Fu'en and Clerk Situ Bihua began the interrogation, which was very detailed. The interrogation ended at 11:20 AM. When Bei came downstairs, the cameras of the photographers were busy again. Reporters stood at the car door and asked him to express his feelings about the interrogation. Bei repeatedly smiled and said, "We are all old friends, old friends." He refused to express any opinions.

Lin Yang Wang and Others: Summoned One After Another

Lin, Yang, and Wang registered at the registration room at 9:00 AM and sat in the waiting room. Lin Fengbao was wearing a gray suit and pacing back and forth, sometimes resting his chin in his hand and sitting silently, looking rather anxious. Yang Anren was wearing a light gray suit and repeatedly said, "This matter is due to a misunderstanding." Wang Songtao was wearing a floral long gown and looked relatively calm. Lin was interrogated from 11:20 AM to 1:00 PM, Yang from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and Wang from around 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. All four were ordered to return home and left one after another. Zhan Liansheng was still wearing a long robe and mandarin jacket, sitting alone in a room. Because it was late, he was not interrogated and was scheduled to be investigated this morning. He was still sent back to the District Court for detention.

According to sources from relevant parties, because the case is attracting national attention, the District Prosecutor's Office has expanded its investigation in order to thoroughly understand the truth, summoning people related to the case in order to get to the bottom of it. Yesterday's investigation focused on who was responsible for the gold rush, such as the amount of gold sold through open and covert channels, who decided the gold price, the reason for the discrepancy between the amount of gold allocated by the Central Bank and Tong Fengyu, and whether there was collusion between officials and merchants to manipulate speculative gold trading, and so on. Lin, Yang, and Zhan, the three defendants, have already been tried in the District Court. As for whether Bei and Wang are guilty, it cannot be determined at this time. Because the case is complex, it is still necessary to periodically summon people related to the case for further interrogation.

### Municipal Government Expenditure Departments: Additional Budget Approved; Totaling More Than 79.2 Billion Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] The re-edited and additional budget for the expenditure portion of the Municipal Government's general budget for the 36th year was passed by the City Council yesterday according to the review report. Several resolutions were also made: (1) Please Municipal Government pay attention to key points in future administration to save expenses. (2) The Municipal Government should submit additional budgets to the Council for review first in the future. (3) In order to strengthen the organization of the Budget Committee, at least one member of each of the other committees should participate in the discussions when the committee holds meetings in the future. The budget report was presented by City Councilor Li Wenjie yesterday, stating: (1) The income portion of the re-edited budget was completely listed in accordance with the amounts passed by the Council, totaling: Ordinary income, regular items, more than 184.3 million yuan, temporary items, more than 58.4 billion yuan, totaling more than 242.8 billion yuan. (2) The expenditure portion: Originally offset against income, but after the Municipal Government added three budgets, totaling more than 79.4 billion yuan (including new construction costs, clearing accumulated garbage, police subsidies, aerial surveys, firefighter subsidies, police subsidies, living subsidies for various units, repairing 500 dung carts, and building 50 public restrooms). After review, it was deemed that the dung cart repair fee of more than 100 million yuan should be included in the Health Bureau's temporary fee for purchasing and repairing equipment. After deducting this amount, the additional budget totaled more than 79.2 billion yuan. Therefore, the total expenditure is more than 322 billion yuan. If the excess collection of various taxes from January to April is used to make up for the deficit, more than 62.7 billion yuan can be obtained, so the deficit is more than 16.4 billion yuan. However, there are also deficits for various bureaus outside the budget (listed by the Municipal Government as an appendix to the re-edited budget), totaling more than 129.6 billion yuan, which have not been reviewed. If they need to be formally listed in the future, the Municipal Government should compile them into an additional budget and submit them to the Council for review.

### Executive Yuan Rejects Subsidy Funding, National Games May Be Postponed, Hao Gengsheng Comes to Shanghai to Convene Preparatory Committee for Consultation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Because the Executive Yuan's administrative meeting on the 4th rejected the 2 billion yuan subsidy for the National Games, Hao Gengsheng took the noon train to Shanghai on the 5th to consult with Mayor Wu, and will convene the Standing Committee of the National Games Preparatory Committee to discuss whether Shanghai will find a way to fund the National Games on its own, or make other plans.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The National Games, scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Day this year, will now be declared postponed indefinitely. The Executive Yuan had previously approved the subsidy for the National Games, but has now changed its mind. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan decided to stop the funding in accordance with the policy of tightening expenditures.

[Our City Dispatch] Hao Gengsheng, Director-General of the Preparatory Committee of the 7th National Games and Physical Education Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 3:30 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the same day. According to Hao, he came to Shanghai to report on the progress of the National Games to the Preparatory Committee. Hao consulted with the relevant authorities last night and scheduled to host a press conference for sports reporters from all newspapers in Shanghai at the City Gymnasium Conference Room at 3:30 PM this afternoon to make a public report.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The 7th National Games, originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Ten Day this year, may be postponed due to unresolved funding issues. On the 4th of this year, the Executive Yuan had approved a subsidy of 1 billion yuan for the National Games. At the first preparatory meeting held in Liuzhao at the beginning of last month, the competition rules of the Games were approved, and the budget was listed as 12 billion yuan. Wu Guozhen, director of the preparatory committee, hoped that the central government could subsidize half of the amount. After several consultations by the committee, the budget was tightened and it was decided to request the central government to subsidize 2 billion yuan. During the debate on the issue at yesterday's administrative meeting, it was decided not to add to the budget, as the fifth item of the National Games's holding method stipulates that if the Games are held in a province or city, the funding shall be borne by the local government. Therefore, whether the Games can be held as scheduled depends on whether the Shanghai authorities can bear the cost of the Games.

### Import Quotas for the Second Quarter; Import Management Committee Considers Relaxation; Generally Increase by 30% Based on the Original Quota

[Our Dispatch] The Import Quota Allocation Office of the Import Management Committee has already considered relaxing the quotas for certain types of imports in the second quarter, generally increasing by 30% based on the original quota. It is known that the import quotas that have been relaxed include white newsprint in the paper category, which has been increased to US$2,595,000. In terms of wood pulp, the quota for the National Resources Commission Paper Mill remains at US$100,000, while the quota for private paper mills has been increased to US$625,000. The quota for cigarette paper has been increased to US$780,000. The quota for other types of paper has been increased to US$520,000. For all types of quota imports of the committee, Shanghai accounts for approximately 70% to 80% of the allocation ratio, while the rest is allocated to other cities. However, fertilizer is an exception, as there is a greater need in South China. The committee has completed the allocation of quotas for extra-quota cotton in the second quarter. It will be announced as soon as it is approved by the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee. Regarding the import allocation of rubber, a consultation meeting with manufacturers in the industry will be held next week before a decision is made. The results of the allocation of wool quotas are insufficient. The committee is currently consulting with the authorities on ways to make accommodations so that those in the industry who have their own foreign exchange can import wool from abroad to make up for the shortfall.

### Statement on the Declaration of the Five County Cloth Factories, the Textile Management Committee Issues a Statement, The Committee Has Never Directly Distributed Yarn to the Factories

[Our Dispatch] Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Management Committee stated yesterday that the "Respectful Announcement to All Sectors" issued by the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Associations of Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, and Jiangyin counties on the 3rd of this month contains inconsistencies with the facts regarding the committee's involvement. He issued the following statement:

He stated: "This committee has never directly distributed yarn to the replicating factories. However, from August 30th of last year, it supervised national and private yarn factories to hold four phases of joint sales of cotton yarn. The first phase was from August 30th to September 18th of last year, distributing a total of 25,779 pieces of yarn. The second phase was from September 23rd to October 18th of last year, distributing a total of 17,966 pieces of yarn. The third phase was from October 28th to November 21st of last year, distributing a total of 19,842 pieces of yarn. The fourth phase was from December 2nd of last year to January 6th of this year, distributing a total of 18,208 pieces of yarn."

The above four phases of yarn distribution were carried out by national and private yarn factories through the Replicating Industry Association to the replicating factories. From January 1st of this year, it was felt that the joint sales system was not effective, so it was abolished. From January 1st of this year, the committee changed to purchasing half of the yarn produced by each factory based on its cotton inventory. The remaining half was sold freely by the factories. The half of the cotton yarn purchased was sold by the committee through the Textile Construction Company in accordance with the company's original method. The committee has never interfered with the Textile Construction Company's business methods. This statement is issued because the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Associations of the five counties are unclear about the matter."

Review of Northern Transport of Yarn and Cloth Nearing Completion

In addition, the committee's review of the qualifications of manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to Hebei and Northeast ports can be concluded soon. Once approved by Chairman Wu, the number of approved companies will be announced. Regarding the matter of abolishing the method of transporting yarn and cloth to Hankou, Director Liu of the Business Department of the committee discussed it with Minister Chen Zhishi of the Ministry of Economic Affairs during his trip to Beijing. Minister Chen indicated that he could consider revising the method and changing it to allow industry associations to issue certificates proving the transshipment.

### Gauze Market Shows Strength

### Zhejiang Province Abundant Spring Cocoon Harvest

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th] This year's spring cocoon harvest in Zhejiang Province has been abundant. The Xin'an-Shengxian and Hangzhou areas are about to conclude their season, while the Huzhou area has not yet entered the market. The Jiaxing area has the highest production. As of the 4th, the total amount collected in various areas has reached over 70,000 dan, and it is expected that 100,000 dan can be collected. Loans have been issued to various areas, including 45 billion to the Hangzhou area, 50 billion to Jiaxing, over 3 billion to Xin'an-Shengxian, and over 4 billion to Huzhou.

Existing loans expended are already at 110 billion, but Jiaxing area needs more funds, the Province has urgently telegraphed the Capitol and Shanghai, in order to arrange for funds to be transferred in the fastest way to Hangzhou, because Jiaxing has too much arrears of funds for cocoons, triggering widespread disturbances.

### Priority Processing of Rice Distribution for Qualified Applicants

[Our Newspaper] The Food Allocation Committee headquarters are still under renovation. Before the establishment of the committee, all matters will be temporarily handled by the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The distribution of rice to trade unions and schools in the city has resulted in many applicants, cumbersome review procedures, and a shortage of staff. Therefore, although some notification letters have been issued, rice has not yet been received.

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, feeling that the processing was too slow, yesterday specifically ordered the Food Section to stop reviewing applications from today and to prioritize the distribution of rice to those who have passed the review. Wu, also the concurrent chairman of the Allocation Committee, specifically convened the Standing Committee members of the committee Zhang Xiaosong, Ren Xianqun, Ye Baofu, and the director of the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Grain Department Ye Xinming, the chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau Ji Mingzhai, etc., to hold a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 4:30 pm today to discuss the progress of the Allocation Committee.

Rice Prices Stable, Miscellaneous Grains Weak

Yesterday, the North and South markets together received more than 6,900 shi of rice and grain. In the North market, the influx of goods led to sluggish sales, and both japonica and indica rice saw a decline of 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. White silver dollars were used to increase sales volume. The South market was still tight in the early morning, but slackened at noon, with similar results. Indica rice was traded thinly, showing a slight softening, while white silver dollars remained firm, and out-of-town silver dollars saw lackluster absorption.

Flour prices showed mixed gains and losses. Foreign flour fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and factory flour also fell by a little over 1,000 yuan, but the bottom-grade sifted flour was still active, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat bran saw increased actual sales inland, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was actively traded in Shantou, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Raw oil and soybean oil rebounded by over 10,000 yuan. Clear oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil showed slight strength, temporarily forming a sideways pattern. Red beans were sluggish and depressed, gradually decreasing by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were the most sluggish, falling sharply by 10,000 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Improve, Slightly Weak at Close

Chinese stocks yesterday, because the environment after the previous night's meeting seemed to show a glimmer of dawn, turned to be lively. However, due to over-speculation, the liveliness was ultimately unsustainable, and at the close, it suddenly reported weakness. Currently, deferred trading saw Yongsha between 300 yuan and 380 yuan, Xinyi between 130 yuan and 170 yuan, small stocks from 6.5 yuan to 11 yuan, and interest-included prices from 18 fen to 24 fen. This is because fluctuations arise repeatedly and the current account balance has decreased, making arbitrage more convenient.

The opening was stable. Stocks were already stable. The opening of Yongsha was much higher, and the deferred delivery of Yongsha became brisk. After the opening, No. 2, No. 224, No. 226, No. 85, No. 231, No. 218, No. 24, and No. 185 came in, while No. 104 and No. 188 vigorously purchased spot Yongsha, so the deferred delivery of Yongsha soon reached the daily limit. The dark market also called high to the 7,000 yuan mark, and Lian, Datong, Jinglun, and China Silk all reported daily limits. No. 157, No. 177, No. 76, and No. 23 took advantage of the high price to sell within 6,800 yuan, and No. 224, No. 226, No. 190, No. 148, No. 75, No. 28, and No. 22 entered again to above 6,900 yuan. No. 154, No. 200, No. 36, No. 223, No. 180, and No. 212 disposed of stock, and No. 201 also sold for immediate delivery, and dropped to within 6,700 yuan. No. 76, No. 99, and No. 22 took advantage of the situation to continue to enter, and No. 112 also took delivery of immediate delivery Yongsha, so deferred delivery Yongsha rebounded to 6,870 yuan. Spot Yongsha reached above 6,500 yuan. Afterwards, although No. 202 absorbed from time to time, No. 99, No. 171, No. 12, No. 152, No. 153, No. 142, and scattered investors successively shorted, and the excess longs mutually trampled on each other at noon, deferred delivery Yongsha fell to a low price of 6,500 yuan. Under the support of No. 117, No. 204, etc., Xinguang eagerly returned to the top, and Yongsha also showed some stability, ending the close with a consolidating pattern. The result compared to the previous close was that Yongsha and Zhongfa rose slightly, Yonggong was still flat, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhua fell slightly, Zhongsi and Jinglun had some return after the daily limit, each rising half a percent, Datong had some return after the daily limit, falling back half a percent, Lian had no return after the daily limit, only reporting a slight rise, Xinya fell by one percent, Guohuo, Zhongfang, and Tongyi were all flat, Underwear fell slightly, and Rongfeng, Yongni, and Commerce rose slightly. Deferred delivery stocks Yongsha rose to the daily limit and then had some return, rising slightly more than Yonggong by half a percent, Xinguang, Xinyi, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing all reported slight gains, and all the old stocks outside the field rebounded slightly except for Wuzhou, which did not show any improvement.

### Government Bonds Initially High Then Low, Foreign Stock Trading Still Low

Government bonds yesterday, series C initially high then low, opened in the morning at 13,800 yuan. From 13,900 yuan, the market fell to 12,900 yuan, and then rebounded slightly, finally stabilizing at 13,000 yuan. Rooms 555, 551, and 360 were selling, while rooms 208 and 503 were entering, the result still fell 300 yuan short of the previous close. Series E was the most colorful, rising alone by 500 yuan, series A and B rose by 200 yuan, series D only rose by 100 yuan, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan. There is a vague saying of multiple repayments of principal, the trend is uncertain.

Foreign stocks yesterday still traded little, still followed Chinese stocks to advance and retreat. Retail investors first entered and then exited, and gold merchants absorbed a little, but Hesheng sold some. Yisha opened in the morning at 67,000 yuan, Hong Kong-Shanghai Telegraph lowered to 14.7 yuan, with the high price seen at 68,000 yuan. Finally, the price fell to a low of 65,000 yuan to end. The result compared to the previous close showed that Yeguang, Yipi, Aviation, Steel, and Cultivation rose slightly, Yisha fell slightly, and British-United, Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Telephone were all flat.

### Rayon Market Active, Prices Rose Straight Yesterday, Factory Silk Calm, Transactions Thin

Yesterday, the market for rayon continued to rise. No. 120 Takayama Yuko opened in the morning, still calling the last price of the previous day as 19.3 million yuan. Then, because the demand from all sides was very good, the price rose in a straight line, and it was immediately traded at 800,000 yuan. The midday close actually rushed out of the 20 million yuan mark. In the afternoon, because there were people who wanted to dispose of their stock at high prices, the price called back slightly. The last price sold was 19.8 million yuan, which was still 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Toyo brands were shouting 100,000 yuan short, and other brands all rose and fell accordingly.

Yesterday, the market for factory silk was calm, and transactions were thin. Only D-grade prices were traded at several levels from 24.5 million to 800,000 yuan. All other grades only had asking prices but no transactions. Because it was rumored that the price of fresh cocoons in Wuxi was between 1.2 million and 1.3 million yuan, and the reeling yield was quite good, all parties maintained a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in very thin absorption.

Yesterday, the silk market was quite excited. True silk bedding rose by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, and Dacheng Plaid Crepe rose by 1,500 yuan. The morning opening started at 35,200 yuan. After many parties pulled it up, the largest bid was 6,000 yuan, and the closing price returned slightly, with a transaction at 5,600 yuan. The interval date opened at 6,000 yuan. The market price of rayon goods was flat and tired. Because actual sales were light, it was unable to rise. Huajin Crepe high-grade yesterday made 17,000 yuan, and Shenghang and other goods did not change from the original plate.

### Estimated Autumn Raw Cotton Harvest in China to Exceed 10 Million Dan, No Need to Rely on Foreign Supply of Raw Materials Next Year

[Our Newspaper] Zhou Bingwen, Executive Member of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, met with reporters yesterday to discuss in detail matters related to cotton production, tobacco leaves, and food in China. The main points are extracted and recorded as follows:

In terms of increasing raw cotton production, in December of last year, he was entrusted by the former President of the Executive Yuan, Song, to plan the Raw Cotton Increase Plan of the National Cotton Production Improvement Office. He accepted and allocated the office's annual expenditure of 9.8 billion yuan according to the predetermined plan, so that the entire production increase plan could be promoted. The cotton seeds sown this year included 500 dan each of foreign and domestic seeds, totaling 100,000 dan, which were planted in various regions of the country. Among them, Hubei accounted for the most, followed by Shaanxi, Henan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, etc. Hebei and Shandong were originally important cotton-growing areas, but unfortunately, due to the war, the work was hindered.

According to this cotton planting plan, when the new cotton enters the market between September and October of this year, it is estimated that 12.5 million dan of raw cotton can be harvested. If the current national cotton spinning industry is fully opened to 4 million spindles, and each spindle consumes 3 dan of cotton per year, the completion of this production increase plan means that China will no longer need to rely on foreign supply of raw materials next year. Unfortunately, the war continues in various parts of the country, and the recent drought in the north will inevitably affect the completion of the plan. However, the output of raw cotton at the end of this year should greatly increase compared to the total output of 7 million dan in the previous year. At the same time, it can also save a large amount of foreign exchange funds for the country. Currently, the branches of the Cotton Production Improvement Office are widely established throughout the country. There are more than 400 technical staff. It is expected that the office's annual expenditure for next year will be expanded to 50 billion yuan.

In terms of increasing tobacco production, there were originally three fixed points, namely Xuchang in Henan, Weixian area in Shandong, and Mentai in Anhui. At present, Shandong can only concentrate on increasing the planting of tobacco leaves in Xuchang due to the current situation, and Anhui due to the soil conditions. The tobacco fields in this area have expanded from 400,000 mu last year to 700,000 mu this year. Therefore, the output of tobacco leaves this year should greatly increase compared to last year.

In terms of food, he believes that in addition to ordering foreign rice for supply, the fundamental solution is to increase production. He said: Before the war, China imported foreign rice worth more than 200 million yuan in legal tender per year. However, the imported amount only accounted for 5% of China's production. China's food production cannot be increased due to the government's neglect of agriculture. Therefore, for the present plan, we should still try to increase production as much as possible, and especially need to take into account the production costs of farmers.

### Jianghai Customs Revises Mooring Buoy Rental Fees

[Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs recently released Announcement No. 137, stating: After examination and approval, the rental fees for customs mooring buoys are hereby revised from now on as follows: Class A buoy (per day or part thereof) National Currency 250,000 yuan. Class C buoy (per day or part thereof) National Currency 120,000 yuan. Furthermore, if a ship stays at a customs buoy for longer than the originally applied period, the rental fee for the exceeding period shall be collected at four times the fixed amount. Also, if a ship engages in repairs or has other reasons for not loading or unloading goods during the period of mooring at a customs buoy, the rental fee shall also be collected at four times the specified amount. However, if the repair work of a ship loading and unloading goods at the same time cannot be completed within the originally approved mooring period, an application may be made to extend the mooring period. The initial ten days of the extended period will still be charged at the fixed rate, and from the eleventh day onwards, the fee will be four times the fixed rate.

### China Trust Bureau Avoids Tender, Sells a Batch of Old Tea at Fixed Price

[Our Newspaper] According to reporters' inquiries from the tea industry: The China Trust Bureau began selling bulk old tea for export through tender yesterday. Peifeng, Wang Yutai, Wuchang and other export houses tendered for hundreds of boxes, with old special tribute tea tendered at 170,000 to 350,000 yuan per dan, and old Zhenmei at 351,000 yuan per dan. It is heard that the old tea sold in this tender is of good quality and is at least 70% cheaper than the market price. It is also learned that the China Trust Bureau plans to publicly tender a considerable amount of tea for domestic sales next time, and the quality is also quite good.

### Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Supports Simplified Tax Collection

[Our Newspaper] The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association of Shanghai, in order to protest the audit and assessment of profits tax and support the simplification of tax collection by the Municipal Council, issued a declaration yesterday, stating: Audit and assessment can only be applied when people's livelihood is stable, and cannot be tried today when all industries are in poverty. What our industry and commerce are fighting for is that the current audit method is simply not feasible, and it is not about how capital can be enough to be slaughtered. In terms of capital, the more the book figures increase, the less the actual materials, the more the loss is real, the more the profit is virtual, and the original capital is larger, and the loss is even greater. The association wholeheartedly supports the simplified tax collection method resolved by the Municipal Council.

### Gu Shanchang Goes to Capital to Convey Brokers' Opinions

[Our Newspaper] The opinions on subscribing for US dollar bonds decided at the previous meeting of the Securities Exchange Brokers Association have been verbally discussed with the Securities Exchange Authority yesterday by the person in charge of the association. It is now learned that Gu Shanchang, the current Securities Exchange Association, was dispatched to the Capital last night. Wang Xitang and Wu Gonglu, the resident supervisors of the Ministry of Finance and Economics, also went with him. It is said that in addition to conveying the opinions of the brokers to the Ministry of Finance and Economics, Gu Min will also submit four types of stocks for listing to the ministry for approval so that they can be listed and opened for auction. It is reported that there are currently a total of 48 types of stocks applied for listing. Only four types have been reviewed and approved by the Securities Exchange Listing Securities Review Committee so far.

### National Banks Conduct Preliminary Discussions on the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises

[Our Newspaper] President Zhang of the Central Bank convened a meeting at the bank at 4 pm yesterday, inviting Wang Yunwu, Wu Yunchu, Li Fusun, and Fu Rulin to talk, and it did not end until about 6 pm. It is heard that the content of the meeting was related to how to accelerate the sale of state-owned enterprises and enemy-puppet properties. As a result of the exchange of opinions, Zhang will submit it for discussion at the National Economic Commission meeting to be held next week.

### Urban Construction and Local Autonomy

— Zhao Zu

——Introducing the Significance of "Neighborhood Unit" Design——

For more than a year, Shanghai's urban planning work has been actively promoted by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Planning Committee and the Public Works Bureau. Recently, the "General Plan" has been submitted to the Municipal Consultative Council for review. In a few more months, the finalization of the plan for Greater Shanghai will be completed in its technical design phase and will enter the stage of administrative approval and actual implementation.

On this June 6th Engineer's Day, I would like to take the liberty of discussing the meaning of "urban construction" contained in the term "urban planning," as well as its relationship to and possible impact on "local autonomy," in order to celebrate the smooth progress and success of a challenging sector in our Chinese engineers' future nation-building work—namely, urban planning.

Urban Construction is Based on Natural Construction

A country has its major aspects of construction, such as economic construction, political construction, military construction, etc. The same is true for a city. It can be divided into three aspects: first, economic construction; second, social construction; and third, natural construction (Physical Development). The object of urban planning is natural construction, but the planners aim to generate power for economic construction and social construction from the planned development of natural construction. This can be said to be a grand vision of our engineers.

For example, if in the urban plan of Shanghai, after comprehensive and detailed investigation and research, and debate on both sides, it is decided that the "General Plan" includes the Pujiang Bridge or Tunnel. The decision from the general plan will strengthen the confidence and efforts of those who advocate cross-river projects. The result? It is completed in a few years or within the time limit stipulated in the plan. Then, what kind of effective power it will produce for other natural constructions in Pudong and Puxi and for the entire economic and social construction of Shanghai is foreseeable. Therefore, although urban construction has three aspects—social, economic, and natural—the general public and those studying engineering focus on the natural construction aspect, just as the focus of a country's economic plan is often on industrial construction, transportation construction, agricultural construction, and so on.

The natural construction of a city can be said to be the foundation of the city's social and economic construction, and "urban construction" should focus on the natural construction aspect. This is the recognition and interpretation of urban construction by our engineers on the "June 6th" Commemoration Day.

Local Autonomy Requires a New Baojia System

What is the relationship between urban construction and local autonomy? The relationship lies in the interaction between the natural construction and social and economic construction of the city, as described above. In terms of the city, local autonomy is nothing less than the city's political or social construction. The most important point of local autonomy lies in the ability of the people of a place to elect local officials to manage their own affairs and to run the police themselves to protect the safety of their lives and property. According to our current local autonomy system, there are organizations such as townships, baojia, and households. Only with this organization can various local autonomy facilities be promoted. To achieve the formation and improvement of this organization, and to coordinate this organization with various facilities, urban planning will be the most powerful and reasonable method.

One of the important principles of modern urban planning is the establishment of "Neighborhood Units." The neighborhood unit can be said to be a new baojia organization. What is a "neighborhood unit"? Modern urban planners regard the city as an organic body and hope that the city can be ruralized both in its natural and social sense, hence the design of neighborhood units. We see that the citizens of Shanghai, even those living in the same alley or next door, often do not know each other's names or communicate with each other. However, Confucius, more than two thousand years ago, meaningfully said: "It is beautiful to live in a neighborhood with benevolence." He also said: "Virtue is never solitary; it always has neighbors." But today's Shanghai, and many of the world's cities, are not like this. As a result, people in the city, away from home, only have factories, "offices," shops, clubs, entertainment venues, etc., and lose the friendship of neighborhood and community life. Thus, the spiritual life of the city seems to only consist of competition, acquisition, or pain, jealousy, or indulgent licentiousness and enjoyment. This is the greatest loss of modern urban civilization. The neighborhood unit is to compensate for this loss.

The Meaning of Neighborhood Units

Now let's look at the design of the composition of neighborhood units in the second draft report of the Shanghai Urban Planning General Plan.

In the report, the planned future city of Shanghai will be divided into twelve district units (originally also called urban area units). Below the district unit, there will be "town units" (originally called town units). There are green belts separating the units. It has high schools, hospitals, churches, police stations, post offices, etc. Below the town unit, there is a "community unit" (originally called intermediate unit). The community unit is surrounded by so-called "auxiliary arterial roads," and should include a junior high school and hospitals, police stations, etc. Below the community unit, there is a "neighborhood unit" (originally called small unit).

Each neighborhood unit must have a primary school. Each complete primary school has six grades, with two classes in each grade, and forty students in each class. The entire school can have 480 students. According to the situation in Shanghai, school-age children account for twelve percent of the population, which is enough to meet the needs of children from four thousand people to attend school. This is the smallest design organization in Shanghai's urban planning. In addition to primary schools, it must have public libraries, kindergartens, nurseries, sports fields, children's playgrounds, and shopping centers.

From the neighborhood unit, community unit, town unit, to the district unit, in addition to the above-mentioned design regulations with various organic properties, there are also the following considerations regarding land use and location in terms of walking distance and time:

1. Within the neighborhood unit, the walking time from the residence to the daily necessities store should not exceed ten minutes.

2. Within the neighborhood unit, the walking time for primary school students from the residence to the school should be at most fifteen minutes.

3. Reduce the distance from the residence to the workplace to a 30-minute walk.

4. Entertainment areas and residences must be within a 30-minute walking distance.

5. The walking distance from the home to the regular administrative agency should not exceed 45 minutes.

From what has been said above, it can be seen that the future Shanghai, if implemented according to the ideal of urban planners, will be a very economically configured, harmonious, and vibrant organic body, and its basic organization lies in the "neighborhood unit."

This kind of neighborhood unit, in form, seems like the bao and jia under the county, city, district, township in our country's local autonomy system (the new baojia organization mentioned above). However, the baojia organization is modified from the traditional social organization of the past. Based on natural development, it seems to have lost its meaning and function. As mentioned above, taking the Shanghai alley as an example, dozens of households in an alley are organized into several bao and several jia, but they still do not know each other's names and do not interact with each other. Each household lives separately. How can it have the function of social autonomy? Moreover, under the situation where rents are abnormal, landlords do not care, and public morality is low, the problems of cleaning and repairing garbage, ditches, and roads in Shanghai's private alleys cannot be reasonably solved.

On the contrary, the neighborhood unit combines the design of housing location, the design of transportation systems, and the design of public places such as schools, health centers, and public meeting places for about 4,000 people in a unit, making it truly a close-knit neighborhood, a community with social life. At that time, how convenient and effective it will be for you to have them elect, jointly guard, jointly prevent epidemics, jointly organize garbage cleaning and repair of road ditches, jointly develop or improve primary school education, etc. This is the role of the neighborhood unit.

By extension, the community unit, town unit, and district unit can also exert their respective individuality and functions. With this, local autonomy can succeed with ease. This is the new path proposed by our engineers for promoting local autonomy on Engineer's Day today.

I sincerely hope that Shanghai's engineers, the people in Shanghai who handle local autonomy—the Department of Civil Affairs and personnel from various districts—as well as Shanghai's enthusiastic social activists, and all citizens, can recognize that both urban construction and local autonomy must start with urban planning, and that our country's new urban planning must be able to promote the organization and construction of "neighborhood units," and must be able to coordinate the autonomous organization with the natural organization of each level of the city in urban planning. This is not only local natural construction, it is also social reform, it is the prerequisite natural condition for local autonomy, it is the foundation of democracy, it is the matter of the whole China, and it is the great aspiration and responsibility of our engineers.

### Prospects for Shipbuilding Engineering in Our Country

— Xu Xueyu

Shipbuilding engineering in our country has never been valued by the world; compared with other engineering departments in our country, shipbuilding engineering can be said to be calm and least noticed.

Before the War of Resistance, there were more than 1.2 million tons of ships along the Yangtze River and coast of our country. Among them, more than 600,000 tons were national ships. Due to the economic aggression of foreign businessmen, the shackles of unequal treaties, and the unsound maritime regulations in our country, most of the national ships were old and rotten. It was not easy for shipping companies to make a living; of course, they could not add new ships. Even if there were, they were very few. Therefore, at that time, the shipbuilding industry in our country was very dull; at the same time, it was not sound and was not noticed by people, which was a natural result.

After the victory, the right of navigation was recovered. During the rehabilitation period, there was a sudden shortage of ships. Therefore, in order to save time, various shipping agencies ordered a large number of ships from foreign countries. Up to now, our country has 700,000 tons of ships. Most of the sources of these ships are old ships from foreign countries or surplus ships after the war. Of course, they can be used temporarily to maintain water transportation when ships are in short supply after the victory. However, these ships are either too large in tonnage or too deep in draft. The cost of repair and maintenance is very huge, which is not only unsuitable for the situation of our country's ports, but also very uneconomical and absolutely cannot compete with foreign businessmen. The conclusion drawn from this fact is that if we want to obtain ships suitable for the situation of our country's ports, or if we want to open up ocean lines and compete with foreign businessmen, we must build new ships.

At the same time, before the war, there were more than 1.2 million tons of ships along the Yangtze River and coast of our country. At that time, Japan's total tonnage of ships along the coast was about 5 million tons. If we not only fill up the tonnage along the Yangtze River and coast, but also replace part of Japan's shipping business before the war, our country will need at least 2.5 million tons of merchant ships. If the prescribed age of each merchant ship is 25 years, then our country must build at least 100,000 tons of new ships every year to supplement it in order to maintain this 2.5 million tons of necessary tonnage, not including the construction of special ships such as warships and fishing boats.

Therefore, shipbuilding engineering will have the hope and need of gradual development in the future. At the same time, it is indeed noticed by the government. Recently, the National Resources Commission is planning to set up a central shipyard, the gradual expansion and equipment of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the Ministry of Communications is planning to set up a ship repair and construction plant, etc., which are examples of this.

However, the construction of the shipbuilding industry has several necessary conditions, which must be gradually realized and improved. They are described as follows:

Formulation of Maritime Regulations

Maritime regulations have the greatest relationship with the design of new ships. In their maritime regulations, all countries have very detailed regulations on the structure of various parts of ships, the waterproof and fireproof equipment of ships, the freeboard of ships, boilers, main engines and auxiliary machines, and the size of crew members' rooms and berths. In other words, maritime regulations can also be regarded as the standard for ship structure and equipment. International conferences have been held many times to stipulate the safety standards and freeboard regulations for various ships on international routes, but each country still has its own special regulations due to its special circumstances. For example, the United States has regulations on ships on the Great Lakes and inland rivers, Japan has regulations on ships in the inland sea, and the United Kingdom has regulations on immigrant ships in various colonies. The Suez and Panama Canals and other governments have their own regulations. Our country's maritime regulations can be said to have no foundation. Even the most basic freeboard law has not been stipulated. Even the various terms related to ships have no standard. Therefore, the shipbuilding engineering community in our country should assist the government in formulating very perfect maritime regulations as soon as possible. Not only can our country's new ships be designed according to a certain standard in the future, but also our country's shipping industry can use this standard to maintain and maintain the safety and effectiveness of their ships. This is not only necessary for shipbuilding engineering, but also a necessary and urgent measure for the future of the shipping industry.

Establishment of a Ship Model Testing Tank

Most of the fuel saving for ships depends on the improvement of ship type and propeller. The research on ship type and propeller can be said to be the most important development in shipbuilding engineering in the past 20 years. This research depends entirely on the ship model testing tank. Countries all over the world, such as Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain, Norway, Sweden, etc., have ship model testing tanks. Universities in various countries are also often equipped with ship model testing tanks for experiments. The correct horsepower of various ship types, as well as the improvement of ship types and the increase of propeller efficiency, must be determined in the testing tank. The situation of the water flow along the Yangtze River and coast of our country has its own characteristics. To match the characteristics of this water flow, special ship types and propellers should also be used, and their generation must rely on the testing tank. Therefore, if our country wants to build new ships to exert their highest efficiency in special routes, it must establish a well-equipped ship model testing tank for detailed research. At the same time, if you want to determine the horsepower when designing a new ship, you must also have a ship model testing tank.

Improvement of Machine Building Technology

Shipbuilding and machine building are interdependent and must be carried out in a complementary manner to build good ships. Our country could manufacture ordinary smoke tube or water tube boilers and ordinary reciprocating steam engines and semi-Diesel diesel engines before the War of Resistance. However, their efficiency was very ordinary. If high-pressure boilers, high-pressure and low-pressure steam turbines, new steam engines, high-speed diesel engines, and electric propulsion and other newer and more accurate machines, there is no factory in China that can manufacture them. This is the biggest shortcoming of our country's shipbuilding engineering. Of course, machine building technology is closely related to the improvement of general machinery industry. At the same time, the technology of steel smelting also has a great impact. On this point, engineering experts in shipbuilding, machine building, and smelting must work together to establish the ship machinery industry, so that the technology of machine building can be gradually improved to meet the needs of our new ships.

Establishment of Auxiliary Machine Industry

There are many types of auxiliary machines for ships, too numerous to mention one by one. Usually, shipyards do not manufacture all of them. Instead, there are various specialized factories, collectively called auxiliary machine industry, such as steering gears, telegraphs, anchor winches, feed water pumps, circulating pumps, air pumps, generators, air conditioners, and anchors, anchor chains, steel wire ropes, etc., which can be manufactured separately in specialized factories. In the future, as our country's shipbuilding industry gradually develops, this auxiliary machine industry will inevitably emerge. The government is willing to provide more support, so that the entire shipbuilding industry can stand tall.

The above points are all necessary conditions for the development of our country's shipbuilding industry. Therefore, I specifically put them forward, hoping that the shipbuilding engineering community will pay more attention and work harder, so that the ships needed by our country in the future can be manufactured in our own country, can exert their special efficiency, and can compete with others on international routes. At the same time, I also hope that the government and the shipping industry will provide more assistance to the shipbuilding engineering community and build our country's shipbuilding industry as soon as possible, so as to improve the performance of our ships and truly develop our country's shipping industry.

### Jiaotong University Was Founded for Telecommunications Construction: Department of Telecommunications Management

— Yu Bingjian

Telecommunications and transportation are to a country what the nervous system is to the human body. The length of the circuits and the quality of the machinery can be used as a standard for measuring the prosperity and decline of national power. They occupy an extremely important position in national defense, economy, politics, and industry. Our country began to run its own telegraph service in the fifth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1879 AD). It has been more than 60 years since then. Although the establishment of telephone was later than telegraph, it also has a history of more than 40 years. According to statistics before the war, there are more than 1,000 telegraph and telephone bureaus across the country, with more than 100,000 miles of lines. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, the southeastern half of the country fell into the hands of the enemy, and telecommunications and transportation were devastated. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the electrical communications in major cities gradually recovered. However, in order to meet the needs of the times and complete the mission of national construction, the current telecommunications industry still needs to continue to work hard. Based on my observations, I will briefly describe my hopes for improving China's telecommunications:

(1) Wired Telegraph: Wired telegraph still occupies a considerable position in China's telecommunications industry today. However, the routes have been destroyed by the war and have been severely damaged, and they need to be repaired urgently. At the same time, the number of lines should be increased. Important circuits should be replaced with copper wires. Phantom and carrier wave devices should be used. Automatic machines should be used more. Facsimile telegraph and teletype should be gradually developed. Underground cables should be installed in Beijing and Shanghai. Submarine cables should be laid in important coastal cities and towns to strengthen national defense and protect the confidentiality of communications.

(2) Wireless Telegraph: In the early stage of telecommunications construction, wireless should be fully utilized to supplement the lack of line construction. More direct routes should be opened, especially for communications in border areas. Bureaus with heavier business should use transmitters of 1 kilowatt or more at a minimum to reduce the attenuation and interference during communication.

(3) Wired Telephone: Wired telephone is the foundation for building a domestic communication network. Laying lines and improving components should be carried out simultaneously. All major cities should use automatic telephone sets. Carrier wave equipment should be used as much as possible to improve the transmission efficiency of long-distance telephone. For remote townships, in order to facilitate business communication and mutual assistance, telephones should be added. In the initial stage, common battery or magneto telephone sets can also be used. Make sure to connect with the city anytime and anywhere.

(4) Wireless Telephone: It is currently important to widely install wireless telephones between international and domestic major cities with long distances and difficult line construction to communicate news.

The above only mentioned the most important aspects of improving telecommunications equipment. As for how to develop China's telecommunications industry and make it thrive, the focus is on whether the entire telecommunications technology and management are sound. If there is only telecommunications technology without a sound management method, there will be no way to lead subordinates and smoothly promote the work. All telecommunications supervisors cannot stick to the expertise of each technology or the excellence of certain knowledge and be complacent. They must be proficient in "telecommunications technology and management," or simply "telecommunications management," in order to be able to plan and organize and be competent and happy. The so-called "telecommunications management" does not mean that technical personnel are engaged in administrative management. Its nature is that technology and management are mutually supportive. At least, they must have an in-depth study of technology and a considerable understanding of administrative management. Recently, I heard that Americans attach great importance to the management of various businesses, finance, and operations. It has become a force equal to engineering technology.

For the past 50 years, Jiaotong University has aimed to cultivate technical and management talents for various industries. All colleges of engineering, science, and management have their own specialties. Talents have emerged in large numbers over the years and have contributed a lot to society and the country. Two years ago, the Ministry of Communications believed that China's telecommunications construction industry was expanding day by day. In addition to the need to train a large number of technical personnel to meet the needs of dispatch, the need for "telecommunications management" talents became more urgent. Therefore, a "Telecommunications Management" department was added to take into account both technology and administration, so that skilled technicians would not be ignorant of administration. Once they take over as supervisors, they often feel unable to cope with the situation with ease. On the one hand, it can be said that it is adapting to the current needs of the telecommunications industry. On the other hand, it can also be said that it integrates the telecommunications technology and management courses of the university's colleges of engineering and management into one furnace to make up for the shortcomings of the past. The admission test for first-year students in the Department of Telecommunications Management is based on the standards of the colleges of engineering and management, focusing on Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and must have management interest and ability, so that they have a considerable foundation in each subject before entering school, and it is easier to make progress in studying advanced technology and management. After entering school, the curriculum was hand-ordered by experts from the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications and Jiaotong University, including:

First year

Chinese, English, Calculus, Mechanics, Heat, Acoustics, Optics, Magnetism and Electricity, Economic Geography, Bookkeeping and Accounting, Principles of Economics, General Theory of Law, Mechanical Practice.

Second year

English, Second Foreign Language, Differential Equations, Electrical Engineering, Introduction to Telecommunications, Thermal Power Engineering Internal Combustion Engine Science, Storage Battery Science, Financial Mathematics, Enterprise Paper Weaving and Finance, Advanced Accounting, Physical Experiment, Engineering Practice.

I would be very grateful.

### Brief History of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Municipal Engineering Society

The Chinese Municipal Engineering Society was established in Chongqing in 1943 and has been in existence for four years. Its purpose is to promote the improvement of municipal engineering. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the general headquarters moved to Nanjing. In order to develop the society's affairs, it was decided to establish branches in major military cities to strengthen the organization and develop the society's affairs. The first branch to be established was the Beijing branch. After careful preparation by the members in Shanghai, the Shanghai branch was formally established on May 2 this year. Zhao Zukang, Yao Shilian, Lu Qianshou, Wu Wenhua, Yang Mingding, Wang Dashi, Yu Haoming, etc. were elected as directors, and Mao Yisheng and Chen Fuhua were elected as supervisors. Among the directors, Zhao Zukang, Yao Shilian, and Lu Qianshou were elected as directors in charge. Zhao Zukang was the chairman of the branch, and the Transportation Research Committee, the Architectural Research Committee, the Sanitary Engineering Research Committee, and the Editorial Committee were established, and Mei Fuqiang, Wang Dingzeng, Gu Kangle, and Chen Fuhua were respectively invited to preside over them, and experts were invited to participate. It will definitely make extensive contributions to the improvement of municipal engineering. The number of members in this branch is 51, including 28 basic members, 18 members, and 7 junior members. The address of the society is temporarily located in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works. In the near future, it will be expanded to solicit members in order to promote the prosperity of the society's affairs.

### A Brief Overview of the Chinese Institute of Engineers

The Chinese Institute of Engineers has its headquarters at No. 3, Lane 517, Middle Zhengzheng Road, Shanghai. It is the only national organization for young engineers in our country, dedicated to national construction, promoting technical education, advancing academic research, and seeking common welfare. It was initially formed in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], when engineers in enemy-occupied areas, resolved not to yield to the invaders, gathered more than 30 people. They secretly communicated and, under the guise of a Chinese Science Society gathering, called themselves the "Extracurricular Friendship Society." Taking care to avoid the enemy's suspicion, the group had grown to over 400 members by the time of the surrender. In the 35th year of the Republic [1946], with the restoration of our land, it was renamed as it is now. Then, expanding its affairs and raising funds, the headquarters were established within a year. To date, the membership has reached over 800. Our association has been working diligently and practically to promote its work, such as establishing industrial lectures and engineering magazines, and the Chinese Technical Vocational School, to advance technical education (to help promote and popularize technical education); such as initiating the Shanghai Brewing Factory, organizing consumer cooperatives, and holding industrial tours to seek welfare for members; other activities include hosting the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition at the Ningbo Association and participating in hosting the Chinese Export Goods Exhibition, sparing no effort to develop the association. This is a record. (Yu Shiyuan)

### A Brief History of the Chinese Society of Power Engineering

Power engineering is closely related to specialized technologies such as electrical machinery and civil engineering. Its nature is comprehensive and cannot be fully encompassed by any single academic organization mentioned above. Relevant individuals had proposed the establishment of an organization before the war. In June of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], a founding conference was held in Chongqing, with the aim of studying power engineering academics and promoting the development of power engineering. Pan Mingxin, Chen Zhongxi, Zhang Jiazhi, Chen Zuguang, and Chai Zhiming were elected as directors to advance the association's affairs. With the arrival of victory, members were stationed in various regions, engaged in restoration and construction work. It was decided to establish branches in important industrial areas. The Shanghai branch was established on December 29th of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], and the Xiwu branch (Wuxi and Changzhou area) was established on April 19th of the 36th year of the Republic [1947]. Xu Xin, Ba Rongquan, Qing Zou, Hong Ji, etc. were elected as directors. Branches in Beiping [Beijing] and other places are also being planned. In February of the 36th year of the Republic [1947], the general association re-elected Chen Zhongxi, Chen Zuguang, Zhao Zengjue, Pan Mingxin, and Zhang Jiazhe as executive directors, and Xian Ti, Lu Fazeng as executive supervisors. The association's affairs are progressing, with the general association constantly encouraging branches in various regions to advance together and preparing to publish a periodical to introduce the latest developments in power engineering abroad, as well as reporting on various domestic power engineering developments. Branches in various regions hold regular meetings to exchange academic information and jointly study and resolve various power engineering issues.

### A Word of Commemoration for Engineers' Day

— Ouyang Lun

Our country has celebrated Engineers' Day since the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. At that time, due to the war of resistance, transportation to the rear areas was cut off, resources were scarce, and all levels of society regarded industrial construction and production as the only important tasks. The position of engineers was valued by the general public, and the status and reputation of engineers rose like the morning sun. Engineers themselves knew to work hard and diligently. Major projects that were不敢尝试before the war, requiring foreign talent, could now be shouldered and quickly completed by our engineers. Items that could not be manufactured domestically before the war, which factories were hesitant to produce, could now be ingeniously and successfully imitated to meet urgent needs in the difficult wartime environment. Equipment and materials essential for daily operations in industry, mining, and transportation, which were completely dependent on imports before the war and could not be manufactured due to equipment limitations, could now be replaced with various substitutes to cope with the situation. Significant contributions were made during the eight years of resistance against Japan. Starting from the 27th year of the Republic [1938], annual meetings were held in Chongqing, Minming, Chengdu, Guiyang, Lanzhou, Guilin, and other places, with local governments and communities vying to welcome and warmly receive them. During the conferences, urgent and critical engineering problems of the local area were submitted for discussion, demonstrating the high expectations and trust that the people of the country placed in engineers. As large-scale construction work begins in the future, with all undertakings to be restored, the weight of the heavy burden will fall on our shoulders. On this Engineers' Day, I offer my humble suggestions as follows:

The fate of China and the industrial construction plan both list the number of technical personnel needed in the future, but how many technical personnel does the country actually have? There is no accurate statistic from public or private organizations. Before the war of resistance, the Resources Committee conducted a widespread survey, but only found over 10,000 people. The technician registrations conducted by the pre-war Ministry of Industry and the wartime Economic Department totaled only several thousand people. During the war, the Central Design Bureau conducted a survey, but no statistical figures were ever released. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], the Ministry of Education compiled statistics based on the number of graduates from university engineering departments and secondary vocational schools, estimating about 20,000 senior personnel and about 50,000 to 60,000 intermediate personnel. However, students studying abroad and technical personnel trained by factories themselves were not included. As construction begins in the future, more talent will be needed, and training and cultivation must be carried out to fill the gap. How many personnel do we already have? How many are in each category? How many are engaged in private business? How many serve in government agencies? How many have changed careers? How many are still unemployed? Our intelligence is not inferior; it depends on proper utilization. For the sake of advance planning, it seems appropriate for government agencies and private organizations to work together to conduct a widespread survey, without omissions, for the country's reference. My fellow engineers should also strive to cooperate. Any survey forms should be filled out and submitted truthfully. If they are regarded as insignificant and ignored, then it will be difficult for this work to succeed.

The areas of work for our engineering personnel generally include transportation, industrial and mining enterprises, government agencies, educational institutions, and practicing engineers who serve society. The latter is an absolute minority, and it can be concluded that civil engineering and architecture account for the majority of this small number, while mechanical, electrical, chemical, and textile engineering are few. The difference from countries such as Britain and the United States cannot be overstated. The reason for this is that society does not pay enough attention to them, and our own efforts are insufficient. In the future, public and private construction will be carried out simultaneously, and industrial and mining enterprises will develop rapidly. The construction of new factories, the improvement of management methods, the increase of production efficiency, and the solution of engineering problems will all come one after another. There will inevitably be a large demand for self-employed consulting engineers. Furthermore, the Patent Law has already been promulgated by the government and will soon be implemented. Agents serving inventors, such as lawyers and accountants, will take on their responsibilities, but our engineers are also indispensable members. Judging from the large number of invention patent cases in countries such as Britain and the United States, the affairs must be very complicated. This is an area where we should pay close attention to serving in the future.

The Chinese Institute of Engineers has been established for more than 30 years and has achieved remarkable results and a long history. However, government agencies have always regarded it as an academic organization, and there are few opportunities to participate in elections at all levels of representative bodies. My fellow engineers should also regard this as a regrettable matter. However, upon closer examination, the crux of the problem is not difficult to understand. Lawyers serve to protect human rights, so the government has enacted the Lawyers Law. Accountants serve to audit assets and profits and losses, so the government has promulgated the Accountants Law. Engineers serve society, and their impact is significant, affecting private property in small matters and public safety in large matters. The relationship cannot be underestimated. However, the lack of specific legislation to protect their legal status has led to them not being valued. Furthermore, according to the procedures for technicians to practice, they must first apply to the Examination Yuan's Examination Committee for examination. After passing the examination, they must obtain a registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs before finally applying to the local competent authority to practice. The so-called examination is only a review of qualifications, and the so-called registration is only the issuance of a certificate. There are no explicit provisions regarding the service, methods, responsibilities, rights, and obligations of technicians. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has long recognized this, and I have also collected and consulted various materials in preparation for drafting a trial version. Unfortunately, due to repeated delays, I have not been able to achieve success. For the sake of the future interests of our engineering profession, it seems that we must plan for this as soon as possible. I sincerely hope that my fellow engineers will work together to propose opinions for the reference of the competent authorities.

The above is what I have felt and thought of at the moment. I dare not present excessively high-sounding arguments. I only present the efforts that we ourselves should make and present them for the instruction of experts!

### The Current Responsibility of Engineers in Our Country

— Zhou Zixu

Since the Opium War in 1842, the economic structure of our country, originally based on small-scale agriculture and family handicrafts, has been gradually destroyed to the point of collapse. Between 1865 and 1870, the Jiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai, the Fuzhou Shipyard, and the Tianjin Machine Factory were successively established, further promoting the transformation of our country's economic construction into a new phase. At this time, the word "engineer" began to give society a brand new impression.

Definition of Engineer

However, under the traditional concept of "that which is above form is called the Way; that which is below form is called the instrument," engineers are generally regarded as merely more skilled machine artisans. Another incorrect view is that engineers are merely copying Western methods of installing, operating, and repairing machinery, and that they are merely a necessary tool for capitalists. Although this view elevates the importance of engineers, it can also be said to be a not insignificant insult to engineers.

The initial impression of this term among Europeans and Americans was quite similar to that in our country. In English dictionaries, the definition of the word "engineer" is merely a draftsman, designer, supervisor, or operator of static or dynamic machines. In fact, these definitions do not encompass the meaning that the word "engineer" should have. The definition of an engineer should be "one who possesses the ability to direct progress and control the implementation of methods based on scientific principles."

During the course of this World War, due to the lack of raw materials and the limitations of tools, industries in various countries, for the sake of production, sought to overcome their difficulties in an environment where various objective conditions were not available. The status of engineers was rapidly enhanced. After the end of the war, because of the necessity of restoration and reconstruction, engineers became even more needed. Therefore, today's engineers, it is no exaggeration to say, have a sense of superiority. How to exert this sense of superiority is something that engineers themselves should be aware of, and society should have a universal re-recognition of. This is precisely what this article specifically puts forward and hopes that everyone will discuss together.

The result of our country's victory in the War of Resistance this time, on the one hand, proves the achievements of our country's inherent culture in national morality, but on the other hand, it also proves the indelible and brilliant efficacy of modern science. The practical and organizational efficacy of science can not only be applied to natural materials, but also to social order. This is the crystallization of Western civilization and is urgently needed by modern China. Our engineers should be at the forefront of shouldering this burden, penetrating the most important department of the revival enterprise—the production sector—and exerting their skills.

In order to achieve this main task, and to conform to the definition of an engineer, the steps that should be taken should be considered. Now I will divide it into two aspects: the group and the individual.

Engineer Group Organization

Regarding the group aspect, in theory, of course, the power of the group is greater than that of the individual. Engineers should break away from our country's traditional thinking, gather together, and organize, on the one hand, to expand the solicitation, and on the other hand, to strictly screen, which is what must be done now.

With a group that is substantial and pure, it can then exert the power of the group to achieve its predetermined task. There is also an important factor, which is to strengthen unity. In our country, where emphasis is placed on the individual over the group, most people do not like to participate in group activities. They think this is superfluous, 間的, and even think that it is for the success of a certain person, and sacrifices themselves. In addition, there is another erroneous view, even after participating in group activities, there is often a tradition of factionalism and regionalism. Since engineers are responsible for applying the practical and effective organization of science to social order, then the first step must be to improve their own organization.

The engineer group must have a creed. This creed is the full realization of the definition of an engineer—"one who possesses the ability to direct progress and control the implementation of methods based on scientific principles." Eternal life beyond time, space, and party affiliation.

Secondly, based on the creed, the group can replace the various members and express its position. When an engineer handles his business, its nature is twofold. On the one hand, it seeks a high degree of progress in the quality of production for the factory; on the other hand, it seeks convenience and safety in all aspects of the work process for the workers. Therefore, the engineer's position is absolutely neutral between labor and capital. This should be necessary to declare.

The above five points—expanding the organization, strictly screening, strengthening unity, announcing the creed, and declaring the position—are all about the group aspect. The following will talk about the individual aspect. Due to space limitations, the issue of responsibility will be discussed in detail in the next article.

Spring and Autumn

### The Recent British Theater Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Last May, a group of Americans went to the New Theatre in London to visit. Recently, Laurence Olivier of that theater went to the United States. This American acting troupe performed Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" in London. This is an excellent acting troupe, but the box office was mediocre. The reason for the failure has nothing to do with the playwright or the actors. The most important thing is that British tastes today are different from before. For example, what Wilder writes about is survival, reproduction, and death. He uses the people of Grovers Corners to make philosophical reflections. Such imagination has never been seen in the British publishing industry after the war. Britain today does not focus on these kinds of life questions. Europe is currently facing many difficult problems and cannot have metaphysical dreams. It is as if there is an iron curtain to prevent the easternization of thought. Philosophy is no longer fashionable. What the average Briton likes is what appeals to the eyes and ears. British audiences always thought that the acting troupe from the richest America should have magnificent sets, but they were greatly disappointed to see only a few tables, chairs, and parasols. This conclusion is foolish, and it is probably created by preconceived notions?

What is performed in London is very different. The greatest success is romantic historical dramas, which win with costumes and colors. Except for the Old Vic, Olivier, and Richardson performing Shakespeare's historical plays, almost all of them play with the colors of costumes. The most beautiful costume success was the performance of Oscar Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan." In addition, audiences also like the color and musicality of language, such as the verse play "The Way to the Tomb."

The Dadlers Wells Theatre was revived in August 1945 and often stages British dance dramas. This theater was built in 1760. In February of last year, the Coveut Garden Theatre also reopened, which is also a memorable event. This Royal Opera House was converted into a dance hall for soldiers during the war, but fortunately it was not destroyed by the enemy. The red velvet seats and pink lampshades are still intact. Walking on the grand staircase during the intermission gives one a temporary illusion that peace has begun.

These two opera houses can be said to be full every night. Londoners are very welcome to have operas and dances from Paris, the United States, and Java staged there.

In the near future, it will probably be felt that the beauty of Shakespeare's historical plays and "Sleeping Beauty" is inappropriate?

Sketches of Flowers and Plants

### Love of the Pomegranate Flower

— Yao Yu

In May, pomegranate flowers bloom red throughout Jiangnan.

Time passes quietly, and the wheels of the times are constantly turning. How can I, a child living in a silent and colorless world, not cheer for this crimson fire!?

In the dark night, I need a lamp to illuminate me. In the harsh winter, I need a fire to warm me. In the deep autumn, I need a fallen leaf to accompany me. But deep in my soul! I need a torch of life even more.

To make life meaningful, you have to fight! If you cannot understand the meaning of fighting, you will never be able to understand the meaning of life.

The martyrs are sleeping forever. Jesus was nailed to the cross and died. But time will not dilute human memory, and the hot blood shed by the martyrs will always be vivid in the hearts of millions of people. Although "Stealing Fire" is a myth, the spirit of Prometheus is eternally worshiped and praised by the world.

So, I love "fire", I love "blood", I love "pomegranate flowers" that have the same colors as fire and blood.

I am very attached to pomegranate flowers! For "life", for "life". …

Pomegranate flower—a poem written in blood, a banner made of fire, a song belonging to young people.

I remember very clearly that it was the year when the pomegranate flowers outside the wall burned red the sky that I left my hometown for the first time and went to a distant place. …

Yuli · Tsuta

— Yu Shi

When the white florets of remembrance wither, I am in love with a Yuli trellis in the garden.

Some moonlit nights I have lingered among the flowers, counting the stars in the sky and fantasizing; perhaps weaving a dream close to scarlet, at that time I was placing my love on the girl in the next garden's building. Who is the girl who is playing this melancholy parting song, telling endless grievances in this long night? So I seek the person in the dark, and my longing is like a fallen flower abandoned in the soil.

It seemed as if the lonely and miserable Yuli trembled, breaking off the thread of my thoughts, and shattering the dream of the bright moon; so I went back to my room sadly, arranged my night's schedule, and thought to myself that I was already middle-aged!

But, no, I am still tasting my own youth, entrusting my years to the ruthless water...

It should be the season when Tsuta climb up the small wooden window, but here there are no green ranks, so I miss the deserted garden in my hometown.

In spring, they crawl out of the black fertile soil; and in the long summer, they climb up the small wooden window, peeking at my desk, stealing kisses from the small water pot on my desk.

I treasured them dearly, remembering with gratitude the piece of their kindness that came to visit me with dew-laden branches. They grew green at the foot of the wall, decorating the colors of the ugly earthen wall, until the autumn wind filled the garden.

Now, the deserted garden in my hometown is desolate. The small wooden window has lost its place, and what about Tsuta? Let the sigh be buried in the memories of the past.

### Roses

— Chu Pinliang

Early in the morning, Xiumei picked a few roses from the garden. The color of the roses was purplish red, very bright.

She put them in a vase on the desk. At the same time, she took one out and gave it to me.

I was happy to accept it, so I reached out to take it, but my hand immediately retracted, wincing in pain. But Xiumei just giggled beside me and said:

"Brother, these roses have thorns."

I wanted to blame her unhappily.

"It's not my fault!"

Yes, the thorns are pricking my hand, what's the point of blaming others.

### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

Yu Yonghe of Renhe wrote "A Record of Collecting Sulfur," a kind of diary recording his service in Taiwan. The Keelung and Tamsui areas of Taiwan produce sulfur. Besides daily records of sulfur mining, the book details the mountains, rivers, dangers, terrains, strategic locations, customs of the indigenous people, and local conditions of the entire island. It is a useful work akin to Zhen Luliang's "An Occasional Record of the Beginning and End of Taiwan" and Lan Luzhou's "A Brief Account of Pacifying Taiwan." The book contains many poems. Here are a few verses about the indigenous people: "Tattooing is an old custom, with island shapes coiling on their backs. Sometimes they transform into leopards, with snake gods and bull demons fiercely grimacing." "Their chests and backs are covered in colorful patterns down to their waists, boasting of intricate brocades that surpass fine silk. Their jade-like skin and wrists are entirely tattooed, only their eyebrows are left untouched." "Fringes covering their foreheads and eyebrows resemble wandering monks, indistinguishable between men and women. In the evening, female companions bathe in the stream, a line of bodies splashing in the green waves." "Old men resemble women, and women resemble men, with no distinction between them. They pluck all facial hair, their beards and mustaches making them look like women."

Hu Zhu, known as "Gu Yu" (Ancient Fool) of the Yuan Dynasty, styled himself as the "Pure White Old Man." His poems are refined, opulent, elegant, and stately, completely devoid of frivolous or dissolute airs. His Song of the Pine and Cypress in the Cold Season begins with: "The painter does not paint the enchanting and flamboyant myriad red flowers of Luoyang, but paints the tall pines on Mount Emei;" and "He does not paint the lonely mountain with its oblique and scattered white plum blossoms, but paints the ancient cypress in front of Zhuge Liang's temple." His poetry is vigorous, resembling the works of Tang Dynasty poets. Wu Cheng's inscription on "Gu Yu's Poetic Selection" states: "Like sprouts emerging in late spring, or summer bamboo holding buds, after being nourished by dew and washed by rain, it is fragrant and alluring, delicately beautiful." This is true for both his five- and seven-character ancient and modern style poems, certainly not an exaggeration. Gu Yu personally compiled "Drafts of the Pure White Studio," but the volumes were scattered due to military unrest. What remains today is a re-edited and published version by his sixth-generation descendant, Huai.

The Pure White Old Man inscribed on Guo Tianxi's landscape painting: "Perilous peaks, thousands of feet high, emerald and verdant, resemble the grass hut of Kuang Lu. I hear the recluse is not to be summoned, as purple lingzhi mushrooms exhale fragrance in the warm spring and white clouds drift." Guo Tianxi's given name was Bi, styled Youzhi, and called Yunshan. He was from Dantu in the Yuan Dynasty. Skilled in calligraphy and painting, he studied calligraphy with Zhao Mengfu and mastered his style. Zhao Mengfu wrote a postscript after writing Songxue Ji, praising him profusely. His paintings of gnarled trees, bamboo, and rocks are full of natural charm. I wonder if what the Pure White Old Man inscribed is still extant in the world.

Brushes used for calligraphy and painting are a great achievement. Changli (Han Yu) wrote a biography of Mao Hao, recounting his lineage, titles, merits, and honors in particular detail, praising his elegant style. Recently, I saw an inscription by Hu Zhu, which stated that the way of his advancement and retreat, from beginning to end, aligns with people. The inscription reads: "Internally firm, externally accommodating, its use never ceases. Initially sharp, ultimately blunt, defeated by ink. Wielding it in your grasp, as your will dictates. Heaven's bounty, the Stone Canal, commendable are your great achievements. The bone structure of Yan Zhenqing and the sinews of Liu Gongquan, the mind upholds righteousness. Writing is not merely writing, truly embodies virtue."

Zhao Zhongmu's calligraphy skillfully inherited the family learning of Songxue. However, his poems and lyrics are rarely circulated. Those occasionally seen in scrolls are just single lines and brief phrases. Wang Tianliang of Wucheng possessed Zhao Yong's handwritten manuscripts with subtle inscriptions, which are the basis for the current "Collection of the Studio Knowing No Satisfaction." Zhongyong's poems and lyrics are clear and beautiful, such as his Butterfly Loves Flowers tune: "Her complexion is like a flower, her skin like snow, her charming eyes convey waves, secret intentions whispered low. After removing the knotted belt, sorrow remains unresolved, reluctant to part with such deep affection. After parting, longing grows ever stronger, on a future reunion, the flower in the mirror will be hard to pluck. The fragrant smoke of the precious seal fades, marital ties gradually wane, the jade flute plays a mournful tune under the twilight moon." His Water Melody Song tune goes: "Why does spring depart so hastily? Spring departs, yet the chill remains. The ground is covered with fallen flowers and fragrant grass, gradually feeling the green shade thicken. The desires of horse hooves and carriage dust, the years pass by with the ebb and flow of heat and cold, bustling for more than ten years. I have won the old age of my ruddy face, forsaking the beautiful forests and springs.

A precious saddle, golden reins, jade whip. In an instant, ambition is achieved, and dazzling splendor fills the eyes. Merit and fame come without intention, wealth and honor are but fleeting clouds, of no use to me! I entrust everything to a laugh, let not the wine cup be emptied." These verses contain a sense of the rise and fall of dynasties and the emotions of family, subtly implied within.

"The green mountains do not rush after the flowing river, several shades of emerald gather at the edge of the forest after the rain. The fisherman's hut is far and blurred, the smoky village is half visible and half hidden. Da Chi (Huang Gongwang) wields his drunken ink, vying with autumn for the azure sky, cleansing the dust of silks and gauze, a nest for disorderly clouds." This is Wang Guoqi's inscription on Huang Da Chi's painting scroll. Guoqi, styled Delian, was from Wuxing. He excelled in contemporary Yuefu poetry. His lyrical style was elegant and unrestrained, pure as jade and clear as ice. Now his name is forgotten, and those who write about Wuxing rarely mention him, which is truly lamentable.

### The Season When Azaleas Bloom

— Li Yutian

He left on a dim morning,

A season when azaleas bloom all over the hillsides.

Before he left, he said: Let everything be arranged by fate,

Perhaps next year, when the azaleas bloom, I will return—

The days pass silently like water,

Slipping away, a year, two years...

Now, it is the season when azaleas bloom again,

But he has not returned, nor is there any news....

### Rubbing of a Han White Horse

— Collection of Xu Weinan

### Willow Catkins

— Hu Mu

Willow catkins float all over my way back.

I smell the fragrance emitted by the white willow catkins.

I live in a deep, secluded green forest, a small scarlet building, ochre-colored windows, and sea-green curtains...

From the window, I see the willow catkins fluttered by the morning breeze; the white willow catkins, the pure willow catkins...

I have the heart to cherish those snowy white willow catkins, but I do not like their lack of firm will, floating aimlessly and falling arbitrarily.

When she leans weakly against my purple window with her pale hands, picking green branches and leaves, I tell stories of my childhood wanderings, until her embroidered colorful skirt is covered with scattered fallen flowers...

Ah, my story of suffering and drifting! I could not finish it in three days and three nights.

### Ode to Dreams

— Qian Fanfu

I am an ordinary person, and I have so many unattainable loves and desires. But dreams are the closest to everyone, so I have fallen in love with dreams.

It is also a loyal friend, attending to you with utmost care, heeding the commands of your emotions, giving you complete comfort, driving away your frustrations and worries.

So I cannot leave it. A dreamless night is equal to a sleepless night.

If you still hate it for deceiving you once, I should defend it. This kind of deception is well-intentioned and harmless. I ask you, where in life is there a true realm?

### Mark Twain

— Yang Shi

When the American writer Mark Twain was traveling in Europe, a British person stopped his carriage and complained: "Mr. Twain, I would rather pay ten pounds than read your Huckleberry Finn (Twain's famous fairy tale)." Twain was so surprised that he could not say a word, with his eyes wide open. The British person then laughed and said: "This makes me experience the joy of reading it for the first time again."

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 527

— Ye Jingfeng

Judging from Zishan's explanation, Shouyi and Hejian entered the bandit den only ten minutes or so after the four mischievous individuals finished their work. Apparently, when the sentries of the bandit nest returned, they discovered that Pingzi had been rescued, and chaos immediately erupted. They fired their guns randomly to boost morale and activated the sirens. This was nothing, but perhaps with such actions, they could fabricate rumors when reporting back to their superiors, to excuse their responsibility. This was a fixed method used by Japanese invaders when they encountered failure.

After Shouyi and Hejian finished observing the den, they gathered the mobilized personnel from all sides and explained what they had seen. Li Ming and the others felt that the two dens in Fahua and West Shanghai only confined two military training students, yet it took a lot of effort to destroy the dens. This situation seemed more serious. How could it be handled so lightly and successfully? They feared that things were not so simple and that there might be further developments. So they agreed to reassemble and temporarily break up into smaller groups, each returning to its base to await further news.

This time, Bai Ren Zhuang dispatched eleven people, and Fahua and West Shanghai dispatched six people to help Li Ming and Han Fang's men with their tasks. The four mischievous individuals should have waited for everyone to gather at the Bund before splitting up to attack Hongzhen. But they still insisted on being mischievous to the end, completing the task first. This style of work was originally inappropriate, but because they had succeeded every time before, even Xiaozhuang could not cope with them. It was not until the Japanese launched the Shanghai Battle on August 13th that Shouyi's elder brother, Yubai, and the five masterminds feared that these mischievous individuals would make mistakes. Then they asked the elder Mingjue from Xiaozhuang to set strict rules, and only then did they stay within bounds.

Hejian sat in the car, still feeling uneasy. He asked Shouyi to find a way to call Bai Ren Zhuang to inquire about the whereabouts of the four mischievous young ladies and the latest news about Pingzi. Zheng Yan said, "There will be public phones available when we get to the Bund. It's too late, and even though there are some places to borrow a phone along this route in Hongkou, it's ultimately inconvenient..."

This move was also anticipated by the four mischievous individuals. They had already made calls to the Grand Hotel, the Wansui Hall, and Bai Ren Zhuang, saying that the "play" had been completed and the results were very satisfactory. They asked Shouyi and the others to go to Bai Ren Zhuang for a "celebration."

At midnight, the elder Mingjue of Bai Ren Zhuang felt that Qingmu's mysterious circle was still somewhat playful, and was reliable yet not entirely reliable. Such actions to thwart the Japanese invaders' secret plans to launch a major invasion were of utmost importance. How could one rely solely on hypnosis and mentalism to plan such a grand strategy? So the old man divided the problem into two approaches:

The first approach was to let Pingzi continue to explore "mental transmission" according to what she had learned from Qingmu. At the same time, the elder Mingjue himself also applied mentalism in his own quiet room, "adding tallies to old games" to test whether it was effective. If a response occurred, he would compare the results with Pingzi's information to see if they were the same.

The second, more practical approach was for the five masterminds of Bai Ren Zhuang, along with Hejian Zhengyan and Shouyi, to carefully consider the secret communications collected by Hejian's side and the current situation, and then develop a practical plan of action. Zhengyan also prepared to take several minutes to run back to the telecommunications department to collect the secret messages received before midnight.

### Visiting Mei Lanfang (1)

— Feng Zikai

Soon after returning to Shanghai after the war, I asked a friend to introduce me to Mr. Mei Lanfang. The next day, someone wrote about it in the "Free Talk" section of the Shen Bao and published a photo of him and me. I have long wanted to write an account of this visit myself. But because the meaning was profound and the words were deep, I hesitated several times. Tonight, the sound of the plum rain pattering against the window, and the silver light illuminating the wall, make for a good night to express my feelings. I cannot help but briefly describe my thoughts.

Visiting the famous Mr. Mei Lanfang was the first time in my life that I took the initiative to visit someone I did not know. Friends and relatives in Jiangnan, from whom I had been separated for ten years, might think that I had spent ten years wandering in the interior and had become a "opera fan" upon returning, and went to support the "King of Actors" immediately. But that is not the case at all. During my ten years of exile, my heart remained pure, and I remained a believer in art and religion. My love for Peking Opera is driven by my artistic heart, and my visit to Mei Lanfang is driven by my religious heart. This is truly a profound meaning, and one cannot be persuaded without reading the entire article.

My love for Peking Opera began a few years before the war, when the Green Edge Hall was newly built. We built a new house and bought a new phonograph. Most of the records were Western music, with a few Mei Lanfang records bought as decorations. Because during the May Fourth Movement, many people opposed Peking Opera and wanted to overthrow it, I read their articles and found them reasonable, and from then on, I looked down on Peking Opera. Unexpectedly, the Peking Opera music on the phonograph gradually attracted people, and I eventually stopped buying Western music records and only bought Peking Opera records, especially Mei Lanfang's records. It turned out that what the May Fourth intellectuals opposed was the decadent content of Peking Opera that contained feudal toxins, while what I loved was the exaggerated, symbolic, and clear form of Peking Opera—its music and acting. Western music is "harmonic," while Eastern music is "melodic." Peking Opera music fully embodies the characteristics of "melodic music." Just look: it has no harmony, no accompaniment (the huqin is only an accompanying instrument), and it does not even have minor scales or semitones. It relies solely on the seven notes of the major scale (do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti) to express various personalities such as Qingyi, Laosheng, and Hualian. Therefore, even if one is not familiar with the plot or understands the lyrics, one can still know the identity, character, and general outline of the plot from the music. It can be inferred that when the authors originally created these Xipi and Erhuang tunes, they must have had an unusually full understanding of the flavors of life, and at the same time, they must have had an unusually keen genius for describing music. Thus, they could extract the essence of various personalities such as virtuous mothers, good wives, loyal ministers, filial sons, brutes, and villains, and use exaggerated and symbolic musical descriptions to create refined and clear melodies that have been passed down unbroken to this day. Before the war, my love for Peking Opera was limited to sound, that is, I focused solely on its musical aspects. Therefore, I did not go to theaters, but specialized in collecting records. Most of the hundred or so records collected by the Green Edge Hall were sung by Mei Lanfang. In the winter of 1937, these records and the Green Edge Hall were destroyed together. After the victory, I replaced them, and now they are almost complete.

Free Talk

### Jiao Da and Liu Si

— Qiren

Scolding people should not just be a venting of anger. Besides venting, it must also have an educational purpose, only then will the meaning of scolding not be wasted.

Currently, because there are too many things that are unsatisfactory, everyone cannot hold back their anger and scold each other. It is not surprising, but if one only scolds, scolding until one is dazed and disoriented, it will backfire. Like the general populace often mentions in their writings, scolding Jiao Da in the Grand View Garden. After three cups of wine, his temper flares up, and he exposes the ugliness of his masters to his heart's content, saying that in the Grand View Garden, inside and out, there is nothing clean except for the two stone lions at the gate. It cannot be said that his words are wrong, but we do not want people today to have Jiao Da's attitude of venting and being done with it. Because people today are in the position of masters, not slaves, and are absolutely different from Jiao Da.

What we expect from those in the position of masters is that everyone should rather be Liu Si than Jiao Da. The Old Book of Tang records the story of Liu Ziyi:

"Liu Ziyi was intolerant of wrongdoing and directly pointed out people's shortcomings. His friend Li Boyao often said: 'Even though Liu Si scolds people, people do not hate him.'"

How could Liu Si achieve such a position? Because he was confident that he would not be scolded by others in the future after scolding them today. His scolding was completely out of good intentions, containing the utmost sincerity and reason for education. Those who listened to his scolding were not only willing but also happy to follow him. This is much better than Jiao Da's abuse, which, besides being smeared with a mouthful of horse manure, has no other gain. It seems much wiser.

Everyone should strive to learn from Liu Si's behavior and no longer regard themselves as Jiao Da. Although Jiao Da had also made great contributions to protecting the old master, he should not act like a drunk madman, only seeking temporary pleasure. He should think about the consequences and not make venting his ultimate goal.

Both the scolder and the scolded can start from love and reach the point of "not hating." This is what we sincerely hope for.

### Refusing a Loan

— Liu Meng

Many countries in Europe and Asia after the war hope to get help from abroad, but the King of Yemen simply refused other people's help.

Cairo, French News Agency, 2nd: "The capital of Yemen reports that King Iman of Yemen has refused the loan offered by the United States, on the grounds that this move would place Yemen's resources in the hands of Americans." Can we say that Iman is stubborn? Can we say he is ungrateful? Judging from the reasons for his refusal, it is not a rash and reckless move. His self-confidence seems very strong, feeling that there is no need to use the power of others to solve his own problems. The name of this country, Yemen, is too unfamiliar. Perhaps it does not have a significant relationship. We rarely see its name in the newspapers, and its situation is not very clear. But it can be asserted that he must have a "problem" at this stage, so someone "offered a loan." However, Iman resolutely refused it.

In our country, there are people who do not have enough to wear, do not have enough to eat, and even commit suicide because they cannot live. The scene of Lihua is still visible everywhere. This luxurious scene cannot cover up the tragic situation of the economic crisis, but makes this situation more sharply exposed. Therefore, there are many "problems." If someone gives us help at this time, we will of course welcome it. However, distant water cannot put out a nearby fire, so at this National Assembly, someone shouted out the emergency solution of "those with money contribute money," and someone also proposed the suggestion of "requisitioning large amounts of private idle capital." We do not have Iman's courage to refuse others from thousands of miles away, but the suggestions of the gentlemen of the National Assembly need to be supported. We not only express our support in the "newspaper bottom," but also hope that the government can implement this suggestion.

### Gratitude in Abundance

Five hundred atomic bombs can destroy the whole world

——Los Angeles, United Press Agency, someone said this at the closing session of the Atomic Energy Conference.

How fierce the atomic bomb is! The Hiroshima seedling appears. The islanders escape the disaster, feeling cold in their hearts!

Five hundred bombs thrown into the world, everyone is finished! Everyone is finished! Only heroes remain, triumphing beyond the heavens?

Note, the word "triumphing" is a pun.

### The English King's Tea Party

— Ye Lin

King George and Queen Elizabeth held a tea party at Buckingham Palace in London the other day, entertaining five thousand guests. This is a major event in British social circles, and everyone is proud to be invited. But what made the tea party so enjoyable was not the rich food and luxurious decorations, but just a cup of tea, a piece of cake, and the light and delightful music played by the band.

As a monarch, to entertain five thousand honored guests with such simple refreshments would be considered an extraordinary act of negligence in the East. If an ordinary person were to entertain guests in this way, they would be despised as stingy. But the King and Queen of England entertained their guests in this way. Here, we cannot assume the poverty of the royal family, because the King and Queen of England could fully afford to entertain guests luxuriously.

Here, there is a profound meaning contained.

This meaning is to tell the British people to be thrifty and to promote post-war recovery through thrift.

When we read the report of this tea party, what we thought of was that Britain is maintaining its democratic system with the civilian identity of its monarch. Before the law, the King and Queen of England are the most exemplary citizens who abide by the law. During the war, they received clothing ration coupons like ordinary people and got the same purchase points. After the war, they also responded to the Labour Party cabinet's call for thrift.

Looking back at ourselves, in our country, the common social customs are to flaunt luxury and extravagance to dazzle people, to flaunt luxury and extravagance to gain face. The extravagance of thousands of people is built on the poverty of hundreds of millions of people. Especially the upper classes are indulging in endless singing and dancing all year round, with garden parties and cocktail parties, with a little tea and a cup of wine.

### Congratulations to the Theatrical Community's Grand Gathering

— Fengyun

I heard that the Audience Performance Company will also withdraw from the Lafayette Theatre at the end of June. After that, apart from the Lyceum Theatre, which can be borrowed occasionally, there will be no other theaters available for performing dramas.

Now, the eleven drama groups in Shanghai have decided to use the Haiguang Theatre as their permanent performance venue. In the face of such difficulties in borrowing theaters, we should congratulate all the drama groups in Shanghai, because they now have a common theater for performances.

The names of these eleven drama groups are: Shanghai Drama Arts Society, China Drama Arts Society, China Performing Arts Society, Shanghai Experimental Drama Society, New China Drama Society, Audience Performance Company, Municipal Drama School, Zhongwan Drama Troupe, Post Office Workers' Drama Troupe, Children's Drama Troupe, etc. The first performance will be the historical drama "The Peach Blossom Fan" by Ouyang Yuqian, presented by the New China Drama Society, scheduled to officially open on the 11th, with a dress rehearsal on the evening of the 10th to entertain people from all walks of life.

Finally, I hope that the drama community will unite, work together, and strive for Chinese drama, and strive for the movement of Chinese culture!

### Chronicle of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

Feifei was being helped by a female troupe member, leaning next to the wicker chair imitating her mother, weeping with tears in her eyes, and several people coaxed her with sweets, but it was useless.

Lan勉qiang opened her eyes, glared at her, and wanted to say a lot to her, but the people on the station were so noisy that she really did not have the strength to raise her voice.

"Feifei, be a good girl, don't cry! In two or three days, you can be with your mother again!" The female troupe member helped to persuade.

"I'm afraid, I'm afraid... I won't see Mom again..." The seven-year-old girl unexpectedly said something ominous.

Zhu Zhaonian happened to be pulling Zhang Chang over. Hearing Feifei say this, he also felt very unhappy. He hurriedly bent down, held her mouth with his hand, and whispered in her ear: "Don't say that, Feifei, if you say that, Mommy and Uncle Zhu will not like you!"

But the child started crying even louder.

"Miss Zhu, please take her away for a while." Zhu Zhaonian, at a loss for what to do, could only use a coercive means to ask the female troupe member to take Feifei away immediately.

Lan silently sighed a breath.

Zhu Zhaonian wanted to say a few words of comfort to Lan, but amidst a burst of noise, the four drivers, who were roaring and wielding the power of life and death, had issued the order to start the cars. Who dared to delay? The four cars immediately became a mess. The young Zhang Chang also began to panic. He also wanted to bravely rush forward, but immediately thought that he was traveling with a seriously ill female, and then stopped and looked back at Zhu Zhaonian, wanting to wait for him to decide.
