### Government Decides to Purchase Unlicensed Imported Goods with Foreign Exchange, Payment to be Cleared in Six Installments Over Three Years

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] In the administrative meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 14th, a decision has been made regarding the handling of Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange. The key points are as follows: This batch of goods will be purchased by the government at the original price in foreign exchange, with payment divided into six installments, one installment every half year, to be cleared in three years. In addition, a profit of 10% on the original price (calculated in US dollars) will be added, and converted into legal tender based on the Central Bank's listed market price. Expenses such as dock rent, insurance fees, and harbor dues for the arrived goods shall be borne by the government. The cargo owner is exempt from customs duties.

[Regular Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] The Executive Yuan passed the "Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving and Shipped Without Permits" on the 14th. The original text is as follows: Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving and Shipped Without Permits. Any self-provided foreign exchange goods without permits, not on the list of prohibited imports, that have already arrived at the port or were shipped from abroad before August 16 of this year, and have been registered in accordance with the order, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. Goods shipped from abroad after August 16 up to September 30 may be allowed to provide documents and re-register. The goods mentioned in the preceding article, with the exception of machinery and equipment in Appendices 1 and 3A for which users pay themselves, shall be purchased by the government, and the payment shall be made with three-year special foreign currency savings certificates issued by the Central Bank. One-sixth of these foreign currency savings certificates shall mature every six months. Upon maturity, importers may hold the certificates to the Central Bank to exchange for foreign exchange to purchase permitted import goods. With the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, the matured savings certificates may be transferred to registered and qualified importers for exchange into legal tender at the market exchange rate at the Central Bank. The valuation of these goods shall include: A. Landing price, paid with foreign currency savings certificates. B. Unloading costs and dock rent after arrival, paid in legal tender. C. An additional 10% of the purchase cost (calculated based on the landing price at the market exchange rate), paid in legal tender. These goods shall be processed according to the order of their shipping date.

### Government to Sell Purchased Goods Primarily to Direct Users

Confiscation of All Unlicensed Imported Goods in the Future

The principles for the government's sale of these goods are as follows: A. Raw materials such as cotton and wool will be sold in consultation with relevant industries. B. The China Trust Bureau (中信局) will entrust and supervise ordinary commercial institutions to sell, and the original importers will be given priority consideration. C. If the above methods are not suitable, the China Trust Bureau will sell on its own or through public bidding. D. The goods shall be sold to direct users in principle, and the selling price shall be based on the market price. However, for industrial raw materials, the price sold to factories may be the landing price plus a certain percentage, and the raw materials obtained by the factories shall be regarded as part of the quota that each unit is entitled to. E. Detailed measures for the sale of these goods will be formulated separately. Importers who are unwilling to comply with the above conditions must reship the goods within sixty days. The detailed rules for the implementation of these measures shall be stipulated by the Import and Export Management Committee. In addition to passing the above measures, the Executive Yuan also resolved that all automobiles that have arrived at the port, with the exception of the truck portion to be managed according to these measures, the import of small cars exceeding the quota should not be allowed. It was also decided that in the future, all imported goods without permits will be treated as smuggling and confiscated.

### Dong Xianguang Issues Statement: Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods are a Balance of Human Sentiment and Law, Not Compulsion

[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] Dong Xianguang, the new Director of the Executive Yuan, issued the following statement regarding the measures for handling self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped:

According to the registered amount, self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped without permits amount to approximately US$40 million. Not being allowed to import without permission is the main point of trade management. Once this provision is breached, the spirit of trade management is completely lost. In addition, the high selling price of foreign goods in the country is already excessive, giving importers excessive profits, and if the legal tender obtained from the sale of goods flows into the foreign exchange black market, the impact will be even more profound. The government has extensively adopted opinions from all parties on this case, and therefore, balancing human sentiment and law, made the decision passed by the Executive Yuan today regarding the measures for handling self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped. The key points are: Although these materials are purchased by the government, the purchase price is still paid in foreign currency and given special foreign currency savings certificates. Upon maturity, the principal and interest of these savings certificates can still be exchanged for foreign exchange to purchase permitted import goods. The goods are valued at the landing price, plus an additional ten percent, which is still converted into legal tender at the exchange rate on the date of purchase and payment. As for all dock rent expenses, the government will pay them in national currency. Therefore, merchants not only retain their principal and profit, but also have the value of their currency guaranteed. Among the goods, machinery and equipment belonging to Appendices 1 and 3A for which users pay themselves are not included in the purchase. In addition, the goods will still be sold to relevant industries, and the price of industrial raw materials sold to factories may be the landing price plus a certain percentage, and the raw materials obtained will be regarded as part of the quota that the factories are entitled to, meaning that the factories have the right to purchase these goods with priority and obtain a reasonable purchase price. When the government sells these materials, the original importers will be given priority to act as agents for the sale, so the interests of the importing firms are still taken into consideration. In order to comply with the requests of various trade associations, goods shipped from abroad after August 16 up to September 30 may be allowed to provide documents and re-register. Importers who disregard the above regulations may ship the goods out of the country, so the handling of these goods does not contain any compulsory nature. In short, the intention of these measures is to maintain government regulations on the one hand, limit stimulation of the foreign exchange black market on the other, and take into account the merchants' capital, the factories' needs, and the importers' position.

### British Parliamentarians Hope China Will Open Inland Rivers; The Authorities Have Expressed Opposition; Responsible Persons of the Shipping Federation Have Also Refuted

[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] This agency's reporter visited the responsible persons of the four major institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the International Trade Bureau, the Legislative Yuan, and the Central Bank to inquire about the opinions of Lord Ammon, the head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, on China's "closed-door policy." The responsible persons of the four institutions unanimously stated that China's policy of protecting inland river and coastal shipping is closely related to the policies strictly enforced by various countries in the world, and is by no means a selfish closed-door policy as claimed by Lord Ammon. They all believed that Lord Ammon excessively emphasized the interests of British shipping in Wuhu and ignored China's need to protect its inland river and coastal shipping. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, said: "The restrictive measures implemented since the end of the war are not intended to freeze foreign shipping or trade with China, but only to protect China's gradually growing shipping industry."

[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding Lord Ammon, the head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, hoping that China will open its inland rivers, the responsible person of the National Shipping Federation said: "This is purely an excuse to attempt to re-enjoy the right to navigate our inland rivers and coasts, which is completely inconsistent with the facts."

He said: "The entire China should treat the CCP crisis with the attitude of the United Kingdom dealing with the invasion from Germany. The Chinese government and people have not fully recognized the severity of the situation. They do not know that it may spread south."

Editorial

### Measures for Handling Goods Imported Without Permits

Regarding imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange, that is, imported goods without import permits, the measures for handling them have been resolved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Meeting yesterday: For imported goods that are permitted to be imported, the government will purchase them at the original price with fixed-term foreign exchange; imported goods that are prohibited from being imported will not be allowed to be imported according to regulations. The detailed measures have not yet been seen as of the time this article was written. Whether these handling measures are completely appropriate is another question in itself; however, the government's ability to cut the Gordian knot quickly and not hesitate any longer is indeed what the general public hopes for at present.

The total value of these goods varies from person to person. The lowest estimate is US$30 million, the highest is US$100 million, and most believe it is around US$70 million; even if converted to legal tender at the current official exchange rate, the amount is in the order of four trillion. With such a huge amount of materials, what would be the loss to the general national economy if they were left idle in customs warehouses and not utilized? What would be the direct and indirect losses to the importers? Moreover, according to the more than ten groups of city merchants and others, "60% to 70% of these imported goods are industrial raw materials and necessities, and 10% to 20% are industrial equipment." These raw materials and equipment are undoubtedly urgently needed items in the country, so it is no wonder that the business community has repeatedly called for a solution.

The above two handling principles were decided by the authorities after a long period of consideration before they were submitted to the meeting for resolution. Regardless of what conditions are set or whether they are welcomed by the importers, the principles are unlikely to change again. Therefore, the most worthy of consideration is how to purchase these goods. First, what price will the government use for the purchase? The original purchase price? The local market price? Or based on the purchase price, plus various expenses and so-called legitimate profits? If purchased at the market price, what is the market price at the time? The types of imported goods are different, and the arrival times vary, so does the government have accurate data to base on regarding the various expenses? Now that the government has decided to purchase at the original price, the problem seems to be less, but when the purchase is implemented, it is expected that there will inevitably be problems that need to be properly resolved.

Second, how will the purchase price be settled, that is, paid in cash? Or on account? If everything is on account and not paid in cash for the time being, the loss to the merchants will be too great; however, paying everything in cash seems to be a problem because the amount is too large. Moreover, these goods were purchased with so-called "self-provided foreign exchange," so should they still be paid in foreign exchange? Or converted to legal tender? From the government's point of view, it can give legal tender, and can be converted at the official exchange rate, but the hidden costs to the importer will be large. The current government has decided to pay in foreign exchange in six installments over three years, and also give reasonable profits, which is a well-considered plan. However, should interest still be added to the foreign exchange payments? This still needs to be paid attention to.

Third, how should the goods be disposed of after purchase? The only way is, of course, to sell them. However, several problems will arise when selling: Will the goods be directly distributed to relevant manufacturers, or will they be sold publicly without targeting anyone? If the distribution method is adopted, how will the distribution price be determined? Will they be sold at cost, or at a slight discount to the market price? Or will profits be added appropriately to the cost? What standard will be used for the total profit? Will the goods be sold in bulk immediately after purchase, or will they be sold gradually depending on the needs of the market?

The above many problems are all related to the purchase, and some of them must be resolved urgently. If the solutions are not appropriate, various repercussions will occur, which may affect the government's credibility, so they should all be considered carefully. We believe that purchasing everything is originally a last resort for the government. In the future, all measures must strive to be fair, and should not cause merchants to lose too much, and should not plan to make unexpected high profits from it, so that they can be understood by the general public.

As for imported goods that are prohibited from being imported, it is perfectly proper not to allow them to be imported according to regulations. However, according to the current situation, these goods that are not allowed to be imported are likely to come again by detours, taking the route of smuggling instead of the legal procedures of customs declaration and taxation. If the government retreats without taking other effective measures, it will be tantamount to promoting smuggling and only causing the customs to lose a large amount of tax revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate the detailed implementation of these two handling measures carefully.

### Madame Chiang's Speech

(Continued from Page 1) Madame Chiang said in her speech: I am very happy to be able to gather here with you tonight and to represent the Chinese women's community in welcoming you. We are very honored that the World YWCA has chosen China as the venue for its conference.

Broad Achievements

When I received your invitation, I originally thought that I should let someone who participates in the daily work of the YWCA and has a closer relationship with the YWCA deliver the welcome speech. However, the achievements of the YWCA in our country are far greater than the number of members. It represents a spirit and social force that deeply moves Chinese women. The YWCA has made brilliant contributions to improving the world. I am one of those who are deeply concerned about the problem of improving the world, so I dared to accept this opportunity to represent Chinese women and express our sincere respect to the representatives present who are dedicated to promoting this great world movement. You have come to China at a time when it is undergoing eight years of cruel and arduous war. Due to material difficulties, our hospitality to you may be simple, but this will certainly not reduce our sincere welcome. We are especially grateful that you have chosen to hold the conference here, knowing that China lacks convenient amenities.

The YWCA has a close relationship with our people. Many years ago, when I was not yet married, I had just returned from studying in the United States, and I was very honored to have a close relationship with the Shanghai YWCA. At that time, I was a volunteer supervisor of the Industrial Committee of the YWCA. Looking back now, the experiences at that time had a great enlightening effect on my life. I was originally very interested in social problems, but from that time on, I began to pay special attention to the problems of child laborers and female laborers in factories. The establishment of the Child Labor Committee by the Shanghai Municipal Council was partly the result of the efforts of the Industrial Committee, and the current Chinese Factory Law is also greatly influenced by the association. This is an example of the role played by the YWCA in society.

In my opinion, Hangzhou is the most suitable city in China to be chosen as the venue for your conference. Hangzhou is one of the most meaningful cities in China, not only does it have world-renowned beautiful scenery, but it is also rich in historical significance and ancient sites.

Great Women

There are two great women in Chinese history whose names are closely related to Hangzhou, which is of particular significance to our conference.

If you were to ask who the most famous women in Chinese history are, I think even a three-foot child would answer you: Yue Mu and Qiu Jin. These two immortal women have an inextricable relationship with the history of Hangzhou.

Yue Fei was a patriotic soldier of the Song Dynasty who resisted the invasion of the Jin people. His loyal remains are buried in Hangzhou. Anyone who comes to Hangzhou to visit will sincerely pay tribute to Yue Fei's tomb. He sacrificed his life for the country loyally and bravely, and his lifelong spirit of ardent patriotism was derived from his mother's education. Yue Fei's mother tattooed the words "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on his back when he was young, and she created a national hero for China who will be remembered for generations.

In modern times, Hangzhou is also the burial place of the revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin. Qiu Jin was the most progressive woman in modern China. She struggled constantly to realize the ideals of liberating the nation and equality between men and women, and finally made a noble sacrifice. Everyone respects her as one of the great revolutionary martyrs.

These two noble figures in Chinese history are buried in Hangzhou. I hope you will be able to take time to visit their mausoleums.

However, Hangzhou has a more direct reason for being of special significance to this conference.

Because the Chinese YWCA was first founded 57 years ago in a church girls' school in Hangzhou. The active founders of the YWCA at that time were the mother of Mr. Stuart Leighton, the current US Ambassador to China, and the mother of Mr. Bi Fanyu. Mrs. Stuart Leighton is also buried in Hangzhou. I hope everyone can take advantage of this conference to visit her grave and express our respect for this great Christian. Since the YWCA movement in China was first created in Hangzhou, it has spread like wildfire and has now spread all over the country.

Creating History

I often like to think back to the great people of the past, but the task of creating history today has fallen on our shoulders.

Representatives from twenty-three different countries have come from thousands of miles away. You represent a powerful world force that can work to promote a more perfect order between nations. You represent the women of the world speaking out what they want to say in their hearts. In this era full of unease and hesitation, your association has established an opportunity for women of goodwill in countries around the world to concentrate their forces. In many parts of the world, there are scattered and isolated people of benevolence and high ideals who are praying for international peace and understanding. Your association provides them with a unified central organization. We must know that the world is eagerly awaiting the heroic leadership that strives for peace! The World YWCA is fair and selfless, does not talk about interests, does not distinguish national boundaries, is rich in noble ideals, and at the same time knows the value and power of the spirit to society, and can give the women of the world this kind of leadership.

Now many people have a beautiful vision of the future of the world in their hearts, but due to their own internal weaknesses, they cannot take action to make their ideals a reality.

Removing Obstacles

I am even more convinced that the obstacles preventing mankind from enjoying a beautiful world order are mostly in people's own hearts. If we want to gain the will and courage to act, we must first remove the obstacles within us.

I think the first psychological obstacle that must be removed is suspicion. Nations and nations, ethnic groups and ethnic groups, are separated by vicious suspicion. Cooperation cannot survive in an atmosphere of doubt and disbelief.

The second psychological obstacle is that we do not believe in the inherent goodness of human nature. I know that in our time, everyone attributes depravity and corruption to human nature. This group of people also has a set of specious evidence to defend their claims. If we start from the premise that human nature is evil, how can we hope for a better world in the future? All of us who have not lost the ideal of governing the world with morality must abandon this kind of defeatist view of human nature being evil.

Third, there are quite a few people now who adopt an indifferent attitude towards the grain species they should strive for, so that all their strength is not mobilized. They have far-reaching ideals, but lack the will to improve the world. They would rather passively drift with the tide and be manipulated, and as a result, they are abandoned by history. If we have learned some lessons from World War II, the lesson is that after blood and pain, nations that lack enthusiasm are tantamount to inviting totalitarianism to invade themselves. Only if we are willing to work hard to realize a better world can we have the possibility of achieving our ideals.

New Enlightenment

I deeply understand that in all efforts to benefit the masses, disappointments and setbacks are inevitable. Our ideals are often higher than our actual achievements. We hope to achieve great achievements immediately, but when our hopes cannot be achieved, we cannot help but feel frustrated with the work at hand. However, it is a great misconception to think that fantasy can easily succeed. The greatest achievements in life often seem certain to fail at first. I recently gained a new understanding of this experience.

When I was in Shanghai recently, I traveled to Yushan in Qingpu, which is a beautiful place. From the foot of the mountain, there is a long stone staircase mountain road, and from the middle of the mountain to the top, there are fourteen turns. We can call them four small stations. Each station has an iron shrine, engraved with the entire process of Jesus Christ's suffering on the way to the suburbs of Jerusalem. On each suffering stele, there are texts related to the teachings, instructing us on the lessons we should learn in each stage of Jesus' suffering. Finally, we reach the top of Yushan, where a solemn and magnificent Catholic Church stands, which is the culmination of the meaning of the cross and a symbol of human suffering and fraternity.

This is truly an enlightening scene. However, for those who are not familiar with the story of Christ, the fourteen suffering steles only show the entire failure ending with the cross. From this person's point of view, it seems that Christ's mission resulted in an unavoidable disaster. However, we know that Christ's glory is one of the greatest achievements in history. We also know that the reason why this world can transcend from barbarism or something worse than barbarism and be saved is because of Christ's spirit of sacrifice and the tragic story of being nailed to the cross. Christ's great teaching: "Love your neighbor as yourself"! It is a beacon guiding us and giving us hope in today's world.

We must not be blinded by temporary success, nor must we be frustrated by current failures. If we believe that we are right, we must move forward bravely, and we must not feel discouraged because of the cost or sacrifice.

Sacred Battle

In this great post-war era, the YWCA and other similar organizations are fighting for moral values in a contradictory and war-torn world. Now they are facing a difficult battle, but it is a sacred battle that we must support with inner faith and aspiration, and we must overcome temporary failures and disillusionment. We must have unwavering confidence in the future of the world.

China has been in a world that seems to have forgotten its struggle, but it has always held a belief that it only relies on the iron-like "justice" to support it, and in such hopelessness, it has continued to fight year after year. We Chinese deeply understand the meaning of this kind of struggle, and we realize how this kind of struggle gives us the inner strength that rewards us.

In this post-war world, the goal that we Chinese yearn for is the international order that the World YWCA is striving for. In the process of this battle, we can all cooperate sincerely and work together. I believe that the World YWCA conference that will open tomorrow will be an important battle in this battle. We are really honored that your conference is being held in Hangzhou, China. (The End)

### Oppose Opening Inland Waterways

(Continued from Page 1) Since Queen Elizabeth of England in the 16th century, she has been developing maritime shipping as the foundation of the country. Engaging in inland and coastal navigation within the territorial waters of other countries has been its consistent national policy. Therefore, the series of unequal treaties from the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing in the 22nd year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty to the Sino-British Mackay Treaty in the 28th year of Guangxu, all aimed at obtaining navigation privileges. The British merchant houses Jardine Matheson and Swire have also worked hard to cooperate with their national policy, taking over the affairs and engaging in inland and coastal navigation in China for more than 70 years, so that China's infant shipping industry has been suppressed and has never been able to rise. We sincerely hope that the British visiting delegation to China will correct the misunderstandings formed by some people in the past who attached importance to navigation privileges and navigation interests, and promote the British government to conclude a Sino-British Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in accordance with the spirit of the treaty on the abolition of British extraterritoriality in China and the handling of relevant issues concluded by Britain on January 11, 1947, in order to promote the friendship and business development between the two countries.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] When the British opportunity visiting delegation to China hosted a reception for reporters in Peiping today, they emphasized that restoring Sino-British trade would require China to open inland waterways. Councilor Yatai said that Britain is a country that opens inland waterways. Foreign ships can reach under the London Bridge directly. China has some open natural resources that Britain needs, and it is willing to exchange them for machinery and other things. If inland waterways are not opened, this kind of trade cannot proceed. As in January of this year, your country ordered a batch of goods in Britain, and the payment has been made. Britain sincerely hopes to transport these goods to China, but cannot find a way to do so. Another member of the delegation, Morrison, continued that China must open inland waterways for Sino-British trade to be restored and developed. There are three reasons: China does not have many ships. If China does not open inland waterways, transportation will be extremely difficult. British ships have sailed on the inland rivers of central and southern China in the past and have rich experience. If foreign ships can only reach seaports, the goods will be unloaded and reloaded, and the high handling fees will have a great impact. Morrison pointed to the sweater he was wearing and said: "This is produced in northwestern China. There were many shipments before the war, and the quality is excellent. The current market price in the UK is about 10 to 15 pounds per load. I don't know if this Chinese wool can resume exports?"

### Anecdotes from the Old Capital

Examining Jin Bihui's Audience Pass; Strange Women Widely Advertise for Marriage; (Qian)

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] Snippets from the old capital: Jin Bihui (Kawashima Yoshiko) will be publicly tried tomorrow. When the court pre-issued audience passes today, there was a scramble due to the large number of people, and a violent scene broke out. Windows were smashed, and some were sold for thousands of yuan each. In the past year, there has been a so-called "strange woman" in the city who has been performing comedies repeatedly. Because she has not met the ideal husband she has been searching for, she has repeatedly asked various newspapers to publish her marriage advertisements for free, and posted notices outside the air-raid shelters on the city walls where she lives and in the city area stating: "Fairy He Xiangu is seeking a husband, 24 years old. Those who are willing to provide dowry must meet the following conditions: a set of gold bracelets, a leather coat, a pair of champagne shoes, and one million in cash. Those who are sincere are invited to visit the third cave dwelling of Hepingmen." Peking opera is increasingly declining in the old capital. Even Xun Huisheng's performance of his signature "Hongniang" sold only 200 tickets yesterday and lost millions. Foreign film merchants opposed supporting the troops, leading to the popularity of Soviet films.

### Madame Sun Yat-sen Arrives in Hangzhou for Sightseeing

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th Dispatch] Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai on the West Lake train on the morning of the 14th, and was in the same car as the representatives attending the World YWCA Conference in Hangzhou, but did not take their special car. A reporter approached her in the compartment and asked about the purpose of her visit. She replied that it was not to attend the World YWCA Conference, but purely for personal travel, as she had not been to Hangzhou for ten years. She will return to Shanghai after a day or two of sightseeing. She was accompanied by an American female secretary.

### Continued Rise in Hunan Rice Prices; Changsha City Government Convenes Expanded Pricing Conference

[Our Newspaper Changsha, 14th] Hunan rice has reached over 350,000 [currency units], a 160% increase compared to a month ago. Despite a total ban on transportation, the price surge has not abated. The Changsha Municipal Government has convened an expanded pricing conference to stabilize grain prices, deciding to: fully secure the city's grain supply and request the provincial government to send capable personnel to the lakeside areas to strictly enforce the ban on hoarding; request the provincial government to restrict grain transport and purchasing; prohibit foreign merchants from purchasing food in the city; temporarily prohibit grain from being transported down the river or loaded onto vehicles in non-rice-producing areas of the city; establish a grain consumption cooperative, requesting the municipal government to supply grain at low prices; restore the "Ever-Normal Granary" system, requesting the provincial government to allocate tribute grain for immediate implementation.

### Suzhou City Market Catches Rice Weevils

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 14th] Suzhou's price surge is rampant. Rice has reached seven "guan" per "shi" (unit of dry measure), and flour is approaching three "guan." The county government has taken three emergency measures: ordering the arrest of elements disrupting the market with speculative capital. Today, the Public Security Bureau apprehended six rice weevils with various "purchasing permits" in the market, clearly engaged in speculative malpractices, and has resolved to severely punish them.

### Malignant Inflation in Fuzhou

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 14th] Prices in Fuzhou have recently exhibited malignant inflation, with rice breaking through the 600,000 mark, pork at 24,000, eggs at 3,000, and almost all other goods experiencing price increases. Coupled with the black market volatility of gold and paper money, the market is increasingly chaotic. Credit is tight, and financial transactions are sluggish. Many businesses have stopped lending. Yesterday, a certain bank sent personnel to Shanghai to transport currency for emergency relief. Living conditions are difficult, and morale is low. The authorities have yet to devise countermeasures, and the price surge continues to set new records.

### Four Arrested in Tianjin Fraud Case; Military Supervision Group Orders Transfer to Beiping Court

[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 14th] The Military Disciplinary Supervisory Group announced that details of the Tianjin fraud case will be made public. The four individuals arrested in Tianjin, including Yu Deshu, have been ordered by the Group to be transferred by the Tianjin Gendarmerie Regiment to the Beiping District Court. The Zhang Tingyi case is still under investigation, with the review of relevant documents continuing. The case of tax bureau chief Jiao Zonghua, accused of corruption, has been found to lack evidence and cannot be substantiated.

### Labor-Management Dispute in Hangzhou Silk Industry Resolved

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 14th] The labor-management disputes in the Hangzhou department store, silk fabric, and silk factory industries have been resolved, except for the stalemate at the Rongshang department store. The silk industry has reached a settlement, and negotiations are still underway for the silk factory and fabric industries, with a final decision scheduled for the 17th. The request for a doubling of wages by the silk reel workers remains unresolved.

### Polish Journey, Letter VII: Glimpses of Society Behind the Iron Curtain - The Lonely Poles (Part 1)

— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

Poland has always played a tragic role on the European international stage. The European part of World War II began with Poland's misfortune. I still remember that timid and incompetent old man at 10 Downing Street, London, Neville Chamberlain. He once tremblingly declared that the British Empire was fighting to fulfill the Anglo-Polish Treaty, to guarantee Poland's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. However, after the war, Poland lost nine million lives and 77,000 square kilometers of territory. Perhaps, even today, many British people feel a hidden sense of shame when they talk about Poland. Before President Roosevelt's death, at a certain impromptu press conference, a reporter asked, "What does the President think about Russia's demand to cede Polish territory?" President Roosevelt, as intelligent as he was, was momentarily stunned. He pondered for a long time and replied in a deep voice, "I deeply admire Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of China for declaring that he has no territorial ambitions towards Thailand."

Some say that President Roosevelt was "angered" to death by the so-called "Curzon Line" dispute in Poland. Perhaps such speculation is excessive, but in the minds of the 23 million Poles today (except for a small portion of the Polish Communist Party), the Curzon Line caused them to lose 181,500 square kilometers of eastern territory, which is an indelible scar for them. On this fertile land, there were originally three million Poles who had lived there for generations. According to the person in charge of the Polish Ministry of the Interior, 1.5 million people have already been sent back to western Poland, and another 1.5 million are on their way to be repatriated.

"Lose at the east end, gain at the west end!" At the Tehran Conference, the "Big Three" agreed that Poland would take back 104,500 square kilometers of land from Germany, which is the so-called Oder River basin, half of East Brandenburg, and the Danzig Corridor. The Communist Party in Poland heavily promoted this, saying it was the generosity of the "Soviet ally" and that the Soviet Union helped Poland "recover lost territory." On slogans and posters in the streets of Warsaw, and even in magazines and publications, you can see a map of Poland's western new border at any time, but you rarely see a map of the eastern "new border."

The Poles call this land obtained from Germany the "Recovered Territories." In the cabinet, a "Recovered Territories Administration Department" was specially set up. The Minister is Gomułka, the number one "red person" in Poland today, the Central Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, and Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet. He is also the administrative governor of the Polish Recovered Territories.

I met with Polish friends in the Recovered Territories Administration Department. He said that the importance of the Recovered Territories is not only that it has recovered "lost territory" for the Poles, but also that it has laid a stepping stone for world peace, because Silesia, in the upper reaches of the Oder River, was originally the center of the German arms industry, and Prussia was the cradle of German "militarism." Now that it has been taken over by Poland as compensation, it is tantamount to completely disarming the war-loving Germans.

He said that before the war, there were seven million Germans and 800,000 Poles living in the Recovered Territories. By the time of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945, there were only two million Germans left. Now, Polish refugees and Poles repatriated from east of the Curzon Line have moved into the "Recovered Territories" one after another. The Polish government is responsible for transporting 1,200 to 2,000 Germans westward every month, ordering them to make a living on their own.

The "man-made" population migration caused by this war has created a rare miracle in European history. When I was in New York, I read Professor Hayes's "Collection of Essays on Nationalism," former U.S. Ambassador to Spain. I remember one chapter in which he discussed many ways to solve national problems. He mentioned many historical tragedies of "forced migration" and the unimaginable consequences arising from the tragedies. He said that some wars in history came about in this way, with endless "recovery of lost territory" creating a lot of killing between nations.

I am not a prophet, and I will not interfere in predicting what bad consequences will arise from Poland's newly acquired "Recovered Territories" in 20 or 30 years. At least, the current Polish authorities will not, and do not want to think about this. During my stay in Warsaw, I came into contact with many Poles. I think the Polish people are very lovely. Except for being a bit addicted to alcohol, most Poles retain the simplicity, innocence, and frankness of a rural society.

However, the environment has created many complex international relations for Poland, making many Western Europeans, Americans, and even Chinese dissatisfied with, and even cursing Poland's major policies and national policies. Last year, when I was in the United States, I listened to the meetings of the United Nations Security Council. No matter how fluent the Polish representative Wosga Lang's English was, or how tactful his speech was, the audience always had a kind of "disgust" for Poland's performance. The Chinese in particular will never forget Foreign Minister Beck of the old League of Nations in Geneva, that typical international politician who "helped the villain to do evil."

Foreign Minister Beck was active in the late years of Piłsudski in Poland. Polish friends said that Piłsudski had been in exile in Japan in his early years. At that time, Poland was in the era of being divided by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The Japanese authorities treated Piłsudski very courteously, and at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919, they supported Piłsudski's "national restoration movement." Piłsudski's "pro-Japanese" at that time did not originally want to deliberately "be hostile to China." Later, when Germany rose, Piłsudski, in order to traditionally "oppose Russia," eventually helped the villain to do evil in his later years and could not extricate himself. (To be continued)

### Major Powers Unanimously Support Partition Plan; Bloodshed in Holy Land Seems Unavoidable; Soviet Representative Suggests Modifying Arab-Jewish Borders

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] State Department officials anticipate that bloodshed in the Holy Land is inevitable after British troops withdraw from Palestine. Since the Soviet Union expressed support for partition, partition has become inevitable, and the Arab world's armed resistance and the Arab countries' willingness to withdraw from the United Nations are almost expected. People close to the British representatives believe that the Soviet Union's attitude has disappointed the Arab countries. The opinions of the major powers on this issue are almost unanimous, and the relationship between Jews and Arabs is close to breaking down. It is expected that some Arab extremists may act freely.

The UN Palestine Committee is scheduled to discuss the following issues at Lake Success today at 2:00 PM standard time: Jewish-Arab borders; the date when Britain will hand over the mandate and withdraw its troops; and the authorities during the transition period. The committee will also recommend that no foreign troops be sent to Palestine and that only Jewish and Arab militias be responsible for maintaining order.

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] In an important policy statement issued today, the Soviet Union endorsed the principle of partition for Palestine. The Soviet Union announced this position at the Palestine Special Committee. This is the first time at this session of the General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union have basically agreed on an important issue. However, although the Soviet Union agrees with the view of partition, it opposes the borders drawn by the United Nations Investigative Committee in Geneva. The Soviet Union hinted that it would announce special amendments later. The Soviet Union and the United States have not correctly explained how the partition of the Holy Land will be implemented. Before this, the Soviet Union had advocated that if the plan was feasible, a Jewish-Arab federation could be established. But on the 13th, Soviet representative Terapkin said that under the current extremely tense Arab-Jewish relations, this federation is clearly difficult to implement. The Soviet Union also demanded that Britain's mandate over Palestine should be ended as soon as possible. The Soviet delegation requested that the General Assembly, when implementing partition, agree to produce an administrative body to govern Palestine. This body should be responsible to the United Nations. The Soviet Union called for the resolution of the Palestine issue to begin on a broad political basis.

U.S. Representative Johnson told the press, "We are very interested in the Soviet statement. We are very pleased that their views coincide with ours on this fundamental issue." The Jewish Congress representing Palestine also welcomed the policy announcement, believing that it was "an inevitable and consistent development of Soviet policy."

### Arab Group Firmly Opposes the Establishment of a Jewish State in the Holy Land

[United Press, Damascus, Beirut, 13th] Leaders of the Arab League are scheduled to meet on the 14th to discuss the United States' proposal to partition Palestine. It is understood that the representatives feel deeply that although the United States hopes to make "some geographical modifications" to the majority report of the United Nations Investigative Committee, the Arabs will not be indifferent to this. Saudi Arabian representative Ye Xin told reporters, "This is a matter of principle, not detail. The Arabs are making every effort to oppose the establishment of a Jewish state, and there is absolutely no room for bargaining." Iraqi Prime Minister Yeb told reporters, "Please frankly inform the Americans that the partition of Palestine will cause trouble and difficulty. We did not expect the United States to take such a move, which is extremely bad." The Arab representatives refused to speculate on the possibility of the Arabs taking arbitrary action if Britain were to withdraw and hand over administrative power to an international peacekeeping force.

[United Press, London, 14th] It is understood that Britain has sternly warned Arab countries that implementing the Arab League's resolution and assembling troops on the border of Palestine will cause serious consequences. Britain threatened that the 100,000 British troops in the Holy Land will take severe measures against any Arab rebellion in the Holy Land, because Britain is still responsible for maintaining order there. It is believed here that Britain's disapproval is the most effective weapon to eliminate the Arab plan to march into the Holy Land, because the regular armies of most Arab countries rely on Britain for a large amount of weapons and the assistance of officers.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 13th] Jewish National Committee Chairman Li Misz claimed that reinforcements had been sent to the Jewish area in northern Palestine to prevent attacks. He also announced that every Jew in Palestine should donate one day's pay each month to fund the protection of the Jewish area.

[Reuters, Amman, Capital of Transjordan, 13th] Transjordanian Prime Minister Rifai tonight denied the claim that Arab countries were stationing troops on the border of Palestine, saying that this move would damage Arab principles. No matter what resolution the Arab League adopts, it will not be implemented before British troops withdraw from Palestine. King Abdullah of Transjordan welcomed the twenty-one representatives of the Arab League today, but Grand Mufti Husseini was not among them.

### U.S. Representative Urges the Prompt Establishment of a "Little Assembly"

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 14th Broadcast, Lake Success Dispatch, U.S. Representative Dulles delivered a speech in the UN Political Committee today, advocating the prompt establishment of a "Standing Committee" of 55 countries to give the United Nations a new vitality. Dulles denied the Soviet claim that this move aimed to overthrow the Security Council, and said that the committee would still be bound by the Security Council when carrying out its work. After delivering his speech, Dulles gave a branch of olive to the Soviet representative and said, "I hope that all countries can propose constructive revisions to the U.S. proposal." According to reports, Dulles was referred to as a "warmonger" by the Soviet side.

### Soviet Union Attacks U.S. Congressional Delegation Visiting Europe; Decides to Offer a Cold Shoulder

[Reuters, London, 13th] Moscow Radio commented: More than 200 U.S. Congressmen have launched a veritable invasion of Europe. This is not a casual trip. These congressional delegations are even equipped in a military fashion, including representatives from various military departments. Some U.S. Congressmen are willing to enter the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union, with its national sovereignty as the priority, is unwilling to become the object of suspicious investigation and has rejected them.

[Reuters, Damascus, 13th] The U.S. Congressional delegation, led by Republican Congressman Merrow, arrived here today to conduct an investigation. Tonight, they will visit Syrian President Kurli.

### Debate on the Greek Issue Concludes; Soviet Counterproposal Rejected; Vyshinsky Defends the Communist International

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 13th] The UN Political Committee today completed the discussion on the dispute between Greece and its three northern neighbors and rejected the Soviet proposal. Previously, the Political Committee passed the U.S. proposal on Saturday, setting up a special committee by the General Assembly to monitor the disputed area and to find ways to improve the dispute between the four Balkan countries. The U.S. proposal will now be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion in order to take appropriate action.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] British representative McNeil solemnly denied in the UN Political Committee that Britain had any intention of threatening the independence of Yugoslavia. He replied to the accusation of Ukrainian representative Manuisky, referring to it as an irresponsible accusation. In today's meeting, the Slavic countries' representatives spoke the most. Soviet representative Vyshinsky defended his proposed resolution, which attributed the entire responsibility for the Balkan unrest to the Greek government and demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Greece and that a United Nations committee be established to supervise U.S. aid to Greece. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries firmly opposed this resolution. During the debate, McNeil's statement that "Manuisky's accusation against the British Labour Party leader shows that the Communist International has been restored" provoked Vyshinsky's rebuttal. Vyshinsky said, "Due to the meeting of the nine countries' communist parties in Warsaw, you have become delusional, but in fact there is no Communist International. The members of the Communist International are by no means limited to nine countries. Only nine countries have made you panic. Why not take some medicine to calm your fears?" The entire section of the Soviet resolution was rejected by a vote of 40 to 6, with 11 abstentions. The first part of the resolution, namely the part that attributed the responsibility for the Balkan unrest to Greece, was rejected by a vote of 39 to 7, with 10 abstentions. The second part, which demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops, was rejected by a vote of 33 to 8, with 16 abstentions. The third part, which established a committee to supervise U.S. aid to Greece, was rejected by a vote of 35 to 6, with 16 abstentions.

This report will be distributed to cabinet members and congressional members this week.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman convened senior political and diplomatic officials at the White House today for the most thorough review of the European situation.

U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Treasury Secretary Snyder, who had just returned from Europe, and Deputy Secretary of State Clayton were often able to provide Truman with extremely valuable information to formulate countermeasures against the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau; Review the emergency food plan. U.S. officials acknowledge that the food plan is in poor shape. If no other measures are taken, the export of food will inevitably be reduced.

兩藝人　浮海歸來　對祖國影業將有所貢獻
Two Artists Return by Sea, Will Contribute to the Motherland's Film Industry

今年孫借用美方技術，曾拍攝「美國大觀」影片一部，內容係敘述兩中國旅美記者目中所見之美國種種，包括美國山水。人物。社會等各種內慕動態，為一純拌紀錄片，目的係在介紹進步中的美國悄况，除女主角為黎莉裁外，男角原定由金燄担任，嗣因金出國護照未能辦妥，復以經費關係，該片在完成三分之一後不得己停拍，孫黎返國後，該片仍暫存美國，聞將俟明春運回，在滬用國內背景補足鏡頭。據孫談稱：「美國電影製片技術，近年來有驚人進步，此次週遊各地，實地觀察，心得頗多，將來我國電影工業，欲求訊速進展，除需訓練大批有深刻修養之優秀人才外，技術方面擬先與美國合作，多拍幾部巾美合作影片，傳能收觀摩誘導之效。」聞孫在好萊塢時，會與名攝影師黃宗沾商談此項計劃，黃旅美已達三十餘年，其攝片技術在好萊塢飲譽極隆，彼對祖國電影改進素具熟誠，最近即將來滬與孫等籌劃。據孫瑜表示，今年年內，彼決盡力協助充實及改進現有之各項設備，明春當可希望有較為理想之影片陸續出現。　　黎莉莉在美因研續甚勤，聞其歌喉及舞藝已有極高成就，黎本為十餘年前梅花歌舞團時代之有數健將，其主演之「到自然去」及「塞上風雲」均為名嗓一時之潔作，此次千錘百鍊，學成歸來，對我國未來影業，當一更有不少貢獻。昨黎在碼頭上會笑謂：「希望我們今後能拍幾部優秀的書樂片，替甲國影壇劃出一條新生的通路」。
This year, Sun, borrowing American technology, once filmed a movie titled "Panorama of America," the content of which describes the various aspects of America as seen by two Chinese reporters traveling in the United States, including American landscapes, people, society, and other inside dynamics, as a purely documentary film, aimed at introducing the state of progress in America. Except for the female lead, Li Lili, the male role was originally intended to be played by Jin Yan. However, due to Jin's passport not being processed and financial constraints, the film had to be stopped after completing one-third of it. After Sun and Li returned to China, the film remained temporarily in the United States and is said to be shipped back next spring to supplement the scenes with a domestic background in Shanghai. According to Sun, "American film production technology has made astonishing progress in recent years. This tour of various places and on-site observation has yielded many insights. In the future, if China's film industry seeks rapid progress, in addition to training a large number of outstanding talents with profound cultivation, it is planned to cooperate with the United States in technology, filming several Sino-American cooperative films, which can be expected to achieve observational and guiding effects." It is heard that Sun discussed this plan with the famous cinematographer Huang Zongzhan in Hollywood. Huang has been traveling in the United States for more than 30 years, and his filming technology is highly regarded in Hollywood. He has always had a sincere desire to improve the country's films and will soon come to Shanghai to plan with Sun and others. According to Sun Yu, within this year, he is determined to do his best to help enrich and improve the existing equipment, and it can be hoped that more ideal films will appear one after another next spring. Li Lili has been studying very diligently in the United States, and it is said that her singing and dancing skills have achieved extremely high accomplishments. Li was originally one of the most capable veterans of the Plum Blossom Song and Dance Troupe more than ten years ago. Her starring roles in "Go to Nature" and "Frontier Storm" were both famous and well-known works at the time. This time, after repeated refinement and returning with acquired skills, she will undoubtedly make many more contributions to China's future film industry. Yesterday, Li smiled at the pier and said: "I hope we can film a few excellent music films in the future and create a new path for the Chinese film industry."

十四年前人命案　高院續審顧竹軒仍　謂敲詐不遂致被誣攀敎唆
Fourteen-Year-Old Homicide Case: The High Court Continues to Hear the Case, Gu Zhuxuan Still Claims He Was Falsely Accused of Instigating Due to Failed Extortion

〔本報訊〕十四年前轟動滬上之大世界遊藝塲經理唐嘉鵬，被人喑殺身死，天蟾舞合老顯顧竹軒涉嫌被控敎唆殺人案，前經江蘇高三分院實告無罪，但檢察官不服上訴，經最高法院剣還更審，適值戰事發生，該案即不了而了，勝利後本市高院重理舊案，於九月八日，會傳顧審訊一次，昨日上午十時許，該案再度續審。　　顧着黑馬掛，灰色呢夾袍，精神似較上次開庭時為差。對於敎唆暗殺唐嘉鵬事矢口否認，供稱兇手趙廣福誣蔡渠為敎唆犯，實因敲詐不遂之故，當時趙之親筆信係由同監犯薛振翼轉交，庭上請以何故趙在舊法租界警務處中即供稱是汝唆，彼尚無借錢不遂之事發生。又詢辭振翼此人現在何處，可傳來作證，此係對當有利者，如薛測到庭證明趙廣福確有索詐函交渠轉交，則此案可結，顧稱薛已有十餘年不見，現不知么向。總稱兇手趙廣福業已死亡。同案犯張廷桂據問亦死，至於另一嫌疑敎唆犯王興高，顧稍根本不認識，後在法庭上見過幾次面，當護律師則稱:趙廣福之親筆索詐西已由前高三分院縝密檢定，會命趙當庭核對筆跡，證明無訛，紀録在卷，根據此點，即可結案。至於傳訊證人，因十餘年來事過境遷，或已死亡，或不知去向，至為困難。庭諭本案尙需調查，改期再審，顯仍交原保候傳。
[Report from this newspaper] Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World Amusement Park, which caused a sensation in Shanghai 14 years ago, was assassinated. Gu Zhuxuan, a prominent figure in the Tianchan Dance Hall, was suspected of instigating the murder and was acquitted by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. However, the prosecutor appealed, and the Supreme Court ordered a retrial. Due to the outbreak of war, the case was dropped. After the victory, the Shanghai High Court reopened the case and summoned Gu for questioning on September 8. Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the case was retried. Gu wore a black mandarin jacket and a gray wool-lined robe, and his spirits seemed lower than at the previous hearing. He flatly denied instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, claiming that the murderer Zhao Guangfu falsely accused him of being an instigator because of a failed extortion attempt. At that time, Zhao's handwritten letter was delivered by a fellow prisoner, Xue Zhenyi. The court asked why Zhao had confessed in the Old French Concession Police Department that he was instigated by Gu, when there had been no unsuccessful attempt to borrow money yet. He also inquired about the whereabouts of Xue Zhenyi, stating that summoning him to testify would be beneficial to the defense, as Xue's testimony could prove that Zhao Guangfu did indeed have an extortion letter delivered through him, which would allow the case to be closed. Gu stated that he had not seen Xue for more than ten years and did not know his whereabouts. He claimed that the murderer Zhao Guangfu had already died. Zhang Tinggui, a co-defendant in the case, was also reportedly dead. As for Wang Xinggao, another suspected instigator, Gu claimed that he did not know him at all and had only seen him a few times in court. The defense lawyer stated that Zhao Guangfu's handwritten extortion letter had been carefully examined and verified by the former Third Branch of the High Court, and Zhao was ordered to verify the handwriting in court, proving it to be correct, which was recorded in the files. Based on this point, the case could be closed. As for summoning witnesses, it was extremely difficult because more than ten years had passed, and some may have died or their whereabouts were unknown. The court ordered that the case still needed investigation and rescheduled the retrial, and he was still released on bail pending further investigation.

[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of July 24th last year, a strange kidnapping case occurred in this city. The protagonist, Xue Jianqiu, who had served as a translator for the enemy's stationed forces in Zhuji and Mei and as a special commissioner of the puppet Zhuji Political Security Bureau, was kidnapped at 9:30 AM on the escalator of the Property Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan on Central Sichuan Road by Zhang Yucan (also known as Xifu), who claimed to have been the commander of the East Zhejiang Guerrilla, and two accomplices. They took Xue by pedicab to the Mei Hua Restaurant on West Fuxing Road for breakfast, then to Wu Wei Qi for lunch, and then to the Hua An Barber Shop for a haircut. In the evening, they went to the Goldfish Cafe for dinner and then to the Koshman Ballroom for dancing. After tiring of dancing, they went to the Waterfront Hotel for a late-night snack. A total of over 100,000 Legal Tender was spent that day, using the proceeds from pawning Xue's diamond ring and gold watch to pay the bill. After a day of revelry, Xue was hidden in the Municipal Government Guard Room at midnight, and a ransom of 20 million yuan was demanded. Xue agreed to pay 10 million yuan and wrote a note instructing his wife to send the money for negotiations. Xue's wife reported the case to the police, who solved the case and arrested the principal offender Zhang Yucan and accomplices Lu Bingyan, Zhang Zhengyuan, and Gao Zhenyu, and transferred them to the court. Zhang Yucan was sentenced to five years in prison, and Lu, Zhang, and Gao were each sentenced to three years in prison. Xue Jianqiu, on the other hand, was sentenced to six years in prison by the High Court for treason. Zhang and others refused to accept the sentence, stating that the crime of attempted kidnapping for ransom should be established based on whether there was an intention to extort money. The defendants kidnapped Xue and took him to the bustling city for a day of fun, which at most constituted the crime of fraud. They applied for a review by the High Court, and the High Court ruled for a retrial. The retrial opened in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Yucan flatly denied that there was a plan to kidnap Xue beforehand, and he was not carrying a gun that day. Because he was a traitor, I was going to send him to the Xincheng Police Station that day, but he didn't want to go, so he stayed in the Municipal Government Guard Room. Judge Shao Renjie, the presiding judge, asked if it was because he didn't get the money that he wanted to send him to the police station. Zhang replied, "It's not like that. Even if I got the money, I would still report him," showing a rather triumphant expression. Defendants Lu Bingyan, Zhang Zhengyuan, and Gao Zhenyu all testified that they had not discussed with Zhang beforehand and had not helped Zhang with extortion afterward. Xue Jianqiu was finally summoned. Xue was escorted to the court by bailiffs, wearing a gray wool robe, disheveled hair, and gold-rimmed glasses. He bowed deeply to the court and testified about the details of the kidnapping that day, saying that Zhang had claimed to be under the command of the Maritime Inspection Office of the Garrison Command and had come to arrest him, but after getting in the car, he ordered the soldiers to "go west," and they did not go to the Garrison Command at all. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing.

[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Ju Guangzao accused of fraud, yesterday the District Prosecutor's Office subpoenaed Ju Guangzao, Gu Jianyi, plaintiff Liu Shen Liying, Gu Chen, witnesses Yang Ding Xiuyun, Gu Guohua, Xu Jianqi, and others to the court for questioning. The most noteworthy among them was Gu Jianyi. Because Ju had repeatedly borrowed money from Liu Shen Liying and others, all in Gu's name, but he had never been seen. The District Prosecutor's Office had summoned him before, but he did not appear. Yesterday he suddenly reported to the court, stating that he had opened the Maohe Rice Mill in Liuzhao, Pudong, and due to financial difficulties, he asked Ju Guangzao and Yang Ding Xiuyun, the guarantors, to borrow five gold bars from Liu Shen Liying. By this spring, Gu had repaid two bars and still owed three bars. Gu wanted to repay according to the official price quoted by the Central Bank, but at that time the black market price of gold was soaring, with a huge difference, which caused the dispute. After investigation by the prosecutor, Ju Guangzao was still released on bail, and the others were dismissed.

[Report from this newspaper] The case of Shen Haitao, the owner of Anzhai Xintie Iron Factory, accused of inciting suicide, was heard in court yesterday. Jin Yingye's son, Jia Dong, was introduced to An Tai Xin Chang as an apprentice, but because the factory failed to pay wages according to living expenses, a strike occurred among the factory workers, and Jin Jiadong also echoed the call, which aroused the factory owner's dissatisfaction. When the strike subsided, Shen Haitao accused Jin of inciting the strike and being negligent in his work and requested the Social Affairs Bureau to dismiss him. After being stimulated by this, Jin returned home and committed suicide by taking lysol on September 7, leaving a suicide note stating that he was oppressed and committed suicide out of anger. Jin Yingye then went to the District Prosecutor'

For this reason, our newspaper's Social Service Department initiated the "Free Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" campaign eight months ago. Despite facing numerous difficulties, we persevered with dedication, appealing and calling out on behalf of the pitiable mothers and the innocent infants. Eight months have swiftly passed, and our free maternity assistance campaign has garnered widespread support and sympathy. The number of hospitals cooperating with us has increased from one to four, namely Renhe Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, and the recently added Baoli Hospital. Countless like-minded readers have provided us with financial assistance and moral support.

The work of "Free Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" is expanding and developing more broadly day by day. From February to October, we have assisted more than one hundred poor pregnant women. Fortunately, none of these women suffered the misfortune of death. Due to soaring prices and currency fluctuations, we have begun to feel the pinch of financial constraints and fundraising difficulties. On the other hand, the number of people applying for maternity assistance is increasing day by day, but we are not discouraged by this. We believe that continuous efforts will surely overcome the current difficulties.

The day before yesterday, on a clear autumn morning, we received a call from reader Mr. Jinhua Feng, who told us that he was willing to independently bear all the monthly expenses of our newspaper's maternity assistance for poor women. The next day, we discussed the implementation methods with him and formulated the guiding principles for the campaign.

Mr. Jin is a kind and amiable middle-aged businessman, with a humble and straightforward nature, and an especially honest and sincere attitude. Twelve years ago, he was a good friend of the late famous doctor Niu Huiqin. Admiring Mr. Niu's character and inspired by his spirit, he resolved to do good deeds, vowing to use his business earnings to relieve the suffering of his compatriots. Mr. Jin has been married for eighteen years without children, but suddenly had a son in early September this year, which of course gave him great comfort. From now on, we will no longer have to worry about the expenses for "maternity assistance funds," and countless poor pregnant women will also receive a safe guarantee.

### Reopening of the Paris Conference: Britain Expresses Strong Opposition

The White House's hasty convocation of a meeting with U.S. Marshall Plan officials and the executive committee of the Paris Sixteen-Nation Economic Cooperation Committee coincided unexpectedly. Authoritative sources say that Britain is strongly opposed to the U.S. proposal to reopen the Paris Conference to approve the U.S.'s proposed amendments to the Paris Conference report. Sir Oliver Franks, the British representative, believes that the final decision on the European Recovery Program rests with the U.S. Congress. Therefore, first obtaining the consent of European countries to the U.S. government's amendments seems unwise and unnecessary.

### New Trade Agreements Concluded Between China and Canada, etc.

### U.S. Export-Import Bank Approves France's Use of $180 Million; Truman's First Voice of Expedient Aid

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Export-Import Bank took action on the 13th, approving France's use of $180 million in U.S. funds to purchase U.S. coal and other urgently needed raw materials to alleviate the Western European crisis. The loan is the unused portion remaining from the $650 million loan to France in May 1946, which was approved for use after French Ambassador to the U.S., Henri Bonnet, made an urgent appeal to President Truman. French procurement agencies have already signed contracts to use all of the funds for heavy machinery to revitalize France's export industry. The exact amount of assistance France can receive under the new regulations depends on the cancellation or extension of some of these contracts. President Truman announced last month that France and Italy would receive expedient aid this winter before the Marshall Plan is implemented. This is the first batch of funds given to Europe by the administrative departments of the U.S. government.

### Iranian Government Prevents Turmoil; Large Numbers of Suspected Communists Expelled

Soviet Ambassador Visited Iranian Prime Minister, Meeting Ended Unhappily

[Report from this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: Great Britain News: The Iranian government, deeply fearful of Soviet-instigated riots in the oil-rich Azerbaijan province, is currently exiling thousands of suspected communists to prevent the organization of a fifth column. Currently, 4,000 people have been exiled to western Iran. According to police authorities, another 4,000 people will be exiled in the next six weeks.

[Reuters, London, 13th] It is reported that Soviet Ambassador, Saki Khikov, visited Iranian Prime Minister, Sultan Nadar, on Saturday to discuss the Soviet oil agreement. Because Sultan Nadar could not agree to submit the agreement to the parliament immediately, Saki Khikov stormed out in anger. Saki Khikov strongly argued that the terms of the agreement should not be changed and that the submission of the agreement to parliament should not be delayed any longer. Sultan Nadar urged Saki Khikov to be patient and stated that he should not only discuss the matter with members of parliament, but also with other important parties.

Paris Transport Workers Stage General Strike Yesterday

### Japanese Demand Return of Greater Ryukyu Islands; Senate Decides to Postpone Temporarily; Hosokawa Suggests Residents of the Island Resolve Themselves

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to temporarily postpone the delicate issue of the residents of Greater Ryukyu Islands requesting that the islands be returned to Japan. They will make a decision after hearing more opinions from the people of the islands.

Following the second fierce debate in the Japanese Senate Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the appeal from 63 residents of the islands for their return to Japan, some senators considered the matter extremely delicate and proposed holding a closed-door meeting. However, Senate Speaker Sato Naotake, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, opposed the above suggestion, believing that the senators would adopt a cautious attitude when discussing this delicate issue. Hosokawa Kakuroku, a communist member of the committee, strongly opposed discussing the case, stating that history proves that Greater Ryukyu Islands were stolen by Japan between Meiji 4 and 12. He also claimed that the chiefs of the islands were forced, not voluntarily, to merge with Japan. Hosokawa is a famous Japanese commentator. He believes that the request of 63 residents of the islands is not representative of the opinions of the 1.2 million people on the islands globally, or even of the 200,000 people from the islands residing in Japan. He continued, stating that some people on the islands support merging with Japan, but some also support merging with China. Therefore, he suggests that the people of the islands resolve the matter themselves, and the Japanese Senate should not interfere. Speaker Sato, from the beginning of the meeting, attempted to prevent a serious debate on the issue. Therefore, he immediately announced a temporary postponement of the issue, pending the acquisition of more opinions from the residents of the islands.

### Taking Extraordinary Measures in Extraordinary Times; Full Investigation of Illegal Merchants; Commander Xuan Announces at Press Conference Yesterday; National Traitors Will Be Punished Most Severely

Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu gave an important speech yesterday afternoon when he received a reporter from the Central News Agency, stating: In today's situation, we must admit that it is no longer an ordinary period, but an extraordinary one. Extraordinary economic fluctuations during extraordinary times should be dealt with by extraordinary measures, which may be able to save the crisis. Xuan announced to the reporter that he has decided to take two emergency measures: Yesterday, he summoned the chiefs of all intelligence brigades to discuss that, starting today, they will concentrate all their efforts on investigating illegal merchants who disrupt finance, monopolize the market, and raise prices. These people are greedy for personal gain to achieve superior enjoyment, disregarding the lives of the majority of the people. They are truly traitors to the nation, and the country and society do not need such people to exist. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished most severely. If the people of the country all say they should be killed, they will be put to death. There will be absolutely no leniency. As an example, Xuan stated that the free trading of gold banknotes is prohibited, but the black market exists blatantly and is extremely rampant. The daily black market quotations are spread everywhere. The most important target of the investigators is to investigate where these quotations come from and who sets them. He has set a deadline to break this place where black market quotations are generated and capture the mysterious figures behind the scenes. Xuan stated that what should be maintained now is the lives of the majority of law-abiding people, and those who exploit the lives of the majority of the people should be sacrificed. The necessities of life for the majority of the people are "food" and "clothing." Food is rice, and clothing is yarn. In terms of the production of rice and yarn in Shanghai and its vicinity, there is sufficient supply. The reason why these two items are lacking today is due to hoarding and manipulation by exploiters. He is currently drafting a measure to avoid the monopolization of rice and yarn by middlemen. The content of this measure, Xuan revealed, is that rice and yarn should be directly purchased and produced by the government, and directly distributed to the people, without going through the hands of merchants. In addition, by checking household registrations, he will thoroughly investigate people who hoard grain and yarn from house to house. Confiscate the goods found, and severely punish the offenders. In this way, Shanghai can be free of people hoarding a single dan of grain or a piece of yarn. After this measure is drafted, Xuan will discuss it with Mayor Wu and report it to the central government before implementing it. Xuan finally stated that financial control and price stabilization originally have competent authorities, but the result of financial chaos and price fluctuations will endanger public security. He is responsible for maintaining the city's public security and must "take precautions."

Spot Check on Seven Textile Manufacturers

[Report from this newspaper] In order to implement the five measures instructed by the mayor to suppress the price of yarn, the Bureau of Economic Affairs dispatched all economic police officers yesterday morning, led by senior officials, along with personnel dispatched by the Textile Adjustment Committee, to conduct spot checks on the yarn allocation situation of various textile manufacturers in seven groups. The manufacturers that were spot-checked include Xinhuo Yarn Factory at 60 Mochanshan Road, Datong Yarn Factory at 223 Bingai Road, Guangqin Yarn Factory at 410 Mabai Road, Hengtong Yarn Factory at 68 Xichang Street in the South City, Zhang Shenghua at 1486 Ban'an Temple Road, Qin Xin Yarn Factory at 162 Father Du Road, and Hongzhang Yarn Factory at 381 Maigen Road. According to Xu, the chief of the Economic Affairs Section, the manufacturers that were spot-checked were all selected by the Textile Adjustment Committee before personnel from the section were dispatched to handle the matter. The principle of not harassing normal merchants was followed during the execution of the work, so the process yesterday was quite good. At the same time, the prices of cotton yarn and artificial silk have all fallen, but because full attention is focused on yarn and rice markets, they are still volatile. In addition to summoning the heads of the North and South markets to advise them, I will start a thorough investigation today.

### 10,000 Dan of Raw Oil to Be Transported; 15,000 Dan of Rice Arriving; Mayor Advises Against Panic Buying

[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu met with reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, stating that the yarn market situation has fallen and will soon stabilize after deciding on emergency measures to strictly crack down on hoarding and speculation. The price of cooking oil has risen sharply recently. After consultation with the China Cooking Oil Company and with the approval of President Zhang via a long-distance phone call, 10,000 dan of raw oil will be transported from Qingdao to Shanghai to be distributed and sold jointly with the cooking oil from the China Vegetable Oil Factory to suppress the printing price. In addition, a telegram was sent to President Zhang, ordering the railway authorities to transport the large amount of soybeans currently at Zhapu, so that the oil price in the city can be lowered. As for the 100,000 tan of rice added by the Ministry of Food, the first batch of 15,000 tan has arrived in Shanghai and will be distributed to the people by the Civil Food Allocation Committee after deliberation. The recent rise in rice prices is not due to rice shortages. I hope that citizens can cooperate with the government and those with rice at home should not panic buy to avoid stimulation, so that the rice price can be stabilized.

Meeting of Oil Merchants Convened to Discuss Oil Conservation Measures

### Yarn Association Consolidates Industry; Stipulates Five Points to Be Universally Observed

[Report from this newspaper] The Economic Affairs Section of the Police Bureau summoned those in charge of the Cotton Yarn Association again yesterday to discuss the matter. In addition to advising them to voluntarily suppress prices, a broad discussion of the reasons for the recent price surge was also conducted. According to the Cotton Cloth Association, the reasons for the market price increase are: 1. Lack of sources for domestic cotton and obstructed transportation, resulting in rising production prices. 2. Foreign cotton is difficult to settle in foreign exchange, and goods are disappearing. 3. Fuel and pigments have all risen dramatically. 4. Insufficient power, reduced production. 5. High wages, increased expenses. 6. The autumn season is in season, and supply cannot meet demand. In the future, the way to suppress prices should be through official-business cooperation, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. In addition to unblocking cotton sources, increasing yarn production, adjusting cotton yarn negotiated prices, and distributing them to distribution manufacturers as much as possible, attention should also be paid to tightening monetary policy, lowering interest rates, and suppressing the selling price of fuel and pigments. The association notified its members yesterday afternoon, stipulating the implementation of the following points: 1. All transactions in the market must be accompanied by a transaction slip, accurately stating the membership numbers of both the buyer and seller, and submitted to the association for verification. 2. Those without market escorts are strictly prohibited from entering the market. 3. Non-industry personnel are strictly prohibited from entering the market to buy and sell. 4. Notify the Brokers Association to advise its members to abide by these rules. 5. If there are any violations, all members should supervise each other. Responsible South will raise.

The second phase of rice distribution to poor households will begin today, and the scope of distribution will be expanded to the "middle poor" and "ordinary poor" classes. The "middle poor" and "ordinary poor households" were also investigated when investigating the "extremely poor" households, so the new list of additional recipients for the expanded distribution will be based on the lists submitted by the district offices. 2. The first phase of rice distribution to occupational workers has been extended to the 20th of this month. 3. The second phase will be started immediately after the first phase of rice distribution is completed. 4.

The allocation of cooking oil to industrial workers will also be extended until the 20th of this month. 6.

### Many Speculations on the Reasons for Xiao Danggui's Suicide

[Report from this newspaper] Xiao Danggui, a famous Yue opera veteran, suddenly committed suicide at her home in Songjia Lane, Beijingshi, the day before yesterday afternoon. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Xiao Ling's body was transported from the Zhongmei Hospital to the coroner's office at 2:00 a.m. yesterday. At 8:00 a.m., the police bureau requested the prosecutor's office to send someone to examine the body. At 9:00 a.m., the body was transported to the Lewen Funeral Home, and the major encoffining ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow at noon. From noon to dusk yesterday, there were many friends and relatives who came to mourn, especially Jin City Yue opera fans who came to view the remains. There was an endless stream. Among the top ten Yue opera actresses, except for Yin Guifang, who went abroad last month, Yuan Xuefen, Fan Ruijuan, Fu Quanxiang, Xu Tianhong, Zhang Guifeng, Xiao Lou, Zhu Shuijuan, and Xu Wanglan all arrived to pay their respects and mourned loudly over the body. Zhang Xiangxiang, Xiao Ling's former supporting actor, as well as Yue opera actresses Jia Lingfeng, Xiao Lingfeng, Xu Xuqin, Chen Peixiang, Wei Guanfang, Bai Mudan, Gao Wufang, Bi Xiaolou, and Xiao Yuee, were all sobbing with their faces covered. Xiao Ling's body was originally scheduled to be encoffined today, but because her family members need to wait for her brother, Qian Boquan, to come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony, it has been postponed until tomorrow. Her sister, Qiong Yun, is guarding the coffin, sobbing sadly. Zhang Chunfan, her husband, according to reporters, was showing signs of mental instability in the funeral home yesterday afternoon. All the Yue opera actresses in the city are suspicious of the reasons for Xiao Ling's suicide, believing that there must be grievances, and there are moves to appeal to all sectors for justice. All the Yue opera actresses in the city will suspend their performances tomorrow to attend Xiao Ling's major encoffining ceremony to mourn her. The so-called five Dan of the Yue opera veteran faction are Shi Yinhua, Cao Ruihua, Wang Xinghua, Yao Shuijuan, and Xiao Ling. Moreover, Xiao Qing is better than blue, and is admired by the Yue opera actresses, so there is a saying that three flowers are not as good as one Juan, and one Juan is not as good as one Gui, which shows Xiao's status. Yesterday, there were many speculations from all parties about the reasons for Xiao Ling's suicide. Some said that Xiao's performance was slightly worse in the joint performance of the "Mountain and River Love" drama this summer by the top ten golden actresses, which caused criticism and was stimulated. Others said that it was due to the collapse of the building wall of the Cathay Yue Opera Theater, which affected the performance. Still others said that Xu Yulan's blocking made Xiao Ling feel unhappy, and even others said that Xiao was too strictly controlled, which led to her loss of freedom. As for economic difficulties, they are secondary.
