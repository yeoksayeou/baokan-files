Wei Envoy Expressed in Nanjing: Always Admired Chairman

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Wei Demai said to a visitor on the morning of the 31st that the mission of this trip is of an absolutely independent nature. Although President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall appointed him and instructed the main points of the work, they did not pre-determine his working process and attitudes. He is investigating the current situation in China from the standpoint of a friend of China, accepting information and opinions, distinguishing truth from falsehood, summarizing and classifying, and then making independent judgments to obtain an accurate conclusion for the reference of the US government, so as to make decisions to help China solve various difficulties. Wei said that since 1944, when he succeeded General Stilwell as Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang, he has deeply admired Chairman Chiang. Even today, although the situation in China has formed an unfortunate split due to various factors, he still believes that Chairman Chiang will surely lead the Chinese people to overcome all internally created difficulties, just as he had led them through external aggression and hardship. He believes that China's biggest problem is that some important people at home and abroad are unable to learn about certain facts. For example, in the winter of 1944, regarding the dangerous situation of enemy cavalry entering Guizhou, some subordinates of Chairman Chiang did not report the truth in time. It was not until Wei personally inspected the battlefield and reported back that he fully knew everything. The purpose of this trip is not only to inform Truman and Marshall of the current situation in China, but also to report all the facts to Chairman Chiang. He agreed that Chiang should not only be the leader of the Kuomintang, but should transcend everything and be the leader of all parties and the people of the whole country. He also agreed that the Kuomintang should open up its regime, and other parties should unconditionally share political responsibilities. Wei said that he has met Chairman Chiang twice in Nanjing for ten days, but has not yet talked about practical issues. He decided to have a long talk with Chairman Chiang again after returning from his trip to the north.

[United Press Nanjing 30th/31st Dispatch] A senior government official told a United Press reporter: "Wei Demai is very capable, and he knows the situation in China like the back of his hand. We don't need to point out everything about the Communists to him, he already knows it well. The Wei Demai delegation can visit the war front these days, and they will be able to fully understand the support that the Chinese Communists receive from Moscow. It is hoped that the 'Friends of China' will not disregard the current threat and repeat the same mistakes as the Japanese invasion." It is reported that Wei Demai has abandoned his efforts to contact the Chinese Communists, believing it to be impossible, but he still hopes to obtain any information submitted by the Chinese Communists.

### Representatives of the Middle Party League Submit Memorandum to Wei, Content Divided into Three Major Parts: Politics, Military, Economy

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th/31st Dispatch] The US Embassy announced that Wei Demai had met with several people on the morning of the 30th/31st.

In addition, Major General Liu Xuesong of the General Command of the Tenth/Eleventh War Zone and Major General Zeng Xigui, Director of the Hearing and Police Department of the General Bureau of Finance, also paid a short visit. Wei devoted most of the day to consulting with his advisors to review the large amount of information and documents collected in recent days, and also shifted some of his attention to planning his upcoming trip to North and Northeast China. Wei had lunch during work hours and had dinner with the Minister.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Representatives of the Chinese Middle Party League visited Wei on the morning of the 31st from 11:11 to 12:30 for a long talk, discussing the current political, economic, and educational issues in China. During the conversation, they mentioned that the democratic economy of the Soviet Union is a collective system, the United States is free competition, and China's Principle of People's Livelihood is quite suitable for the national conditions, and talked about China's Doctrine of the Mean. Finally, they discussed China's education issues. They had a conversation for more than an hour, but had not finished speaking, so they agreed to talk again with the party representatives after his trip to Peiping and return to Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Lin Donghai, chairman of the Middle Party League, which is composed of the National Freedom Party, the Democratic Rule Party, the People's Livelihood Progressive Party, and the Moderation Party, and four standing committee members including Zhao Weiwen, told reporters after visiting the Wei envoy that they had provided Wei with a memorandum containing three major parts: politics, economy, and military: (1) In the political aspect, they believed that the two major barriers in domestic and international politics

### Grain Conference Concluded Yesterday, Revised Implementation Measures for Requisition and Loan Passed, Quotas for Requisition and Loan in Jiangsu and Sichuan Provinces Determined

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The 36th Annual Grain Conference concluded on the 31st. Before the closing ceremony, the third general meeting was held, attended by 75 people, including provincial chairmen, righteousness chiefs, and heads of grain bureaus. Wang Yunwu chaired, and Grain Chief Yu Feipeng reported on the results of discussions in various provinces, stating briefly: The original plan for this year's grain demand was 45 million dan, but after discussions with various provinces, the total of requisition and loan was only over 30 million dan, short of over 10 million dan. It was decided that the part to be purchased would be purchased from overseas. Then, Yu read out the revised plan for the implementation of requisition and loan of grain, discussed it in terms of wording, made slight revisions, and passed it (original text see another article). After the meeting, the closing ceremony was held, still chaired by Wang Yunwu, who delivered the closing remarks, and the ceremony was completed.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The Ministry of Food has scheduled to convene a seminar on grain business review for the heads of grain bureaus of various provinces on the 2nd (that is, the land tax conference), with a meeting period of half a day to one day.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The quotas for requisition and loan in Jiangsu Province have been determined. The principle is one part requisition and half loan. The loan amount is 24 million yuan, 6 sheng per yuan, totaling 1.44 million dan, doubled for the requisition amount, excluding public grain. [Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 31st Dispatch] In order to strengthen the requisition work, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau has replaced the heads of grain bureaus in various places who have not performed well in requisition work. Zhu Shaoqing has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Suzhou Grain Bureau, Yang Dehuai has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Yixing Grain Bureau, and Quan Xingzu has been reassigned as the deputy head of the Qingpu Grain Bureau. [Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 31st Dispatch] Regarding the transfer of food (including husked rice, wheat, and flour) from other ports through Zhenjiang to South and North China, it is now heard that the provincial government has approved the Ministry of Food's telegram, which must first be reported to the Ministry of Food for approval before shipment, otherwise it will not be allowed to leave the province.

[Our Newspaper Chengdu 31st Dispatch] Sichuan's original quota for requisition this year had already been determined. Later, in order to mobilize for suppressing the rebellion, the central government decided to requisition and loan again, and convened a national grain conference. It has now been decided that Sichuan's quota for requisition this year will be readjusted according to the following principles: (1) The total amount of requisition and loan is 9 million shi. (2) Universal requisition, without conversion to legal tender. (3) Grain loans and public grain due this year will be purchased by the central government at market price. The provincial government has now divided the 154 counties and cities in Sichuan into three phases, starting requisition from September 1st, and has scheduled a provincial administrative conference in mid-August to discuss requisition mobilization and other issues.

### Provincial Chairmen in Nanjing Hold Provincial Administration Talks

[Central News Agency Nanjing 30th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has twice invited provincial chairmen in Nanjing to hold administrative seminars to study provincial administration reform plans. It has now been decided to hold a third consultation meeting at 9 pm on the 31st to continue exchanging opinions. , will inevitably lead to a third world war. Therefore, it is advocated that China should only have an independent central government. This government should include middle parties and free members of all parties. The current transitional government should be expanded and reorganized. This autumn's general election should also be open to all parties, not limited to the three parties in power. The Northeast issue must be resolved. It is hoped that the United States will pay attention to it and assist China in recovering the Northeast and obtaining the victory of the eight-year war of resistance. (2) In the economic aspect, after eight years of war of resistance, followed by civil strife, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, wealth is concentrated in a few bureaucratic capitalists, and fiscal policy has not been established based on economic realities, resulting in an unbalanced budget and inflation. Therefore, it is suggested that loans should be used and the gold standard should be adopted to reform and stabilize the monetary system. Effective measures should be taken immediately to curb price increases to maintain people's livelihood. Personnel and systems should be overhauled in both aspects. Economic and financial institutions should allow private capital (especially overseas Chinese capital) and foreign capital to develop fully, encourage foreign trade, and promote economic prosperity. (3) In the military aspect, they believe that no political party should have an independent army, otherwise civil strife will inevitably occur due to disputes over political rights, and international wars will be triggered due to the opposition of ideological barriers. Therefore, the reform of China's military must aim at eliminating the possession of independent armies by political parties. In the conclusion of the memorandum, they pointed out: (1) "Defend independence and territorial integrity. The Yalta secret agreement decided that China should give up certain interests to the Soviet Union in order to maintain peace in the Far East. However, today's situation proves that China has suffered significant losses. The Northeast issue has not been resolved and will endanger world peace. The United States participated in the Yalta secret consultation and has a responsibility to assist China in recovering the Northeast. (2) Since the victory, due to the rebellion of the Chinese Communists, the government has restricted some freedoms of the people. The progress made in the eight-year war of resistance has now regressed. (3) The problem with Chinese politics is that many talented people are excluded from government affairs. If this is not reflected upon in the future, it will be difficult to talk about innovation. (4) China must obtain large-scale loans, otherwise there will be a terrible economic bankruptcy in six months. [Agence France-Presse London 30th Dispatch] Regarding General Wei Demai's mission to the Far East for investigation, The Times of London commented: General Wei Demai is not only going to China for food adjustment, but also to Korea for investigation. The US-Soviet Mixed Committee in Korea has encountered many difficulties and has failed to organize a Korean provisional government. The point of disagreement between the US and the Soviet Union lies in the word "provisional". Therefore, officials from the United States and the Soviet Union have failed to reach an understanding. There are many political parties in Korea at present. In terms of the Communist Party, the Soviet Union seems to be still trying to implement its traditional doctrines in Korea, insisting that communism is the best way to achieve democracy. Therefore, it is gratifying that General Wei Demai has been ordered by President Truman to go to China for investigation, and Korea has also been included in his investigation scope.

### Coal Production Conference Opens in Nanjing This Morning

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The Coal Production Increase Conference is scheduled to open at 9 am on the 1st. As of the 31st, more than 20 units have registered, with more than 50 representatives. More than 40 proposals and plans have been received. The conference will last for three days.

### Opening of Trade with Japan Agreed in Principle by the Central Political Committee, Business Inspection Group to Japan in Mid-Month

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The special meeting convened by the Central Political Committee to discuss the issue of opening trade with Japan was held at 9 am on the 31st, chaired by Dai Chuanxian. After more than four hours of debate, a few committee members reorganized the text, and decided in principle to agree to open trade with Japan, but its nature should belong to guiding trade. At the same time, three measures were decided: (1) The selection of personnel and the number of people to be sent to the Japanese business inspection group should be decided by the Executive Yuan, and they should depart before August 15th. (2) The types and quantities of imported and exported goods should be determined by our government according to its needs. (3) Some necessary goods should be designated by the government as compensation goods. The committee members who spoke at the meeting and considered whether to open trade with Japan focused on the crisis facing us at present, fearing that they could not withstand the onslaught of Japanese goods being dumped. Sun Ke also spoke, believing that after the opening, we should still adopt strict controls to prevent Japan from making a comeback and realizing its ambitions for aggressive behavior.

[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai discussed the opening of trade with Japan, saying in essence: Passively opposing the opening is not the best policy. The most important thing is to examine the nature and use of Japanese goods and decide whether to allow them to be imported. Sending commercial representatives to Japan can be carried out at the same time as examining commodities. China's current situation may not have a large supply of coal and iron to Japan, so there is no need to worry about using raw materials to aid the enemy. After the implementation of the commodity inspection method, the import surplus of trade can be prevented. As for the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods, there is no need to worry too much because Japan lacks merchant ships and commercial institutions. Increasing the number of barter trades with Japan by the China Trust Bureau is a very good idea. At the same time, commodities can be classified according to their nature, with state-owned commodities being state-owned and privately-operated commodities being privately-operated.

### Legislative Member Jian Guansan Discusses the Key to Trade with Japan

Our Country Has an Organic Countermeasure

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] Legislative member Jian Guansan told reporters on the 31st regarding trade with Japan that even if trade with Japan is opened now, because the peace treaty has not yet been signed, the types and quantities of imports can be subject to strict quota restrictions. The serious consequences are not now, but in the future. If it is not opened now, but after the peace treaty is established in one or two years, it will still have to be opened. Therefore, the key to the issue of trade with Japan is not only that Japan's future industrial equipment will remain above the level of 1930 to 1937, which poses a permanent threat to our national defense and people's livelihood. Our industrial and commercial circles have not protested sternly against this, and are only discussing the current issue of trade opening, which is indeed a case of abandoning the essential for the trivial. Second, the largest overseas markets for China and Japan are both in Southeast Asia. We should submit a concrete plan to the Far Eastern Commission to restrict Japan's activities in Southeast Asia to prevent its economic imperialism from reviving. Third, we must deeply reflect on ourselves. Relying solely on the export of raw materials is a backward economic performance with no future. We must devote ourselves to the rationalization movement of industry, that is, the modernization of machinery, the standardization of products, and the official pricing, so that we have the qualifications to open up overseas markets. Fourth, Japan's rigorous starvation export and its determination to revive are enough to warn our country's officials and the public, while the extravagance and luxury in our big cities and the sluggish atmosphere of society are in stark contrast. In comparison, how can we stand on our own? Fifth, Japan currently has 330,000 spindles, and Meng Zong is planning to expand Japanese spindles to 6 million. Japan itself also has a four-year plan to expand silk, all of which are greatly detrimental to our country's textile industry and silk industry. Our country should have organic countermeasures internally and externally to avoid harm in the future. Sixth, the profit from Japanese goods smuggling into the country through Hong Kong and Macao is more lucrative than transporting and selling British and American goods. This should also be brought under control.

### Third Quarter Import Classification Numbers, National Economic Commission Adjusts Quotas, Foreign Exchange Will Be Given to Develop National Industry, Property Donation Case Submitted to Subcommittee for Review

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 31st Dispatch] The National Economic Commission held its ninth meeting at 3 pm on the 31st, chaired by President Zhang. Important proposals included the "Property Donation Levy Plan" submitted by the Ministry of Finance. According to the Ministry of Finance, the name "Special Donation for National Construction" is easily misunderstood as a voluntary donation, and it is feared that the change of name will affect the actual efficiency of future collection, resulting in the loss of the original purpose of establishing this tax. However, the original "One-Time Property Tax" is different from the meaning of the temporary capital donation, so it is renamed "Property Donation" to correct the hearing and facilitate collection. The content starts from 500 million yuan and adopts a progressive method. The supervisory body is organized by representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and public opinion organs, social elites, and financial experts. Each province and city establishes a branch, with the provincial chairman and mayor as the chairman. Because the content of this case is numerous, it will be submitted to the Finance Subcommittee for preliminary review. Another important case discussed at the meeting was the proposal submitted by the Import Management Committee regarding the allocation of import classification quotas for the third quarter. The committee members greatly adjusted the distribution of imports for the third quarter (August, September, and October) based on the principle of cherishing foreign exchange and reducing unnecessary imports. Wang Yunwu advocated reducing the amount of kerosene, Li Jingji advocated reducing the amount of cotton, Jian Guansan advocated reducing the amount of tobacco leaves and gasoline, and increasing the amount of Zhou Pei instruments, aircraft parts, and buses. Chen Fang advocated reducing the amount of wool. As a result, adjustments were made according to the above opinions, reducing a total of 7.37 million US dollars, and 500,000 US dollars of the reduced amount will be used as foreign exchange for purchasing foreign painting instruments. In the future, foreign exchange supply will be used to develop national industry. For production equipment and parts, it will be increased from 1.6 million US dollars per month to 2 million US dollars.

### Details of Fu Zhong and Other Company Incidents to Be Announced Soon, Responsible Authorities Currently Collecting Information

[Central News Agency Feng City News] Since the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai listed that Fu Zhong, Yang Yu and other companies violated import and export regulations and applied to the National Bank for a large amount of foreign exchange to import prohibited goods, the authorities of Yangzi and Fu Zhong companies published a large advertisement on the 31st with relevant statements. In order to clarify the details of the National Bank's approval of foreign exchange, a Central News Agency reporter visited senior officials of the National Bank on the 31st. According to reports, the total amount of our country's exchange settlement is related to the country's foreign exchange resources, so it cannot be announced. However, the central government attaches great importance to the Fu Zhong and Yangzi incidents. The responsible authorities have now started to collect as much information as possible from relevant parties, and it is expected that details will be announced soon. It will not be difficult to find out the actual situation. Before this bank receives the order from the Ministry of Finance, I have no right to disclose any news to the outside world. Regarding the import of prohibited goods by Yangzi, Fuzhong and other companies, the reporter visited Zhang Fuyun, director of the Import Management Office, again on the 31st, but Zhang was out on official business. According to the person in charge of the office, the issuance of import permits must be handled in accordance with regulations and legal procedures. The Jianghai Customs also needs a permit to allow merchants to import goods. The approval of merchant permits is impartial and there is no favoritism. The automobile import rules stipulate that the original price in 1942 should be within 1,200 US dollars and the number of seats should be limited to 7. The original price is based on the standard of the manufacturer selling to the car dealer, and it must be discounted according to the age. Regarding the approval of wireless radio imports, those who settle foreign exchange at the official price must have placed their orders before November 17, 35, and shipped them out before November 30. If free foreign exchange is used, only those shipped out before December 30 last year are valid.

It corrected the record of the newspaper on the 29th and made two statements: (The following is the original text of the Central Daily News)

### Full Text of Measures for Tax Collection and Grain Loans

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 31] The implementation measures for the 36th year of land tax grain collection and grain loan, has been amended and passed by the third plenary session of the Grain Conference on the 31st. The full text is as follows:

A. Regarding tax collection and loans: (1) In order to meet the needs of the national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, this year's land tax in all provinces and cities should still focus on the collection of physical objects and grain loans as much as possible. However, in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and a few areas in various provinces with inconvenient transportation and insufficient grain production, the land tax and grain loans may be converted into legal tender at the grain price of the two months before the collection was started, subject to approval. The areas where legal tender is converted and the conversion standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Food. (2) The principal and interest of grain bonds due this year shall be offset by the central government's grain loan, and no grain bonds shall be issued for grain loans this year, and no interest shall be calculated. From 1952, it will be offset in five years equally. (3) The amount of land tax to be levied and the standards for collection in each province and city shall still be handled in accordance with the original plan agreed upon by the Ministry of Food and the provinces. The principle of grain loan is to borrow one for every one collected. If there is a reduction or exemption due to disaster, it shall be handled in accordance with the law, and shall be reported for approval. No reduction shall be requested without authorization. (4) Provincial and county (city) public grain will be collected along with the land tax, and the amount shall be 30% of the actual collection as a principle. (5) The land tax in each province and city shall still be collected on the approved date, and shall not be extended without approval. (6) If the land tax serial tickets have not been printed in the format previously issued by the Ministry of Food, a "Loan" column should be added after "Collection". Those who have already been printed in the format should add a stamp on each link of the original serial ticket: "Loaned this year (grain) (wheat), □ stone □ bucket □ liter □ combine", and collect it at the same time as the collection of public grain. (7) The land tax in all provinces, counties, and cities must be fully collected within three months after the start of collection. If it is not paid in full after the deadline, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 16, 17, 18, and 19 of the Wartime Land Tax Collection Regulations. In areas where legal tender is converted, in addition to doubling the late payment penalty, the conversion standard may be adjusted.

B. Regarding allocation and purchase: (1) All grain loans from provinces and cities shall be remitted to the central government. The land tax portion shall still be in accordance with the current financial revenue and expenditure system, with 30% for the central government, 20% for the province, and 50% for the county (city) in each province; 40% for the central government and 60% for the city in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Provincial public grain will be divided equally between the province and the county, and all public grain in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan will belong to the city. (2) The physical objects obtained from the land tax collection belonging to the provincial and county local governments will be purchased by the central government and used for overall allocation (provincial, county, and city public grain will still be used by local governments and will not be purchased). The purchase methods are as follows: 1. The purchase quantity shall be agreed upon by the Ministry of Food and the provinces at one time and divided equally into four periods for valuation and payment. 2. The price shall be determined by region based on the grain price in August, November, February next year, and May, based on one-quarter of the total quantity. 3. The payment shall be made in September, December, March next year, and June according to the amount payable in each period. 4. The month of valuation and payment for wheat collection provinces may be advanced according to the collection period. (3) The grain obtained from the collection and loan of grain in various provinces (including the purchase of provincial and county grain) shall be used for military grain as a priority. Without approval, it shall not be used without authorization. If the central government's collected and loaned grain and the purchased provincial and county grain are still insufficient for military grain needs, they shall be transferred from neighboring provinces. If there is no grain available for transfer, or the transferred grain is still insufficient for military grain needs, the Ministry of Food shall purchase it at the market price in the required or other grain-producing areas with cash to make up for the shortage.

C. Regarding agency expenses: (1) Provincial grain bureaus shall, depending on the number of currency-collecting counties, streamline the allocation of personnel with reference to the organizational structure issued by the ministry in the 35th year. (2) All physical object-collecting counties shall set up land and grain bureaus and township offices and storage warehouses. The number of settings and the staffing shall be planned and allocated by the provincial land and grain bureaus within the total number of people set by the ministry, and shall not exceed it. The original agencies in currency-collecting counties and cities shall be abolished and handed over to the county and city governments, and the land and grain sections shall be preserved. (3) The number of provincial storage and transportation agencies shall be determined by the ministry based on the circumstances. (4) The provincial bureau and the land and grain bureaus, township offices, storage warehouses, and storage and transportation agencies in the physical object-collecting counties shall bear all the necessary regular expenses, living expenses, printing costs of land tax books and serial tickets, collection business expenses, and acceptance tool expenses. Among them, the book expenses, collection business expenses, and acceptance tool expenses shall be paid by the ministry in advance from the grain expenses before the additional budget is approved. (5) The collection expenses required by the currency-collecting counties and cities, including the land tax list and the printing costs of serial tickets, shall still be shared by the central government and the provincial, county, and city governments in proportion to the income. Among them, the expenses to be allocated shall be paid by the county and city governments within 5% of the central government's share of the collection, and shall be included in the county and city budgets. The regular expenses, living subsidies, and land tax book printing expenses required for handling land and grain affairs in cities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan shall be shared by the central government and the city in proportion to the income. (6) The total household registration fees, land tax collection fees, land reporting review and correction fees, compilation of land tax books fees, and adjustment of land tax rules fees for the physical object-collecting and currency-collecting counties shall still be borne by the central government and local governments.

D. Regarding supervision and monitoring: (1) The governments of all provinces, cities, and counties and the land and grain agencies shall fully promote the physical object collection and loan business. During the peak collection period, the responsible personnel of the provinces, cities, and counties shall go to various places to supervise the collection, and strive to collect in full within the time limit. They shall also simplify the procedures and facilitate the people's payment. Those who fail to perform their duties or use their positions to make things difficult or engage in corruption shall be severely punished in accordance with the law. (2) The supervisory committees for grain loan at all levels shall be established universally within a limited time, and the organization shall be improved in order to strictly supervise and eliminate malpractices. (3) The governments of all provinces and cities shall supervise the land and grain authorities to formulate implementation measures in accordance with the provisions of the Wartime Land Tax Collection Regulations and these measures, and send them to the Ministry of Food for review and submission to the Executive Yuan for record.

### ### The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party: A Fierce Debate

Attempt to Mediate Internal Strife Fails

[Report from this newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party once again missed an opportunity to resolve internal disputes yesterday. On July 27, through the mediation of Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Junmai and Wu Xianzi met at the International Hotel to discuss a plan to eliminate internal disputes. As a result, three points were agreed upon: (1) Restore the party membership of those who were expelled. (2) Cancel the Reform Committee. (3) Reformists participate in this National Congress. At that time, both parties expressed their agreement and signed the record of the conversation as evidence. However, this matter was not mentioned during the daily meetings of the National Congress. Zhang Junmai hoped that Wu Xianzi could attend the National Congress and make a formal proposal. At 6 pm yesterday, Mr. Wu was invited to the headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party, but declared at the meeting that he was not attending, but only came to report. At that time, Representative Li Weichen stood up and spoke, saying that Wu Xianzi was welcomed to the meeting as vice chairman, but hoped that Mr. Wu would formally sign in and then discuss the mediation matter, and detailed the origin of the party's internal disputes. After Mr. Li finished speaking, others continued to speak, including some fierce remarks. Zhang Junmai saw that the situation was not good, and immediately urged that unity should be the priority, and stimulating words should not be said. However, this advice had little effect, the atmosphere in the meeting became worse, and the order was also poor. When the meeting was about to end, Wu Xianzi suggested that the matter be handed over to the presidium of the conference, but was rejected by the attending representatives, resulting in an unhappy ending. Zhang Jun persuaded afterwards: "I agree with the reconciliation plan agreed upon on the 27th, but today it was rejected by the conference. My position is very similar to that of Wilson after the First World War. I myself agree with the decision of the peace conference, but the treaty was rejected by the US Congress. Among the representatives attending the conference, 70% are newly elected representatives, and I cannot control their opinions. As for whether there will be another opportunity for reconciliation in the future, I dare not say now, but the relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and overseas is believed not to be broken. Wu Xianzi's mediation was all well-intentioned, but it was a pity that he lost his rigidity by saying "not attending" when he attended the meeting, which caused difficulties!"

[Another report] The National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party held meetings yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss the draft of the party's general charter. It was passed after three readings at 7 pm. The content is divided into eight chapters and forty-four articles, which are very detailed. The proposals will be reviewed all day today.

### Great Victory at Linqu Rivals Siping, All Communists Inside and Outside the City Have Been Eliminated, Over 40,000 Communists Annihilated, Pursuit Continuing

[Report from this newspaper, Qingdao, July 31] The great victory at Linqu took place at 5 pm on the 30th. Qingdao received this news late at night. Observers believe that this is the Siping Street battle in Shandong, and it has a decisive impact on the war situation in Shandong. When the north and south reinforcements attacked from Nigushan, Muhushan, and Shangshangshangxia Wujing from east and west, and cooperated from inside and outside, the bandits still struggled. The sky was clear and blue, the air force was active, and the artillery fire could also concentrate its firepower. The bandits finally collapsed, their formation was chaotic, and they fled. The defending troops in the city were struggling, and they had reached the point where ammunition and aid were exhausted. They relied entirely on aircraft for supply. It happened that there had been continuous dangerous rain for several days. Thanks to General Li Mi's calm command and the soldiers' hard work, the weather turned sunny on the 30th, and the reinforcements arrived, boosting morale greatly. They used the force of thunder to achieve the victory at Linqu in one fell swoop, and achieved brilliant results. Observers believe that the Communist army launched an offensive on July 7, attacking Taian, invading Feixian, and fleeing south to Taierzhuang, attempting to change its inner line to an outer line and disperse the national army's forces. The national army smashed its dangerous plan, automatically abandoned some strongholds, concentrated its forces, and seized the opportunity to capture its main force and defeat it, thus successively recovering the strongholds. In the battle of Linqu, the Communist bandits originally planned to take advantage of a gap, concentrate their forces, and attack the elite troops of the national army stationed between Linqu and Weicheng. However, the national army was able to fight ten against one, and finally achieved a great victory, thwarting their conspiracy.

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, July 31] The national army in Linqu has won a decisive victory. The Li Mi troops in the city and the reinforcements continued to pursue the seven columns of Chen Yi who were defeated in three routes on the 31st. By the time the telegram was sent, the Communist bandits had suffered more than 40,000 casualties, more than 1,000 were captured alive, and a division of remnant bandits surrounded by the national army north of the city was mostly annihilated by the national army except for a part that broke through and fled north. All circles in Shandong decided to celebrate the great victory at Linqu within days and expand the comforting of the army.

[Report from this newspaper, Qingdao, July 31] After the total collapse of the bandits besieging Linqu, they fled north in three routes on the evening of the 30th. A part of them arrived at the Jiaoji Line late at night and fought fiercely with the security team led by Commissioner Zhang Tianzu west of Yaogou. Division Commander Li Mi personally led his troops to pursue the bandits fleeing to Yidu. There were no bandit traces inside and outside Linqu City.

[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, July 31] The remnants of the seven columns of the Communist bandits' East China Field Army who invaded Linqu fled in panic along the Jiaoji Road last night. The Communist bandits suffered more than 60,000 casualties in the past seven days. The 8th and 9th columns were almost completely destroyed. More than 20,000 Communist bandits from the 1st and 4th columns and the 13th Division of the 5th column who fled to the mountainous areas of southern Shandong have surrendered to the national army with weapons in the past two weeks. More than 7,000 of their remnants are currently being continuously surrounded and annihilated by the national army in Xiucheng, northwest of Tengxian County. Due to lack of ammunition and food, more and more people are surrendering. The national army in western Shandong recovered Yuncheng at 6 pm on the 30th. Fierce fighting is still going on in the Yangshanji area.

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, July 31] The war in southwestern Shandong has become more intense again. After replenishment, five columns of Liu Bocheng's army, two of which recrossed into Yangshanji on the 27th, one column invaded Datianji, about 20 kilometers north of Chengwu, and one column and an independent brigade fled east from Dayiji to Guoliji on the 30th. The national army's powerful army groups are continuing to surround and annihilate them.

[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, July 31] Two columns of bandits who secretly cut the Jinpu Road from the boundary river and Guanqiao of Tengxian and Zouxian have been surrounded by the national army in Jinjiazhuang on the bank of Zhengshan Lake since the 29th. More than half of the first column has been annihilated by the national army. In addition, the remnants of the two columns who fled northeast from Tianshan Zhangwu (southwest of Wenshang) suddenly attacked Ningyang on the 31st. Fierce fighting has broken out again in the suburbs of Ningyang. The national armies from all routes are continuing to encircle and hunt them down.

### ### Communist Bandits in Northeast Attempt to Move Again, Launching Rumor Offensive Claiming They Will Attack Siping Again

[Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The sixth offensive of the Communist bandits in Northeast China is about to begin, with tentative attacks. In the Huaide area of the northern route, the Communist bandits have gathered a part of their main force, intending to attack Gongzhuling. In the Lanping area of the southern route, the Communist bandits are preparing to attack Dashiqiao and Yingkou. In addition, the Communist bandits have recently launched a rumor offensive, claiming that they will attack Siping again in early August. However, judging from the strength of the Communist bandits, it is impossible. A few days ago, the Communist leaders held a military review meeting in Harbin, revealing that the Communist bandits suffered more than 120,000 casualties in the Siping battle. According to documents captured by the Siping military, it is proved that the Communist army suffered 90,000 casualties, which can confirm that the Communist bandits have lost more than half of their main force. However, the bandits are actively replenishing and training in the mountainous areas on the east and west wings of Siping. Their next action deserves attention. Chen Mingren, the commander of Siping, told reporters in a frank and firm tone yesterday: He very much welcomes the Communist bandits to attack Siping again. The military and civilians in Siping are deeply confident in the stability of Siping.

### ### Anti-Communist Campaign in Western Hebei Temporarily Concluded

[Report from this newspaper, Baoding, July 31] The anti-Communist campaign by the national army in western Hebei has temporarily come to an end. The troops under Nie Rongzhen, about 40,000, are currently fleeing from the Taihang Mountain area to Anguo, Dingxian, Xinle, Dongchangshou, and the east side of Pingbao Road in Xingtang, Pingshan, and Lingshou, and are advancing east along the Baocang Highway. The national army has successively withdrawn from Quyang, Tangxian and other places in western Hebei, transferred the battlefield, and surrounded and suppressed the main force of the Communist bandits. In addition, the national army in the Pingjinbao triangular area has launched an anti-Communist campaign, launching offensives from Rongcheng and Gu'an.

### ### "Settling Old Scores" by Shanxi Bandits Creates Rural Terror

[Report from this newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th] The Communist bandits' "settling old scores struggle" is intensifying. They hold so-called "speaking bitterness conferences" everywhere. The method is to struggle after speaking, divide after struggling, whoever speaks gets divided, and then speak, struggle and divide again, creating rural terror. The Communist bandits are forcing the people to grow opium in Xixian, Daning, Yonghe and other counties, and then forcibly buying it at 60,000 yuan per tael in counterfeit currency, and sending it into the national army area in armed forces, attempting to realize the poisoning conspiracy.

### ### Joint Transportation Between Changchun and Shenyang

[Report from this newspaper, Shenyang, July 31] The train between Changchun and Shenyang has been cut off for two and a half months. After the siege of Siping was lifted, civilian mules and carts were relied on to maintain transportation, which took more than a week. The authorities planned joint transportation by train and car. The first joint transportation of passengers and goods arrived in Shenyang on the 30th.

[Another telegram] The car between Changchun and Kaiyuan has resumed traffic. Although the road is bumpy and the passengers are tired, it is still a good news.

### ### At the United Nations Membership Committee, Xu Shuxi Upheld Justice and Sternly Refuted the Fallacies of the Soviet Representative

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 310th] Chinese representative Xu Shuxi made a speech at the Security Council Committee today, refuting the statement made by the Soviet representative on the 28th accusing China of being responsible for the Beitashan incident, calling it "Outer Mongolia's occupation of lies." Mr. Xu's speech was the strongest ever made by a Chinese representative at the United Nations, in which he firmly refuted the Soviet representative's statement that the Beitashan area was within Outer Mongolia. Mr. Xu first explained today: He has not yet seen the excerpt of the statement made by Soviet representative Krasilnikov on the 28th, and will only answer it in general. Mr. Xu retorted the Soviet representative's accusation that China invaded Outer Mongolia in order to make the world pay attention to its new chapter, saying: "If the Soviet representative said that Outer Mongolia's ancient invasion of Xinjiang was aimed at assisting traitors in North China, so as to restrain the Chinese government and serve as a second front, then his understanding of the Far East political situation would be more thorough than before." Krasilnikov's remarks when replying to the Chinese representative today seemed milder than those on the 28th. He pointed out that the main point of the Chinese representative was that Beitashan was not within Outer Mongolia, but the Chinese representative failed to effectively refute the statement of the Foreign Minister of Outer Mongolia (which Mr. Ke cited). In addition to stating that the Soviet delegation did not recognize that Beitashan was within China, Mr. Ke also asked: "If this is true, why does China allow armed conflicts to occur within its borders?" Xu Shuxi replied: It is absurd to talk about whether a country can "allow" its teeth to be attacked by others. Krasilnikov not only reiterated today that the Beitashan incident was caused by certain people in China who wanted to shift the world's attention to China's internal situation, but also asked why the Xinjiang incident happened before sending the so-called fact-finding mission to China? Mr. Ke's words were obviously aimed at the Wedemeyer inspection team. He also said: "The statement that there were planes with Soviet red star markings is a shameless lie." Xu Shuxi pointed out that the committee has only heard the Soviet representative mention the participation of planes with Soviet markings in combat up to now. The Polish chairman of the committee suggested that the application of Outer Mongolia to join the United Nations be postponed for discussion so that other representatives could have time to study the statements of the Chinese and Soviet representatives. The motion to postpone the discussion was passed after the US representative stated that the postponement must be temporary.

### ### US Undersecretary of State Talks About the Japanese Peace Conference

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett told a press conference today that the US and other ten representatives of the Far East Commission will discuss and decide on the date of the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty again. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on August 19, but was postponed due to the conflict with the Imperial Conference held in Canberra, Australia on August 26. He did not mention the Washington news published in the New York Herald Tribune today. The news said: China opposed the US proposal, that is, the eleven countries of the Far East Commission have the right to vote when concluding the Japanese peace treaty, because this will make China unable to obtain the right to speak commensurate with the huge sacrifices it suffered in the war. The New York newspaper report may be based on the recent proposal put forward by the National Political Council in Nanjing.

[Another telegram] The Central News Agency reporter learned from a reliable source tonight that the Chinese government's reply to the US invitation to attend the preliminary meeting of the eleven countries for the Japanese peace treaty was submitted to the State Department on July 24. According to the spokesman of the hospital, he said earlier this week and today that he had not received the Chinese reply, and the Nanjing reply has not been announced.

### U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board Reviews China National Aviation Corporation's Landing Application

### After the Suspension of Relief Supplies to North China, UNRRA Proposes a New Plan, Huo Bao-Shu and Cleveland Arrive in Nanjing to Meet the Chairman

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Huo Bao-Shu, Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and Cleveland, Director of UNRRA's China Office, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai together on the 31st and met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the afternoon to present the current state of relief and rehabilitation matters.

[Our Newspaper Report] UNRRA's headquarters in Washington announced yesterday that until a more satisfactory agreement is reached on the distribution of relief supplies in the Communist areas, the supply of relief materials to North China, including both government and Communist areas, will be temporarily suspended. This order is effective from July 28th. All materials scheduled for delivery to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude, including North China and Jehol, whether destined for government or Communist areas, will be held in custody by UNRRA's China Office. UNRRA's action follows the formal statement by the Chinese government that it cannot protect the distribution of supplies in the war zones. UNRRA believes that this violates the principle of fair distribution of relief supplies and has brought it to the attention of the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee. After investigation, the Far East Regional Committee submitted a recommendation for suspension to the UNRRA Central Committee. After consideration, the Central Committee immediately ordered a temporary suspension and, at the same time, proposed a new plan to Chairman Chiang, under which 50,000 tons of the originally agreed 83,000 tons of materials that had not yet been shipped would be transported to Communist-controlled areas.

Content of the New Plan

The content of the new plan is as follows: (1) Designate fixed three-week periods in August, September, and October, and consider Yantai as a "safe harbor" under wartime regulations, so that UNRRA's free ships can transport UNRRA relief and rehabilitation supplies into Yantai. Another part of this proposal is that the Communist authorities should provide assurances that when UNRRA ships are anchored in Yantai, the port will not be used for any military activities, including the supply of materials. (2) Transport 25,000 tons of supplies from Tianjin along the Grand Canal into Communist-controlled areas for a period of two weeks, in a "blitz" transportation operation, first in September, then in September and October. During this period, the area from Tianjin along the Grand Canal south to Botou (in Hebei Province, approximately 75 miles southwest of Tianjin) should be demilitarized. In addition, the continuation of the Yellow River project is also under negotiation.

If the above new plan is agreed to by the Chinese government, UNRRA's China Office will be ordered to obtain the necessary guarantees from the Communist side. The UNRRA Central Committee has set a deadline of the 15th to obtain the agreement of both the government and Communist leaders to this new plan. If the plan cannot be implemented by then, the Central Committee will re-evaluate UNRRA's China relief plan.

### Editorial: UNRRA Suspends Supply of Materials to North China

UNRRA headquarters announced yesterday that it has suspended the transport of relief supplies to both the Communist-controlled areas and government-administered areas of North China, effective from the 28th of this month. UNRRA's China Office explained that this was because the Chinese government recently declared that it could no longer protect the distribution of relief supplies in the war zones. Thus, the transport of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas by UNRRA goes against the principle of equal distribution of relief supplies. Therefore, the UNRRA Far East Regional Committee was asked to pay attention to this matter. After consideration, the committee proposed the suspension of transport to North China to UNRRA headquarters. The UNRRA Central Executive Committee then instructed the China Office to comply, and proposed two measures for the Chinese government to accept. We have many feelings regarding UNRRA's decision. Now, we will state one or two points for the reference of people both inside and outside the country:

First, UNRRA was created during the difficult times of the Great War. At that time, everyone foresaw the economic difficulties of the people of the war-torn countries. To prepare in advance, this international relief organization was established in the United States before the end of the war. Since the victory of the war, UNRRA has begun relief work in Europe and Asia, and has now been doing so for more than a year and a half. European and Asian countries, especially those devastated by the war, have indeed benefited greatly. However, in China, which is in dire need of relief, UNRRA's work seems to be far less successful than in other countries. We believe that the reason for this is due to the following two factors: one is that UNRRA personnel have an unclear understanding of the political situation in China and often cannot cooperate harmoniously with the Chinese government on the issue of relief to the Communist-controlled areas; the other is the problem of UNRRA personnel themselves. Although ordinary Chinese people often see news in the newspapers about relief supplies coming to China in a steady stream, how much benefit have they actually received?

Second, UNRRA insists that relief supplies transported to China should be distributed fairly, regardless of whether they are government-administered areas or Communist-controlled areas. In principle, we can certainly agree with this, because the people in the Communist-controlled areas are also our pitiful and innocent compatriots and should receive UNRRA's relief. However, the question is not whether it should or should not be done, but whether the people there can truly receive the materials after UNRRA transports them to the Communist-controlled areas? Will they fall into the hands of the Communists and become provisions for bandits? UNRRA personnel certainly cannot understand this issue. We may as well tell them about the actual situation in the Communist-controlled areas. Not to mention that UNRRA's supplies will not be distributed to the people, even the daily necessities of the people themselves cannot be retained for their own use. Therefore, UNRRA's transport of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas is nominally providing relief to the people there, but in reality, it is no different from aiding the Communists and cultivating their strength to create chaos and harm the country. Since the government has issued a clear order to suppress the rebellion and mobilize national manpower and resources to suppress the Communists and build the country, the matter of UNRRA providing aid to the Communists cannot be allowed to continue!

Third, UNRRA is using "suspension of transport" as a means to coerce the Chinese government into accepting its proposed measures, and this approach is even less tolerable to us. Here, we cannot help but ask our government: How many supplies has UNRRA transported to China in total? Would the Chinese people completely die without UNRRA's relief? Have the people of China suffered great famines in history without foreign relief, and then become extinct? The Chinese nation is a great and unyielding nation. Rather than wagging our tails and begging for "charity," it is better to clench our teeth, endure hunger and cold, and seek a way to self-reliance. Therefore, we want to suggest that the government resolutely reject UNRRA's proposals, with absolutely no room for consideration. If UNRRA insists on its own way, then we would rather let UNRRA's work in China end sooner.

Fourth, UNRRA's nature is different from ordinary charitable organizations. It has the task of stabilizing the social economy of various countries in the post-war world. It should pay special attention to the internal and actual situation of each country affected by the war. UNRRA personnel should have a long-term perspective when allocating relief supplies. They must not base their decisions on personal prejudices, otherwise the country being aided will not only fail to benefit from it, but also run the risk of further disrupting the country's social economy.

### The Dike of Northern Jiangsu Breaks, Mu, Pi, and Other Counties Report Disaster, Land Travel by Boat, Hope for Autumn Harvest Lost

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] Continuous windstorms and rain have caused the waters of the Yi, Shu, and Canal Rivers to surge, and the dikes of the Central Canal have collapsed in many places. The water is raging, and the counties of Shuyang, Pi, Suqian, and Donghai are a vast expanse of water. Land travel is by boat, and hope for the autumn harvest is lost. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has received repeated telegrams from the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau and various counties reporting the disaster situation. It is taking the situation very seriously. In addition to constantly instructing the counties to work together to rescue, the need for funds and materials is urgent. A special urgent telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Water Conservancy to promptly approve and allocate the province's flood prevention funds for application to avoid the expansion of the disaster.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] The central government has allocated 1 billion yuan to urgently relieve the water disaster in northern Jiangsu. The amounts allocated to each county are determined as follows: Funing 80 million, Jiancheng 50 million, Lianshui 50 million, Shuyang 50 million, Ganyu 50 million, Dongtai 60 million, Xinghua 50 million, Huaiyin 70 million, Huaian 30 million, Siyang 50 million, Haiment 20 million, Donghai 40 million, Guanyun 50 million, Rugao 20 million, Suqian 20 million, Taixian 10 million, Nantong 10 million, Baoying 10 million, Xuzhou area 210 million, Jiangdu 20 million, Lianyungang 10 million, Provincial Capital 40 million, totaling 1 billion yuan.

### The Flow of Jing River in Shaanxi Gradually Decreases

Heavy Rain in Northern Shaanxi at the Beginning of the Week Seen Only Once in 20 Years

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 31st] A Central News Agency telegram yesterday stated that the flow of the Jing River had broken all previous records, which is greatly different from the report of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau. According to the upper reaches of the Jing River, there was heavy rain on the 29th, and the river water surged. The maximum flow rate reached 11,400 cubic meters per second, but it did not break the highest record of 13,000 cubic meters per second. The weather has been clear for three days, and the flow rate has gradually decreased. By tomorrow, it should be completely cleared.

Many bridges in the area were washed away, and traffic has not yet resumed.

### External Transportation of Fuzhou Falls Into a State of Isolation

Sea, Air, and Land Routes Are All Blocked

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 31st] Recently, external transportation in Fuzhou has become isolated due to the reduction in the number of ships and aircraft. The Fuzhou-Shanghai route currently has no scheduled passenger transport. The Fuzhou-Taiwan route only has one small boat going back and forth, and the schedule is uncertain. Each flight is extremely crowded. As for routes to Tianjin and other ports, there are no scheduled ships, relying solely on a small number of freighters to take passengers. Although China National Aviation Corporation has a station in Fuzhou, it has not landed in Fuzhou recently for some reason. Only one flight from Shanghai to Nanchang and Hankou via Fuzhou lands once a week, with limited seats and difficulty in purchasing tickets. The Fuzhou-Xiamen highway is still under construction, and most of the highways in northwestern Fujian are damaged and impassable. Therefore, traveling from Fuzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other places requires trekking through barren mountain roads. Under these circumstances where sea, air, and land transportation are all blocked, Fuzhou has become an isolated place, cut off from the outside world.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The old traitor Yin Rugeng was sentenced to death again by the Capital High Court on the 30th. At 10 a.m., Presiding Judge Chuan Qinqing and others opened the court in the Grand Achievement Hall and brought the traitor to the court. After clarifying his identity, the judgment was read out: "Yin Rugeng colluded continuously with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country. He is sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, and all property will be confiscated, except for a reasonable amount of living expenses reserved for family members." Yin's expression changed greatly upon hearing the verdict, and he was at a loss. President Zhao Chen told our reporter that Yin's case is a valuable legal case.

His crimes are extremely heinous. The court, legally speaking, believes that Yin has no reason not to die. He finally stated that the judgment of this retrial will still be sent to the Supreme Court for review.

### India and Australia Request Arbitration of the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute: The Security Council Begins Discussion; Britain and the United States Still Plan to Mediate Informally

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 31st. The Security Council began discussing the proposal by India and Australia at 3:00 PM today to prevent the Dutch-Indonesian war. Originally, the Security Council was to discuss the Balkan issue, but it has now decided to give priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue. According to well-informed sources, the Netherlands is making every effort to prevent the United Nations from intervening in the Dutch-Indonesian war. Therefore, the Security Council is taking the lead in mediation, giving priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue and temporarily suspending the debate on the Balkan issue. It is reported that the Security Council's discussion of the Dutch-Indonesian issue will be short-lived, and if no resolution is reached, it will be shelved and the Balkan issue will be addressed again. The Security Council's swift action to give priority to the Dutch-Indonesian issue has reportedly doomed the Netherlands' attempt to prevent the United Nations from intervening in the Dutch-Indonesian war.

[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] Official sources stated today that the Chinese government will support Australia's submission of the Indonesian issue to the United Nations. China's primary concern is to quickly stop the Indonesian war to avoid endangering the lives and property of overseas Chinese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet formally decided on instructing the Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council to support Australia's actions, but the Chinese government is prepared to support any concrete steps that can stop the Indonesian war.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett publicly confirmed here on the 30th for the first time that the U.S. government has discussed the Indonesian issue with Britain and other countries in the past ten days. Officials here believe that the Security Council is almost unanimously of the opinion that peaceful resolution steps must be taken quickly, but the positions of the various countries differ. India advocates that the United Nations immediately condemn the Netherlands' mistakes, while Australia argues that the United Nations should intervene based on the grounds that "the Indonesian issue is sufficient to endanger world peace."

[Reuters, London, 30th] Judging from Foreign Secretary Bevin's answers to questions from members of the House of Commons, the British government still seems to favor mediation rather than appealing to United Nations institutions to end the Indonesian dispute. Bevin also revealed that the British government is continuing to exchange views with the United States, so some have speculated that Britain and the United States may take joint action to try to get the Dutch government to end the Indonesian conflict.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons that the British government has already prohibited the Netherlands from transporting war materials to the Dutch East Indies via Singapore and other British territories in the Far East. As for Britain training and equipping Dutch troops, this is a sacred promise that Britain made to the Netherlands when Germany occupied the Netherlands. I can only declare to the Dutch government that we are training and equipping Dutch troops for purposes other than fighting in Indonesia.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] The new Dutch Ambassador to the U.S., Kleffens, recently denied that the United Nations Security Council has the right to interfere in the Dutch-Indonesian issue, and said that the Dutch government has no intention of asking other countries to mediate this dispute. Kleffens went on to deny that the Netherlands was carrying out a "colonial war" in Indonesia, or that it would ask Britain to mediate. He also said that for the past two years, the Dutch representatives attending the Security Council have repeatedly argued that the United Nations Charter only applies to relations between independent countries, and that Indonesia is not an independent country and, in fact, has no government to speak of. At this point, a reporter interrupted him and asked why, if the Dutch government did not recognize it as a republic, it had spent months negotiating with it and had signed agreements with it, treating it as part of the Dutch Imperial Federation? Kleffens refused to answer this directly, only saying that the Netherlands had only hoped that it would be a cooperative representative.

[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 30th] The Dutch cabinet has discussed the matter of India and Australia submitting the Indonesian war to the United Nations for appeal. No official comment has been issued. Unofficial sources say the matter is "deplorable."

According to an announcement by the Ministry of Commerce today, Minister of Commerce Cripps will fly to Paris this afternoon to meet with Clayton, the U.S. Under Secretary of State in charge of economic affairs.

### British Government Firmly Advocates Nationalization of German Coal Mines, Has Not Yet Accepted U.S. Compromise Solution

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Regarding the nationalization of the Ruhr coal mines, a conflict is likely to occur when representatives of Britain and the United States begin to study the issue of increasing production next week. British Foreign Secretary Bevin not only wants to socialize German coal mines, but also other major German industries. However, after U.S. Secretary of State Marshall explored the opinions of members of Congress for several months, he learned that this plan would be difficult to obtain funding from Congress. Most members of Congress in the United States believe that this is a measure to form communism. The United States has offered a compromise solution to the nationalization proposal and the British proposal for "immediate action," proposing a five-year extension and waiting for the German people to resolve it themselves. However, Britain has not yet accepted this U.S. compromise proposal and insists that nationalization will be implemented immediately in the British occupation zone. Therefore, this matter will become a subject of fierce debate when Britain and the United States convene a German coal production conference here next week.

It has not yet been decided whether France's opinion will be presented at the Three-Power Conference or through normal diplomatic channels. Lovett also solemnly denied that misunderstandings had occurred between the State Department and the Department of the Army or General Clay due to the German industrial issue.

### The Soviet Union Opposes Ireland, Portugal, and Other Countries Joining the United Nations

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 30th] When a committee of the United Nations discussed the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Jordan to join the organization today, the Soviet Union worked to prevent their admission to the United Nations. The reasons given by Soviet representative Krasinikov were that Ireland had publicly expressed sympathy for the Axis powers and Franco's Spain during the most critical period of the war. Portugal not only did not aid the Allied countries, but actually aided the enemies of the Allied countries. As for Jordan, the Soviet Union still expressed great doubt about the independence of Jordan.

### Britain's Serious Economic Situation: Socialist Experiments Face Tests

[United Press, London, 30th] After two years of Labour Party rule, Britain is still mired in poverty. Slogans are posted on street corners warning the people of the country: "No work, no food." Ten years of depression, six years of war, plus two years of socialist experiments, Britain lacks electricity, cradles, knives, forks, plates, tractors, cars, textiles, steel, etc. The number of items is countless, almost involving every aspect of life. However, the five-year plan to nationalize basic industries is being strictly implemented without any compromise in accordance with the party program.

In the first year, Congress passed laws on nationalized coal mines, airlines, the Bank of England, and wired and wireless news agencies. In the second year, other laws were passed to nationalize transportation businesses such as railways, buses, and trucks, as well as electricity production. In addition, central and local officials were given the power to manage real estate, guarantee satisfactory crop prices and markets, and force farmers to work hard to cultivate the land, otherwise they would be deprived of their land.

However, the people are still poorly dressed, live in cold houses, and have meager rations. They complain about the government's strict measures. Bread is still rationed, and only limited quantities of ham, fresh meat, and butter are distributed each week. Although the clothing rationing system has been slightly relaxed, the number of vouchers has not increased much, and they are all spent on buying sheets. The housewives' league is quite indignant about this, but the government says that according to statistics, the food distribution situation is better than before the war. Crises are lurking in the future and are expected to follow one after another. Coal is a major resource in Britain, but there is a risk of a shortage again this winter, even if the situation is not as serious as last winter. The government has issued a warning that a shortage of electricity this winter may cause panic again.

According to Commerce Minister Cripps, exports have fallen sharply, with losses of about 200 million pounds, or 800 million U.S. dollars. Of the 3.75 billion U.S. dollars borrowed from the United States, half has been used up in less than a year, most of it spent on food. If it is all used up, unless loans continue to be taken out, otherwise they will starve. Steel production is gradually increasing, but it is only enough to supply 80% of the country's reconstruction and export needs. The nationalization of steel will be discussed at the next parliament meeting this fall.

Last winter's heavy snow and floods destroyed about 25% of the country's cattle and sheep, and destroyed thousands of acres of wheat fields, resulting in a one-month delay in the harvest of vegetables and other crops. The government promised farmers more benefits to increase grain production this season, and began to abolish subsidies for certain types of food, and invested funds, which led to soaring prices. The next general election was originally scheduled for 1950, but there are rumors that it will be held earlier due to the urgency of the crisis.

The Conservative Party has formulated an industrial plan that emphasizes private enterprise, but also recognizes the achievements of socialization, such as the nationalization of coal mines. The Ministry of Finance is very troubled by financial issues. Experts are trying to reduce British pound debt, but have not succeeded. Trade talks with Moscow, in which Britain hoped to exchange machinery for Soviet wheat and timber, have broken down. The left wing of the Labour Party is dissatisfied with the status quo and has "rebelled" twice. Prime Minister Attlee attended a secret meeting at the request of Labour Party members today to report on the policy of dealing with the economic crisis, and it is reported that he has obtained approval.

### Royal Arrives in Germany

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 30th] U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal arrived here today to confer with U.S. military government governor Clay and other committee members. Official sources said that Royal's visit was to consult with military government officials in view of the importance of the German occupation mission.

### The Soviet Union Sends a Note to Britain Proposing to Postpone the Ratification of the Treaty

[Reuters, London, 30th] A spokesman for the Foreign Office said that the Soviet government has sent a note to the British government expressing the hope that the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland will be postponed until the former enemy countries themselves ratify their treaties. At the same time, it stated that the Soviet Union, in principle, is not opposed to the ratification of the peace treaties with the five former enemy countries. Authoritative sources expect that the British government will not accept this attitude of the Soviet Union. The reason given is that it cannot be established for enemy countries that have already ratified the treaty themselves, such as Finland. This move by the Soviet Union will not only delay the entry into force of the treaty, but also prevent the meeting to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies from being held. The Soviet Union has previously stated that it is unwilling to discuss the issue of Italian colonies before the peace treaty with Italy comes into effect.

### Two British Soldiers Kidnapped in Greece, Still Missing

### Soviet Union Provides Assistance to Yugoslavia to Realize Industrialization Plans

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] Today, the local newspapers reported that the statement on the business agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on the 25th stated that since the two countries agreed on the direction of economic cooperation on June 10, 1946, development has become increasingly close, so it was decided to conclude this agreement for the exchange of goods, stipulating that the Soviet Union will transport industrial equipment to Yugoslavia in 1948 to help it build various factories. Starting in 1950, Yugoslavia will begin to fulfill its obligations to the Soviet Union, transporting products to the Soviet Union or paying for Soviet machinery in currency. The newspapers continued to comment that the Soviet Union is now providing such effective assistance to Yugoslavia, and its purpose is to enable the country to realize its industrialization plan and its economic development.

### Dissatisfied with Soviet Representatives' Abuse of the Veto, the U.S. Will Take Retaliatory Action; Greece Will File New Complaints on the Balkan Issue

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 31st: The Soviet Union has vetoed the U.S. proposal on the Balkan situation. In response to the Soviet Union's exercise of its veto power, Britain and the United States have decided to take retaliatory measures. Encouraged by Britain and the United States, Greece has decided to invoke Section 7 of the United Nations Charter to accuse its neighboring countries of aggression to the Security Council again. Greece's new accusations will prevent the Balkan issue from being affected by the Soviet veto and keep it on the Security Council's agenda.

[United Press, Lake Success, 31st] Well-informed sources here said today that after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power in the United Nations Security Council on the U.S. proposal to establish a Balkan border monitoring group, the United States may take decisive action to seek revenge. U.S. Representative Johnson was summoned back to Washington by Secretary of State Marshall yesterday to assist in drafting countermeasures. He returned here this morning, presumably carrying a concrete plan, which will announce the next step of the United States at this afternoon or evening's meeting. Although the content of the countermeasures decided by the State Department and Johnson is not yet known, it does not go beyond the following three routes:

(1) Based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter on punitive measures, condemn Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania for directly threatening world peace, and request the Security Council to discuss it. (2) According to the United Nations emergency provisions, urge the five major powers of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the measures that can be implemented. (3) Submit the entire Balkan issue to the United Nations General Assembly, so that a border monitoring group can be established without the use of veto power, but if the Balkan countries do not agree, this kind of monitoring group still cannot perform its duties within the borders of each country. Official sources admit that one of the above three routes will have serious consequences for the United Nations, but on the other hand, after the Soviet Union exercised its veto power, the situation was already extremely serious, tantamount to openly challenging the United Nations' power to maintain world peace.

Liu stated: "I took up the puppet position at the invitation of Chen Jintao, the puppet Minister of Finance. During my time in the puppet position, there are two things worth mentioning: (1) I tried to rescue the underground worker Lin Tianguan. Lin was an education worker from the rear who came to Shanghai to investigate the education situation under the enemy and the puppets. He was arrested by the enemy's military police.

(2) I provided assistance to the family of Feng Anbang. Feng was a division commander under Sun Lianzhong and died in the Battle of Taierzhuang. I provided living expenses for his family in Peiping."

### Sudden Decrease in Water Supply in Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's Supply Area; Company Discovers Leak in Main Pipe; Repairs Expected to Take Two Weeks

Recently, the water supply in the area supplied by Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas of this city has suddenly decreased. Often, there is no water on the upper floors, and the water flow on the lower floors is also weak. To understand the reason, our reporter visited the person in charge of the company. According to the discussion: "At 1:30 PM on the 29th of this month, the water pressure in the company's water plant suddenly dropped by 15 pounds, resulting in a sudden decrease in the water supply in the supply area. Employees were dispatched to inspect the distribution of major water pipes. At the intersection of Wenshui Road and Yinhang Road, it was discovered that there was a severe leak in the 36-inch diameter cast iron main pipe. Technicians were immediately summoned for emergency treatment. However, due to the difficulty of the project, it may take about two weeks to repair. The damage to this 36-inch main pipe was due to the fact that during the period when the area was occupied, the Japanese moved the main pipe to the west side to expand the road, resulting in it being very close to the aircraft field's protective wall river. The location of the accident was at the bend of the river. The rapid flow of water in the river caused the bottom of the main pipe to become hollow and sink, and several iron pipe joints became detached and leaked. It is necessary to build dams at both ends of the river to cut off the water and drain it before construction can begin. During the repair period, another main pipe will be used to divert water, but the water supply will inevitably be slightly reduced. We hope that users will conserve water."

### Wartime Deposit Dispute: Appeal Court Orders Thousandfold Compensation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court yesterday ruled on a case involving a wartime deposit dispute, ordering the bank to pay compensation at a rate of one thousand times the original deposit. Wang Zhenxing had deposited 5,000 legal tender yuan in the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank for a total of five years, from 1940 to 1945. After the victory, due to the devaluation of the currency, he filed a lawsuit in court, requesting compensation at an increased rate. The District Court initially ruled that the Shanghai Bank should pay compensation at a rate of three hundred times. Wang, dissatisfied, appealed to the High Court. After careful investigation, the High Court ruled that the defendant, Shanghai Bank, should pay compensation at a rate of one thousand times, and that if the plaintiff, Wang Zhenxing, provided a guarantee of 3 million yuan, the judgment would be executed immediately.

### Courts Continue to Accept Deposit Dispute Cases

[Our Newspaper's Report] Disputes over requests from depositors for increased payments on wartime fixed deposits are piling up. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Justice issued an order approving the banking sector's request to no longer accept litigation cases involving increased payments on deposits, but the courts have stated that this is not accurate. The Shanghai Banking Association had previously requested the Ministry of Justice to exempt from preliminary enforcement the court's requirements that banks often grant demands from depositors, as such enforcement often interfered with banking business. The Ministry of Justice has responded to the Banking Association stating that such a demand has no legal basis and thus would be difficult to approve, and added that providing appropriate collateral would allow for exception from preliminary enforcement. The relevant official must weigh the situation and handle as appropriate. The outside world, not understanding the truth, has spread rumors that the courts would no longer be accepting such cases, but this is not true. The courts are still accepting deposit dispute cases as usual.

### District Court Invites Tax Authorities to Discuss Rectification of Tax Revenue; Those Who Violate the Law Will Be Strictly Punished

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau, the provisions of the newly formulated banquet and entertainment tax law stipulate that penalties for all violations and tax evasion cases should be determined by the District Court.

### Only Those with Myopia of 700 Degrees or More Can Apply for Exemption from Military Service

Since the promulgation of the Conscription Law, nearsightedness has been included as a disability that allows for application for exemption from military service. However, the law stipulates that only those with vision below "0.2" can apply for exemption. According to human vision, "1" is the best, followed by "0.9" and "0.8." The smaller the number below zero, the deeper the degree of nearsightedness. Vision of "0.2" corresponds to about 700 degrees, so only those with nearsightedness of 700 degrees or more can be considered disabled and exempt from military service. However, according to general statistics, although there are many eligible young men with nearsightedness, none have such a high degree.

### The Complicated and Entangled Half-Year-Long Issue of the Beiyang Ping Department's Affiliation

— Our Correspondent in Beiping, Song Shaobo

The complicated issue of the Beiyang Ping Department's affiliation has now been resolved by the Ministry of Education, which ordered Peking University to take over. This half-year-long entanglement seems to have come to an end. However, the faculty and staff of the Beiyang Ping Department, less than half of the students, and the alumni association of the Ping University of Technology are still firmly opposed. Therefore, whether Peking University can smoothly take over on August 1st remains to be seen, depending on the development of the opposition. Due to the complexity of this matter, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education specially sent Deputy Minister Tian Peilin to Ping a week ago to make a decision with a quick and decisive approach. Hu Shi and Jin Wenshu, the acting president of Beiyang, are still racking their brains.

The predecessor of the Beiyang Ping Department was the Faculty of Engineering of Peking University. Not a few of its graduates are influential figures in today's society. During the enemy and puppet period, Ping Engineering was changed to the Faculty of Engineering of the puppet Peking University. After the victory, it went through a transitional period of the Provisional University. As the various schools successively resumed operations, the question of its affiliation became an issue. The Ping Engineering Alumni Association strived unsuccessfully to restore the independent Ping Engineering Institute. Joint management by Peking University and Tsinghua University was also unsuccessful, and Peking University's initial takeover was also unsuccessful. As a result, the Ministry of Education assigned it to Beiyang in Tianjin, making it its Ping Department. This was the genesis of the later multi-faceted dispute. (The Beiyang authorities could no longer continue to run it because they were too far away.) This involves the Ministry of Education, the highest authorities of Beiyang, all faculty and staff of the Beiyang Ping Department, two factions of students (mainly the Autonomous Association and the School Protection Association), the Ping University of Technology Alumni Association, and Peking University – seven parties in total. Analyzed, there are three different opinions: (1) maintain the status quo, (2) become independent, (3) be taken over by Peking University.

The Ministry of Education's measures for the Beiyang Ping Department have been criticized for lacking an overall plan and causing many disputes. Whether the Ministry of Education initially had prejudices against it is unknown to outsiders, but its repeated changes of course have certainly demonstrated indecision. After deciding to change the Beiyang Ping Department, it issued a clear order in February to prepare to move to Tianjin. In May, the students went on strike in opposition, and the entire school entered a state of anarchy. Most recently, it announced the takeover by Peking University.

Although the Ping Engineering Alumni Association has repeatedly issued declarations and submitted appeals, it has not attracted the attention of the Ministry of Education. After the entire body of more than 800 students of the Beiyang Ping Department went through the process of opposing the move to Tianjin, they split into two different factions. One faction, centered on the Student Autonomous Association, accounting for about half of the students, after the strike against the move to Tianjin proved effective, mainly worked to demand the takeover by Peking University. At this time, some people said: "The Beiyang Ping Department is like a beautiful young woman without a master, possessing a rich dowry, who frequently sends love glances to Peking University, taking it as her target." This faction of students had no other ill intentions, but simply admired the reputation of Peking University.

The other faction of students, following the wishes of all the faculty and staff, formed the School Protection Association and advocated maintaining the status quo. Although there were many actions in between, they ultimately failed. On July 28, the Professors' Association published three objections from this faction. They believed that firstly, President Jin, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Education, agreed to the takeover by Peking University without considering the opinions of all parties in the Ping Department. Secondly, after Deputy Minister Tian Peilin came to Ping, he acted secretly, avoiding meeting with anyone from the Ping Department. Even when Chen Jinmin inquired twice by telephone, he replied that he would not come, and only consulted with Peking University, which was not open and fair. Thirdly, Hu Shi also did not consider the opinions of various parties, forcing the merger of two engineering colleges with different academic systems. The Ping Engineering Alumni Association also expressed its attitude, believing that the Ministry of Education did not directly order Beiyang to hand over the Ping Department, but ordered Peking University to take over, because it was under pressure from a certain party. In their remarks, this faction seemed to be too激进, even calling Hu Shi and others "academic warlords," so the meaning of the "certain party" they referred to can be imagined. They also plan to publish an "Open Letter to Students of the World" to express their views specifically. Furthermore, there are rumors that they will expose the inside story of the "academic warlords" when Wedemeyer comes to Ping, which is both laughable and exasperating.

What will Peking University ultimately do? Reject it? Accept it?

On the surface, Hu Shi had repeatedly stated in the past that although the relevant parties hoped that Peking University would take over, he had never considered it. The reason was expressed in his letter to Jin Wenshu, the president of Beiyang, and Chen Jinmin, the director of the Ping Department, on July 25, after the matter was decided. That letter was published to show that he had no intention of turning against the northern part of Beiyang. He said: "I telegraphed Minister Zhu on the 30th (June) stating that it would be best if the Beiyang authorities still resolved this matter, increasing their funding so that they could be responsible for reform and development. The Faculty of Engineering of Peking University has limited manpower and does not want to add to the difficulties… Today, Peking University received an order from the Ministry of Education, and I hope to schedule a meeting…"

What is the reality? Someone described Peking University as follows: "With such a young woman with a rich dowry sending love glances, and with the orders of her parents (the Ministry of Education) and the words of a matchmaker (President Jin of Beiyang), even if the Peking University authorities cannot act like Sima Xiangru picking up with his zither, they cannot remain undisturbed like Liu Xiahui." But why did Hu Shi repeatedly state to reporters that he had not considered it? In fact, Hu had initially seen that the group of faculty and staff who relied on her (the Beiyang Ping Department) for a living were already watching to see if Peking University would take away their rice bowls.

Although the Ministry of Education's clear order for Peking University to take over has arrived, Jin Wenshu and Chen Yimin had already gone to Beijing, lacking responsible persons, and the students of the Beiyang Ping Department's School Protection Association responded to the attitude of the faculty and staff, expressing their refusal to accept the takeover. Therefore, whether Peking University can smoothly get started is still uncertain. (Sent from Beiping on July 28)

### Four-Bank Joint Council Decides: National Cotton Arrival Bills Must Be Redeemed; Cannot Be Converted into Pledge Loans; Manufacturers Entrusted by the Ministry of Food to Produce Flour Will Not Receive Additional Assistance

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 31st] The 349th council meeting of the Four-Bank Joint Administration was held on the morning of the 31st, with Council Member Chen Guofu acting as chairman. Council members Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, Weng Wen, Huo, Chen Qitian, Yu Dawei (represented by Tan Boyu), Zhao Dihua (represented by Tang Ju), Li Shuming, and Secretary-General Xu Batu, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, and General Manager Shou Miancheng, among others, were present, reviewing and approving more than 100 loan proposals and discussing two major cases:

(1) Regarding loan cases for flour mills in various regions, the Administration has been verifying and issuing loans based on the actual production capacity of each factory. Recently, the Ministry of Food entrusted five major flour mills in Shanghai, including Fufeng and Fuxin, to handle the purchase of wheat and flour production business. In order to understand the details of this case, the Administration specially invited representatives from the Ministry of Food to attend and explain, so as to serve as a reference for future review of loan applications from flour mills in various regions. It was decided at today's meeting that factories that have already accepted the Ministry of Food's commission to produce flour should not receive additional assistance from the banks. As for other factories, they should be assisted separately in the form of orders. Before the ordering method is approved, loans can be approved according to customary practices.

(2) The cotton bill of exchange principle established by the Administration in September of last year expired at the end of May this year. After the 345th council meeting, it was decided not to renew it. From June 1st, the bill of exchange method for daily necessities was adopted. At today's meeting, supplementary regulations were made, stipulating that from now on, cotton bills of exchange undertaken by various banks should be limited to domestic cotton transported from the production area to the sales area. In addition, arrival bills of exchange must be redeemed and absolutely cannot be converted into pledge loans.

### China Trust Bureau Purchases Foreign Cotton

Applications Reach More Than 30,000 Bales

As of today, the China Trust Bureau has received applications for the purchase of more than 30,000 bales of foreign cotton, including more than ten factories such as Shenxin. Shenxin accounts for the largest amount, about 40%. The Bureau will send personnel to customs warehouses to inspect and accept the goods, and will still entrust them to the factories for spinning. The method of spinning is being exchanged with the Six-District Association. The Association has expressed acceptance of the principle of spinning, and the detailed method is yet to be determined.

It is also reported that the application deadline for purchasing foreign cotton arriving at the port was originally the end of July. After the first small group meeting of the China Trust Bureau, it was decided to extend the deadline to August 15th. According to reporters, most of the cotton importers this time are foreign firms, while Chinese firms account for a minority. The situation of ordering and settling foreign exchange from abroad can be divided into three categories: (1) Foreign exchange has been fully paid; (2) Part of the foreign exchange has been paid; (3) No foreign exchange has been paid at all, and credit is guaranteed. Among the above three types of cotton importers, those applying to the China Trust Bureau for purchase are mostly the third type. For the first and second types of importers, due to the excessively high purchase price and the loss of official exchange rate settlement, and there are also unresolved resale disputes in transactions, most of them have been delayed. The disputes regarding the part of foreign cotton arriving at the port that importers buy and sell on behalf of customers are as follows: (1) Part of the foreign exchange has been paid by each customer in advance when ordering from abroad; (2) The surplus part of the price at the time of ordering and the current price, and the compensation problem for the part of the business that importers operate themselves has been ordered but the futures have been sold in advance when the goods have not arrived, and the goods have arrived but Zhu can deliver the goods, etc., have not been resolved.

The market condition of cotton cloth was characterized by Guangzhou's price being higher than the cost price, business being sluggish, and sales in Hankou and the Yangtze River area also being sluggish. In addition, the market's money supply was slightly tight, and cargo owners frequently liquidated their positions. Finally, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was as low as 425,000 yuan, a drop of 7,000 or 8,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths such as Wufu, Lanji, and Caiqiu also fell by 4,000, 5,000, or 6,000 yuan. The prices of other factory plates such as Shilin cloth were also partially reduced, so prices were not strong. The prices of cloths supplied and sold by the Textile Construction Company were similar to market prices, and applications were not very enthusiastic.

Raw Cotton is Still Soft

The trend of raw cotton yesterday was still weak. The market condition had more supply than demand, and people's hearts were weak. Transactions were sporadic. Furthermore, cotton yarn fell, and yarn factories and customer gangs had small profits. Market prices uniformly looked down. The trading volume of various grades was very small. The price of Lingbao sent to the factory was 21.1 million yuan, the price of delivery at the pier was 2.1 million yuan, Huoji was 1.7 million yuan, Nantancang was 1.8 million yuan, and Zhoupu cottonseed was 330,000 yuan.

### Temporary Short Covering at Closing, Chinese Stocks Initially Weak Then Firm

Chinese stocks were very unfavorable at the opening yesterday, influenced by swaps. Although there were reports of settled order loans, the delayed Sino-Japanese trade was rejected by the Executive Yuan, and news that the Ministry of Finance had ordered banks and money shops to disallow same-day check cashing was prevalent, resulting in more selling pressure than buying. Until closing, temporary short covering emerged, and because checks could not be cashed on the same day, pending negotiations by the association, short sellers could not sustain the pressure, resulting in short squeezes and a rebound. Small stocks New Guangming and Jingfu, encouraged by further capital increases, closed at their highest prices.

Opening weak in the morning, Delivered Yong An Silk opened low at 29 yuan, with No. 153 further selling down to 217 yuan.

After 10:15 AM, Nos. 224, 173, 232, 35, 143, 218, 117, 219, and 112 sold in succession. It was heard that Guangbang aggressively sold both inside and outside the market. Interest rates opened high at 1.8 and 2.25 cents, and it once again consolidated down to around 223 yuan. Nos. 104, 180, and 155 entered the market, pushing it up to 229 yuan.

After 11:35 AM, Nos. 105, 219, 106, and 110 offered sales, again forcing it down to 232 yuan. Afterwards, it was heard that the banking community was holding meetings to discuss remedies for the inability to cash checks on the same day. Nos. 12, 83, 234, 24, and 76 covered in succession. The noon close saw Spot Yong An Silk rise to 227 yuan, and Delivered Yong An Silk rise to 232 yuan at closing.

After the close, bid prices were moderate. Small stocks New Guangming and Jingfu, maintained by No. 204, gradually saw increased buying, closing at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, Spot New Guangming alone rose by half a percentage point. Yong An Silk, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly. Xinyi, Meiya, Sino-French, and Xinhua slipped slightly. Qinxing and Yonggong each fell by slightly less than half a percentage point. Datong, Zhongfang, Guohuo Neiyi, Zhongsheng, and Jinglun were flat. Tongyi, Rongfeng, Business, and Cement rose slightly. Huochai and Lianan slipped slightly. For Delivered, New Guangming and Jingfu each rose by slightly more than half a percentage point. Yong An Silk, Meiya, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose slightly, varying up to slightly less than half a percentage point. Yonggong slipped slightly. Off-market prices were generally considered moderate.

### Group Profit-Sharing Savings Deposits, Starting First in Beijing and Shanghai

[United Credit Bureau News] Group profit-sharing savings deposits, after the Central Trust Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Savings Association has begun preparing for implementation. There was a previous plan to start on August 11 and hold a profit-sharing lottery on September 1. It is now learned that the bureau, due to printing and other preparations, was unable to complete preparations in time and has scheduled the launch for around August 15. The first profit-sharing distribution is tentatively scheduled for September 25. The purpose of establishing group profit-sharing savings is to encourage savings and attract idle funds. Its functions include: (1) This savings can be used as long-term capital, (2) Guiding the middle class to establish relationships with banks, (3) Absorbing idle funds for the government, (4) Investing in productive enterprises. Based on the above, the significance is clear. Initially, it was planned to be jointly operated by national banks and bureaus. Although the Executive Yuan made changes, it will still initially entrust national banks and bureaus to handle it on behalf of the government, and may in the future entrust commercial banks and firms to act as agents to ensure universality. It is also heard that it will be temporarily launched first in Beijing and Shanghai, gradually extending to the whole country.

### Customs Clearance of Imported Goods, Limited to 24 Hours

Jianghai reports: Upon inspection and release of imported goods, the Customs normally endorses the original bill of lading and issues it to the merchant, who takes it to the inspection office to apply for inspection or release. The date and time are stamped on the back of the bill of lading, and the inspection group manifest or release detail list is simultaneously sent directly by the general affairs section to the designated inspection office for inspection and release. Under normal circumstances, this detail list should be delivered to the designated inspection office within 24 hours. After receiving the bill of lading, the merchant should check the date and time stamped on the back. If the detail list has not arrived at the designated inspection office after 24 hours, they should immediately report it to the general affairs section or the inspection supervisor of the inspection department for investigation.

Also, import and export merchants and customs brokers who come to the Customs to handle matters should directly deal with the customs officers of each department or the inspectors of each inspection office and must not directly contact the Customs messengers, laborers, customs police, and other miscellaneous personnel for any matters. The messengers and laborers are not allowed to directly accept or deliver customs declarations and bills of lading to merchants or participate in customs declaration, inspection, stamping, release, and other matters. Those who deliberately violate this will be immediately dismissed.

In forward-term trading, Yong An Silk rose from 4.5 yuan to 7 yuan yesterday, closing at 6.5 yuan.

### Nine Associations of the Reproduction Industry Meet to Discuss Increasing Yarn Allocation, Deciding to First Investigate the Actual Needs of Each Factory

[This Newspaper's Report] The nine industry associations affiliated with the reproduction industry in this city held a joint meeting at the Atlantic Restaurant at 7 PM yesterday to discuss how to increase the amount of yarn allocated to the industry and the issue of opening trade with Japan. More than 20 representatives from the dyeing and weaving, handkerchief, knitting, underwear, and towel blanket industries attended, chaired by Pan Shihao, chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association.

Mr. Pan reported on the progress of repeated negotiations with the Spinning Adjustment Committee and the Spinning Construction Company regarding increasing the yarn allocation for the reproduction industry in this city. The details are as follows: (1) The yarn demand of the reproduction industry in this city is estimated at 52,000 pieces per month this spring, but the current actual allocation only meets one-fifth of the industry's needs. (2) The Spinning Adjustment Committee's current spinning adjustment policy is quite active, and it is imperative to outsource weaving for the industry. (3) The implementation of the current spinning management and adjustment policy is actually a derivative of the unified purchase and sale policy of flower yarn cloth in the Great Rear Area in the 32nd year of the Republic. However, the industry pointed out the differences in the current situation: (A) There is a shortage of spindles and a surplus of looms. (B) The Great Rear Area was striving to acquire and export materials, which is different now. (C) Sales are difficult and distribution is challenging.

Mr. Pan immediately moved three proposals for discussion on the meeting floor: (1) Re-investigate the production equipment of the industry. (2) Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, Japan will focus on exporting cotton textiles to Southeast Asia, and the reproduction industry should express its opinions. (3) Prepare a plan for the products of the industry to coordinate with outsourcing weaving and export. The nine industry associations then reported on the recent allocation of cotton yarn in each industry. The final resolutions were: (1) The nine industry associations should promptly investigate the number of member companies, production conditions, and yarn demand of their members, as well as the amount that still needs to be supplied by the black market in addition to the Spinning Construction allocation, and create a plan within two days to request an increase in the yarn allocation from the authorities. (2) In order to strengthen the connection between the nine industry associations, it was decided to temporarily establish a joint communication office for the nine associations affiliated with the reproduction industry within the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association in this city.

### Gu Geng Talks About the European and American Bristle Market, Chongqing Bristles are Already Threatened

Gu Geng, General Manager of Sichuan Livestock Products Company, a leading authority in the bristle industry, went to Europe and the United States in April of this year to investigate and discuss business matters. He returned to China at the beginning of this month. Mr. Gu arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing a few days ago. A reporter from the United Credit Bureau visited him yesterday to understand the situation in the European and American markets and the future of our bristle industry. According to him, the largest market for our bristles is the United States, followed by the United Kingdom in Europe. The United States imports 7 million pounds annually, equivalent to over 50,000 boxes. Judging from the quantity of our exports in the past few months of this year, it may not be as much as last year. One reason is that the United States has millions of pounds of bristle reserves, reducing the need for imports. The second reason is nylon, which is hard and uniform in quality, comparable to Chongqing bristles, and is largely replacing them. However, Chongqing bristles are still indispensable for industrial bristle brushes and are still needed. If the United States greatly increases the production of nylon in the future, it will be a fatal blow to Chongqing bristles. Therefore, the international market price of Chongqing bristles is trending lower. Currently, it is 2.20 yuan per pound, compared to 1.50 yuan before the war, which is less than double the pre-war price. Tianjin bristles are in great demand as raw materials for oil paint industrial bristle brushes. Grade 555 can be as high as 7.78 yuan per pound, and Grade 555 can also be sold for 4.50 yuan. Shanghai bristles also have a market, with a current price of 1.95 yuan. Hankou bristles are used for blending. For example, if Tianjin and Shanghai bristles are used for oil paint bristle brushes, they must be mixed with Hankou bristles, with a current price of 3.35 yuan. The above is the situation in the US market. In Europe, the United Kingdom can sell up to 2,000 boxes, at 13 shillings and 6 pence per pound. Other countries such as France, Switzerland, and Belgium also have sales, but the quantity is not large, totaling no more than several hundred boxes. Germany is currently planning to revive its industry, requiring a large quantity of bristles, and mostly using short bristles, which is the best market for Chongqing bristles. It is currently negotiating with the occupying countries. If it is realized, it will be a major turning point for Chongqing bristles.

### Holders Unwilling to Sell, Rayon Market Revitalized, Factory Silk Slightly Weak, Silk Goods High Then Low

The rayon market revitalized again yesterday. The opening was very flat, but after rumors spread that the Central Trust Bureau's allocation price would double, confidence was restored, and holders were determined not to sell. No. 120 Gaoshan Youshan opened at 24.5 million yuan and rose immediately, with transactions at 4.90 million yuan. The highest was 5.3 million yuan. In the afternoon, buyers remained cautious and slightly lowered prices. The final price was 25 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The factory silk market was slightly weak yesterday. The asking price for high uniformity five-dan silk was about 500,000 yuan lower, but there were no transactions. The transaction price for medium-grade silk was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The opening price was 27 million yuan, and the opening price for high-grade silk was 28 million yuan, both with ten-day terms. For 28/30-thread, 75% uniformity E-grade silk, there were five dan of transactions yesterday, with a seven-day term price of 28.2 million yuan. For 28-thread dry silk, there was an order for 17.3 million yuan, another dan for 7 million yuan, and the lower grade for 16 million yuan, all with ten-day terms.

The silk goods market was high then low yesterday. For pure silk quilt covers, because there were more sellers than buyers, the market was high then low. Dacheng goods opened weak, with transactions at 400,000 yuan. In the middle, it reached 450,000 to 500,000 yuan, then fell back to 400,000 yuan at the closing spot price. Huaqiang goods initially made 10.37 million yuan, then a maximum of 4.5 million yuan, and finally closed lower at 3.17 million yuan spot, and 4 million yuan with a one-day delay. Dacheng plaid crepe initially made 12.8 million yuan, and the final transaction was 34,000 yuan, 800 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of Huajin crepe also slightly increased yesterday due to the high price of rayon, with high-grade goods being transacted at 22.5 million yuan.

Jinshan Twigs Slightly Loose

About a hundred pieces of Jinshan twigs were previously closed out. Yuanzhi was 1.289 million to 1.3 million yuan, Bianzhi was 1.7 million to 1.65 million yuan, and the others were between 1 million and 900,000 yuan. The market was stable, slightly looser than before.

### Final Meeting of the Spinning Management Committee Decides on the Handling of Surplus Funds

Request the Executive Yuan to Quickly Establish a Management and Utilization Committee

[This Newspaper's Report] The former Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its last meeting at the Municipal Government at approximately 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Chairman Wu Guozhen. Many committee members and executive directors of the six district associations attended, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 5 PM.

At yesterday's meeting, the handling of the 97.8 billion yuan in surplus funds accumulated after the purchase and sale of cotton yarn during the period of the former Spinning Management Committee was discussed in detail. During the tenure of former Premier Song of the Executive Yuan, the Spinning Management Committee, in order to manage the funds, had requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the establishment of a Fund Management and Utilization Committee for Promoting Cotton Planting and Developing the Textile Industry, but it has not yet received approval. Currently, 10.3 billion yuan of the total funds have been transferred by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, including the start-up costs of the current Spinning Adjustment Committee, the dissolution costs of the former Spinning Management Committee, and some investment projects of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After yesterday's discussion, some yarn factory members believed that the transfer and use of the funds were somewhat inappropriate and inconsistent with the original purpose of accumulating the funds. It was decided to request the Executive Yuan to quickly establish the Fund Management and Utilization Committee, with nine members, including three from private factories, two from state-owned factories, and four from the government, in order to jointly discuss a proper use of the funds.

### Communist Party Connections with Japanese Military Advisors, Gangs in Guangdong and Guangxi Cause Trouble, Looting Civilian Guns and Food

[Our Wuzhou Correspondent] This reporter, with a heart half-filled with worry and resentment, half with fear, wandered through the green of the mountains connecting southern China and the Shiwan Mountains, feeling as if he were treading on the surface of a festering sore. General Zhang Fakui was right when he said, "I still believe that there are no formal Communist Party troops in Guangdong and Guangxi." These roots of disaster in the south have erected a banner calling themselves the "South Road People's Armed Liberation Army." A closer look reveals that they are actually a band of thieves – a group of bandits causing trouble under the influence of the Communist Party. The so-called "CPC South China Bureau Guangdong Armed Work Committee" is their master.

The South Road bandit gangs, spreading across the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, were initially estimated by officials to number only three to five thousand, with just over a thousand in Guangxi. Later, due to the lean season and severe famine, people turned to banditry, creating a situation that became difficult to control. According to this reporter's investigation, the bandits gathered in the area south of Luchuan County to the north of Lianjiang, led by Zou Youning and Liang Banwei, are said to number as many as three thousand. As for those scattered in the counties of Huazhou, Wuchuan, Lianjiang, and Suixi, their number is estimated to be between five and six thousand. In the Leizhou Zhanjiang area, those led by Fu Chunmao also number more than four thousand. They generally have an elegant name of "Democratic Allied Army." The number of these titles is so great that even the "headquarters" of the "Allied Army" cannot keep track of them.

Five "Tasks" of South Road Bandits

The style of the South Road bandits would not be a cause for great concern, but when the word "traitor" is added to the word "bandit" to become "traitorous bandits" acting in concert with the communists, the headache is much greater than usual. According to a written order from the traitorous bandit leader that this reporter found from relevant sources, there are five major tasks: (1) Burn as much as possible of everything that can be burned; (2) Kill and loot villages to create a climate of terror; (3) Send personnel to Zhanjiang to blow up military warehouses; (4) Actively sabotage all transportation on the South Road; (5) Loot as many vehicles as possible. This is considered to be the most recent "working program." Therefore, in the midst of the chaos, traveling east from Yulin to Luchuan, one can experience countless tense situations. According to the common people, after the Qingming Festival, the bandits consolidate from dispersed groups and are active everywhere. In the villages south of Luchuan, such as Liangtian and Chentian, the township offices are often besieged. The areas around Lianjiang Lizhi and Fanling have become the bandits' territory, where they burn, kill, loot, and commit all kinds of atrocities. Those wearing civil servant uniforms or military uniforms, once captured, are killed immediately without any questions. Countless grassroots personnel in the villages have died at the hands of the bandits. In the four rural districts of Suixi County, nineteen are occupied by bandits. The bandits from Donghe to Maling Anpu have a rather well-organized structure. There are advisory groups from the Chinese Communist Party in the command structure, and it is rumored that there are several Japanese people holding the title of senior advisors, directing the operations from within. Under the "headquarters" there are staff, intelligence, political, and liaison departments, each with its own responsibilities. These "democratic armies" are best at making false claims and turning nothing into something. Often, three to five hundred people run around looting, creating a network of deceptive information. Just as government forces are gathering to launch a sweep, the traitorous bandits scatter without a trace. When the government forces are slightly weaker, they regroup and attack again, leaving the local area with nothing.

Bandit Gangs in the Lianjiang Guangzhou Bay Area Extort "Protection Fees"

Since the county magistrate of Suixi County, Guangdong, was killed by traitorous bandits, the banditry has increased unabated. Wherever they go, the traitorous bandits issue declarations and appoint county magistrates (such as Qu Wenxi and Chen Kailian as the chief and deputy puppet magistrates of Suixi County), attack the government, and do everything possible to rebel. On the one hand, they set up checkpoints and collect taxes on water transport. Every boat from Lianjiang to Guangzhou Bay is charged a monthly "protection fee" of 60,000 yuan - now increased to 90,000 yuan. On the highway at the junction of Lianjiang and Suixi Counties from Chikan (under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou Bay) to Anpu, a tall sign of the "Democratic Allied Army" is conspicuously displayed, openly collecting taxes from passing merchants. The tax standard is 20% of the value of the goods, and the value of the goods is determined by the bandits themselves. Often, the estimated tax is higher than the value of the goods. At this time, the merchants have no choice but to admit their bad luck, leave the goods on the spot, and walk away. Those who are lucky enough to pass through have to go through the "proper channels" as well, and once they pass through the gate, they have to pay another batch of "protection fees." After all the protection, by the time they reach their destination, they are already heartbroken and want to cry but have no tears. This makes those who carry goods over long distances regard it as a dangerous road. However, for the sake of survival, they have to take risks. Sometimes, if they have connections, they can negotiate a "deal" - which means "to get along well." Even if the goods are rolling around, they won't be harmed.

"Wild Boar Famine Army" Actually Fires Guns and Writes IOUs

Passenger and cargo vehicles traveling between Yulin and Guangzhou Bay often fail to pass the "Old Friend, Lend Us Some" checkpoint more than six out of ten times. With a shout of "Stop!", the ambush heroes aim at the tires and fire a shot, completely deflating the tires. Then, the "Wild Boar Famine Army" - (Note: The common people like to mistake this group of "Democratic Liberation Army" for "Wild Boar Famine Army," which has a profound meaning) - rush up and strip even the women of their underwear before leaving. Some even politely write an IOU: "This is to acknowledge that we have borrowed the funds from the passengers of car number ××××, amounting to approximately so many yuan, which will be repaid without fail after the success of the revolution. This is the receipt, South Road Democratic Liberation Army No. × Squad," which is truly a great farce.

This scene happened last month near Pifang Bridge on the Yulin-Zhanjiang Highway and near Shijiaota in Leizhou to Zhanjiang. Unfortunately, this reporter was unable to witness it.

Big "Thieves" Go Everywhere, Demand Guns and Food, It Has Become an Iron Rule. In the Villages of Lianjiang and Luchuan, All Civilian Guns and Food Have Been Almost Completely "Struggled" Away. For Example, in Sanhe Township, Lianjiang, Which Has Been Looted by Bandits Several Times, "Not a Single Gun Remains, Not a Single Grain Remains." The Common People Cannot Endure the Hardship, and the Number of Deaths is Countless! As a Result of the Atrocities of the Traitorous Bandits, the Villagers Are Coerced to Hand Over All Their Weapons and Food. If They Fail to Comply, They Are Subjected to Cruel Torture, Even Using the Tendons from Cotton-Ginning Machines to Tightly Tie the Heads of the Victims. The Heads Are Twisted on Both Sides, the Tendons Are Embedded in the Flesh, and Blood Is Shed, Causing Blood to Flow From the Seven Orifices. Such a Horrible Sight Makes Even Those Who Hear About It Tremble. For Example, Yang Daguang, a Villager in a Certain Village in Suixi County, Suffered This Kind of Torture. Other "Good Policies" Such as "Flying Airplane," "Lighting Sky Lanterns," Etc., Imposed by the Bandits on Petty Landlords, Merchants, and Public Servants During "Purges" Are Not Counted Here.

### Fuzhou Murder Case: Abandoned Corpse in the Grass, Truth Comes to Light, Victim is the Young Owner of Zhengde Printing House, Culprits You Kaiyun and Wu Lixing Captured

[Our Fuzhou Correspondent, 31st] This assassination and corpse-moving case that occurred more than ten days ago has attracted much attention from all walks of life. After a secret investigation by the security authorities for ten days, it was learned that the deceased was Huang Yingmei, the son of the manager of the Zhengde Printing House in this city. Huang had just returned to Rong from Taiwan and was very close to You Kaiyun and Wu Lixing. The three had jointly participated in a secret Communist Party organization, but Huang intended to withdraw from the party. You and Wu feared that Huang would leak secrets to the outside world, so they decided to kill him. A few days ago, they invited Huang to You's house, a former rice warehouse, for dinner. Taking advantage of Huang's lack of preparation, they strangled him to death together, cut his body into several pieces with a knife, and abandoned it in the weeds in a nearby open space, and robbed Huang of the gold ring and watch on his body. Afterwards, it was discovered and reported to the police by nearby residents. The murderer has now been arrested and has confessed to the killing. The entire case has been sent to the court for investigation.

### Hardship March in Northern Jiangsu, Efforts to Catch "Rats"

The mercury column of Hua's scale rises to ninety-eight degrees, the red sun is scorching, and sweat is pouring down like a waterfall. The national army of northern Jiangsu, in coordination with local forces, is carrying out a great task of suppressing the rebellion in the midst of the hot summer - the pacification area's suppression battle.

The battle of suppression is unfolding in the long, desolate coastal area. From Sanyu Town to Juegang, Fengli, Pincha... to the rural areas of Dongtai 1, 2, and 3 Canghe, the soldiers, loaded with all their equipment, are searching and advancing from one town to another, from one village to another. The weather is extremely hot, and the march is extremely difficult. Both people and horses are panting from the heat, and sweat is wiped off by the handful. During rest, the small river becomes a great gift to the public. Jumping into the river and taking a cold bath, they feel unparalleled refreshment all over their bodies. Sometimes the weather changes and a heavy rain falls, drenching everyone from top to bottom. After the rain, the roads are muddy, and they rush to the camp in a bumpy fashion. At night, they have to deal with the harassment of mosquitoes and prevent possible ambushes.

"Suppressing bandits is like catching rats." If you want to catch them, they will hide everywhere. If you don't pay attention to them, they will immediately come out to steal and destroy things. The national army of the northern Jiangsu pacification area is determined to use the determination and means of catching rats to pursue and suppress them everywhere, overturning nests and wanting to completely eliminate these rats that are causing trouble in northern Jiangsu. As usual, the Communist bandits are using their housekeeping skills, running around and fleeing wildly, and using cruel tactics, leaving those local "militia" behind as cover, letting them be their shields. In this suppression battle, the national army encountered fierce battles with the remnants of the bandits. All the captures, in addition to what has been seen in the newspapers and telegraphs, are those "meat rats"!

In this suppression, whenever the national army arrives in a place, the township and village chiefs immediately enter the area with them to reorganize the baojia system, appease the people, and search for scattered bandits. This is a great blow to the Communist bandits, because the township and village chiefs are local people. After returning to their hometowns, everything is familiar to them, especially the identification of accomplices. They can see everything clearly. The military authorities search for a large number of suspects and immediately send them to them for identification. Who is a bandit accomplice, who is the most violent participant in "struggle" and unrest, and who has not participated in the bandit army's work is identified by them one by one without any errors. Among them, accomplices are sent to the rear for punishment according to the severity of their circumstances. Those without suspicion of being bandits are immediately released and will never be detained or harassed, so that the people in the bandit area do not feel distressed or afraid. At the same time, it is absolutely impossible for bandits to try to use the stealth method and mix in with them. Many people who have been ravaged by the Communist bandits for a long time have now obtained true "liberation."

Northern Jiangsu is the granary of the Communist bandits, and the coastal area is their main base for causing trouble, because this is a vast wilderness, and it is not facing the highway, which is suitable for them to use as a "rat hole." From here, the public grain of northern Jiangsu is secretly transported to southern Shandong to supply the bandit army in Shandong, and from there, ammunition and the bandit army are transported back here. This spring, some of the bandits in Shandong fled back to northern Jiangsu, and many of them took the sea route through the coastal area. This time, the national army rushed to the coast and launched a fierce attack. The remnants of the bandits were unable to turn around, so they boarded boats and fled to the sea. They were bombed and strafed by the government air force, and many were wiped out. In addition to launching the suppression in the coastal area, the national army has also begun to coordinate its actions in the river areas south of the Tongyang Road, preparing to force the remnants of the bandits along the river and coast to move inland, and then launch a large-scale suppression. During the wheat harvest this summer, the remnants of the bandits caused a lot of commotion in the countryside, causing chaos. Before the autumn harvest, the pacification authorities took this swift action to deal a fatal blow to the remnants of the bandits. Farmers will surely be able to maintain considerable stability during this year's autumn harvest.

### A Pair of Wild Lovebirds Commit a Murder in the Middle of the Night, Melon Vendor Stabbed Four Times to Death, Culprits Arrested and Confess Without Denying

[Our Dangtu Correspondent] A resident named Shen Yu in Santiao Alley, East Main Street, Changtu County, is currently a grain police officer at the Zhajiiawan Grain Branch. His wife, Shen Sunshi, is 42 years old. Sunshi is promiscuous and has an affair with Chen Jiansan (33 years old) from Sichuan, who has now retired from the military. Before Shen Yu went to Zhajiia Town, he entrusted Dong Jinan, a melon vendor who sold watermelons at his door, to take care of his household. Dong Jinan (45 years old, from Yuncheng, Shandong) had a quarrel with Shen Sunshi a few days ago, so Jinan forbade Chen Jiansan from interacting with her, which caused Chen Jiansan and Shen Sunshi (see photo) to harbor resentment in their hearts. Suddenly, at about 2:00 a.m. yesterday (July 28), Chen Jiansan and Shen Sunshi used a small pointed knife for selling watermelons to quickly stab Dong Jinan four times while he was fast asleep, killing him instantly. Afterwards, they planned to move the body to a secluded place. A wonton vendor happened to catch a glimpse. The murderer, Chen Jiansan, seeing that the situation was not good, fled through the Xiaojia Alley across the street and threw the murder weapon into the Xiaojia Alley. Shen Sunshi was even more anxious when she saw this, and used the trick of covering her ears to steal the bell to avoid suspicion. She shouted loudly: Someone has been stabbed to death! Neighbors rushed to the scene after hearing the sound and saw Dong Jinan lying miserably in a pool of blood (see photo). The criminal police team then arrested Shen Sunshi and brought her to justice. At about 8:00 a.m., the murderer Chen Jiansan was captured behind the Lvzu Temple at the west end of Tishu Street, taken to the police station and transferred to the judicial office. The judicial office sent clerk Xue Mianbin to examine the body. There was a knife wound on the neck that penetrated the neck, a knife wound on the right chest, a knife wound on the left collarbone, and a knife wound on the shoulder, confirming that he had been killed. There were still blood stains on the murderer's body, and he confessed without denying. (29th)

### Mata Hari Song Manping Arrested in Wuhe County

[Our Bengbu Correspondent] In mid-month, a Mata Hari case was uncovered in Wuhe County, eastern Anhui Province. The protagonist in the case was Song Manping, who graduated from the Yan'an Anti-Japanese University. Miss Song, a native of Sichuan, is 26 years old and has a beautiful appearance. Last spring, Miss Song secretly came to Anhui to work on intelligence and made contact with Li Yangzheng, a Communist bandit from Sixian County. Li used his hometown relationship, and the two cohabited, appearing as husband and wife. By autumn, Sixian County was recovered by the national army, and Li fled Sixian County and went to Jiashan, where he surrendered to the investigation office. After being given a title by the investigation office, he worked there. Song also fled to Jiashan and continued to live with Li. Li was again bewitched by her. Last winter, he resigned and went to Wuhe with her to live temporarily. This spring, Song expressed great dissatisfaction with Li's lack of willpower. Li then went elsewhere. Miss Song remained in Wuhe. She then fell in love with Huang Zhenqiu, the police chief of the county's police security team. Song took the opportunity to incite Huang to lead the team in a mutiny and harm Wuhe. Huang was swayed by her. Just as he was about to act, the matter was heard by County Magistrate Jiang Zhenglun. Jiang used swift and decisive means to capture Huang and Song together. According to County Magistrate Jiang, he has scolded Chief Huang to his face. Although Song Manping was rigorously interrogated by himself, she only lowered her head and wept, and firmly denied that she was working as a spy for the Communist bandits. It is learned that Jiang attaches great importance to this case and has reported it to the Anhui Provincial Government and requested instructions. (July 29)

### Person in Prison Accuses Person Outside Prison, Traitor Liu Zhensheng Petitions for Return of Bribe Money

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 31st] Former prosecutor of the Hebei High Court, and current chief prosecutor of the Luan County District Court, Sun Chengxi, was accused in a presentation by the jailed traitor Liu Zhensheng at the Hebei Supervisory Office, claiming that Sun accepted a bribe of 5 million yuan while serving in the Hebei High Court, promising to release him but failing to do so, and requested severe punishment. The presentation stated that Liu was arrested in January last year as a traitor. After being transferred to the Hebei High Court, his case was investigated by Sun Xianxi. At that time, a fellow inmate, Wang Yaofu, who had served as a puppet county magistrate, told Liu that he was on good terms with Prosecutor Sun. Wang was indeed released in November. Half a month later, Wang went to Liu's house and said that Prosecutor Sun had agreed to release Liu, but he had to pay 5 million yuan first. At the end of December, Sun was suddenly ordered to transfer to a county post. In January of this year, Wang wrote to Liu, stating that the case had been taken over by another prosecutor, and the 5 million yuan would be returned. After demanding it without success, Liu filed a complaint and requested the arrest of Wang and an investigation.

### Lychees Fill the Sky

— Meng Long

Eight years ago, during a sweltering summer, I traveled in the southern regions. As the sun set, I loved to wander around Lychee Bay, strolling among the houseboats on the water, relieving the weariness of the day's work. I also deeply savored the Southern delicacy with small seeds, thick flesh, abundant juice, and sweet taste—the lychee.

Sometimes I would walk along the shore, where lychee fruits were densely clustered on the vermilion doors and mud walls, hanging high above six meters. The sight of "thousands upon thousands, crimson pearls uniformly distributed," extending beyond the walls, inevitably causing one's mouth to water, is something I still fondly remember!

The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states: "Of the eight commanderies in the South, lychees are most famous." It also says: "Lychee shells are red and the flesh is white, sweet, juicy, and delicious." Xu Yin of the Tang Dynasty wrote lychee poems that were quite popular. I imagine he was also a lychee enthusiast. I might as well record two of them for everyone to enjoy, perhaps as a delightful way to beat the summer heat, in addition to plums and melons. The poems are as follows:

"Day after day, the warm wind rolls up the miasmic haze; the lychee is the first precious fruit of the South. Clever crows peck open, droplets of jade-like juice; precious vessels hold the round belly of a clam. In Jinli, it is only known to quench thirst after intoxication; in the Palace of Nectar, it is fit to be a gift for the gods. Who has pricked out the blood of an orangutan, deeply dyeing the patterned veins all over the fresh shell?" "Crimson bullets and starry spheres gleam in the sunlight, green jade branches scatter small fragrant pouches. Dragon silk reveals crimson-veined rice; fish eyes contain white-fleshed juice.

Plums are ripe, past the rains of the Southern Ridge; sour oranges await the frost of Dongting Lake in vain.

Climbing mountains at dawn, picking them with the smoke, reverently presenting them on golden platters to the King of Yue."

Amidst the yellow wind and miasmic haze, lychees first grow and ripen, possessing the color and flavor of "shells revealing crimson veins and pearls containing white flesh." Once picked, they become precious fruits of the South, even taken to "reverently present them on golden platters to the King of Yue." It is evident to what extent this fruit was valued in the Tang Dynasty.

Historically, the woman who loved eating lychees the most was Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Ming of Tang spared no effort to satisfy her craving for lychees, devising a quick delivery from lychee-producing areas. Given the difficult transportation and lack of tools at the time, the special express delivery that Emperor Ming of Tang could employ was no more than relay stations. Thus, once the imperial decree was issued, a whip led the way, red dust billowed, and the lychees were sent directly to Chang'an. An ancient poem says: "A courier arrives, kicking up red dust, for the sake of the imperial concubine's smile; no one knows it is lychees that are being delivered." This can be said to be a portrait of that lychee-loving concubine (Yang Guifei).

This historical scene has reappeared in today's reality. The only difference is that the relay horses have become airplanes. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th, fresh lychees are already on the market. This year's production is quite abundant, and the price is also affordable, selling for three to four thousand yuan per catty. Merchants, with their wild imaginations, are negotiating to charter airplanes to transport lychees to Beijing and Shanghai for sale. Naturally, this is good news: the news of chartered planes transporting fruit is at least not as unnoticed as the movement of animals (such as pandas). Fruit dealers can make a good profit, needless to say, and the Yang Guifeis of Shanghai will no longer have to brave the summer heat to travel to the southern regions to enjoy fresh lychees in the comfort of electric fans, refrigerators, and air conditioning, as if Lychee Bay has been moved into their mansions. Isn't this enough to be called exceptional good fortune for their palates?

After lychee charter flights fill the sky, I believe sales will surely develop further, but whether the price at the place of origin will remain the same without rising seems to be questionable. If we look at the previous telegram, we know that the situation at the ancient Xichan Temple in Fuzhou, where excellent lychee varieties are widely planted, is already very different. According to past customs, every tourist could eat as much as they wanted by simply paying some incense money, but now this old practice has been broken, and measurements are required for pricing. This means that you can't eat as much as you want; you have to pay for how many lychees you eat. One can imagine how disappointed the local lychee eaters are. This kind of good fortune for the palate will probably have to fall to out-of-province eaters like Yang Guifei.

### The Term "Comrade"

— Oriental Mist

"Comrade," what a warm and resounding term, but now it sounds truly jarring.

During the Northern Expedition in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China, the term "comrade" echoed throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, in every corner of the country, following the footsteps of the National Revolutionary Army. Whether it was the chairman, the commander-in-chief, or the workers and service personnel, they could all address each other in this way. At that time, every time I heard someone call me "Comrade Oriental," a surge of pleasure would immediately well up inside me, and I would deeply feel a sense of warmth, friendship, and honor. Who knew that "good times don't last long"? The term "comrade" soon embarked on a path of decline, and in recent years, the value of "comrade" has steadily decreased. It has even developed to the point where it is limited to the exclusive term used by superiors to subordinates, masters to employees, and the honorable to the lowly. There is no longer a trace of friendliness or warmth in this surface, only a signpost indicating the nobility or baseness, the height or lowness of one's status. If you don't believe me, try shouting "So-and-so Comrade" at your superior and see what kind of look they give you. If you don't have any background or family connections, you might even face the fate of being "reassigned to another position." However, perhaps your superior is more enlightened and doesn't take it to heart, but your good colleagues will sneer at you from the sidelines, scolding you for being too ignorant of etiquette.

Several times, I have accompanied our director, secretary, and section chief to gatherings held by dignitaries. When the host introduced the other esteemed guests one by one, saying, "This is Director So-and-so, this is Secretary So-and-so, this is Section Chief So-and-so, this is Mr. Cha…," the other dignitaries would all happily bow and shake hands as a greeting. But when the host hesitated slightly and pointed at me, saying, "This is Comrade Oriental," the smiles on the faces of the dignitaries would immediately disappear, replaced by a forced and reluctant display of teeth. After that, they would talk and laugh animatedly, exceptionally harmonious, while I would be consistently neglected on the sidelines. The reason for this is all because I am a "comrade." "Comrade" is destined to be someone of low rank and humble position, unable to join the ranks of the dignitaries. The reason why our clever host used this most clever term was certainly not to genuinely regard me as a like-minded comrade. It was only to maintain his own status and dignity, implying my status to those dignitaries.

Thinking about it all makes one furious: for a year, I have been working in what is supposedly a revolutionary organization with a friend whom I have known for three years and with whom I am on fairly good terms. Although his position is two levels higher than mine, he has always addressed me as "Brother Mengwu" out of friendship on the official memos he has given me. However, since we had several disagreements over a matter that was neither too big nor too small, the vigorous and upright words "Brother Mengwu" can no longer be found in the official memos he gives me. Instead, it has been replaced by this six-character address, with which I am unusually familiar and which was strangely warm in the past but now indicates the nobility or baseness, the height or lowness of one's status: "Comrade Oriental Mist."

In China, where "democracy" is currently being shouted at the top of one's lungs, I cannot help but burst into tears for this declining "comrade"!

### The Indonesian Question Amidst Slaughter

— Yi Feng

The tense relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which had been escalating since May 27, have finally erupted into war. The Dutch army, navy, and air force, equipped with 100,000 modern troops, are currently engaged in mutual slaughter with the indigenous forces of the Republic of Indonesia.

The Netherlands has ruled Indonesia for 300 years. The disparity in interests between the rulers and the ruled has resulted in a fierce nationalist movement, which is an inevitable fact. Therefore, since the beginning of the 20th century, the Indonesian people's nationalist movement resisting Dutch rule has never ceased. It was not until the establishment of the Indonesian Nationalist Party League in 1939 that the front line of the nationalist movement was consolidated, engaging in effective activities, which caused headaches for the Dutch government.

During World War II, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Indonesia was quickly occupied by Japan, and the Indonesian people strengthened their long-term plans for nation-building. When Japan was defeated and surrendered, the Netherlands planned to make a comeback. However, the 70 million people of Indonesia disregarded all obstacles and pressure and declared the establishment of the "Republic of Indonesia" on August 17, 1945. Then, in November of the same year, the Republic government was established, with Sukarno as president, breaking free from the chains of 300 years of ethnic rule.

However, during the first year, before the Linggadjati Agreement was established, Indonesia's situation was under the dual oppression of the Dutch and British (under the pretext of helping prisoners of war) forces. The war was intermittent, and negotiations were intermittent. It was not until the Linggadjati Agreement was established in November 1946 that the Dutch finally recognized the existence of the Republic of Indonesia, including Java, Sumatra, and Madura as the territory of the Republic. However, the Republic was only a part of the United States of Indonesia (composed of the Republic of Indonesia and other islands in the Dutch East Indies), and it was to form a Dutch-Indonesian Union with the Netherlands proper. This roundabout way shows that the Netherlands has not generously given up its attempt to rule Indonesia and its suzerainty. On May 27 of this year, due to different interpretations of the content of the agreement, the Dutch government finally issued an ultimatum to Indonesia, demanding that the Dutch and Indonesian sides jointly organize police and security forces, and return Dutch property rights and economic development rights. The Dutch side firmly stated that this was the final position of the Netherlands, and the Indonesian side had no room for consideration other than accepting it in full.

Thus, the Dutch-Indonesian situation since May 27 has been unusually severe. After many twists and turns, although Sjahrir formed a middle-of-the-road cabinet, agreeing to the Dutch request to jointly organize police and security forces, it was only with attached conditions, which also dissatisfied the Dutch side. The Dutch cabinet then authorized the Dutch East Indies Acting Governor Van Mook to issue an attack order at the opportune moment, so the conflict in Indonesia was unavoidable and broke out on the 21st of this month. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have expressed deep regret over this dispute and are seeking ways to mediate it, while Indonesian President Sukarno has appealed to the United Nations, requesting that it be accompanied by reasonable mediation. Therefore, the future development of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in the mutual slaughter depends on the attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States.

However, there are nearly one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia. They hold the actual power in Indonesian commerce and have suffered considerable losses in the past Dutch-Indonesian disputes. Now, with extremely concerned emotions, we are concerned about the safety of their lives and property. We also hope that the Dutch and Indonesian sides can correct past mistakes and respect the interests of the people of neutral countries.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shuyuan

Auditing at American Universities

In many ways, American universities contribute more to society than any university in China. University education in China is limited to a small number of regular students, and working citizens cannot get involved. Regular students are not only burdened by heavy coursework, but also have to go through formal shackles such as major exams, minor exams, quarterly exams, and monthly exams. The day they successfully complete their studies is often the day their lung disease reaches the end of the third stage. Many top students happily receive their diplomas, but also sadly climb into bed. University education in America is not so rigid and formalized. Higher education institutions rarely have gates at all. You don't have to take an exam to enter; you can study first and then decide. If the purpose is not to earn credits, you can audit as much as you like. Therefore, in addition to regular students, there are all kinds of people, such as lawyers, managers, businessmen, civil servants, middle school teachers, old and young, everything that should be there. The courses they choose are all related to their professions. They work and study at the same time, so that their work ability can be further improved. The government saves the trouble of training civil servants. Classrooms often find old gentlemen and ladies in their seventies and eighties. They have lived to such an age, and it seems that there is no need for further study, but why are they going back to school? They feel that at this age, going to nightclubs is too old, and going to movie theaters is afraid of hurting their presbyopic eyesight. Other activities such as swimming, riding, ice skating, and driving are not for them, but they are unwilling to be lonely, so they audit at universities. On the one hand, they can listen to the great theories of authoritative professors, and on the other hand, they can meet a few young friends and relieve their boredom. Old people have mature and prudent views, so when discussing international issues, professors and students respect the opinions of old people very much. I think that if there are no old students with long beards and wrinkled faces in a university, university education cannot be considered complete or mature. University education is the highest education, not the education of young people. The arrogance, harassment, and endless trends in Chinese universities are all because of immaturity. Old people are not allowed to enter universities, but are only allowed to hang around in temples or teahouses. The wise education authorities do not want to transform universities, but instead regard teahouses as a kind of civic education institution, which is really that education has gone into a dead end.

### Zhang Lu's Failure

— Zhou Leng

——Miscellaneous Discussions on Figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, No. 6

Zhang Lu, who rose from a "rice thief" (a derogatory term for a Taoist rebel leader), surrendered to the government, was treated as a guest by Cao Cao, and was given the title of Marquis of Ten Thousand Households, with all five of his sons and capable confidants being generously rewarded. Pei Songzhi, the Song Dynasty Grand Master of the Imperial Academy who annotated the Records of the Three Kingdoms, criticized: "Although Zhang Lu had good intentions, he had to surrender after defeat. Now he is favored with ten thousand households, and all five sons are ennobled as marquises. This is excessive!" The implication is that he strongly disapproved of this. In fact, in my opinion, this is precisely where Cao Cao's supreme cleverness lies, a good tactic worthy of special mention.

Because everyone knows that during the seventy or eighty years spanning the late Han and early Wei dynasties, the peasant revolutionary forces, which disguised the truth with religious mysticism, were shaking the position of the rulers of the time to a precarious degree. Zhang Lu, the leader of the "rice thieves" who inherited the political ideology of the Yellow Turbans, according to the Book of Wei in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, had at that time "ruled Bazhong and Hanzhong for nearly thirty years, and the Han dynasty was unable to conquer him at the end of the Han dynasty. Tens of thousands of families from the Guanzhong area fled to him through the Ziwu Trail." His power was very great. From the government's point of view, it would be easy to quell a group of warlord politicians' conspiracies and rebellions, but it would be difficult to subdue the spontaneous power of the masses with this. Because the former is just a rabble, gathered together for profit, and easily dispersed by profit; while the latter has different positions, thoughts, and beliefs, and opposes each other, which cannot be eliminated all at once. Cao Cao understood this distinction, so he did not hesitate to use high-ranking officials and generous salaries to lure, disintegrate, and divide them. And it just so happened that he encountered such a silver-like wax spearhead in Zhang Lu, and the result was a quick success. Otherwise, if this confrontational situation continued, no one could estimate how the development of the Wei, Jin, and even later history would have been.

Even in terms of military strength, Cao Cao's ability to defeat Zhang Lu, even the orthodox literati of the dynasty, admitted that this was a stroke of good luck, "Heaven blessed Great Wei, and Lu's defense collapsed on its own." Dong Zhao's memorial in the Records of Famous Ministers of Wei contains a good confession: "Emperor Wu listened to the words of the surrendered people, saying that Zhang Lu was easy to attack. He believed it to be true, and when he went there in person, it was not as he had heard. He sighed and said, 'Other people's deliberations rarely meet my expectations.' Attacking the camps on Yangping Mountain, he was unable to take them in time, and the soldiers suffered casualties every day. Emperor Wu was discouraged and wanted to withdraw his troops. Then the advance army got lost at night and mistakenly entered the enemy camp, and the thieves retreated and dispersed. He still did not believe it. Xiahou Dun went forward to see it for himself and reported back, and Emperor Wu advanced his troops to pacify it. Fortunately, he succeeded." Thus, it can be seen that even Cao Cao, who was good at using troops, had to feel a headache when he encountered these "militia uncles," so victory was only obtained by chance.

However, this is not the reason for Zhang Lu's failure. The reason why the "rice thieves'" morale was so scattered should mainly be that their leaders had no confidence in their own cause and did not fight thoroughly. The Biography of Zhang Lu by Chen Shou says: "When the people found a royal seal in the ground, the subordinates wanted to honor Lu as king. Yan Pu advised: 'Hanzhong is surrounded by dangerous terrain. If you support the emperor, you will be Marquis Huan. If you are second best, you will not lose wealth and honor. I wish you would not claim the title for now, and not be the first to cause trouble.' Lu followed his advice.... When Emperor Taizu (Cao Cao)征之, Lu wanted to surrender Hanzhong, but his younger brother Wei refused and led tens of thousands of people to defend the pass." ... Emperor Taizu sent people to comfort and persuade Lu, because he had good intentions, and appointed Lu as General Who Pacifies the South." From here, we can know even more that the defeat of the "rice thieves" was not due to Cao Cao's conquest, but to Zhang Lu's betrayal. Of course, when the will and determination of a leader are so unsteady, on the one hand, he maintains the idea of recognizing the orthodox first, and on the other hand, he attempts to sell himself and surrender, the will to resist the enemy is not active, and internal strife is easy to occur. Once oppressed by the other side, he will naturally be defeated quickly.

### Sai Jinhua Before Marriage

— Cai Xue

The life of Sai Jinhua has been described in great detail, with Fan Fanshan's Before and After Rainbow Clouds Songs, Zeng Mengpu's Flower in a Sinful Sea, and Liu Minong's biography of her in her old age. However, they all record her affairs after marrying Hong Jun. It is not known that before marrying Zhu, Li Shichang also wanted to take her as a concubine. Li Shichang was originally a Nian thief, and he降淸rebelled again. Zeng Guofan奏參him, stripped him of his title as Admiral, and secretly went to Suzhou to indulge in pleasure. He first recruited Caiyun's elder sister, Chaoyun. Chaoyun was afraid and dared not go, so she was replaced by Caiyun. Caiyun was still young at the time, and thought she could be safe. Unexpectedly, Li fell in love with her at first sight, and immediately took out gold and pearls as betrothal gifts, and made an appointment to come and meet her. Caiyun refused, and he was angry, his power was overwhelming and incomprehensible. After he left, the family was frightened and had no way to deal with it. At that time, someone offered a plan and said, "This is Li Shizhong, and it will be inevitable for him to come. Why not move to avoid him?" So they moved into a remote alley without anyone noticing, and left an old woman to guard the mansion. Not long after, Li came back, and he紫彩云was very urgent. The old woman said, "She has already moved." Asked where she moved to. She said, "I don't know." Li大咆哮, but he had no way to deal with it, and he never came again. At that time, he had been革职, and his arrogance had been slightly curbed. Later, in Anhui, he was killed by the Qing governor Yulu, so彩　had no future troubles.

Science Snippets

### Lingzhi (Part 1)

— Jia Zuzhang

Orchids are "auspicious objects," but Lingzhi (a type of mushroom) is an authentic domestic "auspicious herb." Its status as an auspicious herb is likely related to the apocryphal texts of the Han Dynasty. Books like the "Apocrypha of the Classic of Filial Piety" say, "When virtue reaches plants and trees, Lingzhi grass grows; when the elderly are well cared for, Lingzhi grass flourishes." In the second year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanfeng era, "Lingzhi grew in the Ganquan Palace, with nine stalks and connected leaves." Therefore, a general amnesty was declared throughout the empire, and the Song of the Lingzhi Chamber was composed, ending with the lines: "Spreading and flourishing day by day, Lingzhi becomes spiritual brilliance." Thus, this ordinary plant, originally called "zhi" or "zhicao," firmly established its identity as "Lingzhi."

Moreover, because it became "Lingzhi," various miraculous legends were attached to it. For example, the Shennong Ben Cao Jing (Divine Farmer's Materia Medica) mentions five types of Lingzhi: "Red ones like coral, white ones like cut fat, black ones like lacquer, green ones like kingfisher feathers, and yellow ones like purple gold." It also speaks of six types of Lingzhi: "Green Lingzhi grows on Mount Tai, red Lingzhi grows on Mount Huo, yellow Lingzhi grows on Mount Song, white Lingzhi grows on Mount Hua, black Lingzhi grows on Mount Chang, and purple Lingzhi grows in the valleys of Mount Gaoxia, all harvested on the eighth day of the sixth month." As for Ge Hong's Baopuzi (Master Who Embraces Simplicity), it says, "There are stone Lingzhi, wood Lingzhi, grass Lingzhi, flesh Lingzhi, and fungus Lingzhi, each with about a hundred types," which are patently absurd and unbelievable.

Since the record of Lingzhi growing in Emperor Wu of Han's palace, similar accounts have appeared endlessly in historical records: In the spring of the seventeenth year of Emperor Ming of Han's Yongping era, Lingzhi grew in the front hall. In the fourth month of the first year of Emperor Huan of Han's Jianhe era, Lingzhi grass grew in the central Huangcang Palace. In the third month of the seventh year of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Tianbao era, jade Lingzhi grew on the pillars of the Datong Hall, with divine light illuminating the hall. In the seventh month of the second year of Emperor Suzong's Shangyuan era, king Lingzhi grew on the beam of the throne in the Yanying Hall, with one stalk and three leaves, and the Emperor composed the Poem of Jade Lingzhi. These were all recognized as auspicious omens and were solemnly recorded by the court historians. Ancient and Modern Poetry Talks says: "During the Xuanhe era, Wang Jiangming was granted a residence, and he reported the growth of Lingzhi grass on the beams. The Emperor visited, coinciding with a long period of plum rains, which moistened the Lingzhi's cultivated soil. An anonymous person in the capital wrote a seventeen-character poem: 'The new duke's newly granted residence, Lingzhi grass grows on the beams, why does it fall down? Little glue.'" This clearly shows that many historical records are unreliable. Furthermore, Duan Chengshi's Youyang Zazu (Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang) says, "If Lingzhi grows for no reason on a house pillar, white signifies mourning, red signifies blood, black signifies thieves, and yellow signifies joy. If its shape resembles a human face, it signifies loss of wealth; if it resembles cattle or horses, it signifies distant labor; if it resembles turtles or snakes, it signifies depletion of fields and silkworms." This further dampens the hopes of those who wish to find Lingzhi in their homes.

However, in society, it is better to compliment people than to curse them. Especially in China, who dares to say no to the Emperor? Thus, Lingzhi has always maintained its status as an auspicious object, and successive generations of flatterers have treated it as a treasure to be offered. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty probably had a particular fondness for Lingzhi. From the second year of Xianping (999 AD) to the first year of Qianxing (1022 AD), nearly every year in the Wuxing Zhi (Treatise on the Five Elements) of the History of the Song Dynasty has records about Lingzhi. For example, in the first year of Dazhong Xiangfu (1008 AD), Wang Qinruo presented 8,139 stalks of Lingzhi grass in the eighth month; Zhao Anren presented 8,711 stalks of five-colored gold jade purple Lingzhi in the ninth month; and Qinruo and others presented 38,050 stalks of Mount Tai Lingzhi grass in the tenth month. In the sixth year, in the tenth month, "Ding Wei came to court and presented 37,108 stalks of Lingzhi grass, decorated with images of immortal beings, precious birds, and exotic beasts. In the eleventh month, he presented another 95,100 stalks. The following year, when the Emperor arrived at Zhenyuan, the people who came to offer them numbered 18,000 stalks." Such a large-scale collection was truly unprecedented and unrepeatable.

Spring and Autumn

### Jiazhou Six Records: Suzi Tower and the Great Buddha Temple

— Ye Dingluo

From Wuyou Temple to the Great Buddha Temple, one can first visit Suzi Tower. It is said that this is where Su Dongpo, a songwriter and prose writer of the Song Dynasty, once studied. Dongpo was from Meishan near here, and if the biographies about him written by later generations are not nonsense, then it is absolutely possible for someone like him to study in this place for a period of time. Therefore, I do not doubt that this historical site is fabricated. Descending the mountain in a winding path, we called a small boat to cross a small stream, then climbed up the earthen slope from the beach, turned to a terrain similar to a valley, walked up the stone steps between the bushes, and after several unavoidable turns, we found the gate with the two characters "Suzi Tower" written on it. After all, for most people, the charming power of poetry is not as great as the charming power of mythology; therefore, this gate is much poorer than the gate of Wuyou Temple.

Passing through this small school-style gate and crossing a slightly repaired courtyard, we came to what seemed to be a dilapidated and dangerous building, which was "Suzi Tower." Leaning on the narrow wooden handrail and walking up, we climbed to the upper floor. In the open small room and the dilapidated shrine, there were statues of Dongpo and his younger brother, with rosy cheeks and blue clothes, holding scrolls in their hands, looking like professors, with sparse beards and simple turbans, quite in the spirit of lecturing people. But not many people came to visit this floor. Besides my friend, there were only three female students eating peanuts here for a while. This floor is exposed to wind and rain on three sides, and the walls on one side are full of doggerel poems. At this time, the sun had already broken through the clouds and shone on the flowers and trees in the courtyard below, making people aware that the late autumn season had arrived.

The woman and children squeezed up to the floor. I knew that they did not have Dongpo in their minds, but came here to join in the fun. Orange peels and peanut shells became sacrifices to Dongpo. There was really no elegance to be found here. We walked down the handrail again to see the hall that we had not paid attention to just now. The hall also enshrined statues with the same spirit. On the left side of the altar, there was a Kui Xing (god of literature) with his leg raised. Kui Xing is a "god of literature," and Dongpo is a "literary man." Putting them together in a hall and calling it "Suzi Tower" allows one to imagine the character of the person who designed this temple and his intentions.

Suzi Tower has nothing to do with Su Dongpo, just as Dongpo has nothing to do with tourists. Without any feelings, I felt that the same boredom existed in ancient and modern times, and it was necessary to have tea to quench my thirst.

Leaving Suzi Tower, we sat in the tea garden on the mountaintop. This tea garden is right next to the hair of the Great Buddha. A snow-white dome-like roof, like that of a mosque, is the top of the Buddha's head protruding from the mountain. Walking to the stone railing, you can see the head of the Great Buddha. This head is standing in the stone gap between the two mountains. The ears, with earholes large enough for one person to stand in, are the most clearly visible part. Looking down from the head, the Buddha's body looks like a stone wall slightly shaped like a human figure, inserted directly into the river in the depression between the two mountains.

According to the inscriptions of the Great Buddha Temple, the Buddha is thirty-six zhang (approximately 118 meters) tall, with eyes two zhang wide and a head circumference of ten zhang, which gives an idea of its height. Facing the confluence of the Dadu River and the Min River, he stands proudly with the generosity that allows you to rush towards him without getting angry. The river under his feet is obviously frighteningly deep. If the boat capsizes, it will probably be impossible to rescue anyone. According to the inscriptions, this Buddha was started by a monk in the Tang Dynasty who solicited donations for its construction. It took almost half a dynasty to complete the project. Because the rapids here often overturned ferries, making it a dangerous place to navigate, the monk made such a great design here, relying on the protection of the Buddha to allow boats to travel safely from then on. This statement is, of course, an article by a religious person; he studied the causes of the eternal between the shape of the mountain and the water momentum and found a method of remedy, specially rushing the rapids of the mountain base, opening a large flame gap, letting the water rush here to soften its power, and then using an idol to strengthen people's courage. Therefore, his labor and effect have been preserved to this day.

This Buddha is entirely made of stone, and it can also be said that a large cave was carved out of the stone mountain, and the final protruding part was sculpted into a Buddha. At that time, without machines and explosives, it is unknown how much manpower it took to complete this great project. Thinking of this, the spirit of the real Chinese people of the Han and Tang dynasties was active in front of me. Sitting in the restaurant with many people, we have become so anxious and afraid to think about or talk about national affairs, aren't we ashamed?

Going around the back of the stone Buddha, we admired the Great Buddha Temple. The front part of this temple is more quaint than Wuyou Temple, but the back has a Western-style Dharma hall, which seems to be a recently built scripture library. In the more remote place behind, we wanted to buy some rubbings of inscriptions here. We walked into the reception hall on the left side of the main hall, where there was a monk of about thirty years old. He seemed to be on duty, but he was not willing to sincerely entertain guests. He seemed to have a neurotic personality, constantly squinting his eyes and reluctantly answering the questions of the guests. When my friend said no, he immediately took them back. This monk who was not good at business was probably just a bookworm who loved to read Buddhist scriptures. We felt that there was no need to sit there any longer. We walked out of the gate through the old path, feeling that even the monks were more incompetent than those of ancient times. Aren't the monks of modern China also modern Chinese people?

The dew had already condensed on the boat, and many tourists had already started to return. However, we were reluctant to leave. We still wanted to accompany this lonely moon, singing some ancient verses on this beautiful and extraordinarily charming lake night...

It is not that you should feel obligated by society, or by your ambition or inner necessity, to stubbornly write down what must be written. It is absolutely true! — Man Shen

### Curtain

— Wang Dai

It seems we regret it somewhat again,

Adding a thin curtain to the wide-open window;

Neither blinds, nor even glass can satisfy us.

Like a poem, we repeatedly delete and revise.

This curtain is truly a grand invention!

This final epigram is indeed somewhat surprising.

It seems to be still derived from imitation.

Don’t you see the cicada cocoon, the spider web, the light mist of dawn?

Transforming sunlight into moonlight, cicada song into autumn insects;

Making the scenery outside the window hazy, the thoughts inside the window serene.

In the midday heat of July,

We seem to be immersed in the spring breeze or autumn air.

It wonderfully complements the window opening,

Like a railing to the meadow, willow branches to the sky.

They exist independently, unconnected, each going its own way;

They are even more mutually compatible in their mutual silence.

Who created intimacy and created separation?

Just like carrying a slight suspicion within deep understanding!

I fear that one day the window will die like a dried-up well,

The curtain torn, and from then on, there will be no secrets whatsoever.

### Boating on a Moonlit Night

— Pei Yin

Random Notes by the Lakeside

Have you ever been to Hangzhou? Have you ever taken a small boat and, on a cool and moonlit summer night, invited one or two kindred spirits to wander in the heart of the lake? This poetic and beautiful scenery is enough to make people forget the heat and troubles of the day.

There have been some nights when we took a small boat and went to the heart of the lake to seek coolness and fantasy; enjoying this rare beautiful scene. The moon hangs high in the sky, and the night wind blows on the lake surface, rolling up a series of fine silver waves.

The boat was moving slowly, we gently stroked the oars, and softly sang B. D. Ackley’s “Moonlight on the Lake.” From somewhere, the sound of a violin drifted over, so soft, and mixed with the melodious singing of some young men and women. Slowly, that boat full of youth and joy crossed from our left side; vaguely, I saw the shadows of several robust young people on the boat.

Our boat passed through a bridge hole, and everyone suddenly felt a coolness. The sound of the bow of the boat breaking the water was reflected from the bridge wall, making a rustling sound so eerily. On the other side of the bridge, the lake surface was covered with lotus leaves, densely connected into a large area. The boat struggled to row through the gaps between the lotus leaves, and the sides of the boat constantly brushed against the lotus stalks. The lotus flowers were in full bloom, and the rich fragrance of the flowers floated on the lake surface. Those large flowers swayed in the dim night air. I was actually intoxicated by this strong floral fragrance...

The night was deep, and the lake appeared cooler. The lonely moon hung high in the sky, foolishly watching her shadow cast on the heart of the lake. The mountain colors around were very deep, and some farmers' temples and villas were still flashing sparse lights. Who hasn't fallen asleep at this late hour? ... I couldn't help but fantasize.

### Gazing (Two Chapters)

— Jiang Ye

Tower

A tower stands outside my window. I stand under the window and can see it. It has been standing there for a long time. —

It is old and worn, it is aged; it is dilapidated.

I think: One day, it will suddenly collapse with a bang: ...

No praise. I look at it. I am composing a dirge for it.

This tower, it has experienced I don’t know how much wind and rain, calamity. Even if it had a glorious past; but everything has become a relic. Such a remnant only has loneliness, only has desolation.

Therefore, I am praying for the collapse of this tower.

Collapse is the inevitable fate of this tower. Collapse may still be a kind of happiness for this tower.

Mountain

Gazing at the mountain standing outside my window, I become melancholy. I have too many thoughts about this mountain.

Children fly kites on the mountain, villagers go to the mountain to graze cattle and sheep, and cut firewood, and I have been a frequent visitor to this mountain since I was a child, and I can find traces of my childhood footsteps everywhere.

Since the Japanese devils raised their adhesive plaster flag on this mountain, it has been occupied as a military forbidden zone, and no one is allowed to approach it even one step.

What about now? What about now that the Japanese devils have been driven away?

Now, it is still not a peaceful era:

The children do not come to fly kites, the villagers have no sheep to graze, and they do not come to cut firewood anymore, and I, who have returned from the distant south not long ago, am about to go to another distant place.

### Random Talks on Poetry

What is not connected to actual life cannot be considered a work of art, and what is not connected to actual life cannot be considered poetry.

Poetry is a tool for educating the masses, and poetry is also a perspective for understanding reality.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Finished, Chief Secretary." The Big Fool then performed a sweeping salute, reached into his pocket and took out a note, handed it over; then turned around and placed the package in his hand on another desk, turned his back to us, made a face at Little Tiger, and made a gesture. He thought I was looking at the note, and didn't notice his actions. In fact, I understood the note as soon as I saw it, and at this time I had already moved my eyes to see what food he had brought. Judging from his secretive actions, I could guess that those things, although not exquisite, were probably not bad, and there were quite a few; because he and Little Tiger, one big and one small, happened to be a pair of foodies.

"Chief Secretary, reporting back," the Big Fool then remembered that there was also a report; "The secret telegrams have all been sent. There was a phone call from Peiping at the time. Please call back home, Chief Secretary, there is an urgent official matter..." He pointed to the note in my hand, "That was received by Clerk Liu, at six twenty-five in the morning. …"

"Anything else?" I knew that most of his thoughts were pinned on that package of food; absent-minded, he might drop one or two pieces of news; so I reminded him a little.

"There is... yes... Longhu Terrace has already made contact, a small contact, only rifles and light machine guns, a trial of strength. It only lasted for an hour. The Chinese garrison replaced the Japanese devils on this side with a beating, and there were quite a few casualties on the Japanese side..."

"Anything else?" I asked again.

"... They have now deployed large formations of aircraft, fifty field guns, and two large squadrons of cavalry here; at six o'clock in the afternoon, they are preparing to attack the Chinese garrison on the left and right flanks... The Chinese side has equipment that is too old."

"Anything else...?" I tentatively asked again.

"... Before leaving, I tidied up the 'gear' and told Little Liu and Second Monk, Second Monk's woman to take turns guarding it in two shifts. - Second Monk and his woman both said that someone was paying attention to our 'establishment'; Little Liu didn't sleep all night, afraid of trouble, so..." The so-called "gear" refers to the radio transmitter.

"That's very well handled." The Big Fool handled this move well; "'Carefulness is never wrong' is a common saying," I couldn't help but praise him. "No more words, then?" I thought the Big Fool's report should be over. As for someone paying attention, it was Du Erxian and his wife being nervous; I believed that since we had appeared as "Number Fifteen," ordinary Japanese special agents would never pay attention. If someone was paying attention, it must be a high-ranking member of the Pine Group, they are elusive and ruthless. If there was any action, Du Er would not notice. So I did not follow up.

"There's one more thing!" The Big Fool stammered a little; "It can't be someone from inside us..."

### Song of the Seashore

— Lu Hai

Fishing Boat

On the clear blue sea, white sails are floating vaguely, the sun has just risen, and the early-rising fishing boats have already sailed far away with the wind.

Living on this coast, gazing at the departing fishing boats all day long, do I silently think about the wind and waves of the future?

Happy residents of the seaside country, will you also have the impurities of the mortal world on the fishing boat?

Envy those people who live on the sea, they are so free, you see, every day, they sail their own boats, turning in any direction they please.

Beach

Who used "planting an ideal flower on the beach" to compare it to an impossible hope?

Today, living by the sea, I actually saw the flowers on the beach? I exclaimed in surprise:

"Come and see! Flowers also grow on the beach!"

It spreads in the gaps between the sand and rocks, with round leaves and white flowers, but I don't know what it's called.

Dusk

Every dusk, I stroll along the silent beach. The sea at dusk is so attractive, the setting sun emits colorful brilliance.

Red clouds; purple clouds, yellow clouds, set off on the blue head of the sea, like a colored plate, smearing the blue waves, what a beautiful dusk! If it is said that color intoxicates people, this dusk sea is enough for you to love.

Stars

Now, in the season of midsummer, every night I lie by the window, quietly whistling, the sound contains the streamer of my mood.

I love to watch the stars, the stars on this midsummer night are so comfortable to look at! Especially at the junction of the sea and the sky, the silver light of the stars is reflected on the sea waves, I wonder if it is the starlight of Bethlehem?

Star girl, how lively you are! You are always mischievously blinking your eyes, I really want to transform into the night wind and travel with you. (July 9th, Qingdao)
