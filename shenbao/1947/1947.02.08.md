### The National Army Is Only Nine Miles from Linyi; The Communist Army Attacking Laiwu Has Already Been Defeated; Liu Bocheng's Attempt to Flee to Eastern Henan Has Been Thwarted

[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th] The National Army's advance on Linyi has reached a point nine miles from the city. It is currently difficult to predict whether the Communist army will make a stand with their backs to the city. In the central Shandong province, the National Army under Wang Yaowu near Laiwu is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. The National Army occupied the city on the 4th of this month, and the Communist army immediately launched a counterattack the following day.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] Chen Yi's troops of the Communist army in southern Shandong are now disintegrating. Some advocate defending Linyi, some want to flee, and others wish to surrender. Among them, the Second, Third, Seventh, and New Sixth Divisions, which advocate fleeing, began independent actions on the evening of the 6th, harassing southeast of Tancheng. In the area of Suanzhuang Lake and Daxinji, north of Baitapu on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, they have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hao Pengju's troops. The fighting had not subsided as of the afternoon of the 7th. The National Army north of Tancheng, in order to support Hao's troops, also advanced north towards Linyi in three routes on the morning of the 7th, engaging in fierce battles with the faction of Chen Yi's troops advocating defense. At the same time, Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, wrote a letter to Communist army officers and soldiers, which was distributed by the air force on the morning of the 7th, encouraging the faction of Chen Yi's troops that advocate surrender to quickly surrender to the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 7th] As the National Army presses towards Linyi, the morale of the Communist army in southern Shandong is wavering. It is reported that important military and political institutions have been relocated to Dadian, about ninety miles north of Linyi. The price of the fake Beihai currency in the Communist area is falling sharply, and the people are throwing away the fake money and secretly hoarding legal tender.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 7th] The Nationalist and Communist armies are still fighting near Caojiazhuang, 14 kilometers south of Laiwu today. In addition to dispatching a part of its forces to clear out scattered Communist troops around Laiwu, the National Army is also rushing to repair the highway between Boshan and Laiwu.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] The National Army in central Shandong has made progress. The Communist army attacking Laiwu has been repelled. The National Army took advantage of the victory to advance south, reaching Yanzhuang, Caojiazhuang, Yangshan, and surrounding areas 14 kilometers south of the city on the evening of the 5th, where fighting continues.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] Liu Bocheng's troops, consisting of twelve regiments totaling over 20,000 men, crossed south of the Longhai Railway a week ago and dispersed to LÃ¼ling, Tuocheng, Luyi, and Haoxian areas. After continuous tracking and interception by the National Army for several days, they were completely routed by the 6th. Currently, the National Army in eastern Henan is strengthening pacification efforts. Liu Bocheng's eight regiments in western Shandong, totaling over 15,000 men, fiercely attacked Liuhe Xiaoba and the area 20 miles northwest of Shangqiu on the 4th. The garrison forces resolutely blocked them with flanking maneuvers from both wings, resulting in fierce fighting for two days and nights. Two-thirds of the Communist army was annihilated. Liu Bocheng's six columns have now lost four, and his plan to flee to eastern Henan has been completely thwarted.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 7th] A brigade of Liu Bocheng's troops has newly arrived northwest of Shangqiu, and the National Army is increasing reinforcements. A major battle between Henan and Anhui is about to break out.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 7th] There is peace and quiet in Jiaodong with no fighting. Communist army movements are busy around Jinan. On the 5th and 6th, two to three thousand Communist troops moved south from Yucheng, attempting to attack Qihe, but were all repelled by the National Army.

### The First Batch of U.S. Personnel from the Military Mediation Department Return Home by Ship

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 7th] After the U.S. statement of withdrawing from the Military Mediation Department, over 300 U.S. personnel and their families left Ping by special train for Tanggu on the 7th, and will return home by ship. This is the first batch to withdraw.

[United Press, Beiping, 7th] The U.S. personnel from the Military Mediation Department were ordered by the State Department to withdraw. The first batch of 303 people, aboard seven specially prepared train cars, arrived safely in Tanggu at 1:35 PM, without any accidents, except for a one-hour delay outside Beiping due to a damaged locomotive. Upon arriving in Tanggu, they immediately transferred to the transport ship General Weigel, which is expected to set sail within 24 hours.

### The U.S. Changchun Branch Ends; Liaison Office to China to Be Established

Withdraws After Work Is Completed

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] Colonel Tyson, the U.S. representative of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch, recently notified both the government and the Chinese Communist Party in writing that the U.S. work officially ends from today. A Changchun branch of the U.S. Army Headquarters' Liaison Office to China will be established to carry out unfinished tasks before the withdrawal. Once transportation matters within the Northeast region of the department are completed and work is finished, it will withdraw. The government and the Chinese Communist Party at the Changchun branch will remain as usual.

### Personnel of Various Groups in the Northeast

Concentrate in Changchun and Shenyang to Await Orders for Withdrawal

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] Government and U.S. personnel from various groups in the Northeast of the Military Mediation Department have gradually concentrated in Changchun and Shenyang. The Anshan 30th Group withdrew to Shenyang on the 5th and awaits orders for withdrawal with the Shenyang 27th Group. The Hailong 29th Group and the Dehui 34th Group also withdrew to Changchun on the 5th and 6th respectively. The Siping 28th Group will also return to Changchun within a day or two. As for the Chinese Communist Party personnel of the above five groups, they withdrew to Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places on December 20th of last year.

### Personnel of the Three Parties in Changchun; Communist Party Personnel Withdraw First

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] A spokesman for the government side of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch recently told reporters: The process for the withdrawal of the three parties of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch may involve the Communist Party personnel withdrawing first. The U.S. side has agreed to provide two planes to send them to Harbin. After the Communist Party personnel withdraw, the U.S. side will begin to withdraw via both land and air through Shenyang to Beiping. Government personnel, except for some who will go to Ping by plane, will travel by train. It is reported that arrangements have been made with the local transportation authorities to prepare two special trains for transportation.

### The Military Mediation Department's Special Group Discusses Sending Liaison Officers

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The last special group of the Military Mediation Department held a meeting at 4 PM this afternoon. U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Ye Ci, Government Colonel Liu Tielun, and Communist Party Lieutenant Colonel Long Yinglin attended. They discussed sending liaison officers from both sides to their original areas and unfinished matters. Major General Zhou Beifeng (Director of the Suiyuan Political Bureau), the liaison officer of the 12th War Zone who has been released, also attended the meeting to thank the group for its efforts to restore their freedom. Today, a reporter interviewed Zhou, who said: (1) On August 21st, he was ordered by Commander Fu to go to Jining to persuade the Communist army to stop attacking Datong, but to no avail. Later, the war escalated, and he was taken to Zuoyun by the Communist army. Initially, the Military Mediation Department sent a special group to Datong to handle the exchange of liaison officers several times, but the determined exchange dates were never successful. He was then sent to Yan'an, and only yesterday morning at 10 AM was he notified that he might be released and returned to Ping by plane in the afternoon. (2) The Yan'an side seems to believe that continuing to fight could change the situation in their favor. They have great expectations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The Jiefang Daily has never published the news of the U.S. withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department and the withdrawal of Communist Party personnel, only articles criticizing the U.S. withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department. After living through a forced march of three thousand miles (and four months as a prisoner), Zhou's temples have turned gray. He will stay here briefly and then go to Zhangjiakou to meet Commander Fu and report everything.

### The Government and the Chinese Communist Party Exchange Liaison Officers

Zhou Beifeng Released from Yan'an and Returns to Ping

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Huang Hua, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Military Mediation Department, returned to Ping from Yan'an this afternoon, and Major General Zhou Beifeng, the liaison officer of the 12th War Zone, was also released and returned to Ping. Zhou was the liaison officer stationed in Jining by Commander Fu. During the Jining campaign, the Communist army exchanged Zhou for their retreat. Later, the Military Mediation Department formed a special group to go to Daming to handle the exchange of liaison officers between the 12th War Zone and the Communist Party (the Communist Party also had liaison officers in Guisui), but all efforts failed. Recently, as the Military Mediation Department was being dissolved and Chinese Communist Party personnel were about to withdraw to Yan'an, the government side requested again that the Chinese Communist Party release Zhou. Today, the Military Mediation Department sent the last special group to the Xijiao Airport to handle the exchange of liaison officers from both sides. This afternoon, Huang Hua accompanied Zhou Beifeng and three other government personnel from Yan'an, and the Datong special group also accompanied Yuan Jian and five other Chinese Communist Party liaison officers from Datong, and the exchange was immediately carried out.

In Order to Maintain Liaison Between the Government and the Chinese Communist Party

[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Chen Jiakang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters yesterday: Whether the Chinese Communist Party delegation will withdraw before March 5th is pending instructions from Yan'an. However, if the government does not refuse the Chinese Communist Party personnel to reside, the Chinese Communist Party delegation is willing to continue to fulfill its responsibility of maintaining liaison between the government and the Chinese Communist Party.

### The Northern Hebei National Army Launches a Counterattack; The Communist Army Attacking Laishui Retreats Southwest; Strong National Army Units Arrive in Baoding

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 7th] The Northern Hebei National Army launched a full-scale counterattack. Nie Rongzhen's troops of over 20,000 men, who fiercely attacked Laishui for days, retreated to the southwest yesterday. The National Army in the Laishui area has entered Yixian County, and Yixian City can be recovered within days. The National Army between Caohe and Zhuoxian is also sweeping the area 20 miles on both sides. The National Army reinforcements arrived in Baoding on the evening of the 6th, immediately stabilizing the morale of the people. The next action is in preparation.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Fierce fighting is taking place north of Baoding. Military sources say that the two Communist armies have been attacking since the 4th in Laishui, Yixian, Wen Dunsizi Mountain, and outside Xushui. After days of fierce fighting, the Communist army has not gained an advantage, and the National Army is gradually taking the initiative. Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, went to Zhuoxian Dingxing front today to inspect the military situation with Mou Tingfang, and returned to Ping that day. Mou is still staying in Zhuoxian, and Xushui Gucheng is tense. The National Army's fortifications outside Baoding are very strong, ensuring no worry. He Long's sister, He Feng, is now near Baoding. In addition to commanding two cavalry units, she is also responsible for training Communist Party female spies.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Baoding, 7th. The military authorities of Hebei Province have recently implemented effective emergency measures in response to the current situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The National Army has begun large-scale deployments to make planned new arrangements to ensure the safety of Pingbao traffic and consolidate the defenses of Baoding. The National Army's strength in Dingxing has been strengthened so that the troops stationed along the Pingbao route can coordinate with Baoding from north and south to crush the Communist army's harassment attempts. Therefore, military transportation between Pingbao has been busy in recent days. In addition, strong National Army units heading south along the Pinghan Railway have arrived in Xushui and are waiting for orders to cross Baoding and head south.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] There are minor skirmishes outside Shijiazhuang. Communist army forces frequently harass southwest of Yuanshi. Around Nanbeiyaocheng northwest of Zhengding, six regiments of the Communist army frequently attack the National Army outposts outside Zhengding. Yaocheng County is southwest of Gangshan, and there were battles the day before yesterday, with Xima briefly falling. The city of Shijiazhuang is stable. The military has requested the Pinghan Railway Bureau to actively repair the city's railway to secure Shijiazhuang, which can be completed within two weeks. The Communist army's attention has shifted to cutting off the Zhengtai Railway to isolate Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan. Military sources say that the current Communist army force is not enough to attack Shijiazhuang. The Communist army on the west side of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is mobilizing hundreds of carts to transport materials and food to the mountains on both sides and is actively engaging in air defense activities.

Gu also conveyed Chairman Chiang's condolences to the compatriots in the pacification area. Gu will go to Tianjin on the 9th.

### The Government Raises Import Tariffs; The U.S. Will Express Opposition; American Businesses Urge the U.S. Government to Stop It

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Chinese Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen is scheduled to raise import tariffs starting on the 6th of this month. The U.S. State Department and the Department of Commerce stated today that they will oppose it. It is said that this matter has not yet been confirmed by their representatives in China, and action cannot be decided until the report is received, but it is believed that this move is enough to harm American commerce in China. When reporters asked the authorities for their opinions, it was said that this could devalue Chinese legal tender, which will ultimately be unavoidable.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] American businesses in China are worried about the increasing control of industry and commerce by the Chinese government, believing that it threatens the position of American businessmen in the Far East. Hundreds of American businesses with branches in China or seeking to establish branches are urging the American government to stop the wave of government monopolies of the market, saying that this move would eliminate private enterprises. The initiators of this movement are the National Foreign Trade Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in China, both of which are based in New York and composed of American businesses engaged in Far East trade. Other American trade organizations, such as the American Chamber of Commerce, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, have not joined, but are equally concerned about maintaining and expanding American trade in China. The State Department and the Department of Commerce are also sympathetic to the business community's request for government support to expand postwar Far East trade. The Export-Import Bank is the same, and its main task is to assist American international trade. A lengthy memorandum from the two New York chambers of commerce to the State Department outlined the increasing dominance of government-run industries in China and stated that the government should take remedial measures on behalf of American interests. The State Department said it has been negotiating with the Nanjing government for months to resolve the difficulties encountered by American trade and investment in China.

### Villages Around Datong Are Repeatedly Harassed by the Communist Army

[Cooperative News Agency, Beiping, 7th] A U.S. military officer who returned here from Datong today told the United Press that villages around Datong are repeatedly harassed by the Communist army, and fighting continues intermittently, causing considerable damage to houses. He saw some Japanese technicians in Datong wearing old Japanese military uniforms. Also, according to a U.S. officer who returned to Ping from Taiyuan, there are still a large number of Japanese soldiers in the Taiyuan area, either wearing Japanese military uniforms or Chinese clothes.

### The Chahar Administrative Meeting Opens; Chairman Chuan Announces Ten Major Programs; A Mongolian Banner Cultural Welfare Committee Is Established

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] A Zhangjiakou telephone message states that the first full provincial administrative meeting in Chahar after the recovery of the province opened at 9 AM this morning. Chairman Chuan presided over it in person. Attendees included commissioners, county magistrates, section chiefs, and Mongolian Banner representatives, totaling more than 800 people. The meeting is scheduled for ten days. In his opening speech, Chairman Chuan revealed the ten major programs for Chahar Province in the future: (1) Complete local autonomy and implement democratic politics; (2) Stabilize society and ensure public security; (3) Implement a 25% rent reduction; (4) Increase farmland; (5) Protect transportation and balance prices; (6) Restore schools at all levels; (7) Improve health facilities; (8) Reorganize finance and reduce the burden; (9) Improve the welfare of Mongolian compatriots; (10) Implement omnipotent politics. Chairman Chuan particularly emphasized that stability is a prerequisite for promoting all policies. In addition, the Chahar Provincial Government has established the Mongolian Banner Cultural Welfare Committee as an agency for implementing Mongolian Banner policies.

### A Batch of Communist Army Enters Dalian City

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] It is reported that on the 1st and 2nd, three military ships of a certain country arrived at Dalian Wharf, and 1,500 Communist army soldiers with equipped vehicles landed and entered the city. In addition, a certain national army in Jinzhou is actively constructing ground fortifications and other defensive works. At a time when the reception of Dalian is being hyped up, its future development is indeed noteworthy.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] It is learned that the Communist army has now changed the Dalian Municipal Government into the LÃ¼da Jin Joint Office, which is a measure that has attracted much attention.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] Passenger trains from Shihe south to Datong are now open. In addition, the Jinzhou Chengzipo Railway now runs from Jinzhou to Dengshahe, which is one hundred miles away from Jinzhou, but because it is only used by the Soviet army to transport materials, the people are not allowed to use it.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] Soviet troops are stationed at Yuzidian, about thirty miles southwest of Bizçª, because the area is outside the Lushun naval base area, and we have urged them to pay attention.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] For more than two months after the national army stationed in Yuzidian, the outer periphery of Dalian, no formal administrative personnel have been sent. Helplessly, the stationed troops ordered the local area to establish a maintenance committee. However, the leading members of the maintenance committee are Japanese accomplices such as senior criminals and special agents, Wang Letian, Shi Tingya, etc. In the past, they arbitrarily accused people of being anti-Manchu and resisting Japan. Today, they falsely accuse people of being the Eighth Route Army and spies, deceiving the stationed troops and harming 200,000 civilians. The people have specially written to Du Yuming and Chairman Xu Zhen, appealing to be rescued from the water and fire.

### The China Chang Railway Establishes the Dalian Management Office

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The Dalian Management Office of the China Chang Railway will be formally established in Wafangdian within days. Director Guo Zhongxin has taken a train on the 6th to preside over it. The temporary office originally located at Dashiqiao has been dissolved. The Dalian Management Office is the southernmost section of the China Chang Railway, in charge of the 240-kilometer railway administration between Dalian and Dashiqiao.

### Nantong Datongzhen Recaptured

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 7th] Military News: Datong Town, Sanyu District, Nantong, has long been occupied by the Communist army, and the people have suffered greatly. On the evening of the 28th of last month, the Communist army gathered in the town again and carried out massacres. The situation was very tragic. Dozens of people were killed in the Tongxing Township area of Henan. Upon hearing this, the Tong Rudong Qingjiao District of the First Pacification Zone immediately cooperated with the Self-Defense Forces and rushed to the scene, recapturing the town and capturing its leaders, seven people. Fifty people, including the head of the political and transportation station, automatically laid down their guns and surrendered. Currently, the refugees who fled are returning to their hometowns one after another.

### The U.S. Howard Newspaper System Opposes Interference in China

[Associated Press, New York, 6th] The Howard newspaper system today wrote a commentary criticizing Democratic Congressman Mansfield's Pacific report as "admirable," but its suggestion that the four powers jointly resolve China's domestic situation must be criticized, saying, "This suggestion is bound to backfire, because China is an independent country."

### The Letter from the MinShe Party to the Chairman; The Wording Is Much Softer Than the Original Opinion Paper; The Letter Was Taken to Nanjing by Lei Zhen Last Night

[Our News] Confirmed News: The requirements and wording in the letter that Zhang Junmai entrusted Lei Zhen to take to the Chairman are much softer than the original opinion paper. The most obvious point is that the original opinion paper required that the position of Executive Yuan President be held by a person outside the party. After Lei Zhen repeatedly explained, the MinShe Party personnel considered administrative experience and practical issues, and finally decided to cancel this requirement. The Central Government's intentions for reorganizing the government are very sincere, and the central and local governments can be fully considered when implementing the reorganization in the future. Currently, the MinShe Party is carrying out preparatory work. Zhang Junmai will go to Nanjing next week to meet with the Chairman to discuss practical issues. If there are no unexpected changes in the reorganization of the government, it is expected to be completed in mid-March.

[Our News] Lei Zhen took the night train to Nanjing at 11 PM last night, and his activities before his departure were quite busy. At noon, he gathered many important members of the MinShe Party at the International Hotel for a final consultation before going to Beijing. At 5 PM, he visited Director Wu Wenguan, who came to Shanghai, and gave a detailed report on the process of the contact in Shanghai. According to Lei, there is not a great distance between the government and the MinShe Party, and the various conditions rumored outside may not be true. Zhang Junmai could not go to Beijing with him due to some affairs. In his letter to Chairman Chiang, he explained the reasons and difficulties for the MinShe Party's delayed submission of opinions on the reorganization of the government, but it is not necessarily a requirement for the government to respond. According to his personal observation, the government reorganization can be realized in the short term. In addition to the MinShe Party and the Youth Party, social leaders will be individually invited to participate by the government.

### Sun Ke Discusses the Current Situation: The Government is Determined Not to Resolve the Communist Issue Militarily; Government Reorganization Can Be Implemented Within Weeks

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 7th] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, recently gave a speech to our reporter, discussing the French-Vietnamese conflict, the domestic situation, and the US policy towards Japan. The details are as follows:

Conflict in Vietnam

If the conflict in Vietnam is brought before the United Nations, China should support any reasonable demands of the Viet Minh Republic. At the same time, if the conflict in Vietnam develops to a point where it endangers China's interests, then we will have to consider the situation and adopt a new attitude. If France attempts to conquer Vietnam by force, it will be seen as an imperialist country causing resentment among all Asian countries, including China. This will result in some Chinese people crossing the Sino-Vietnamese border and fighting alongside the Viet Minh forces. However, the report that the Chinese government plans to organize an expeditionary force to fight in Vietnam is not true. China's recognition of the Viet Minh government depends on the future development of the situation. Furthermore, such recognition could strain Sino-French relations, which we should avoid. Current Sino-French relations are very cordial, with no serious disputes. As of now, China has not participated in any side of the conflict in Vietnam, so this issue is unrelated to China. However, when the Viet Minh government is capable of [conducting] diplomacy, we will welcome any proposals from the Viet Minh to establish relations with us.

Regarding the domestic situation, the Shandong campaign is ongoing and will have a decisive impact on the country's future. The government is forced to take military measures to deal with the Communist military attacks. The government is prepared and willing to resume peace talks at any time, but military action is the only way to change the Communist attitude. The government sincerely hopes that the Communists will take a reasonable path, but if they do not, then the war will continue as long as they resist by force. The Communist army attacked the government army because they have too much faith in their own military power, but the Communist army cannot occupy Xuzhou according to plan and are now preparing to retreat from Linyi. The war situation is gradually turning against them, but the government is determined not to [follow] suit by using military methods to solve the Communist problem. As for the reorganization of the government, it may be implemented within the next few weeks. The government is recruiting various parties to share the responsibility of the government. General Marshall's statement acknowledged the failure of American mediation but strengthened the government's desire to accelerate the implementation of the constitution. The withdrawal of the United States from the Three-Man Executive Headquarters and the Military Mediation Department was dictated by the situation. The Chinese question must be solved by the Chinese themselves. Marshall was just a mediator. He is an American, with a great power behind him, so his mediation work seemed too much like foreign intervention. If Marshall were a citizen of a small country like Switzerland, the situation would be different.

Moscow Conference

When asked about the possibility of the Moscow Conference discussing the Chinese question, Sun said: I do not know how the Moscow Conference can involve China. It must be known that any external interference is enough to arouse the indignation of our people. Marshall's failure is a lesson learned.

Regarding the Japanese question, the current policy of the United States is wrong. MacArthur seems to rely too much on reactionary elements to achieve his goals.

The Japanese ruling class is covering up for a comeback and is trying to make MacArthur believe that Japan is democratic and no longer has military ambitions. China has suffered the most from Japanese aggression and is very concerned about the development of the situation in that country, fearing that Japan's expansionist policy will be revived. The Japanese question is linked to the current US-Soviet confrontation. Each side wants to use Japan as a tool to promote its future goals. This situation is enough to increase suspicion and sow the seeds of future conflict. Therefore, all countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression should cooperate closely, and the Far Eastern Commission should also be strengthened so that it is not just a formality. It would be best if the United States adopted broad opinions and abandoned its current policy.

Sino-Soviet Relations

Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, we have always been satisfied, but they should be improved. The Northeast question also needs to be resolved. Sincere negotiations are the only way to avoid misunderstandings. Taking over the administration of Dalian is feasible at any time. This matter depends on the outcome of the current negotiations in the Northeast. These negotiations are mostly technical in nature, but some aspects are of a higher standard.

### Truth About the Nanjing Massacre: Witnesses Give Indignant Testimony; Public Trial Period May Be Extended by One Day

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, Tani Hisao, continued to be tried on the 7th. Witnesses and victims were called to testify. At exactly 2:00 PM, Judge Shi and others arrived in court. The suspect Tani was escorted to the court and remained extremely calm. First, the judge asked him about the date he entered the city and when he was transferred. Tani replied: I entered the city on the morning of the 3rd. On the 15th, I began transferring from inside and outside the Zhonghua Gate to Wuhu. The transfer continued on the 16th and 17th and was completed on the 19th. Then, Chen Yaodong, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing City Council, reported on the investigation of the enemy's crimes, stating: I have been dedicated to the investigation since July 1st of last year, with a total of 2,784 cases, divided into ten categories: (1) shooting cases, 1,159 cases, (2) stabbing cases, 667 cases, (3) mass slaughter cases, 315 cases, (4) burning to death cases, 136 cases, (5) beating to death cases, 69 cases, (6) cases of torture followed by murder, 33 cases, (7) cases of rape followed by murder, 20 cases, (8) bombing cases, 19 cases, (9) drowning cases, 11 cases, (10) other cases, 321 cases. Among them, the following are noteworthy: (1) one-third of the cases occurred in the area outside the Zhonghua Gate, that is, within the defendant's defense zone, (2) the most cases occurred between the 12th and 20th, which was the period when the defendant was stationed in Nanjing. Finally, Chen requested that, in addition to the suspect Tani, all those involved in the massacre should be extradited to China and executed according to law. Immediately, witnesses were called to testify about the truth, including Liu Chengzhong, Xie Lisan, Hu Kouzhi, Lu Yinfa, Zhang Sunshi, Li Chenshi, Gu Yanshi, and more than thirty others. Then, Ms. Cheng Jie, who was the director of the Social Services Department of Gulou Hospital at the time, appeared in court to explain. The session ended at 5:50 PM, and the trial will continue at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. There are still more than ten witnesses. After questioning on the 8th, the trial will proceed to the debate stage. Because there are many details in the case and the trial is difficult, the public trial may be extended by one day. The more important cases among the witnesses today are recorded as follows: (1) Zhao Rongsheng was a victim himself. He described in detail the scene of his struggle with the enemy, mentioning how he used his fists to repel the enemy, but because he had no weapons, he was stabbed and injured very badly. The scars are still vivid today, including eleven knife wounds on his head, two bullet scars on his neck, a gunshot wound on his left wrist, which caused the wrist to be deformed, and his left middle finger was broken. Zhao's description was vivid and moving, and even the suspect Tani, who was standing woodenly to the side, was moved by it. (2) Zhang Sunshi's husband was killed. The judge asked where the injury was. Zhang said: "How can you still look there?" Then she continued: "I have so much hatred for the Japanese devils! I can't finish talking about it in three days. I have suffered too much." The anger overflowed her words. She then said: She herself was raped by the enemy and also saw her younger sister-in-law and a neighbor raped and became ill, etc. Her tone was painful, and the listeners were furious. (3) Yu Biwen said: On that day, he and six others were surrounded by the enemy, and all five were stabbed to death. Yu was also stabbed unconscious at the time. When he woke up, he was beaten again by a Japanese police officer with a rifle butt and fainted again. He woke up again at midnight that day and immediately showed the crowd his wounds, including seven knife wounds and two gunshot wounds. (4) Liu Maosui described the Qing [situation] of his mother's death, saying that his mother was hiding in an air-raid shelter with more than thirty other people, and all of them were locked in the cave by the Japanese and died. (5) Dong Wenlong's [?], who was killed, had eleven wounds. (6) Kong Hanshi's maternal uncle, grandmother, and younger sister, a total of six people, were shot [and killed]. (7) Zhu Guoshi's father and two brothers were also seen being killed. After his father was killed, he was placed in the house and then set on fire. After the testimonies of the above witnesses, the suspect Tani also tried to argue at any time. The reasons he held were mainly that the incident (1) did not occur within his defense zone, (2) it was impossible for civilians to hide in civilian houses during the war, (3) the above situations could not have occurred and were impossible, (4) fabricated talk cannot be recognized, (5) there may have been injuries during the war, and I can only sympathize and cannot be responsible. His wording was cunning, and the audience was very angry. The court announced that the trial would continue on the 8th and then adjourned.

### Nanjing Mayor Investigates the Whereabouts of a German Man, Who Saved the Lives of Citizens

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, is currently making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of a German man who saved the lives of thousands of Chinese people when the Japanese army was carrying out massacres in Nanjing. As the city searched for evidence of this case, it was discovered that when the Japanese army invaded Nanjing in December 1937, a certain German man, the head of the Nanjing branch of the International Relief Association, housed Chinese refugees and protected them, so that thousands of them were spared from the Japanese army's atrocities. The detailed name of this German man has not been published. At that time, he took photos of the Japanese army's atrocities. When he returned to his country in the summer of 1938 on government orders, he publicly exhibited these photos to expose the Japanese army's inhuman behavior to the German people. The exhibition was very successful, causing the Hitler government to declare that it would arrest him if he did not stop the exhibition. Mayor Shen learned that the man was already in his sixties and was living with his family in a small town in Germany and was in a very difficult situation. If he could find out his detailed address, Mayor Shen intended to provide him with financial assistance. American members of the International Relief Association also wanted to send this German man back to China and give him a pension in order to reward him for his relief efforts during the Nanjing Massacre.

### Large Oil Veins Discovered in Anyuan, Southern Jiangxi

Reserves Can Support 2,000 Workers for 50 Years

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 7th] A large amount of oil ore has been discovered in Anyuan, located in Southern Jiangxi. The magistrate of the county, Zhang, is currently in the province attending the All-Jiangxi Administrative Conference. He told reporters that Jiangxi Province's oil ore was discovered as early as the winter of the 13th year of the Republic of China when local people were building a stone bridge [at] Shikong [Bridge]. At that time, there were long, about two kilometers thick layers of black stone chips. The weather was very cold, and the workers burned fire to keep warm. They burned these stone chips unintentionally. The burning gave off a strong stone oil smell. The general public believed in geomancy and kept it secret. It was not until recent years that the county government hired mining experts to conduct preliminary surveys and identified it as oil ore. When the Jiangxi Provincial Political Inspection Delegation came to the county for inspection last year, it discovered a large number of ore veins. The abundance of reserves can support 2,000 miners for 50 years of mining. Currently, the oil shale discovered on the surface can be ignited. According to general estimates, the oil content is about 5 percent.

### Editorial: The Function of the Export Promotion Committee

Regarding export trade, the government's important measures have been, according to past situations, roughly as follows: (1) abolishing export taxes; (2) providing loans, such as packing, negotiation, and opening letters of credit; (3) purchasing raw silk and preparing to purchase tea, and recently implementing (4) subsidies for export drafts; and (5) establishing an Export Promotion Committee.

Regarding the tasks that the so-called Export Promotion Committee should undertake, we have previously offered some opinions, believing that emphasis should be placed on implementation and that it should not merely be of a consultative nature, nor should it merely possess the nature of guidance and ordinary administration. However, the current explicit provision that it should "achieve the important task of promoting, supervising, and researching the development of export trade, and that it itself does not engage in any export trade, nor does it intend to monopolize or control export trade" suggests that its nature still focuses on consultation and guidance, which is obviously different from our expectations. The reason for this is that our focus is on procurement, while the government adopts subsidy or allowance measures. Therefore, there is no need for direct operation, let alone monopoly trade. In that case, this Export Promotion Committee will naturally become an Export Advisory Committee or a Guidance Committee.

Even so, in terms of promoting, supervising, and researching development, this committee is indeed not without benefit, and it is considered very important, for the following reasons:

(1) It has the effect of raising awareness. The prosperity or decline of export trade is by no means just a matter of the interests of exporters; it concerns the entire national economy. We have repeatedly pointed this out. Now there is a specialized agency trusted by the government that constantly researches, investigates, advises, and assists, in order to awaken the attention of the authorities. This effect is naturally more valuable than the committee's own function.

(2) It has the function of communicating opinions. According to the organization of the committee, in addition to the ex officio and appointed members, there are also well-known experts from China and abroad. In addition to setting up an executive committee, branch offices are also established in major commercial ports. Its function is naturally to gather wisdom from all sources and to collect information and opinions from various places. In that case, regarding A, the shortcomings of the current methods; B, recommendations for what should be done but has not been done; and C, the hidden pains and difficulties of industry and commerce in various places, it is hoped that they can be collected as much as possible and faithfully fulfill the responsibility of conveying them.

(3) It has the responsibility of practical improvement. Although the committee itself does not engage in any export trade, among the four prescribed tasks, there are clauses such as A, removing the difficulties encountered by export goods; B, encouraging agricultural production and processing manufacturing; C, improving methods to promote exports; and D, promoting overseas consumer markets. Therefore, in export trade, the committee will at least fulfill its responsibilities of indirect assistance and direct promotion. In other words, although the committee does not directly engage in exports, it indirectly promotes exports and facilitates exports. Therefore, calling it Export Promotion is not an empty name.

The problem is that the goal is too big, which clearly shows that the task is heavy and the road is long. To make this check fully cashed and truly achieve the purpose of promoting exports, it seems that ordinary general committees that sit and talk or do some calculations cannot solve the problem, nor can simply compiling some forms and putting together a lot of numbers be effective. Take its first task as an example: the original text is "to study and remove various difficulties encountered by various export goods in various parts of the country," how extensive is the content? And how serious are all the difficulties? The general problems currently prevalent, such as transportation, security, wages, interest rates, and taxes, can almost all be included. Simply studying it is not easy, and to further remove it, merely "concentrating the experience and strength of the industrial and commercial sectors" is probably not enough. Must we concentrate the experience and strength of the government and the private sector, or can we "then be successful"?

As for promoting exports, the currently implemented subsidy system is naturally a powerful tool. However, the key to whether local goods can be exported is whether the price of the goods can be locked in the foreign market. In other words, after giving subsidies, can the cost be reduced to a considerable extent? It must be known that not all those who engage in export goods are exporters; most are intermediaries, manufacturers, transporters, and hoarders. Their relationship with the foreign market is not very close, so when they encounter favorable news, they all raise prices one after another, taking the opportunity to push them up. In just these past two days, export goods have only seen increases and have not heard of decreases. The situation is already very obvious. Based on this speculation, how much effect this subsidy fee will have is a very questionable matter. What's more, local goods such as raw silk and eggs are said to be unable to be exported even after receiving subsidies because the cost is too high. Therefore, whether the point of determining a reasonable price and the government investing in purchases should be abandoned seems to be worth considering. We believe that complex situations must be resolved with complex methods. Although the current method of subsidizing foreign exchange for exports is a good way to make timely amends, is it still too simple to rely solely on this method? Is the uniform doubling of subsidies, regardless of grade, appropriate? Public opinion is also quite divided. Fortunately, there is also an Export Promotion Committee that can study and improve at any time, and its affiliated executive committee was established yesterday. We are willing to contribute this issue to the committee as research material.

### Major Corruption Case in Ningbo Customs Bureau: Illegally Collecting Security Deposits on Tax Payments; Zhejiang Supervisory Office Confirms Facts and Impeaches

[Report from our Hangzhou Office] The Zhejiang Supervisory Office recently discovered a major corruption case in the Ningbo branch of the Customs Bureau.

### Strange Incident in Wujiang County Government: District Chief Sentenced to Imprisonment Stillééæ³å¤; Seat Untouched, Even More Formidable

[Report from our Wujiang Office] Wu Hong, the Yanmu District Chief of this county, originally from Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, worked as a guerrilla during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, he advanced to Yanmu and obtained his current position. Wu, relying on his merits, was reckless and unscrupulous. Last year, he captured three suspected bandits, Li Fusheng, Zhu Dingbang, and Chen Awu, and three suspected collaborators, Gong Jinsheng, Wang Haiqing, and Mo Changsheng. After lengthy negotiations, he did not obtain any results. In a fit of anger, they were all tied up, shot, and then reported to the county for handling. The former County Chief Gu Duan believed that the District Chief disregarded the law and arbitrarily exercised the power of life and death, which was inappropriate, so he transferred Wu to the Jiangsu High Court for questioning. He was subsequently transferred to the Wujiang District Court for trial. He was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of incitement to murder. It has been three months and he has not been executed. There has been no impact on his position as District Chief. Recently, he has become even more intensified, colluding with township chiefs and imposing quotas for money and rice under various names, such as exemption fees for conscripts, fees for collecting conscripts, and fees for purchasing firearms. The people could not bear his abuse and jointly elected six representatives, including Zhuang Liangsheng, to petition the Party and government agencies in the county for relief. After Wu District Chief learned of this, he ordered the arrest of the representatives. Among them, Zhong Jinfu was arrested by him. Wu personally used a carrying pole to brutally beat him to vent his anger. Jinfu suffered serious injuries and was still imprisoned in the district office. Zhong's wife, Chen, has now wept and sued the Wujiang District Court, asking for justice.

### Haimen Diverts Refugees

[Report from our Haimen Office] Qinglong Port in this county is the transportation hub of Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Most of the refugees displaced by the disasters in northern Jiangsu pass through here to Shanghai. However, due to traffic obstacles, transportation is extremely difficult, causing the refugees to gather in increasing numbers. Common local ruffians take the opportunity to extort and deceive.

In ten days, it has transformed undesirable elements and trained unemployed youth, with remarkable results. The stranded refugees can also be expected to be diverted quickly.

### Jin Juefei, Who Used to Hold a Puppet Position, Transforms Himself and Becomes a Military Officer; Victims Present Evidence and File Charges

[Report from our Tacang Office] Jin Renzhi from Taicang, currently a staff officer in the First Pacification District Command, changed his name to Jin Juefei and is stationed in Kunshan. Jin Renzhi, also known as Jin Weizheng, served as the District Chief of the puppet Wuxian urban area and the Director of the puppet Wuxian County Party Headquarters during the enemy and puppet period. He also served as the Section Chief of the Transformation Section of the puppet Special Jiangsu Experimental District and the Deputy Director of the Taicang Puppet Special Station. He was a disciple of the great traitor Zhang Deqin. During his tenure in the puppet position, he was arrogant, abused innocent people, and framed underground workers and patriots. The people of Su, Kun, and Tai who suffered from his poison were countless. During the enemy and puppet period, he was once detained by the enemy police but was released by Zhang Deqin. After the victory, he hid in fear of punishment. Unexpectedly, the Jin traitor's skills were astonishing. Not long after [blank] residence, he changed his name to Jin Juefei and, with the appearance of an anti-Japanese warrior, took a position in the military organization and mixed into the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, winning a military position. Now, the victims have recognized [blank] mountain face, listed the facts at the time, provided conclusive evidence, and directly reported to the Jiangsu High Court and separately to the military organization for thorough investigation.

### Former Tannery Workers Want to Resume Work

We are a group of unemployed workers who worked at the Jiangnan Tannery operated by the enemy in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei before the war. When the war broke out, we held national concepts and voluntarily stopped working, abandoning our promotions, bonuses, and savings, and resolutely left the factory and ran to other places, living a subhuman life. Now our country has won the victory and the enemy has surrendered. The factory buildings have been taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the government, so we should have hope of resuming work. ââHowever, the state took back this factory and does not manufacture leather. It is said that it will be converted into a Sichuan oil press. Although we want to enter the factory to work, we cannot be called veterans. However, our only goal is to work, and our only target is this factory building. Whether it is a veteran or a new worker, as long as you are willing to use us, that is enough. But I don't know what method to use or where to apply. I would like to ask your newspaper to be fair and publish this in a corner to seek guidance from the social authorities. (Yang Shangyou, representative of more than 40 workers from the former Jiangnan Tannery)

### Kunshan Agricultural Products Do Not Benefit Farmers

Not long after the victory, the Kunshan Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank and the Kunshan County Bank were successively established in my hometown of Kunshan. As for the main business of the Farmers Bank, it is to support the countryside, so in the hearts of ordinary farmers, they believe that with such a rural relief organization, they are naturally overjoyed. However, judging from the current situation, how much can actually benefit? On the contrary, it has become a general hub for large merchants to lend, speculate, and exploit farmers. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Morning People's Bank, the interest rate published in the newspaper is 5%, but sometimes it reaches 9%. The interest rate of Kunshan County Bank is 7% in the newspaper, and sometimes the interest rate reaches 15%. With such high interest rates, it is still difficult for real farmers to be able to obtain a loan. In this situation, only merchants can store white rice and cloth in the warehouse to obtain speculative funds, but wouldn't it be a loss of the government's purpose of helping the countryside? I hope that the bank's executives will make some corrections so that the poor farmers can obtain real benefits. (Qian Bozhang)

### Identity Cards Delayed

We live in the Subei Refugee Refugee Village on Dapu Road. Last August, we applied to the Bao Chief's Office for national identity cards. We paid an application fee of 100 yuan and received an application form. When the form was filled out and submitted, we also paid a handling fee of 100 yuan. We asked them to issue receipts for the identity cards. They said that they would be issued together with the identity cards in two days. Unexpectedly, until today, there are neither types of documents. I don't know what is the reason for this situation? (A citizen) Editor's note: This newspaper previously received a letter from the Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that if there are any delays in applying for identity cards, you can send a letter to the department with your residential address and Bao Jia household number, and it will be verified and issued (see this column on January 26). Please contact them.

### Problem of Entrusting the Governance of Japanese-Controlled Islands: US States Policy Unchanged, But Decides to Postpone Submission to the Security Council

[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The US government does not change its suggestion to place the Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean under US strategic trusteeship. However, due to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom not agreeing to endorse this plan in advance, its submission to the Security Council will be postponed. The State Department stated that the agreement in the proposal was announced during last year's United Nations General Assembly and was originally intended to be submitted to the Security Council this month. However, Britain and the Soviet Union sent notes to the United States, advocating that the disposal of these islands should be postponed until after the Japanese peace treaty is agreed upon, causing the United States to decide to postpone the proposal temporarily.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It is heard that the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have advised the United States to temporarily shelve the trusteeship of the Pacific strategic islands, pending the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. While the United Kingdom and Australia have expressed acceptance in principle regarding the US intent for trusteeship, the Soviet Union will regard it as "US imperialism" and oppose it. Although the Soviet Union has not yet submitted a formal note on this matter, it has always opposed the expansion of US interests or responsibilities. So far, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia have only provided opinions to the State Department regarding the US request for trusteeship. The islands that the US requests to administer include the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands. The United States has clearly stated that it wants to maintain administrative rights over these islands but is willing to place them under the trusteeship of the United Nations organization.

### Regarding the Future Foreign Ministers' Meeting: The United States Will Adapt to Circumstances; The Soviet Foreign Minister Opposes Destroying Germany

Poland Inquires About the Attitudes of Britain and the United States Regarding the Western Border Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] According to well-informed sources here, the United States does not have a definite policy regarding the future Moscow meeting. It is widely believed that differing opinions need to be discussed in another meeting to reach an agreement. This is the reason for the lack of a definite policy. Generally, the United States will adapt to circumstances and not prepare in advance. The US diplomatic community hopes that this meeting will not discuss the same issues as the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, but will seek a practical solution to the German problem. The State Department supports granting Germany the greatest freedom to form its future government but does not believe that Allied control is necessary to prevent the revival of German militarism.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] A commentator on Moscow Radio recently quoted Foreign Minister Molotov as saying that any plan that aims to destroy or liquidate Germany, or to implement a federation or partition it, is opposed by the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Regarding the western border of Poland, it has recently come to light that the new Polish Ambassador to the United States, Winiewicz, will submit a note to the State Department on this matter, reiterating the Polish government's view. In short, the resolution passed at the Potsdam Conference has already been accepted by the powers, and there is no other way forward except to approve it. At the same time, Polish Special Envoy Professor Grabski will also submit a similar note to the British government. Poland, in view of the imminent opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, sent a special envoy to Britain to test the British government's opinion on this matter. However, according to well-informed sources here, the attitude of the United States has not changed, that is, it believes that the boundary line stipulated at the Potsdam Conference is temporary and should be re-discussed by the four foreign ministers in Moscow.

### US House of Representatives Passes Constitutional Amendment

Presidential Term Not to Exceed Two Terms

[United States Information Service, Washington, 6th] The US House of Representatives today voted by 285 to 121 to limit the US president's term of office to a maximum of two terms, each term being four years. This bill, in the form of an amendment to the US Constitution, has now been submitted to the Senate. The US Constitution only stipulates that the president is elected once every four years but does not specify the number of terms the president can serve. US custom has been that the president does not serve more than two terms, but President Roosevelt broke this tradition and was re-elected for a third and fourth term. According to the provisions of the Constitution, amending the Constitution can be done by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress, and then approved by a three-quarters majority of the US states. According to current calculations, three-quarters of the states is 36 states.

### Disarmament Committee Rules of Procedure: US and Soviet Union Fail to Reach Agreement

The United States insists that international control of atomic energy should proceed without waiting for the establishment of the Disarmament Committee. The Drafting Committee, composed of six countries, is scheduled to meet again at 2:00 PM today to make a final attempt to formulate a plan acceptable to both the United States and the Soviet Union.

### The United States Wants to Liquidate Lend-Lease Accounts: The Soviet Government Ignores It; The United States Also Has Not Received a Reply to the Request for the Return of Ships

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Lend-Lease Administrator Lane told the Senate Appropriations Committee today that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith has personally urged Molotov to schedule a consultation to resolve the $11.25 billion in lend-lease accounts owed by the Soviet Union to the United States, but without result. Prior to this, Ambassador Smith had sent several notes to the Soviet side, requesting immediate discussion of the liquidation of accounts, but it was also not fulfilled, he said.

I have never done anything to harm the American people. I am a member of the German Communist Party, a political refugee, and my only ambition is to return to my country."

Military regulations do not prohibit the purchase of goods, but Morley did not explain that these diamonds were purchased in Japan, only saying that he did not feel that he had done anything wrong.

### The United Kingdom is Considering New Plans to Solve the Palestine Problem: Foreign Secretary Bevin Meets with Jewish Association Leaders; Jewish Terrorists Vow to Fight to the Death

[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] Regarding the plan that the United Kingdom has drawn up to solve the Palestine problem, it has recently come to light from reliable sources that the British government will present this plan to Arab representatives and the Zionist movement in the near future, and its contents are expected to be announced tomorrow. According to information gathered by this agency's reporters from various sources, the main points of the plan are as follows: (1) Palestine will be divided into two regions, one Jewish region and one Arab region. (2) A central government will be organized in Jerusalem by the British, Arab, and Jewish parties. (3) Jerusalem will be divided into three districts, one belonging to the Jews, one belonging to the Arabs, and another smaller district belonging to the Christian minority. (4) 100,000 Jews will move into the Jewish region. (5) After the number of Jews moving into Palestine exceeds 100,000, they must first obtain the approval of the central government before they can continue to immigrate into the country. (6) The Arabs should provide full guarantees for the Jewish minority living in the Arab region. (7) The Jews should also provide the same guarantees for the Arab minority living in the Jewish region. (8) After the announcement of this plan, the number of Jews in the Arab region must not increase.

According to other sources, the central government stipulated in the British plan is only temporary in nature. The United Kingdom intends to establish an Arab-Jewish National Assembly in Palestine in the near future, especially to organize a new government in the future, but its powers must be limited. Palestine will eventually be handed over to the United Nations for trusteeship, and the trusteeship agreement will include the sixth, seventh, and eighth items mentioned above. In addition, the United Kingdom will also attempt to borrow loans from the United States for the Arab region, so that the Arabs can achieve a similar standard of living as the Jews.

### MacArthur Writes to Prime Minister Yoshida, Hoping that Japan Will Hold a General Election: There is No Need to Establish a Coalition Cabinet

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur Headquarters announced this afternoon a letter from MacArthur to Prime Minister Yoshida, stating: The time has come to implement a general election. Since the decision to hold a general election, a year has passed. Major changes have taken place in Japan's domestic institutions, economic conditions, and the lives of the Japanese people. The Japanese people should express their democratic will again in the near future to solve the fundamental problems facing Japanese society. The clear fact that a general election should be held should be judged by the Japanese government. However, in order for the new legislature to effectively implement the new constitution immediately, the general election should be implemented as soon as possible after the parliament is adjourned. The results achieved in the past year have been very good, and I am confident that this will continue in the future. It is reported that the current regular session of the parliament will resume on the 10th, with a session period of three months. In addition, after receiving the letter from MacArthur, the Japanese government immediately held a cabinet meeting and decided that Yoshida would explain when the parliament resumes and announce the policy direction, as well as state that once the parliament's mission is over, it will immediately dissolve the parliament to comply with MacArthur's wishes. Secretary-General Ono of the Liberal Party recently stated that there is no need to establish a coalition cabinet. The Liberal and Progressive parties should strengthen their cooperation so that the conservative front can achieve victory in the general election. Secretary-General Tanaka of the Progressive Party stated that when the general election is implemented, he will compete with the Socialist Party. The Progressive Party should cooperate with its friendly party, the Liberal Party, to strengthen the conservative camp. A former central committee member of the Nationalist Party stated that the result of the general election is that the turbid air of the current political situation can be expected to clear up. Secretary-General Norikawa of the Cooperative Democratic Party expressed his support for dissolving the parliament, and the new regime can be decided by public opinion.

### China National Aviation Corporation Submits Approval to Resume Flights: Three Routes to Fly First Today; Formal Order from the Ministry of Communications Should Arrive the Day After Tomorrow; Prosecutor Investigates the Truth of the Rumor That Gold Was Hidden in the Wings

[Report from this newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation previously had its flights suspended again by order of the Ministry of Communications due to the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing passenger plane in Tianmen, western Hubei. This has been almost ten days. The two companies have experienced a sharp decrease in income and significant losses since passenger transport was suspended. They have requested the authorities to allow them to resume flights first and then gradually adjust and improve. It has recently come to light that China National Aviation Corporation has first obtained approval and will resume three passenger aircraft routes starting today: (1) Shanghai-Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, (2) Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Kunming route, (3) Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Chongqing route.

### Presenting Eight Factors of the Fire; All Firefighters Send Letter to the Assembly Calling for Attention

[Report from our newspaper] All firefighters of the Xinzha District Fire Department in this city, after the fire case on Seymour Road, faced criticism from public opinion. This led to the dismissal of three to five corrupt elements, causing innocent parties to suffer. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Municipal Council, appealing for understanding, which stated in brief: The Wuding Road fire has become a topic of after-dinner conversation for citizens, and firefighters have been universally labeled as extortionists and robbers, causing the entire force to suffer unjust accusations, which is extremely unfair. Regarding this case, we are willing to accept the truth and expose illegal personnel.

As for the reasons for the spread of the Wuding Road fire, it was by no means due to extortion by firefighters. The factors can be summarized in the following eight items: (1) All kinds of firefighting equipment currently in the city are those used for decades since the era of the former Municipal Council. In this severe winter season, the weather is extremely cold, and the lack of water heaters in the living quarters of each fire squadron affects the freezing of fire trucks, delaying response time. (2) The gasoline for fire trucks and ambulances is in constant shortage. The entire fire brigade only receives 1,500 gallons of gasoline per month, which is distributed among the districts, and each district feels it is insufficient. Therefore, fire trucks often run out of gasoline, which is one of the reasons for delays. (3) In the era of the Municipal Council, each person had two pairs of leather boots, which have now been canceled. The only rubber boots have countless holes and cannot be waterproof. Furthermore, uniforms have not been changed until now, while the police have already been allocated Melton wool, which is incomprehensible. Every time they return from fighting a fire, the cold penetrates their bones. It is impossible to take a hot bath, and even changing uniforms is not possible, causing extreme suffering. (4) Firefighters' salaries are meager, while prices are soaring, making it difficult for individuals to feed themselves, let alone support their families, which affects their work morale. Most are disheartened and passive. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will provide guarantees that the government should bear the living expenses of the families of those who die in the line of duty. Only then will our colleagues be able to dedicate themselves to completing our great mission. (5) Many fire hydrants in various parts of the city are damaged or stolen, delaying firefighting time. It is hoped that citizens will assist in their maintenance. (6) There is an urgent need to add more water hoses. Most of the water hoses in each squadron are old and rotten. Every time a fire occurs, they burst, delaying rescue work. (7) In the era of the former Municipal Council, once a fire occurred, the fire department, police department, power company, and water company all sent personnel to the scene to assist. But now, traffic congestion and disorder greatly affect rescue work. (8) Currently, the windows and light bulbs inside and outside the rooms of each district team are mostly damaged. Repairs should be the responsibility of the authorities, but currently, all expenses are borne by us, which is truly unbearable exploitation. We sincerely hope that the representatives of the Council will uphold justice, etc.

### Reform the Atmosphere, Improve Treatment: The Mayor Expresses

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the fire case on Shaanxi South Road, a newspaper reported that Mayor Wu had said, "The government's thunder is loud, but the size of the raindrops depends entirely on the court." Mayor Wu solemnly stated to reporters yesterday that he did not make this statement. He only said that the criminal part of the case is being handled by the court, and the administrative part will be dealt with separately after the investigation committee completes its investigation. Regarding the atmosphere of the fire brigade, Mayor Wu said yesterday that it must be improved. The issue of treatment definitely needs to be improved, and the authorities should do their best to find a way. Firefighting equipment also needs to be improved within the possible scope. The authorities are currently planning closely.

### Two Policemen Wrongfully Accused: Released After Investigation

[Report from our newspaper] According to Police Chief Zhang's statement to reporters, police officers No. 1850 and No. 335, who were detained on suspicion in the fire case, were proven by Yang Junshan and Yin Bingquan, the owners of No. 3, Lane 660, to have acted bravely at the time and not to have taken advantage of the fire to rob. At the same time, the police department also found no evidence, so they were released on bail yesterday.

### Excavation of the Wang Family Fire Site: More Utensils Continue to Be Discovered

[Report from our newspaper] The excavation of the Wang family fire site continued yesterday. Zhang Da, Chief of the Inspection Division of the Police Department, Baozhang Cai Guoliang, and Wang Yunfu himself all personally went to the site to supervise. The excavation resulted in the discovery of one silver ingot, one Near-to-Love brand gold pocket watch, one silver pocket watch, one pair of silver vases, one silver-plated fruit plate, one silver crucifix, one table scale, one electric fan, one silver basin, one electric furnace, one cabinet door handle, one unlicensed electricity meter, five copper rings and six hinges from a box, seventeen keys, and three private drafts of Wang Chuiging. Unfortunately, they were all burned and unusable.

### Failing to Rescue and Taking the Opportunity to Solicit Bribes: The District Prosecutor's Office Is Actively Investigating

Regarding the Seymour Road fire case, the five-person investigation committee prepared a report based on the criminal-related materials obtained from the investigation and submitted it to the mayor. After approval and referral to the court for investigation, Chief Prosecutor Huang of the District Prosecutor's Office stated that firefighters' duty is to rescue people from fires. Failing to rescue and taking the opportunity to solicit bribes is a violation of the law. This office is currently actively investigating. If such illegal behavior is confirmed, a public prosecution will be filed according to law.

### Investigation Committee Continues to Visit Various Districts: Tools Mostly Damaged, Personnel Complain

[Report from our newspaper] Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, and others continued to visit fire stations in the Xinzha District, Huxi District, and Taishan District at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to inspect firefighting facilities. They carefully observed everything, including the fire alarm control room, fire trucks, pumps, belts, rescue vehicles, and gas masks. They found that many were damaged, especially the belts. For more than ten years, firefighting facilities have never been added, so there are very few intact ones. Most are full of holes and patched repeatedly. Moreover, the fire trucks currently in use are at least ten years old, and some have been used for twenty or thirty years, resulting in poor operation, which affects the response time.

Most of the firefighters in each district team complained incessantly and vented their grievances to reporters. Fire police officer No. 105 in the Xinzha District complained to reporters yesterday: "I am already seventy-one years old and have been working as a firefighter for thirty-five years. Today is the first day I have suffered this kind of hardship! If it weren't for the fact that Mayor Wu still owes me more than two thousand yuan (referring to the retirement payment from the Municipal Council) and a monthly salary of 150,000 yuan, I would have run away long ago."

### Shelter Achieves Excellent Results: Councilors Ask for Support

[Report from our newspaper] Municipal Council Social Affairs Committee members Liu Jingji, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yao Baozhen, Dong Rengui, and Tong Xiang and others inspected the social welfare agencies under the Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago. They concluded that the Caohejing Refugee and Orphan Shelter was well-managed and achieved excellent results. Yesterday afternoon, they invited Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing and Budget Committee member Li Wenjie and Finance Committee member Guo Linsuang to the 12th floor of Wing On Department Store to report on the inspection process and appeal for active support and assistance to the shelter. Director Zhou Wang of the shelter also attended the meeting to report on the shelter's situation. During the meeting, Councilor Zhang and others expressed their hope that government budgets for similar charitable relief efforts should not only not be reduced but should also be subsidized. Deputy Speaker Xu also said: "I am very pleased to learn today that the shelter has achieved such excellent results and should be given more attention. The Budget Committee should also consider assisting in this matter. In addition, nurseries and other such institutions should also be actively established to serve the community as much as possible." Finally, Councilor Li Wenjie put forward three points: (1) Budget increases and decreases should be based on the needs of the cause. (2) The government has a complete set of procedures for the payment of approved budgets. If Director Zhou needs funds urgently, he can find ways to raise them temporarily. (3) Relief efforts can be planned to transform the passive into the active. Then, it will not be difficult to gain social sympathy and support in the future.

More than 420 people attended, including Qian Naixin, representative of Mayor Wu, Director Fang, Speaker Pan, Director Zhao Banfu, Shui Xiangyun, and representatives from various labor unions. At the beginning of the rally, Chairman Shui Xiangyun reported the significance of the welcome and introduced the resumes of the two men. Amid applause, Liu rose to speak, expressing his gratitude and reporting on his attendance at the Labor Conference and his visits to factories and labor unions in various countries, saying that the Labor Conference was based on human rights and justice, seeking coordination between labor and capital to promote the balanced development of the world economy. Zhou Xuexiang then reported on his participation in the International Construction and Textile Workers' Conference after attending the Labor Conference, which discussed production and construction, labor-capital relations, and working conditions. After Zhou's report, Qian Naixin, Director Fang, Director Zhao, Speaker Pan, and others spoke in succession. Speaker Pan pointed out that the current high prices, high wages, and high interest rates are all interrelated, and the crux of the problem is inflation. The expansion of currency is due to the communist Party's trouble-making. Therefore, we must now use the power of the people to stop the trouble-making behavior to seek peaceful unification, and we must judge right from wrong in order to have true peace. Finally, the meeting passed a temporary suggestion to send a letter to Mayor Wu to retain Director Wu Kaixian and a letter to Director Wu urging him to dismiss his resignation.

### Shanghai Garrison Commander Fu Will Inspect Wusong and Baoshan Districts; No Deferment for Special Occupations

Fu Zhengmo, the first commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, has been actively preparing for conscription work in the city since arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing. However, since the Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Civil Affairs Department has just been established, some preparatory work has not yet been completed, so the date of conscription in the city is still undetermined. Commander Fu is scheduled to inspect the Baoshan and Songjiang Group Districts in mid-month and has drafted a spring inspection plan, which has been submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for investigation. Regarding the recent report in a newspaper that those in special occupations could be granted deferment, the Ministry of National Defense has been consulted on the scope of special occupations. It is understood that this is not the case. Yesterday, the person in charge of the ministry said that there is no provision in the Conscription Law for deferment for special occupations, but technical personnel in war-related national defense industries may be granted postponement.

### Land Administration Bureau Faces Difficulties in Layoffs; Manpower Already Insufficient; Layoffs Will Reduce Efficiency

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, some members of the Municipal Council and the outside world have expressed that the Land Administration Bureau can tighten its expenses and lay off some staff. A reporter visited the bureau to inquire about their views. According to them, the Land Administration Bureau is different from the Police Department, the Public Works Bureau, and others. They are engaged in regular work, such as maintaining public order or building roads. The main work of the Land Administration Bureau is land registration and land surveying. There are approximately 700,000 land registration maps and charts left over from the former concession and the puppet government, which urgently need to be sorted out. After the victory, land registration was carried out, and applications were made for the reissuance of land ownership certificates. Due to the complicated procedures and insufficient staff, only about 50,000 certificates were issued in the past year. There are currently more than 120,000 certificates awaiting issuance. Other regular work includes requests for land division and certificate replacement. Land surveying is like a census, which must be completed in a short period of time with concentrated efforts; otherwise, changes in the land will make it difficult to investigate. This matter is not easy to understand for those who are not in charge of the matter and have not experienced it firsthand. The Land Administration Bureau already feels that manpower is insufficient, and it is estimated that it will take another two years to complete the current work. Therefore, even if it wants to lay off staff, it should be considered after two years. If the Council passes a resolution that layoffs must be carried out now, it can only be considered for the administrative staff, but there is one principle, that is, it must not hinder work efficiency, and it is hoped that the business staff will be added. If both administrative and business staff are to be reduced, the estimated time to complete the work will be extended, and if there is less manpower, it will not be possible to concentrate on the work, and efficiency will be reduced.

Secretary Yang of the bureau also led reporters to visit the work situation in various departments, such as review and drawing. According to reports, many people have left due to low salaries.

### Rickshaws and Handcarts Must Have Lights at Night

### Tang Huaiqun Robbed; Losses of 20 Million

[Report from our newspaper] Tang Huaiqun, a famous lawyer, lives at No. 9, Lane 50, Yingshi Road. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, five robbers in uniform suddenly came to his house, brandishing pistols and threatening him, claiming to be brothers from a certain unit who could not make a living and asking for help. After speaking, they proceeded to rob him, taking away diamond rings, gold jewelry, clothes, etc., with a total value of more than 20 million yuan.

### There Is No Shortage of Gasoline; Why Panic?; Oil Companies Say

[Report from our newspaper] The phenomenon of gasoline panic has not improved in recent days. Although gasoline stations have been limiting each vehicle to only three gallons per fill-up since yesterday, supply is still falling short of demand. Long lines of cars waiting for gasoline can be seen everywhere. According to the opinion of a person in charge of an oil company, the main reason for this phenomenon is unnecessary mass panic. The reasons for the panic are nothing more than the following: (1) Suspecting that there is insufficient gasoline in the city and that imports will be difficult in the future. (2) Half a month ago, due to delays in exchange settlement procedures, Customs did not unseal the gasoline, and the source of gasoline was cut off for a while. Car owners were deeply afraid that the same situation would occur again in the future. (3) Rumors that the exchange rate will soon change and that gasoline prices will be increased. (4) Some people are taking the opportunity to hoard large quantities of gasoline, storing it in their homes, or selling it on the black market. Based on this mentality, the demand for gasoline has increased sharply. With the current number of motor vehicles in the city reaching more than 20,000 (according to the recent estimates of the Public Utilities Bureau), which is twice that of the pre-war period, each gasoline station has seen congestion and sell-outs in a "stampede" situation.

Import Quota of US$2.5 Million Every Three Months

In fact, according to the person in charge, there is no shortage of gasoline in the city. The current gasoline import quota is US$2.5 million every three months, which is enough to meet normal needs. There is no need to adopt restrictions such as quota allocation. Even if the price increases due to exchange rate adjustments, the amount that users can hoard is limited. It is not worth risking fire for a small amount. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not worry unnecessarily.

### Three Companies Discuss and Formulate Improvement Measures

[Another Report] The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the recent abnormal supply and demand of gasoline and the phenomenon of cars lining up on the roadside, which not only hinders traffic but also allows some people to take the opportunity to purchase large quantities of gasoline and store it in their homes, which is prone to fire, convened representatives from Asia Petroleum, Texaco, and Mobil on February 5 to discuss the matter and formulate three improvement measures in order to avoid creating a black market and protect public safety: (1) If the oil companies have a large amount of gasoline in storage but insufficient oil transportation equipment, they should give priority to transporting the gasoline required by gasoline stations so that they can supply a large amount. (2) The license plate number and gasoline volume of vehicles fueling at gasoline stations should be recorded in detail by the three companies. If it is discovered that there are vehicles attempting to store gasoline by making abnormal purchases, and the investigation confirms that this is the case, the stations will be notified to stop supplying gasoline to those vehicles in the future. (3) All gasoline at gasoline stations should be sold as soon as it arrives and sold out. If managers refuse to supply gasoline and attempt to store it for sale on the black market, citizens can report it to the Public Utilities Bureau in confidence, and it will be dealt with severely in accordance with the regulations after investigation.

### Fang Jiuhe Swindled Out of a Large Golden Fish

[Report from our newspaper] At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, a middle-aged man wearing an overcoat and about 30 years old, carrying a travel bag, went to Fang Jiuhe Silver Store at No. 519 Jinling East Road with a boy, saying that he wanted to buy a large gold bar. Wang Zhongdao, a shop assistant, took out a gold bar weighing 10 taels and 1 qian and 8 fen (Da Feng Heng brand). The man said that he needed to take it to another store to weigh it and left with the gold bar. The store thought that he had a child with him and that there was money in the travel bag, so they did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, he did not return for a long time, and they began to suspect something. They opened the travel bag to check and found that it was full of blank paper and not banknotes. They realized that they had been cheated and immediately reported it to the Songshan Branch Bureau, which ordered police officer Yang Jinhong to take the boy and the travel bag to the police station. According to the boy, Ji Jizhao, 13 years old, lives at No. 62 Zhengjia Muqiao Street. When he was playing near Dongxinqiao, the man asked him for the address of Fang Jiuhe Silver Store and ordered him to lead the way. He was deceived for a moment and did not dare to collude with the swindler. He was instructed to be taken home by his parents, and a wanted notice was issued to apprehend the swindler and bring him to justice.

### Impersonating a Guild, a Swindler Defrauds Businesses: Multiple Importers and Exporters Deceived

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association, located at 12 Creek Road, has over a thousand members. On the 3rd, they all received a letter from the association stating that the executive committee had approved a fee of 50,000 yuan per member. It claimed that several companies, including Jit Sang Tai & Co., Chung Mou Trading Co., Ta Wei & Co., Lixin Hua & Co., Xiang Li & Co., Shanghai Import and Export Co., Yong Chang Industrial Raw Materials Co., Heng Tai Hua & Co., Jing An Enterprise Co., Pacific Industrial and Commercial Federation, British Tyler & Co., Yi Li Enterprise Co., and San Wei & Co., had already paid. British Tyler & Co. reportedly gave a check for 100,000 yuan at the time. Other companies called the association to inquire about the matter. The association denied having made such a decision and secretly reported it to the Pudong Branch Bureau for investigation. Director Zhang of the Branch Bureau ordered Chief of the Criminal Division Li Yinmin to supervise officers Wang Zhicheng, Police Chief Fu Yunfeng, Wang Shenquan, and others to investigate. After four days, they solved the case yesterday at noon and arrested the suspect for prosecution. The check paid by British Tyler & Co., numbered 686368, was issued by Chung Mou Bank to Xie Xin Hua & Co. The investigation revealed that the check had been received by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the number 1732 was written on the back. Further investigation revealed that the account holder was named Cao Zhizhan, living at 190 Beijing Road, Room 44. They went to the address, but it was an empty room. They returned to the Savings Bureau to investigate the introducer for the account opening and found out it was a Mr. Yu Rong, living at 83 An Yi Road. However, inquiries at that address found no such person. They returned to the association to discuss the matter for a long time and discovered that the letter and seal were both forged, but the letterhead and envelope were genuine and belonged to the association. This stationery had been given to Cao Zhizhan of the Economic Express News Agency at 35 Mauger Road (Cao had worked there as a salesman two months prior) for use when introducing clients. Police officers disguised themselves and waited at the agency. Yesterday at 11:40 a.m., they arrested Cao at the agency. Cao initially denied everything. During interrogation at the bureau, he confessed that he lived at 4 Zhujia Ku, Da Xi Road. The police then escorted him to his residence and found forged seals and other evidence. Cao could no longer deny the charges and admitted to defrauding over one million yuan in legal tender, which he used to make clothes and exchange for gold rings. The branch bureau plans to prosecute Cao for forging seals and defrauding for financial gain.

### Impersonating Military Police, Repeatedly Defrauding Hardware Merchants: Culprit Arrested with Evidence and Confessed

[Report from our Newspaper] The White Rock Road Military Police yesterday arrested Sun Guozhang, also known as Sun Rong, who impersonated a member of the team to attempt to steal and sell military cables. After interrogation by Captain Deng of the team, he confessed. The team, based on a tip, intercepted five rolls of military cable of unknown origin at 17 Jinghe Wind, Shilu, Sanma Road, on September 17 last year, valued at over 10 million yuan. Because the main suspect was at large, the materials were impounded and reported to superiors for instructions. Before receiving instructions, troops were assigned to guard them. Recently, Sun Guozhang impersonated a squad leader from the White Rock Road Military Police, privately carved the seals of the Battalion Headquarters of the 23rd Regiment, 1st Battalion, and the signature seal of Battalion Commander Xiong Fei. He forged documents and went to Heng Lv Hardware and Steel Store at 27 Wusong Road at the end of last month, claiming to have five rolls of military cable for sale and asking the store to send someone to inspect the samples. Upon reaching the entrance of Jinghe Lane, he asked them to wait and absconded with 500,000 yuan in silver that he had brought. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, he used the same method to defraud 100,000 yuan in deposit from a hardware merchant broker at 9 Rongchang Lane, Yuhong Road, Hongkou. Yesterday morning, Sun committed fraud again by approaching Zhenfeng Hardware Weaving Shop at 182 Puan Road and swindling 1 million yuan in deposit, but he was discovered by the White Rock Road Military Police, who sent officers to arrest him. The forged documents and seals were seized on the spot. After interrogation and confirmation by the victims, it was decided to transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office today for investigation.

### "Theft of the National Treasury" Outdoor Scenes to be Shot on the Bund and Elsewhere

[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Xiaoting, who is filming outdoor scenes for Columbia Pictures' "Theft of the National Treasury" here, told reporters that the main outdoor scenes will be shot on the Bund, Nanjing Road, Nanshi, and Longhua Airport. Scenic spots in the city, such as Longhua Pagoda, the City God Temple, and the Baoan Situ Temple, will also be filmed one by one. Wang said that if the weather is clear, outdoor shooting will begin next Monday. However, the film is set in 1935, and the street scenes are very different from today. There were no jeeps speeding down the streets, nor tricycles blocking traffic, so filming outdoor scenes will be difficult. It is reported that Mayor Wu and the Police Bureau have agreed to assist with the filming of outdoor scenes.

Director Nat Natcho said that he will be working here for about one to two months. After finishing, he will go to Cairo and Havana to continue filming outdoor scenes. He has found two male and three female doubles here, one of whom is Chinese. All costumes were brought from Hollywood. The two men may be recruited from the American military personnel here.

"Theft of the National Treasury" is a detective film starring Dick Powell, set in Washington, San Francisco, Shanghai, Cairo, and Havana (the capital of Cuba). It is based on the theme of international cooperation in drug prohibition and is based on the files of the U.S. Treasury Department's Narcotics Bureau.

Filming began in Hollywood on December 8 last year and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. It is expected to be released in the second half of this year.

### Are All Traitors' Families Long-Lived? Living Expenses Should Have Flexibility: Seven Cases Decided by the Illegal Property Disposal Committee Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office of the China Trust Bureau, in view of the "Precautions for Implementing the Confiscation of Traitor Property" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, has found some regulations to be difficult to implement, and has submitted a document requesting amendments.

One of these regulations stipulates that adult family members of traitors who are incapable of earning a living should have their entire life expectancy estimated at 70 years, and be given the necessary living expenses for the future period. The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office believes that estimating the entire life expectancy at 70 years seems too long. Moreover, traitors are sentenced to varying lengths of imprisonment. If the life expectancy of their families is uniformly estimated at 70 years, it may not correspond to the actual situation. Therefore, it is requested that the implementing agency should have some flexibility in the standards when making discretionary decisions.

[Another Dispatch] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office convened its 22nd Committee on the Disposal of Illegal Property at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and decided on the following cases: (1) Xu Liangcai reported that the illegal property houses on Zhongzheng Road and other locations were forcibly purchased by Zhou Fohai, a traitor. He now requests permission to pay the price and have them returned. Decision: The evidence is insufficient, and the request should be rejected. (2) Regarding Chu Chen Zhen's request for the return of houses, property, and daily necessities that do not belong to the Chu Minyi treason, the decision is to transfer the case to the Jiangsu Higher Court for review. (3) Yang Qian, a former prisoner, is suspected of being a traitor. His property was confiscated after an initial investigation. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him. The question is whether his property should be unsealed and returned. Decision: The matter will be discussed after the judgment becomes final. (4) Rao Jinrong, son of the traitor Rao Shu, requested the return of confiscated scattered clothing. Should we return it and submit a list for review? Decision: The matter should be discussed after the judgment becomes final. (5) Regarding the estate of Mei Siping, a traitor, in Yongjia, his stepmother Mei Wang requested confirmation that it was jointly owned, but she could not produce any documents. The question is how to handle this. Decision: Notify her to submit documents within a time limit. If the deadline is exceeded, the property will be confiscated. (6) Changzhou Tongcheng Cotton Spinning and Weaving Factory has traitorous shares owned by Yan Qingxiang, Jiang Shang, Zhang Yunbo, and other traitors. How should this be handled? Decision: First, all traitorous shares should be confiscated. Second, a letter should be sent to the Higher Prosecutor's Office to request the declaration of confiscation of Zhang Yunbo's traitorous shares. (7) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education requested priority allocation of the house of Li Bingru, a traitor, in Baijiao Lane, Hangzhou. Decision: It should be sold through public bidding.

### Qian Zongfan, Tough as Iron: Denies Being Wang Jingwei's Guard Captain: "If It Were True, I Could Be Shot."

[Report from our Newspaper] Qian Zongfan (also known as Qian Zhongfa), nicknamed "King of Lotteries," was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The defendant was introduced by Wu Shibao and served as an inspector for the Enemy's West Shanghai Military Police at Kaimara Road, and also served as a puppet secret agent in No. 76. He opened the Rongsheng Gambling House, later renamed the Six Nations Hotel, and served as its manager. He also served as the deputy captain of Wang Jingwei's Shanghai residence guard. After the victory, he was reported by Jin Yushun, but the prosecution was dropped due to insufficient evidence. Subsequently, the Shanghai Garrison Command received a telegram from the Military Affairs Office of the National Government, transferred from the Military Intelligence Bureau, ordering the arrest of Qian Zongfan and transfer to the High Court for prosecution. The defendant, with a bald head, ruddy complexion, and obese figure, wearing a blue cloth robe, claimed to have opened the Shangtian Funeral Home and never opened the Rongsheng Gambling House or the Six Nations Hotel. He did not know Li Shiqun, Wu Shibao, Wang Maoting, etc. If he had served as Wang Jingwei's deputy guard captain for even one day, he could be shot. A few days before his arrest, he received three strange phone calls, the general meaning of which was to threaten him. He usually recited Buddhist scriptures and meditated and had never done anything bad. He was truly wronged. The defense attorney, Fei Xizhen, requested the court to summon Zhu Chizi, the puppet Major General Adjutant of Wang Jingwei, who was in custody, as well as Xia Zhongming and Wu Yu Aizhen, to testify. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Puppet Consul and Opium Dealer: Both to be Sentenced on the 14th

[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Xixi, a Chinese expatriate from Nagasaki, Japan, grew up in Japan and studied business with his father. In January 1942, he joined the puppet consulate in Nagasaki as a clerk. In 1944, he was transferred to the puppet Korean consulate as acting director. Jiang, short in stature and pale in complexion, testified in the High Court this morning that he had graduated from a Japanese elementary school with little knowledge. In the puppet consulate, he only performed tasks such as copying and purchasing, with a monthly salary of 40 yen. The court decided that the verdict in this case would be announced on the morning of the 14th.

[Another Dispatch] Lin Jinyong, suspected of being a traitor, was accused of opening the Xieji Opium Shop and serving as the head of the puppet Yangzhou Anti-Smoking Bureau. The trial in the High Court concluded yesterday and will also be sentenced on the morning of the 14th.

### Sun Shaokang's Traitor Case: Xia Zhongming Questioned

[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Sun Shaokang, the former president of the puppet Shanghai District Court, was tried on January 10. The defendant vehemently denied participating in the research association of colleagues from the puppet No. 76 Court. The High Court yesterday summoned Xia Zhongming, the director of the puppet No. 76, who was in custody, for questioning. Xia's complexion was quite plump, and he was wearing a dark blue cloth robe. He testified that Sun Shaokang did not participate in the research association of colleagues from the puppet court. His previous testimony in a certain bureau was obtained through coercion and could not be relied upon. Moreover, the research association of colleagues from the puppet court was canceled shortly after being opposed by Chen Gongbo by order, so it did not do any practical work. After giving testimony, he was ordered to be returned to custody.

### Puppet Consul and Puppet Township Head: Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison

[Report from our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday sentenced two traitor cases: Jiang Daquan, the puppet consul-in-training at the puppet Korean Busan Consulate, and Qiu Shaoting, the puppet township head of the First Township in the puppet Zhabei District of Shanghai, were each sentenced to two years and six months in prison, deprived of public rights for two years, and their property was confiscated, with the exception of what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families.

### Two Henchmen of Gojima Shigeru: Deny Working for the Enemy

[Report from our Newspaper] Xie Wanfang and Yu Cheng were tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being traitors. Xie Wanfang was originally the Deputy Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. After the enemy invaded the concession, he continued to work. In February 1942, he became the Deputy Inspector of the Second Section of the Special High Department of the Puppet Police Department. In June of the same year, he was transferred to the Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Section of the Puppet Hongkou Branch Bureau. Yu Cheng was originally an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. In February 1942, he became the Deputy Inspector of the Second Section of the Special High Department of the Puppet Police Department. Because the section was unique in nature, the office was located at 84 Tongfu Road, and it was responsible for arresting our political workers. It was a secret organization, headed by Gojima Shigeru, the Japanese Criminal Section Chief. The defendants were accused of working exclusively to assassinate and arrest our workers. After the victory, they were arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for prosecution. When questioned, the defendants claimed that they only worked in the puppet police department for a few months after the enemy entered the concession and then quit. They denied any knowledge of arresting our workers. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### Shop Not Yet Opened, Confined First: Discharged Soldier Beaten and Humiliated: Accuses Police Officers of Assault and Petitions the Senate for Relief

[Report from our Newspaper] Sang Jinrong, a citizen of Longhua District in this city, requested assistance from the Municipal Senate due to extortion and infringement by Qi Jinliang and other officers of the first section of the police branch bureau in that district in preparation for opening a pawn shop. He requested the Senate to send letters to the competent authorities and the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to uphold justice and severely punish them according to law. Sang Jinrong's report stated: "I am a discharged soldier and have received a retirement pension thanks to the country's grace. In order to make a living, I intend to open a pawn shop in Longhua Town with friends. While I was preparing, Qi Jinliang, an officer of the first section of the Longhua Police Branch Bureau, came to my place on the 27th of last month to investigate fire prevention and sanitation equipment and demand protection money, making unreasonable demands and demanding 500,000 yuan. Because I had no cash, I only offered a check, but he refused to accept it, saying that it must be paid in cash, and we could not agree. On that day, a plainclothes policeman surnamed Wang, along with four or five unknown plainclothes policemen, forcibly pawned items with handcuffs before the pawn shop was opened. I refused. Then, on the 29th of last month, many local volunteer police officers, including Tang Yugen and Tang Yusheng, swarmed in and forcibly pawned bricks, tiles, broken clothes, shoes, etc. After I politely refused, they dragged me out of the house, punching and kicking me, injuring vital parts. They took me to the police station. At this time, Qi Jinliang took advantage of his position and scolded me loudly, without asking the reason, and allowed the volunteer police to leave. He then arbitrarily deprived me of my freedom until the next morning. While I was in custody, I requested five medical examinations, but they were all rejected. Later, I was fined 2,500 yuan by Guo Zhikai, an officer of the judicial section of the bureau, saying it was because I was operating without a license. My pawn shop was still in the preparatory stage, and the signboard was not hung, nor was it opened for business. There were no pawn tickets or documents, but I was still punished. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to request a medical examination and filing a complaint, I am submitting this report to request justice."

### Transportation Companies Appeal for Fairness in Rushing to Transport Rice from the Station

[Report from our Newspaper] The Ganquan Trade Transportation Company and the Xiexing Gongji Transportation Company had a dispute over rushing to transport goods at the North Station. The North Station has suspended freight transportation since the previous day. Xu Dajun, manager of Ganquan Trade Transportation Company, hosted reporters at Da Sanyuan yesterday afternoon to report on the dispute. He said that Ganquan Company has been transporting goods at the North Station for over 20 years and has a good reputation. It has over 50 workers and transports over 700 items per day for customers. However, Xiexing Gongji Transportation Company has no waybill and has been rushing to transport goods in the past two months. After Ganquan Company takes the customer's goods from the station, Xiexing and its workers would rush to grab them. On the 6th of last month, the two sides had a conflict. The police station intervened and fired shots to quell the situation, but disputes continued to occur at any time after that. At 3:00 p.m. on the 5th, Xiexing was still rushing to transport goods, and the workers on both sides had another major conflict. Wang Baobao and Du Desheng, two workers from Ganquan, were detained by the 8th Precinct of the Railway Bureau Police Department and have not been released yet. The Railway Bureau stipulates that those without a waybill are not allowed to transport goods. Now, Xiexing is repeatedly rushing to transport goods, which greatly hinders legitimate business. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities and impartial individuals to come forward and uphold justice.

### Zhi Jiang Steamer Case: Two Captains May Be Released on Bail

The two captains in the Zhi Jiang steamer case were detained because the District Prosecutor's Office considered it a case of manslaughter, violating criminal law. The Seamen's Union requested the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau to ask the court to allow them to be released on bail, but the court refused because the investigation was not yet complete. It is now learned that the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau has received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications, requesting the court to release the two captains. In addition to submitting the determination of responsibility for the collision to the Ministry of Communications for inspection yesterday, the Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, Li Gufan, also submitted a copy to the court for reference. Director Li is also consulting with relevant parties on the issue of bail for the two captains, and they are expected to be released soon.

### Professor of Chi-Chee College Accused of Being a Traitor: He Shizhen Provides Favorable Testimony

[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Bingkang, a former French professor at Chi-Chee College, was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. Zhang graduated from Chi-Chee College at an early age and then studied in France. He returned to China in the winter of 1937 and married Xiong Shaoqi, a graduate of Fudan University, in May 1938. He taught at his alma mater, Chi-Chee College, and also served as He Shizhen's private secretary. After the victory, someone reported that Zhang "returned to China with his French wife in 1940 when France was defeated by Germany, approached Li Shiqun, a traitor, organized the Qingxiang Committee in Jiangsu, killed underground workers, the chief of the training department of the Loyal National Salvation Army, Han Jin, and members of the commando team Tang Chuanren, Wang Bin, and Fan Jiahe, and also participated in the work of the traitor Mo Cun's special agent headquarters." Liu, the presiding judge, opened the trial yesterday, and He Shizhen appeared in court to testify, stating that Zhang never left Shanghai during the occupation and had always served as his private secretary. Because Zhang was upright and feared that he had offended someone, he was falsely accused. Zhang's wife, Xiong Shaoqi, was then questioned, and Xiong sobbed and complained of injustice, and presented her early marriage certificate, photographs, and Chi-Chee College appointment letter. The lawyers Shan Yuhua and Ge Bangzhen then defended her. The court ordered that the trial of this case be concluded and the verdict announced on the morning of the 14th.

### Social Services, Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

Buying and Selling Marriage

Mr. Dong Shichang asks: When my relative was sixteen years old, his mother arranged for a child bride. The girl's brother and a neighbor acted as matchmakers. After she entered the family, we discovered that she was temperamental and of low character. It seems impossible to live together in old age. I gently advised him, but unexpectedly, she became angry and left, never to return. Later, the man asked a third party to request the dissolution of the marriage from the girl's mother, but it was not accepted. I ask: (1) The husband is now an adult, but the other party is still a minor. How should he proceed to dissolve the marriage contract? (2) The engagement of a child bride is decided by the parents of both parties, but without the consent of the individuals involved. Is it legally valid? (3) If the woman does not agree to dissolve the marriage contract, what should the man do? (4) Can the man claim compensation from the woman for all the expenses incurred during the engagement? (5) Can the woman accuse the man of any crime?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) (2) A marriage contract not entered into by the parties themselves is legally invalid. (3) A unilateral procedure to dissolve the marriage contract is of course invalid. (4) (5) No.

Overstepping One's Bounds

Mr. Zhang Jun asks: When Miss A was three years old, her parents arranged for her to be betrothed to Mr. B through a matchmaker and accepted a deposit of ten yuan. However, no engagement ceremony was held. Now the woman is nineteen years old and very dissatisfied with this marriage contract, but she does not understand the legal regulations and dares not act rashly. Your newspaper has always been enthusiastic in serving the public and resolving doubts. Please answer the following questions: (1) Is this marriage contract valid? (2) Can Miss A publish a statement in the newspaper denying the marriage contract? (3) What will happen if the other party responds? (4) Does Miss A have to compensate for any losses? (5) Does the ten-yuan deposit have any bearing on this marriage contract? (6) What are the steps to resolve this marriage contract? (7) If the woman does not dissolve this marriage contract, can she become engaged and married to another man?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) This marriage contract is invalid. (2) (3) There is no need to publish a denial in the newspaper because the marriage contract is legally invalid from the beginning. (4) She is not liable for any compensation. (5) This deposit is not related to the marriage contract. (6) No procedures are required. (7) It does not constitute bigamy.

### Inquiry About Fresh Mushroom Farm

I am interested in developing scientific mushroom cultivation. Although I have theoretical knowledge from books, I lack practical experience. Recently, I saw fresh mushrooms for sale in the market, so there must be such a farm near Shanghai. I would like to visit it, but I do not know its address or name. If you could provide an answer, I would be infinitely grateful. Respectfully wishing you well, Ye Chunyang.

### Rumors of Loose Monetary Policy Abound, Gold Price Breaks Through Five Million, US Dollar Soars 1,200 Yuan

Yesterday, the rise in gold prices became unstoppable. With monetary policy reportedly loosening and few sellers, new buyers advanced easily and fearlessly, creating new highs. However, after reaching high prices, many sold off, leading to a volatile market. The morning opened at 4.82 million to 4.84 million, and immediately rose. Initially, the rise was relatively steady, but after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 460 bars at a price of 4.95 million, immediately pushing the price to break through the 5 million mark. Many short positions were automatically closed, briefly lowering the price to 4.91 million. However, the downward correction did not change the overall trend. The 5 million mark was eventually broken through, attracting new buyers and accelerating the upward momentum, reaching a high of 5.22 million. Some still took profits, causing a slight drop back to below 5.1 million around noon, but the price still stood at around 5.15 million at lunchtime. In the afternoon, trading continued and fell back to 5.07 million. Next-day transactions still showed bullishness. Rumors abounded in the market, pushing the price to a new high of 5.33 million, before a pullback. However, even after the market closed, there were still high bids, resulting in a net increase of 440,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Ornaments were listed at 550,000 yuan. Silver dollars continued to strengthen. The underground interest rates remained loose, with interest rates only around 1.5 jiao. Foreign currencies followed the gold market, with the US dollar opening at 9,200 to 9,400 in the morning, fluctuating upwards, and finally breaking through the 10,000 yuan mark at lunchtime. In the afternoon, the trend continued to be bullish, reaching a new high price and closing near 10,500 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 1,200 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were particularly bullish, repeatedly jumping from 1,800 yuan to over 2,000 yuan, also increasing by 200 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,900 to 1,920 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 2,320 to 2,340 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 30,500 yuan. There were more transactions in Hong Kong exchange rates, with few supplies for the rest.

### Export Promotion Executive Committee Resolves to Establish Seventeen Subgroups, Chairpersons of Each Group Already Appointed

Chairman Bei Zuyi, Committee Members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, Lin Fengbao, Shen Xirui, etc., all attended. The secretariat of the committee also announced its establishment on the third floor of the Bank of China building on the same day.

The Executive Committee will establish seventeen trade subcommittees, including: (1) Silk and silk fabrics, (2) Cotton fabrics, knitwear, and cotton, (3) Embroidered goods, lace, hairnets, (4) Tung oil, (5) Tea, (6) Eggs and egg products, (7) Sheep wool, goat wool, and felt carpets, (8) Goat skins and cow hides, (9) Furs, (10) Plant products, ramie, peanuts, and peanut oil, (11) Animal products, (12) Straw braid, (13) Medicinal materials and camphor, (14) Pig bristles, (15) Minerals, (16) Soybeans, (17) Sundries. The various committees and consultants will preside over them separately. A financial subcommittee will also be established, chaired by Committee Member Lin Fengbao. A transportation subcommittee, chaired by Committee Member Jin Shixuan, will be convened separately within the month to discuss and actively promote exports.

Furthermore, according to our reporter's investigation: In addition to the financial and transportation subcommittees, the other seventeen trade subcommittees will be chaired by: Lin Fengbao for the first and fifth groups. Yang Xiren for the second, seventh, and thirteenth groups. Zhang Silu for the third group. Central Bank consultant Mike for the fourth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and sixteenth groups. Shen Xirui for the twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth groups.

### Public Bonds Rise

Public bonds also rose yesterday. The unified bonds opened at 2,050 yuan in the morning. Bids were made for the 550, 360 series, pushing the price up to 2,350 yuan. Before closing, the price fluctuated between 2,250 yuan and 2,300 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 200 yuan for classes A and B, 250 yuan for E, and 300 yuan for classes C and D. The transaction volume was approximately 2 million yuan.

### White Paper to be Listed as a "Production Enterprise" and Approved for Unrestricted Import

Recently, the price of white paper in this city has been surprisingly high amid rumors of foreign exchange adjustments. It is said that the relevant authorities will approve white paper imports to be listed under the "production enterprise" category and allow unrestricted import to meet the needs of the national cultural industry. The market price of white paper may stabilize in the future.

### Silk Goods All Improve, Artificial Silk Especially Rises Sharply

Yesterday, as gold and banknotes rose in the market, silk goods generally improved, especially artificial silk, which rose most sharply. After 120 gold three-horse Yukwang changed hands at 4.58 million yuan per 61 boxes in the morning, it rose gradually and continuously, reaching 5 million yuan at the close at noon. In the afternoon, it was bid up another 200,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of slightly less than 700,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, because the bidding price soared in the market yesterday, buyers hesitated, and transactions were very scarce. The price of 75 semi-gloss was bid at 7 million yuan, which can be described as "rare things are expensive." The reason for the continuous rise in recent days is simply because silk factories have started work. Some of the raw materials were mortgaged with production loans last winter and cannot be used, and the procedures for the materials issued by the silk joint venture have not been completed. This has forced some manufacturers to search for goods on the black market, and holders have seized on this weakness, taking advantage of the rising gold and banknotes to opportunistically push up prices. However, once the materials are processed and the allocation is sold as usual, there will be a possibility of price declines. Yesterday, the factory bid prices also increased in the morning, but there were few transactions. In the afternoon, as the price of gold rose again, there was a slight demand. D-grade goods were priced at 5.9 million yuan, a sharp increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ordinary goods and dry silk were bid up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Affected by the high prices of raw materials, factory prices for all types of silk goods increased due to cost reasons. Yesterday, the transaction price of Mayar bedcovers in the morning was 3.55 million yuan, and in the afternoon, the outside market bid up 150,000 yuan for sale. Large Chen Gezi fabrics were in high demand, and local silk stores competed to purchase them. The price in the morning was 14,500 yuan, and in the afternoon, the outside market bid 5,000 yuan. Juxi crepe was priced at 4,000 yuan in the morning and bid at 4,200 yuan in the afternoon.

### Yarn Market Rises Again

Yesterday, the yarn market rose again. Cantonese merchants were very active, and heavy double-horse yarns set a new high price of 4.25 million yuan. Ordinary 20-count cotton yarn also followed, rising by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. 32-count and 42-count twisted fine yarns rose wildly by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan due to factory purchases. The closing trend was still bullish, and market sentiment was firm.

### Cloth Prices Soar

Yesterday in the cotton cloth market, fine cloth was rarely traded in the market because of the flat price, but the market atmosphere outside the market was quite lively. Yanghe fine cloth rose by 8,500 yuan per bolt. Prices of other fabrics such as AAA Caiqiu Wufu and Longtou cloth also rose by 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan. Dark blue Shilin cloth was affected by the fine cloth market, and factory prices increased. Traders rushed to buy it. Anan blue cloth rose sharply by 40,000 to 70,000 yuan per bolt. Poplin rose again by 5,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton market was firm. Guoguang Yarn Factory purchased 100 bales of Bailuoqu cotton flowers, and the price delivered to the factory was 495,000 yuan. There were not many transactions between traders, and market sentiment was bullish.

### Mayor Wu Emphatically States: Siamese Rice Supplies Unlimited, Negotiated Prices Not Allowed to Change

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu stated to reporters yesterday afternoon regarding the rice issue: The government's massive sale of Siamese rice and strict crackdown on merchants who violate negotiated prices could have resolved the rice market price surge within this week, but the impact of rising gold prices has caused some setbacks. In any case, it is hoped that prices can be suppressed next week. Recently, one or two hundred rice boats have arrived on the Suzhou Creek, and they seem to be observing the situation to see if the government will adjust negotiated prices. I have also recently received letters from citizens stating that "cheap grain harms farmers," indicating that the government's suppression of rice prices has caused significant losses to farmers. What I want to clarify now is that the government allows rice prices to follow other commodity prices, but not to exceed other commodity prices. According to the current black market calculations, it has already exceeded the price of other commodities, so we must suppress it. Even if not a single grain of white rice comes to this city in the future, the current stock of Siamese rice can last until the end of August. Therefore, the municipal government remains committed to: (1) Unlimited supply of Siamese rice, (2) White rice can be sold within the negotiated price of 76,000 yuan, (3) No plans to adjust the negotiated prices at this time.

Rice Merchants Violating Negotiated Prices to be Punished by the Social Affairs Bureau According to Law

Yesterday, the North and South rice markets had a total of approximately 500 shi of goods arriving. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell Siamese rice, with 4,195 bags sold in the North Market and 1,750 bags in the South Market, totaling 5,945 bags. Regarding merchants violating the negotiated price of white rice, the bureau yesterday also continued to investigate and discovered 23 more firms, bringing the total to 101, including the previous 78. Among them, the black market price was as high as 100,000 yuan. Some are repeat offenders. The Social Affairs Bureau has drafted punishment measures, which are reportedly: warnings will be issued for those below 90,000 yuan. For those above 90,000 yuan, account books or other evidence will be confiscated, and fines will be imposed separately in accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices. The amounts will be submitted to the municipal government for approval before implementation.

Merchants Unable to Make Profit, White Rice Disappears from Market

[Our Newspaper] Because the authorities are determined to suppress rice prices and will not allow renegotiating agreed prices, it is nearly impossible to buy white rice in this city. According to rice merchants, the market price of white rice in Wuxi is 80,000 yuan, and the rice prices in other counties are also between 70,000 and 80,000 yuan. Shipping it to Shanghai would cost at least 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Since the negotiated rice prices in this city are lower than the rice prices in other cities, merchants cannot make a profit and naturally will not ship rice to Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have been strictly investigating rice store inventories, so most rice stores sell small amounts of white rice in mixtures, and black market transactions are gradually decreasing. The North and South markets have formed a single-color Siamese rice trading environment. Although white rice has been shipped to the Suzhou Creek, it is all waiting for a reply and will not be easily sold. Therefore, whether rice prices in this city can be fully suppressed, the level of rice prices in the suburbs is also a determining factor.

The Markets for Coarse Grains and Bean Cakes are Buoyant

The source of soybeans is still scarce, and oil plants and wood have a very strong appetite, and the price is sharply rising, advancing by 2,300 yuan. Bean cake owners are very firm, and customer acceptance is still acceptable, advancing by another 1,3500 yuan at a high price. Qingdao already has spot goods in the oil market, and the market sentiment is somewhat uncertain, the shop sentiment has turned weak, and various oils have fallen across the board by 35,000 yuan. The air is still strong, and the flour market has risen by 500-1,000 yuan. The skin of the wheat is very popular in Zhejiang, and the villages are slightly encouraged, the market is lively, and it has rebounded by 1,000 yuan. The high price of raw kernels is fixed, and the secondary transit is acceptable, and it has risen by 2,300 yuan. Sesame is up, corn is fixed, red sorghum is outstanding, wheat is stable, red beans have risen by 34,000 yuan, and lentil beans are imitated, and green beans are firm.

### Black Market Prices for Sugar Soar, Mayor Wu Orders Taiwan Sugar Corporation to Restrict Arbitrary Allocation Requests from Merchants

[Our Newspaper] The allocation price of raw sugar and red sugar had just been adjusted by the Review Committee from 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per dan a few days ago. The black market price has risen repeatedly in recent days, reaching its peak yesterday. Mayor Wu issued a statement yesterday afternoon regarding this matter: Merchants applied for a total of only 11,000 tons of allocated sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation last month. Now, seeing the high black market price, they applied for 12,000 tons of allocated sugar in the first week of this month. Merchants' concept of valuing profits so highly is truly inappropriate. An order has been issued to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to allocate all applicants for the month based on last month's standards. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to closely monitor black market sugar prices. We hope that merchants will not deliberately raise prices or hoard goods.

Furthermore, the sugar market trend was still tight yesterday. The guild's quoted spot price for refined sugar was 175,000 to 200,000 yuan, up another 45,000 yuan. Raw sugar red sugar was 163,000 yuan. Numbered goods were offered by Cantonese merchants, with Shunde Qing at 125,000 to 6,000 yuan, and Shantou offered 126,000 yuan, totaling more than 300 bags. The Xinghua gang offered Xinghua foreign for 30 bags, at 145,000 yuan, and Xinxing red at 145,000 to 138,000 yuan, totaling more than 400 baskets. Jianbang Diao Qing was initially 118,000 yuan, then 120,000 to 122,000 yuan.

### Negotiated Prices for Sugar and Cotton Cloth, Extraordinary Meeting to be Held Today

### Wheat Flour Continues to Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] More than 100,000 bags of American flour arrived last week, as reported earlier.

### Allocation of Oil Materials to be Handled by the Transportation Management Committee

The Executive Yuan has determined that since the Temporary Import Management Committee has been established, the authority to set prices and distribute oil materials should be transferred to the committee. The China Petroleum Corporation, which previously managed this work, has been ordered to abolish the Oil Material Allocation Committee it had established. After receiving the order, the company immediately sent personnel to contact Li, the Executive Member of the Transportation Management Committee, to handle the handover. It is understood that in addition to approving oil prices, the committee plans to establish a separate agency to manage the allocation of oil materials. However, the work of transporting oil to other cities will still be carried out jointly with the Petroleum Corporation. The distribution of oil and materials purchased by government agencies under special projects and oil materials produced by the Gansu Oil Administration Bureau's Kaohsiung Refinery will still be managed by the Petroleum Corporation.

### Treasury Bills

Market Rumors Abound, Central Bank Claims They are False

[Our Newspaper] With gold and banknotes soaring in recent days, the market has been rife with rumors that the Central Bank will issue treasury bills. Yesterday, our reporter inquired with Liang Ping, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the bank, about the details. He replied that he knew nothing about this matter and stated that all the rumors were false. He further clarified that even the new version of the gold banknotes issued during the Lunar New Year were not numerous and were issued purely to meet the needs of various sectors. Therefore, an application is still required for exchange. Recently, due to extremely limited reserves, there have been restrictions on exchanges.

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament Successfully Concludes; Morning White Wins Group A Championship; Defeats Morning Red in Second Final Last Night; New Life Defeats Morning Blue in Group B Final

[Our Dispatch] The finals of the 6th Changyou Cup basketball tournament, organized by the Morning Friends Group of the YMCA, were held last night in the Zhongqing Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. Over a thousand spectators attended, making it an unprecedented event in the small Zhongqing basketball hall.

As a result, the White team defeated the Red team again 59-33 to win the Group A championship. The battle situation is described below:

New Life Wins Group B Championship

In the first scene, the New Life and Morning Friends Blue teams competed in the Group B final. New Life was indeed "new life," more lively, younger, and willing to fight than Morning Blue. After the start of the game, both sides were highly concentrated and the defense was extremely strict, so the scores were low. In the first half, New Life led 9-6. After switching sides, Liang Xiong of New Life scored the first bullseye again. Chen Weiyuan of Morning Blue made a long shot, and Yuan Peiyuan also made two free throws. However, Tong Yanxuan and Liang Xiong of New Life teamed up, and Morning Blue could not do anything about it. As a result, New Life won the championship 19-13.

Brotherly Confrontation Especially Tense

The final battle was the second final of Group A, the Morning Friends Red and White brothers confronting each other. Outside rumors said that the Red and White brothers were a family. Last night, before the game, they understood each other. Red wins, White loses, but the result is that the championship still belongs to the White team. The battle was especially tense, resulting in numerous fouls. The White team was the embodiment of benevolence. When the whistle blew, they couldn't get anything in seven minutes of melee. He Zeng of the Red team opened the record with a single-handed goal. Wu Xinyun of the White team attacked desperately and scored two points in a row. Bao Daohui added fuel to the fire, and the White team took the lead 13-6. Huang Cunrui of the Red team made a long shot from the center line several times, but failed to score, and the morale declined, and the movements gradually became clumsy. Wu Xinyun of the White team was injured and fell to the ground, and Shen Pengju replaced him. In the first half, the Red team was behind 15-25.

White Team Wins Red Two Battles, Two Wins

After switching sides, Wu Xinyun of the White team re-entered the battle. The guard Sun Guozheng intensified his efforts to rush forward and block, putting on a show. The Red team only had Huang Cunrui's long shots and Wang Rongsheng and Shi Jiuquan's slight embellishments. The White team's score soared with Yao Wenyi's holding the ball, Shen Pengju's rushing forward, and Wang Huaiting's long shots, reaching 52-33. Yao Wenyi took the opportunity to score three more points, and Wu Xinyun added icing on the cake. The bell rang loudly, 59-33. The White team won two battles in a row and won the Morning Friends Cup Group A championship.

### Dedication

This page is not only a short history of the development of a national goods factory, but also the arduous and striving process of the entire Chinese national industry.

Yumin Woolen Yarn Factory has been established for ten years. What a great era these ten years have been! The motherland's Anti-Japanese War has finally achieved victory. Yumin Factory was destroyed at the beginning of its establishment, just as the incident began. But its leaders were unyielding, rebuilt the foundation in the isolated island of the turbid current, and strived for a broad future for the national industry. When the Pacific War broke out, the entire Shanghai market fell, and the enemy and puppets frantically squeezed everything. In this darkest moment, it was willing to shut down and refused to cooperate with the enemy and puppets. After the victory, it raised its head again and took on the task of revitalizing the country and building the industry. Isn't this the epitome of all loyal and unwavering national goods factories?

To commemorate this great decade, we hope that in the next decade, we will work hard to make China's national industry thrive day by day, keep pace with the world's advanced countries, and complete the most important task of the construction era.

### Ten Years of Entrepreneurship

Our company was established in May of the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937], with a capital of 350,000 [currency not specified]. We purchased more than 16 mu of factory land at the intersection of Jinyi Road and Longhua Road, and ordered the latest woolen spinning machines from the United Kingdom. The construction of the factory building began, but less than two months later, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the construction project was halted. Moreover, the location was near the military area, and it was impossible to send personnel to guard it, so the completed walls and other projects were completely destroyed. By the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], we had separately surveyed the current factory site (142 Xinhui Road), rented land and built houses, installed machines, and immediately started work, persevering and striving for the national goods industry. Later, feeling that the funds were insufficient, we increased the capital twice in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic of China [1940 and 1941] to 1.1 million [currency not specified]. All changes were reported to and registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All of our products, including Double Ocean Brand, Double Hand Brand, Eagle Brand, and Globe Brand coarse and fine woolen yarn, were sold to various ports and were well received, with demand exceeding supply. Our company became more motivated, studied carefully, and strived to make progress. Soon, the Pacific War broke out, the source of wool tops was blocked, and work was halted. At that time, the flames of the enemy were spreading, coveting the factory's assets. Monsters and demons used their usual tricks, threatening and tempting, using both soft and hard tactics. Our company remained unmoved, always strictly adhered to its position, adhered to the spirit of preferring to be a broken jade than a complete tile, and resolutely refused to the end. In order to protect the funds, we returned the funds to the shareholders twice, as an expedient measure to cope with the then environment, to ease our burdens, and to wait for the arrival of Su. Since the victory was realized the previous autumn, factories in Shanghai have resumed work one after another. Our company has regrouped, increased its capital to 1 billion [currency not specified], expanded production, and strived to revitalize the industry, hoping to contribute a small amount to the cause of national construction and revival.

### News

It is reported that the company will hold a grand 10th anniversary celebration with solemn ceremonies. The invitations issued are all accompanied by admission tickets. Guests must enter with tickets. The venue is limited, and in order to maintain order, one ticket per person, and no admission without a ticket.

The prosperity of science and the innovation of thought are all due to the innate abilities of people on earth. Yumin Globe Brand woolen yarn uses the earth as a trademark, its meaning is not only to hope to promote this beautiful product to the whole earth, but in fact it has the alert that the lives of people on earth should be new and new every day, so the Globe Brand is a broad commodity, it can be in this corner of the earth. Enjoyed a great reputation, it is a matter of course.

As for the double ocean, in the past China, which was based on silver, silver ocean coins were valued by everyone. Silver is a pure color, it has brilliance, but it does not have the vulgarity of gold, it is very simple and very cute. Yumin's Double Ocean yarn with the Double Ocean as its trademark, on the one hand, expresses its brilliance, and on the other hand, it means that it is spread among the people.

The same is the trademark, which should be both elegant and popular, and the meaning should be profound. The meaning of the trademarks of Globe Brand yarn and Double Ocean Brand yarn are clear, and its sales will naturally go without saying!

### The Importance of "Oiling" in Wool Spinning Engineering

â Sheng Wei

After the raw wool used in wool spinning has been washed once in the wool washing process, most of the original wool grease attached to the wool fibers has been washed away, leaving only 1-3% of the oil content on it, and the surface of the wool fibers becomes rough after being subjected to soap and alkaline substances, and it also loses its original softness. If such wool fibers are put into the various spinning processes, the fibers will inevitably be broken and damaged due to mutual friction through multiple mechanical operations, resulting in a defective product. In the spinning engineering, the only way to remedy this problem is to apply a so-called "oiling" process.

After the wool fibers have been subjected to the "oiling" process, the advantages of its technology and products are briefly described below:

1. Reduce the frictional resistance between fibers in various spinning preparation processes such as Carding, Gilling, and Cornbing, so that the fibers reduce the rate of breakage and damage.

2. Make Cornbing and Drafting easier to operate and increase the elasticity of fibers in roving.

3. Prevent the fibers from flying around during spinning and reduce the consumption of waste.

Secondly, choosing the oil quality used for "oiling" is also an important matter. The following points are the conditions for checking the oil quality and are also worth studying.

1. It can easily expand on the surface of each fiber, so that there is a kind of lubricity between the fibers, which can reduce its frictional resistance, prevent the generation of static electricity, help the stretching effect, and reduce the discount of falling wool and flying wool.

2. It is stable in the atmosphere and does not cause chemical reactions, is non-coloring, and does not damage the fibers and the mechanical needle cloth, etc.

3. It is easy to emulsify and can be stabilized in spinning without coagulation, no volatilization phenomenon, and no bad odor remains on the product and is easy to wash.

4. High ignition point, the fibers after "oiling" have no danger of spontaneous combustion.

According to the above-mentioned regulations, olive oil is the most suitable among the oils, so it has always been used as the best raw material for "oiling." Because the value of this kind of oil is too high, other mineral oils or vegetable oils have recently been used instead, but when using high-grade raw materials to manufacture high-grade products, olive oil is still used.

Because the raw materials are different, such as coarse wool, fine wool, waste wool, and silk wool, the amount of oil applied is of course also different. Depending on the type of wool, an appropriate amount of oil is injected. The general amount of oil injected is:

About 0.5-5% for combing, about 3-15% for spinning woolen yarn, and 20% for short wool fibers that have undergone carbonization work.

Before applying the oil, it is more economical and the surface of the fibers is also easier to expand evenly if hot water is added to the oil and stirred to make it milky white before spraying it on the wool.

According to the research of many famous spinning experts, the yarn spun from spinning raw materials that have been subjected to "oiling" work can be increased by 8-10's. From this, we can know that if you want to spin high-quality and fine products, you must not neglect the "oiling" work.

### Saving Dyes and Improving Colors

â Dingdong

The main purpose of dyeing is how to dye the finished product into bright colors at the lowest cost. Although its brightness has a direct relationship with the dye itself, according to my experience, it can also be improved by the following two methods:

1. The combination of dyes should not exceed four types. The more types, the easier it is for the dyed finished product to turn gray.

2. Apply the original dye liquor for dyeing. Ordinary water often contains a small amount of calcium salts, which make the dyed color slightly darker. If the original dye liquor is applied, this disadvantage can be avoided. It can not only make the color brighter, but also save dyes, fuel, acid, sodium sulfate, and water consumption. The cost of finished products can be reduced.

The above two methods are very easy to implement. The second method is slightly more difficult: because the dye components in the dye liquor are not easy to measure, the color of the finished product cannot be consistent, and the color is not easy to be uniform and becomes mottled. Therefore, dyeing with the original dye liquor should choose raw materials with good dyeing properties. As for measuring the remaining dye components in the dye liquor, the following two methods can be used for measurement:

1. Suppose 3% of the required dye liquor is poured into the test cup, add 4% sulfuric acid and 20% sodium sulfate, and add water to make the total amount 30 c.c. Take out 25 c.c., set aside, and dye the sample in the usual way. After dyeing, squeeze dry, and add water to make the dye liquor to the original 27.5 c.c. Take out a part and put it in a colorimetric tube, and at the same time take out 1 c.c. from the previous 25 c.c. of liquid and put it in a graduated colorimetric tube, dilute it with water so that its color is the same as the liquid in the other colorimetric tube. Assuming that 1 c.c. of undyed liquid needs to be added with 8.5 c.c. of water to be the same as the dyed liquid, the dye stolen in the period liquid (1+8.5=0.12) is 12%, and the sample absorbs 80% as the dye.

2. Add 2% sulfuric acid and dye that makes the color the same as the previous sample in the dye liquor that has been dyed in the first method. If the amount of dye liquor added is 2.6%, then the remaining dye component in the original dye liquor is 13.33% (2.6+3Ã100), and the sample is absorbed by 86.66%.

The results of these two tests are very similar; however, the first method is more accurate. As for acid mordant dyes, the colors before and after dyeing are completely different; therefore, the second method is more appropriate. As for the measurement of the blended dye liquor, the principle is the same as above, and the reader will be able to apply it by analogy, so I will not repeat it here.

### I Talk About Woolen Yarn Knitting

â â¦â¦Feng Qiupingâ¦â¦

The invention of woolen yarn knitting, in European and American countries, has already published knitting samples as one of the ways to promote handicrafts. Looking at our country, there are few knitting researchers. You must know that woolen yarn clothing is soft and comfortable, and both outer wear and inner wear are very suitable. It is actually the chief of clothing, and it is suitable for people of all classes. Although Europe and the United States have long created various styles of knitting, they are only suitable for foreigners to wear. Ping has learned from this, so she has devoted herself to researching various woolen yarn clothing that is suitable for Chinese people to wear; and also to promote business in the woolen yarn industry, to provide women with more opportunities. The relationship between woolen yarn and knitting is like siblings. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Ping had already compiled the various patterns of woolen yarn clothing that she had researched on a daily basis, and titled it Qiuping Woolen Yarn Embroidery Knitting Method, and had also given lectures on the airwaves at the radio station, so that ladies who love knitting in other cities could also have the opportunity to study. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Woolen yarn has been controlled, and I have to temporarily retire. After the victory, I am in the midst of shouting for national construction. Women should seek self-reliance. Woolen yarn knitting is a noble art, and it should be further developed to give women more occupations. Among the domestic woolen yarn, Earth and Double Ocean are the two kinds of autumn ping have been used for many years, the quality can be called first-class, today is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Shanghai Yumin Woolen Yarn Factory, I would like to solemnly introduce it to all circles.

Don't say the business is light as a feather The success is now ten years and eight years The enemy soldiers come Ever not stained Pure and upright, strong and firm Holding this thousands of threads, think about the meaning, often looking at the name Not seeking thick I am to enrich the people's livelihood

### Fire at (Little Qin Prince)

â Ling Keming

Hearing of a great fire somewhere,

Letting it spread into a field of ash;

Now I believe the ancient saying is wonderful: "To create magic water, one needs an umbrella handle!"

### The Lantern Festival is Over, No More Merrymaking

â Fang Wen

This year's Lantern Festival coincided with the return of spring to the earth, auspicious snow just after, golden rice and white rice, soaring success, prices rising for all goods, thriving prosperity, speculative hoarding, universal joy, spending this fine evening, naturally particularly lively. The international metropolis of Shanghai was exactly a scene of trees of fire and silver flowers, the city open all night, gongs and drums sounded together, lanterns and beacons the same color, singing and dancing of peaceful prosperity, oh, how glorious!

On the streets of Shanghai that night, high stilt performances, the Land Boat Dance, and others, in team after team, came in an endless stream. Also, there were various lanterns, colorful, incredibly ingenious. Among the most wonderful were the Two Dragons Gate Formation, the Eight-Legged Crab crawling sideways on the road, the Water Dragon Playing with Phoenix, the Airplane doing Somersaults, the Water Rat Stealing Oil to Eat, all kinds of forms, without exception, had innovative designs, making people happy to stop and watch. Especially the Allied friendly forces, also watched with great fascination.

Celebrating the Lantern Festival, it is said that it should be lively, the livelier the better, but once the Lantern Festival is over, everyone should get down to business, release their conscience to do what should be done, and absolutely must not continue the merrymaking!

### American Movies in Full Swing, Recruiting Movie Star Doubles in Shanghai, Part of "Stealing the Treasury" Filmed on Location in Shanghai

â Yin

Several days ago, various English newspapers in this city carried a strange advertisement, without the name of the person or company placing it, nor stating the purpose or intention, only saying that it was recruiting several foreign beauties, but listing the conditions such as each person's figure measurements, weight in pounds, etc., in extremely detailed terms. Readers mostly did not understand what the real meaning was. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the American Columbia Pictures Corporation had come to Shanghai to shoot on location.

Columbia is one of Hollywood's eight major production companies. This time, it is filming "Stealing the Treasury," a film about a major international drug trafficking case. It is said that part of the background is Shanghai, so the film's director, Nachailuo, reversed the past Hollywood practice of "closing the door to build a car," and earnestly rushed to Shanghai to film on location. However, because the journey was long, it was inconvenient for the delicate actress to cross the ocean, so they placed an advertisement to recruit a double.

Not only is the leading actress preparing to find a double in Shanghai, but even the cinematographer has also hired someone here, Wang Xiaoting. Wang is the MGM company's newsreel photographer stationed in China. I remember when the enemy bombed Shanghai in those years, Wang Xiaoting shot a newsreel at the North Railway Station. The scene was that the station had just been bombed, full of broken walls and debris, and a one-year-old child was sitting on the tracks, his clothes tattered, his whole body burned, crying loudly, surrounded by deathly silence.

Just this one photograph won the sympathy and support of the people of various countries, and the inhuman act of the Japanese invaders killing innocent people and indiscriminately bombing left a deep impression internationally.

Until recently, one magazine praised it as one of the best news photographs of the last ten years. In the new film "Flying Tigers," there is a close-up shot after a major bombing, the background and the child's situation are all similar to the above, naturally influenced by that news photograph.

### Marriage Advertisement - Just Promotion

â Fan Shiren

Recently, someone placed a marriage advertisement for "Peking Opera Asia Queen" Cao Xiuqin, and sure enough, many people who usually admired her wrote letters to apply. In fact, this marriage advertisement was just a joke between her and the writer, and was used to do some "promotion."

Sisters Kunyi Li Qianghua and Li Weihua, who came from the rear, sang at the Great Stage for a period of time, and then had no opportunity to join a troupe, but their presence could often be seen in social venues, so some people called them "Socialite Peking Opera Actresses."

One night, at the Tianchan Stage, I watched Cheng Yanqiu perform Mei Fei. During the Golden Palace scene, the set was full of light bulbs, appearing to be performing "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince," this kind of "gimmick" is both clichÃ©d and low-grade, and does not fit the Peking Opera style, and the style is not very harmonious with the Peking Opera atmosphere.

### Mysterious Herb

â Kang Shi

Heard about the Legend of Lingzhi

Lingzhi's educational aid exhibition caused a sensation, and many people came from afar to visit, eager to make a small examination, to provide a means of conversation.

Lunheng says, "Lingzhi grows in the soil, when the soil's Qi is harmonious, so Lingzhi grows in the soil, eating it makes people live long, there is Azure Cloud Lingzhi, Dragon Immortal Lingzhi, Golden Noisy Lingzhi, Nine-Bend Lingzhi, Fire Lingzhi, Moon Essence Lingzhi, Noctilucent Lingzhi, Ignited Fire Lingzhi, White Cloud Lingzhi, Mica Lingzhi, Phoenix Brain Lingzhi, Five Virtues Lingzhi, Ten Thousand Years Lingzhi."

The Materia Medica Five Lingzhi Classic says: "Azure Lingzhi grows on Mount Tai, Red Lingzhi grows on Mount Huo, Yellow Lingzhi grows on Mount Song, White Lingzhi grows on Mount Hua, Black Lingzhi grows on Mount Chang, Purple Lingzhi grows in the valleys of Mount Gaoxia, the six Lingzhi are all harvested on the eighth day of June."

The Langhuan Records says: "Lingzhi is also called Longevity Grass, also called Xiyi." Shuowen says: "Lingzhi is a divine herb."

Baopuzi says: "There are hundreds of kinds of Lingzhi." Other books such as the Lanyang Miscellany and the Lingzhi Collection, etc., all have records of it, but each has its own say, which will be omitted.

In the spring of the seventeenth year of Emperor Ming of Han, Lingzhi grew in the front hall. In the third month of the seventh year of Tang Tianbao, a jade Lingzhi grew on the pillars of the Datong Hall, with a divine light illuminating the hall. The army begged to add the emperor's title, Kaiyuan Tianbao Sacred and Martial Responding to the Way. In the seventh month of the second year of Suzong Shangyuan, jade Lingzhi, one stem with three flowers, grew on the beam of the throne in the Yanying Hall. The Five Elements Records of the Song Dynasty states: "In the ninth month of the fifth year of Taiping Xingguo, Lingzhi like lotus flowers grew on the hall beams of the ZhenDing Prefecture temporary palace. In the first month of the fourth year of Xianping, Weizhou presented a Lingzhi grass, shaped like a Buddha. On Xinwei day of the fifth month of the first year of Dayou Xiangfu, five Lingzhi plants were found in the Konglin, with colors of yellow and purple like clouds, and in the shape of people wearing crowns and hats." There are countless cases like these.

The Record of Extensive Information says: "Famous mountains produce divine Lingzhi, the grass of immortality, the upper Lingzhi is for carriages and horses, the middle Lingzhi is in the shape of humans, the lower Lingzhi is for the six domestic animals."

Regarding Lingzhi literature, there is Tang Cui Rong's Crown Prince's Ode to Lingzhi Grass, Song Qin Guan's Preface to Yu Zizhi, Song Wang Anshi's Lingzhi Pavilion Record, Huang Tingjian's Auspicious Lingzhi Pavilion Record, and Ji Zhou Fengyuan Wang Xiu Pavilion Record, etc.

Song Su Shi's letter to Ju Shizheng says: "Although Wendeng is somewhat remote, all things can be established. An herb called White Stone Lingzhi grows in the island, its fragrance is like chewing tea at first, and is very good after a long time, it is said to be very beneficial to people, the Duke must be informed. The White Stone Lingzhi is shaped like a rock tripe, but has a fragrance, this is how to distinguish it, keep it secret, keep it secret."

According to the Jushan Miscellaneous Records: "Jinshan in Wu County especially has much Lingzhi, often produced on the ground, mostly blue in color, the mountain people pick it up every time, and do not value it."

In summary, Lingzhi, although an auspicious herb, has been produced over the years, and is only produced in deep mountains, rarely being discovered by people. As for the legend of "taking it to become an immortal," it is all mythology, not to be believed. As for whether it can be used as a medicine, it remains to be studied by medical scientists.
