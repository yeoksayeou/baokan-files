### Recovery of Yantai and Consolidation of Jiaodong; National Army in Western Anhui Enters Qianshan; Gu Zhutong Arrives in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou to Take Command

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, This Newspaper, 1st] The National Army officially recovered Yantai at 9:30 AM on the 1st. The supply line of the Communist bandits in North China via Daisu Sea has been cut off, and the entire strategy of the Communist bandits has completely failed. In addition, the important base of the bandit army in Jiaodong, Mount Juchi, has also been recovered, and the mop-up operation against the remaining scattered bandits is underway. The news of the recovery of Yantai was first reported by aerial reconnaissance. The Air Force witnessed the National Army entering Yantai city in a steady stream. The military immediately issued a message stating: "Under the strong cover of the Navy and Air Force, our Que Hanqian's troops (54th Army) launched a general attack on Yantai yesterday (30th) morning. After a night of fierce fighting, all resistance of the bandits was destroyed, and Yantai was completely recovered at 9:30 AM this morning. The war gains are being investigated."

After the recovery of Yantai, the 6th and 13th Columns of the bandit army attempted to break through to the west, but were surrounded by the National Army in the area between the Jiao River and the Han River and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In the Haiyang area, more than 10,000 bandits are fleeing westward to the area north of Lingshan. The two groups of remaining bandits are clearly attempting to cross the rear of the National Army and enter the mountainous area of southern Shandong. They have been continuously encircled and annihilated and pursued by the Army and Air Force.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] Chairman Chiang instructed all units of the National Army advancing toward Yantai to pay special attention to protecting the churches and church personnel in the area after the recovery of Yantai.

### Wang Chonghui Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations; Both Parties May First Exchange Opinions; Control of Japan Should Be Thoroughly Implemented

[This Newspaper Report] Government Commissioner Wang Chonghui stated yesterday, "Regarding the recent Sino-Soviet relations, the government has always had the desire to improve the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The problem is that a set of methods is needed. I personally advocate that China and the Soviet Union should each send high-ranking officials to exchange opinions on the overall problems between the two countries for a considerable period of time, and to discuss openly to explore the real crux of the problems. China may first propose this matter to the other party to show our sincerity. As for whether there will be results, it is another matter. If Sino-Soviet relations can be improved, it will be of considerable benefit to the solution of internal problems." According to reports, Wang had a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao, who came to Shanghai, yesterday to broadly exchange views on the Japanese peace treaty issue. Wang believes that the period of controlling Japan should be quite long, at least twenty years, until every provision in the peace treaty is thoroughly implemented and the thinking of its people is thoroughly changed before the Allied control of Japan can be ended. During the control process, it would also be permissible for China to send a small number of troops to be stationed in Japan.

### US Senators and Representatives Cancel Visit to the Far East; Several Legislators Plan to Visit the Far East in a Private Capacity

### Hong Kong Official Discusses Smuggling; Says China Should Be Responsible

[United Press Dispatch from Hong Kong, 1st] According to Sims Worth, Hong Kong government's Director of Imports and Exports, smuggling between Hong Kong and mainland China is mainly due to the tacit approval of Chinese officials and the high trade barriers established by the Chinese government, which prohibit goods that consumers demand and that have a legitimate market in China. (Sims' speech is on page 2)

### Recent Price Fluctuations; Reasons for Volatility; Overall Price Increases Stimulate Grain Prices

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] According to sources related to the matter, the price fluctuations in Nanjing and Shanghai began in late August. Initially, there were fluctuations in cotton cloth, and cigarettes and fuel also showed sharp increases. The price of rice in Shanghai remained stable at around 400,000 yuan before August 27th. Starting from the 28th, it began to rise due to high prices in the production area (Wuxi). This proves that overall price increases stimulate grain prices, not that grain prices lead overall prices. Since entering September, the situation has become even more intense due to the westward flight of the Communist bandits and the tense situation in Anhui and Hubei, which has hindered the downward transportation of rice and grain. In terms of national prices in September, cotton cloth and other goods have generally risen sharply in various regions, while rice prices, except for fluctuations in the Nanjing and Shanghai area, have mostly fallen in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River and southeastern provinces due to the abundance of new goods or difficulties in external transportation. There have also been no fluctuations in North China and Northeast China. The prices of various goods have become unbalanced. As new rice enters the market in Nanjing and Shanghai, it will flood in large quantities, and recent price declines in production areas indicate that prices may gradually stabilize.

### Legislative Yuan Inquires to Executive Yuan; Hopes to Maintain Contact Regarding Peace Treaty Matters

### Foreign Minister Wang Meets with US President; Discusses the Current Situation in China; Did Not Mention Loans or General Wedemeyer's Investigation; Contents of Negotiations with Secretary Marshall Kept Secret

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 30th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, accompanied by Ambassador Wellington Koo, told reporters after a courtesy visit to the White House today that he had the opportunity to discuss the world and China's situation with President Truman. He informed President Truman about the current situation in China and found that President Truman was already very familiar with the situation in China. They did not discuss matters related to loans to China or the investigation of the situation in China and Korea by General Wedemeyer. Wang confirmed that he had requested a meeting with President Truman. Assistant Secretary of State Acheson and experts on Far Eastern affairs were present at the meeting. He also said that he would continue to stay in the United States for ten days, which is longer than he originally planned, as the United Nations may discuss matters related to China. Wang later met with Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Chinese Embassy is scheduled to host a banquet on the 1st to entertain leading figures in the US government.

[US Information Service Dispatch from Washington, 30th] Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Shijie stated that he had met with Secretary of State Marshall at the UN General Assembly. These negotiations have not yet been completed. Wang declined to disclose the contents of the negotiations.

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 30th] Responsible officials said, "Judging from current signs, the Wedemeyer Report will not be released." The report that Wedemeyer submitted to President Truman on the results of his investigation into China and Korea is currently being kept strictly secret. As of now, only the White House and top officials of the State Department know about it, and both sides are tight-lipped about it.

[US Information Service Dispatch from Washington, 30th] A State Department spokesman stated today that he had no knowledge of the news from China that the United States plans to train ten divisions of the National Government's army. He said he had inquired with the Department of the Army about this matter, and they also had no knowledge of it.

### Import Tax on Gasoline, Kerosene, and Diesel Set at 50% Ad Valorem

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated that gasoline and diesel oil are goods subject to tax under the import tariff schedule. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the seaports fell and the Burma Road was blocked, the source of oil was hindered. In order to encourage merchants and civilians to transport oil to meet the needs of the time, the government decided to temporarily exempt gasoline and diesel oil from import tax starting in August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Since the restoration, the import of foreign goods has mostly resumed the 1934 import tariff schedule, which levied taxes ad valorem, but gasoline and diesel oil have not simultaneously resumed taxation due to the wartime measures being continued. The government is now striving to balance the budget and save on consumption, so it should resume the customs duties that should be levied on gasoline and diesel oil in order to increase revenue. In addition, because gasoline was previously tax-free, some unscrupulous retailers sold gasoline mixed with kerosene, or used tax-free diesel to distill kerosene to evade taxes. All of this needs to be corrected. In view of this, the Executive Yuan recently resolved at a meeting that the import tax on gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil will be uniformly increased to 50% ad valorem. Crude oil will be temporarily exempt from import tax. After receiving the order from the Executive Yuan on September 30, the Ministry of Finance immediately telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs to implement it. If the import quota for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil this year is not reduced, then based on estimates for the three months of October, November, and December this year, the possible increase in customs revenue will be more than 200 billion yuan. (Implementation measures for the 50% ad valorem increase in import tax on fuel oil, see page 7)

### Zhang Junmai Goes to Nanjing

### Dong XianGuang Announces to the Press That Members of the Democratic League Participated in Rebellion; Headquarters Failed to Correct and Should Be Held Responsible

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Is it true that members of the Democratic League, such as Yan Baohang, hold important positions in the Communist bandits, and can you give details? This inquiry was answered by Director Dong XianGuang at a press conference on the afternoon of the 1st: In the Northeast region occupied by the Communist bandits, those who currently hold important positions are Yan Baohang, chairman of the pseudo-Liaobei Province, Yu Yifu, chairman of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province, Che Xiangchen, vice chairman, Han Youtong, director of the pseudo-Songjiang Province Education Department, Guan Mengjue, director of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province Education Department, and Gao Chongmin and Zhou Jingwen, administrative committee members of the joint administrative office of the pseudo-Northeast provinces and cities. The above-mentioned persons are only a few prominent examples. The Democratic League established a preparatory committee for the General Branch in the Communist area long ago, and the number of its members holding positions in the Communist area is not limited to these.

Yan Baohang and others accepted pseudo-orders in the capacity of the preparatory committee of the Democratic League's General Branch in the Communist area, betraying the government. This is an undeniable fact. The Democratic League headquarters has not heard of any expressions regarding these members who participated in the rebellion. However, in order to implement its anti-government and anti-constitutional propositions, it severely dealt with members who participated in the central government or the National Assembly, repeatedly causing them to withdraw from the League. In other words, Democratic League members have no freedom to participate in the constitution or accept central appointments, but can collude with the Communist Party to hold important positions in bandit areas and participate in actions to betray the government. Under this stark comparison, the position taken by the leaders responsible for the Democratic League's activities between the government and the Communist bandits is very clear.

Another fact is also worth our attention. After the government promulgated the Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion and completed the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government, Democratic League members engaged in inciting and sabotaging mobilization in various places. For example, the Hong Kong and Kowloon General Branch of the Democratic League issued a declaration in July, calling for action to resist general mobilization, attempting to obstruct the government's requisitioning measures. This statement incited rebellion and violated the law. It was issued in the name of the local general branch of the Democratic League. More than two months have passed, and the leaders responsible for the Democratic League's activities have never corrected it.

The activities of any political party are based on the guidelines established by its central organization. The Hong Kong and Kowloon General Branch of the Democratic League and its Communist Bandit General Branch Preparatory Committees have obvious facts of participating in or inciting rebellion. The Democratic League's leadership should have its own responsibilities in guidance.

In the past, the relationship between the Democratic League and the Communist bandits was close, and their propositions were consistent. This is a fact that is commonly seen in society and does not need to be elaborated. After the government issued the General Mobilization Order, some Democratic League members still did not know how to cherish themselves and openly held positions in the bandit area and participated in the rebellion. Its overseas general branches also made extensive propaganda, calling on the people to take action to resist the government. All these facts make people deeply believe that the Democratic League is not an independent political party, but an appendage of the Chinese Communist Party.

Luo Longji's Defense

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, issued a statement at 11:00 PM on the 1st to defend himself against the issues involving the Democratic League raised by Dong XianGuang at a press conference on the 1st. He denied that Yan Baohang was a member of the Democratic League and that Zhou Jingwen had participated in the work of the Communist bandits. However, Luo admitted that "it is indeed a fact that Democratic League members hold positions in the Communist area," but argued that "they are all local positions and were taken before the announcement of the Suppression of Rebellion Order more than a year ago." He also refuted Dong's accusation that the Democratic League's remarks incited rebellion, and said that he did not know what the government spokesman's intention was in "attacking" the Democratic League at this time. The conclusion of his statement reiterated the Democratic League's position of not participating in any action that would strengthen the division of the country.

### Adjustment of Civil Servant Benefits; Dong XianGuang Says Authorities Are Considering; Distribution of In-Kind Goods to Civil Servants and Teachers in Beiping and Tianjin Starting in September

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Dong XianGuang, Director of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, answered the following inquiries at a press conference on the 1st: According to previous regulations, civil servant benefits should be adjusted every three months. The most recent adjustment was in August, so the next adjustment should be implemented in November. The adjustment methods recently proposed by the Procuratorate and other agencies concerned about the lives of civil servants are being carefully considered by the relevant authorities. The official exchange rate for US dollars will not be increased. I do not know the black market price.

[Another Dispatch] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received an order from the Executive Yuan to handle the distribution of in-kind goods to civil servants and teachers in Beiping and Tianjin starting in September. However, the steps for implementation can only be determined based on the production of materials.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Chinese Institute of Engineers

The 14th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Joint Annual Meeting of thirteen specialized engineering societies, including electrical and textile engineering, is scheduled to be held in the capital today. The total number of delegates attending this session exceeds one thousand, and the conference will last for five days. This is the first joint annual meeting after the victory restoration. We feel that in the post-war economic construction, the responsibility of engineers is significant, and we place infinite expectations on the convocation of this annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers.

Engineering is a practical science and technology after the industrial revolution, and engineers are specialized talents who apply scientific and technological knowledge. The joint organization of engineering societies began with the Institution of Civil Engineers in the United Kingdom in 1828. The joint organization of engineers in our country started with the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Chinese Engineering Society in the early years of the Republic, and the Road Works Mutual Aid Society. The original founders were Zhan Tianyou and other advanced figures in the engineering field. Later, the three engineering groups merged to concentrate their strength, develop the engineering industry, and named it the "Chinese Institute of Engineers". Thirty articles of association were formulated, and the purposes were to standardize the construction system, develop the engineering industry, and promote engineering academics. At the first meeting, Zhan Tianyou was publicly elected as the president, and Yan Deqing and Xu Wenjiong were elected as the vice presidents. At the Nanjing Annual Meeting in 1931, it was resolved that the year when our country's first engineering group was organized would be the year of the association's founding. This symbolizes that the year of our country's founding was the year when our country's engineering industry sprouted and was established. In fact, since 1931, our country's engineering facilities and construction have been greatly contributed by our engineers. The organization of the Chinese Institute of Engineers is no less than the driving force of our country's industrial construction. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, our country's engineering talents emerged in large numbers and made great contributions to the country and the people. Deceased engineers, such as Zhan Tianyou, Li Yizhi, Fan Xudong, and Zhang Xinfu, dedicated themselves to the engineering industry and did their best. The current engineering personnel are all adhering to their posts, down-to-earth, and vigorously developing. These can all serve as models for the general public.

China needs modernization, and the engineering industry and engineering construction have brilliant prospects. For the practical application of science and technology, and in order to catch up with the new century, at present, the absorption and research of engineering academics, and the cultivation and utilization of engineering talents, still require the efforts and dedication of various engineering technology groups. Academic groups are originally a combination of talents, in-depth research, and the combination of knowing and acting. Its development and its future are not in the form of annual meetings, but in the concentration and unification of forces for the development of its own business after the exchange of will at the annual meeting. The Chinese Institute of Engineers has a strict organization and a large number of talents. It has creeds and disciplines. In today's uncertain national crisis, all engineering facilities and engineering construction designs rely on engineers to strive for perfection and make further progress.

In the five thousand years of our country's national construction plan, there was Yu Gong in the past, and the Father of the Nation's industrial plan in the future. One Yu Gong once laid the foundation for our country's past five thousand years, just as one industrial plan will build the future five thousand years. Our country, thanks to the hard work of our ancestors, has roots and foundations, and fertile land awaits construction, and vast plains await development. And the industrial plan has already designed the pattern, magnificent, with warp and weft, pointing out the path for engineering personnel. Now and in the future, how to follow this ideal, practice innovation, this is the grand task of our country's engineers. The first article of the revised creed of the 30th annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers states: "Abide by the national defense and economic construction policies of the country and realize the industrial plan of the Father of the Nation". The second article states: "Recognize that the interests of the country and the nation are above all else, and be willing to sacrifice freedom and contribute ability". How great is its spirit and its ambition! Engineers are practical and law-abiding. Looking at the world trend and the national situation in the past six years, the task of our country's engineers is indeed very great. It is hoped that engineering personnel will establish their goals, recognize the interests of the country and the nation, contribute their academics and skills under the government's national defense and economic policies, and make arduous and unremitting efforts to realize the ideal of the Father of the Nation's industrial plan.

The Chinese Institute of Engineers has a bright and brilliant history in the past thirty years, and the future prospects are even greater and longer. We wish that the convening of this annual meeting will glorify the spirit of the association, promote the creed of the association, recognize the importance of one's own responsibility, strive for progress, and be consistent with the pace of the government and the people to jointly create a strong, prosperous, and happy new China.

### The Significance of Recovering Yantai Exceeds the Yan'an Campaign: Deng Wenyi's Report to Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The news of the National Army's recapture of Yantai in Jiaodong on the morning of the 1st greatly excited people here, who generally believe that the complete suppression of the communist bandits on the Shandong Peninsula is no longer a problem. Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended a press conference held by the News Bureau at 4:30 p.m. on the 1st and reported on military affairs, especially emphasizing the great significance of the National Army's recapture of Yantai. He said: "The National Army in Jiaodong began its offensive on September 15, advancing from Jimo, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi in three routes. Within half a month, Yantai has been recaptured." Deng then pointed out the strategic value of Jiaodong, saying: "After the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, the transportation between the Northeast communist bandits and Shandong relied solely on Yantai in Jiaodong. Shandong's strong manpower and food supplies, and the Northeast's weapons and ammunition, were all transported through this channel. The recapture of this area by the National Army can determine the future fate of the communist bandits' failure, and its impact will be greater than that of the Yan'an campaign." This campaign shows that the communist army's attempt to cross the Yellow River, invade Anhui and Hubei, and threaten Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai to contain the Jiaodong battlefield has failed, and its impact on their morale is particularly great. The communist army implemented the "empty city tactics," withdrawing approximately 80% of the troops from Hebei and Shanxi to flee south, resulting in a depleted force in their hinterland. The National Army that recovered Jiaodong only needs half of its strength to recover the communist bandit areas in Hebei, and then restore Shanxi and reinforce the Northeast, recovering the territorial sovereignty of the Northeast." Deng concluded: "The Yantai campaign is a failure of the communist bandits' overall strategy, and it also eliminates the fatal crisis to national unification and construction since the end of the War of Resistance."

### Communist Bandits in the Northeast Are Stirring; The National Army Has New Deployments

### Japanese Machinery as Compensation; Packaging and Shipping Pending

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Resources Commission announced the situation of Japanese compensation materials as follows: The first batch of Japanese compensation materials, machine tools, has already been drawn and allocated. Our country has obtained 9,780 units. These machines still need to be distributed and inspected by personnel from various ministries and commissions in Japan. If necessary, China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines must also consult and exchange with each other. Only after this work is completed can the packaging and shipping begin. According to the decision of the Allied Headquarters for Japanese early compensation materials, all work such as dismantling factories, packaging machines, and loading on ships or planes will be handled by the Japanese. Transportation ships will be arranged by each receiving country. Our country's Transportation Supervision Committee, under the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan, is responsible for transporting the materials from Japanese ports to Chinese ports. After the compensation goods arrive at the port, each receiving agency will distribute, ship, store, and transport them to the place of use.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The central government has a large-scale development plan for the Datong Coal Mine. The trip of Sun Yueqi, Wang Yichen, Xu Houfu, and others to the Ping-Sui Railway this time is to lay the foundation for the exact plan. When President Zhang passed through Beiping, relevant parties made a brief suggestion to Zhang regarding this plan, and Zhang was very supportive. It is reported that the reserves of the Datong Coal Mine are extremely astonishing and can be designed to mine 20 million tons annually, or at least 10 million tons annually.

To enable Datong coal to be directly transported from the production area to Tanggu New Port, the railway authorities have planned to build a direct line from Shacheng on the Ping-Sui Railway to Fengtai and extend the Ping-Jin Railway to Tanggu New Port. According to the pre-war national export, the total amount was only 1 billion national currency, which at that time was only about 300 million US dollars. If Datong coal can be sold well abroad, the foreign trade situation will be greatly changed.

### Consultations on General Election Nominations; Proportional Issues Unresolved

According to a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party who participated in the consultations on general election nominations: when representatives of the three parties consulted on September 25th, the Democratic Socialist Party suggested that the three parties submit their candidate lists for each province, add them together and make a decision, but the government representatives stated that the list had not yet been drafted, and the candidate list for Jiangsu Province could not be submitted.

The Youth Party has approximately 150 members of the Legislative Yuan and 600 members of the National Assembly.

### Speech by Sims-Worth, Hong Kong Government Director of Imports and Exports; Exposes Smuggling Methods and Routes

Sims-Worth, Director of Imports and Exports of the Hong Kong Government, said in a speech at the Hong Kong-British Economic Association that the most common method of smuggling is to pack all embargoed goods into small packages, carry them on board several times, and hide them in various parts of the ship. After the ship sails, all the packages are gathered together. After arriving at the destination, they are taken out through customs with or without the tacit permission of customs officers. He denounced the saying that smuggling is carried out at night on deserted beaches as absurd. According to him, most of the smuggling is found on ships sailing on designated routes. These ships directly enter the port of Hong Kong, or are found on planes flying to the airport in Kowloon, or on trains to Kowloon. Mr. Sims-Worth criticized the statement that "Hong Kong does not cooperate in prohibiting smuggling" as unfair. He pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong courts have ruled on more than 500 such cases, in which the value of the contraband confiscated exceeds HK$1.5 million. He declared: "The solution to smuggling depends on merchants having a sense of political morality and being able to abide by export ban regulations. In short, only by lifting trade restrictions and higher tariffs can smuggling be completely eliminated. We only hope that all countries understand that the loss of tax revenue, the shrinking of trade, and the organized resistance to laws will produce results that are not worth the losses."

### Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council: Canada and Argentina Elected; One Seat Remaining After Nine Inconclusive Ballots

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 1st Radio: Lake Success News, today the UN General Assembly continued to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. In the morning's eight rounds of voting, Ukraine received 31 votes, a decrease of two votes compared to yesterday. India received 23 votes, still failing to confirm its election.

[Our Newspaper Report] Approximately the 1st Radio: The General Assembly held its ninth vote, resulting in 32 votes for Ukraine and 24 votes for India, each gaining one vote from the eighth round, but still short of the 38-vote legal requirement.

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 30th Combined Telegram] The United States is attempting to eliminate pro-Soviet countries from the Security Council, causing the General Assembly to be deadlocked during voting. This has further deteriorated US-Soviet relations. Poland, originally a pro-Soviet non-permanent member of the Security Council, has now completed its term, and the election of its successor has reached an impasse. The Soviet Union supports Ukraine, while the United States supports India. After seven ballots, neither side could obtain a two-thirds majority, and the vote was postponed. According to UN practice, Poland should be succeeded by another Slavic country. The Soviet Union protested, saying that removing Slavic countries from the Security Council would undermine the UN Charter. During the voting, only Poland, among the Security Council member states, voted in favor of a country sympathetic to the Soviet Union succeeding as the new member. From the first vote of the General Assembly, Ukraine received more votes than India. By the seventh vote, Ukraine had 33 votes and India had 23 votes. Former General Assembly President Spaak suggested adjournment, but Vyshinsky shouted against stopping the voting. However, the General Assembly ultimately passed a motion with 28 votes to 16 to postpone the vote until the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 30th Telegram] Since its various committees began working at Lake Success, the UN General Assembly held its first plenary session here today, officially allowing the two Asian Muslim countries, Pakistan and Yemen, to join the organization. However, it was completely deadlocked in electing a country between Ukraine and India to replace Poland's vacancy on the Security Council. Today was one of the most unstable days since the establishment of the new world organization. After smoothly electing Argentina to succeed Brazil and Canada to succeed Australia as members of the Security Council, it failed to resolve the problem of Ukraine and India. Today's meeting demonstrated the effect of so-called bloc voting. The United States and the Soviet Union played a leading role in today's difficulties. Today's situation reflects the great rift between the two countries and clearly shows how small, united countries can fish in troubled waters. Due to difficulties in the Security Council election, the elections for six members of the Economic and Social Council and two members of the Trusteeship Council, originally scheduled for today, could not be held.

### UN Organization Membership Increased to 57 Countries; Mrs. Pandit Delivers Speech Welcoming Sister Nations

After the Assembly passed the applications of the two countries, their chief representatives were invited to the podium to sign the membership certificates. Yemeni representative Prince Saif wore a black silk robe embroidered with gold and a white headdress, while Pakistani representative Khan wore a blue casual suit. Both sat in the seats of honor. General Assembly President Aranha expressed deep satisfaction with the accession of the two countries. Khan then took the stage to deliver a thank-you speech, followed by Prince Saif, representing the Kingdom of Yemen, thanking the Assembly and stating Yemen's determination to fulfill the purposes of the UN organization and jointly establish better conditions for the development of international life.

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 30th] Indian representative Mrs. Pandit today delivered a congratulatory speech at the UN General Assembly welcoming Pakistan's participation in the United Nations, stating that India's sister nation has obtained its legitimate position in the international community and can cooperate in solving the current world's problems, which makes India deeply gratified.

### US President's Expedient Aid to Europe Plan; Taft Ridicules as Unwise; Firmly Opposed to Convening a Special Session of Congress

[United Press, Boise City, 30th] Senator Taft stated on the 30th that although Truman had issued a warning that the current European relief funds would be exhausted by December 1st, he still opposed convening a special session of Congress before December 1st. Taft believes that the majority of Republican senators have reiterated their previous position against convening a special session at this time. However, he believes that "some foolish people in the government" will be willing to dip into their pockets to provide a large amount of money for expedient aid to Europe.

[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] The chairmen of the major congressional committees today quickly responded to President Truman's request to expedite the study of Western Europe's winter relief needs.

### On the Eve of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference; Soviet Union Sends Note to Italian Government Explaining Its Attitude Towards Italian Colonies

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 1st Radio: Rome News, the Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman announced at a press conference that Soviet Ambassador to Italy Kostylev presented a note to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza today. It is said that the content of this document is "very important" and has a great relationship with improving Italian-Soviet relations. It is generally believed that the document explains the Soviet Union's attitude towards the disposal of pre-war Italian colonies, because this issue will soon be discussed by the four-power foreign ministers in London.

[Reuters, London, 30th] After the Soviet government agreed to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss Italian colonies, the conference is expected to be convened in the second week of this month. Its first task will be to send a committee of experts to the Middle East to inspect the former Italian colonies of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. General attention is focused on the Soviet Union's attitude, because at the first foreign ministers' conference in London two years ago, the Soviet Union requested trusteeship of Tripolitania. Although it has not raised the matter again since then, it is possible that it will be raised again at this conference.

### Bidault Meets Truman; France Deeply Fears Aid Will Not Arrive in Time; Britain Concerned About Occupation Cost Negotiations in the British-American Zone of Germany

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French Foreign Minister Bidault, who is currently in the United States, is scheduled to meet President Truman today. The French government and people attach great importance to the outcome of this meeting, because the US dollars that France can use to pay for necessary imports can at most last for only two or three weeks. The President's announcement yesterday that he intended to submit a transitional aid plan to Congress for a decision disappointed people here, who are worried that American aid will not be allocated in time to prevent the rapid deterioration of the economic situation.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Authoritative sources say: British officials do not feel dissatisfied or angry about President Truman's failure to include Britain in the list of transitional aid plans. Britain's economic recovery plan does not fully take into account American financial aid, including the Marshall Aid plan. However, although Britain is struggling to survive on its own resources, it does not mean that Germany will also rely on British resources to survive, so the negotiations on the occupation costs of the British-American zone of Germany, which will be held in Washington next week, have a significant impact on Britain's American dollar budget.

### Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan Requests Raising Japanese Industrial Standards; Believes Increased Population Necessitates Increased Volume

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The Allied Council for Japan held its 42nd meeting on the 1st, at which Chairman and US Representative Sebald reported on the current state of Japanese industrial production. The main points are as follows: The production index has gradually increased from the lowest point in the autumn of 1945, and has now recovered to 45% of the average base from 1930 to 1934. The population has increased by 20%, so the level in these five years is an underestimate of the current peacetime needs. The wartime peak production index was approximately twice that of 1934. The main obstacle to production is the shortage of coal. Coal production has recently averaged 2.2 million tons per month, while the average minimum peacetime demand is over 3 million tons per month. Steel production has recently recovered to 90,000 tons of steel ingots per month from zero when Japan surrendered, which is one-third of the minimum demand. The fiber industry is the central hub of the Japanese economy. Silk production is more than double that of the early part of 1946, but it is only one-sixth of the 1930 level. There is great hope for the necessary raw material imports in the coming year. The recovery of Japanese industrial production can only be achieved after the conclusion of a peace treaty and the resumption of peacetime trade. Japanese industrial production must exceed the level of 1930 to 1934.

Approximately half of the senators at the meeting stated that "the petition has aroused the sympathy of the Japanese people for the Ryukyuans," but the majority opinion at the meeting favored resolving this issue in accordance with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.

### Truman Sincerely Appeals for National Food Conservation

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 1st Radio: Washington News, the newly established US Citizens' Food Committee held its first meeting today. President Truman attended in person to deliver a speech, in which he said: The United States must suppress prices and conserve food waste in order to help the hungry people abroad. In order to relieve the food panic that Europe will face this winter, the United States must save 100 million bushels of grain. If the American people can all understand the urgent need for relief in other countries and unanimously implement conservation, then the amount to be saved by each person is actually very small. In the coming months, if every American can save one bushel of grain, the entire relief plan can be realized. According to general estimates, 10% of the daily food purchased by the American people is wasted, and this phenomenon must be corrected. In addition, domestic prices must be suppressed, otherwise it will lower the living standards of the American people and cause the current prosperity to disappear.

### City General Labor Union Emergency Meeting; Discusses Reasons for Particularly Low Index; Demands Supplementary Coal Balls and Cooking Oil Compensation

[Our Newspaper Report] Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the City General Labor Union, convened an emergency joint meeting of temporary directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon to discuss the reasons for the particularly low cost of living index in September: It was believed that when compiling the index, prices were surveyed once every Wednesday. There were only four Wednesdays in a month, and the prices on each Wednesday in the past month were relatively stable, which was inevitably inaccurate. Rice, coal balls, and cooking oil, all important daily necessities, are calculated using official ration prices, which has a significant impact on the index, but workers have not yet received coal balls and cooking oil. Resolution: The entire standing committee of the General Labor Union, together with five representatives including Sun Jinghu, Lin Chunting, Yao Ligen, Weng Shanhe, and Ni Xuanqing, will visit Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to request supplementary distribution of coal balls, cooking oil, and other rationed items to compensate for the losses in the cost of living index. As for how to improve the compilation of the cost of living index, the General Labor Union will hire experts to study and advise the municipal government, so that the cost of living index is not too far from actual prices. Regarding the communist bandits' incitement of labor unrest in the city, the authorities have arrested them separately. The General Labor Union will publish a letter to all workers in the city, hoping that all workers in the city will be secure in their current jobs. The General Labor Union will protect good workers. If there are any requests or opinions, they must be submitted through legal procedures. Do not lightly believe in rumors and act rashly.

### Prostitute Business Not Good: Brothel Owner Seeks Death in Her Room

[Report from this Newspaper] At midnight yesterday morning, a female guest secretly took a large dose of sleeping pills in Room 253 of the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road in Shanghai. Fortunately, she was discovered by a waiter and rushed to the hospital, where she was saved. It is reported that the female guest's name is Ma Cuiying, from Ningbo, 28 years old, residing at No. 10, Lane 65, Shantou Road. She runs the Tianchan Brothel, where she keeps several adopted daughters. Because the prostitution business has been slow, and expenses are high, she has been losing money day by day. A few days ago, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, in order to make up for the losses, she approached relatives and friends to raise funds and repainted the room in the hope of offsetting her debts with the profits. However, things did not go as planned, and business was not good, so she suddenly had the thought of ending her life.

### Apprentice Unaware of the Dangers of the World: Careless Money Escort Suffers Theft

[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kangshen Zhuang at No. 4, Lane 109, Zhejiang Middle Road, Shanghai, sent apprentice Chai Jiangshui (17 years old, from Ningbo) yesterday morning to escort 38 million yuan in cash to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road. After arriving at the bank, Chai saw that there were many people escorting money, and most of the money he was carrying was in small denominations, so counting would take time. He was afraid that the store would blame him, so he asked another unknown person who was also escorting money to take care of it for him. Then he went to the bank's public telephone room to make a call. When Chai returned to the escorting area after talking on the phone, all the cash had disappeared, and the person who was supposed to be watching it had also disappeared. In a fit of anxiety and crying, he was accompanied by a bank employee to report the incident to the Huangpu Police Department. As a result, Hui Bingsheng (from Wuxi) was arrested and confessed to the theft, but the stolen money had been taken away by his accomplice, Wang A'gen, who lived at No. 187, Madang Road. Wang was arrested at the address, and 36.34 million yuan of stolen money was found in the room.

### A Trip to Haiyan

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, September 29th Dispatch] Crossing mountains and Hangzhou, on the way to Haiyan, this is approaching

the edge of the seawall.

The reporter has been here many times and has even had a car accident and been injured. Strangely, this time the road is so flat. The driver who came with me also said this is the best road since the war. Arriving at the edge of Haiyan city, we made a special trip to the Tide Watching Pavilion in Haiyan for a patrol. Outside the stone embankment, there was a stretch of yellow sand. The magnificent sight of the tide like ten thousand horses galloping in the past cannot be seen outside Haiyan city anymore. I also thought of the desolate scene in Haiyan city that I couldn't bear to see again, but Mr. Tian insisted that I accompany him to see it. As soon as we arrived in the city, it was still ruins and rubble. The Haiyan county government doesn't seem to know what it's planning to do. The provincial government and the special commissioner have repeatedly ordered the restoration of governance, but there is still no sign of it. Then from

Haiyan to Haiyan Salt Fields

Along the way, engineers and masters constantly got out of the car to ask the road maintenance team and check the bridges. They were really busy. I heard that each worker in the road maintenance team only receives 240,000 yuan in salary per month, and food alone costs 200,000 yuan. Most of these road maintenance workers came here to avoid military service due to the draft. Some people even brought money from home. As we traveled, it suddenly started to rain. The engineers worked in the rain. They asked this and that for the safety of the passengers, which was really touching. The car slid past the sea. The road was a little bumpy. Mr. Xu Huijun told the reporter that this section of the road still needs to be repaired. Along the way, looking at the sea on the right, we also saw the salt fields by the sea. Mr. Tian was here for the first time and was very interested. That night, we stayed at the Haifeng Hotel in Zhapu, which is famous in Jiangnan for its guerrilla warfare, opened by

Double Gun Eighth Sister

It is said that Ms. Wang also has a hotel in Huangshan. Mr. Tian was inspired by poetry and recited many poems and lyrics. The next day, the reporter and Mr. Tian went for a walk on the street. Most of the shops here sell salted dried goods, and there is also fresh jellyfish for sale. We walked to the seaside and saw the seagoing ships with their high bows and sterns, and the endless sea, singing loudly. The strong ocean atmosphere made us children who grew up in the plains and rural areas feel happy.

We walked to the end of Zhapu town and saw a

broken bunker.

Looking further ahead, it looked like we had arrived at the battlefield of the Zhili-Anhui War. The large stone slabs were destroyed and scattered in disarray. This bunker had three cannons facing the sea, but the gun carriages of two of the iron cannons were gone, and their bodies were covered in thick rust. One cannon was relatively intact, but it was also heavily rusted. The cannons did not have ammunition transport tunnels, so the shells probably had to be loaded from the muzzle. There were no sights either. These three cannons were products of the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau in the year Jia Shen of Guangxu (1884). We felt that such things should be well preserved abroad. But we tolerate their abandonment, which is a real pity. We also looked at several mountain peaks in the distance, all of which had gun emplacements and military works. But if they are also abandoned like this bunker, then what else can we say?

Zhapu and Ganpu

The area between the two can be said to be the best harbor. The vast expanse of seawater is really pleasing. Then we went to Huangshan, which is also a summer resort in summer. Many foreigners come here. It is said that at that time, the cars on the road were simply lined up one after another, which shows the grandeur of the scene. Most of the houses on the mountain are simple, and the facilities are not very good. At the foot of the mountain, there is a river, and some grass sheds are built on the river. It is said that this is a simple seawater bathing place, and the grass sheds are changing rooms. Facing Huangshan, there are three small islands. The one on the left is lush with trees. Huangshan and these three small islands can be developed to attract many tourists.

We then drove forward, which was a section of highway still under construction. The machines were running non-stop. When we arrived at Jin Sinianling, Director Liang and Mr. Tian wanted to go to Shanghai, so they let the reporter and Director Xu return to Hangzhou. Before leaving, they all told the reporter that by the end of September, that is, the time to watch the tide, this road could be safely open to traffic.

Hangzhou Bay, with its rich scenery, is indeed a place worth developing. Now the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau wants to make Hangzhou Bay navigable, which has taken a step forward in realizing the ideal of developing Hangzhou Bay. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Naming Incidents in Hong Kong: A stall vendor dares to name himself Wang Yunwu; A bold prostitute jokes with the judge.

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong, 28th Dispatch] A young man picked up a bottle of nitric acid and splashed it on the face of a female tour guide, and as a result, he was taken to court. When the judge asked his name, he replied, "Zhang Yuxiang!" There is a small stall in Wan Chai Steele Road, with a white cloth and black characters, which says: "Wang Yunwu sharpens razors and scissors."

Hong Kong people do not know whether it is out of curiosity or to join in the fun, recently they have "stolen" the names of famous people in the mainland. Some prostitutes who were arrested by the police and fined for "obstructing the street" were even more blatant in joking with the judge. One prostitute was arrested three times in a month. The first time she called herself "Yuan Wang Xia" (Wronged Xia), the second time she called herself "Duo Luo Xia" (Fallen Xia), and the third time she called herself "Zhe Jie Xia" (Broken Xia). The translator translated them into English as usual, and the judge listened and recorded them as usual. As a result, the bold prostitute deceived them! However, not every case is so confused.

A few days ago, General Huang Qiang's son ran over a woman in Kowloon while driving. The newspaper reported that he was General Huang Guangshuo's son. The latter was innocent and suffered for nothing, so the newspaper published a correction.

### Banquet for Zhang Fakui, Cen Weixiu Accompanying

A few days ago, Guangzhou Executive Yuan Director General Zhang Fakui came to Hong Kong to report for duty. At the welcome banquet hosted by the Chinese and Western Chamber of Commerce, according to a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper, "Cen Weixiu of the Overseas Chinese Daily was invited to accompany him." General Zhang once issued an order to arrest Cen Weixiu last year. This arrest warrant has not yet been publicly revoked. How did a "prisoner" become a "guest of honor"! Although it is said that the "Cen Weixiu" at the banquet and the "Cen Weixiu" in the arrest warrant are two different people, is it the same person? This has to be said to be a special manifestation of the recent "naming incidents" in Hong Kong, but this joke seems to be getting bigger and bigger! (Special Correspondent Zijian)

### Construction Fund of 600 Million Allocated to Nanchang Municipal Government, Designated for Transportation, Education, etc.

[Our Newspaper Nanchang, September 26th Dispatch] The central government approved a construction fund of 600 million yuan for Jiangxi this year. Governor Wang Lingji now believes that if the funds are distributed to various counties, the amount obtained will be very small and will not help. Therefore, he decided to use the funds in a centralized manner and allocated them to the Nanchang Municipal Government as a construction fund for building Nanchang into a model city, and designated them for transportation, education, and public health. The municipal government now plans to use 200 million yuan for repairing the five main roads such as Xiangshan and Fushan, 200 million yuan for repairing primary schools in the urban area, and another 200 million yuan for building the city's main sewers and public toilets. However, it is heard that the funds allocated by the central government will be distributed in installments from this month to September next year.

### Monks of Tianchi Temple in Lushan Discover Iron Tiles

[Our Newspaper Nanchang, September 28th Dispatch] Tianchi Temple in Lushan was built during the Jiading period of the Song Dynasty, destroyed by war in the Yuan Dynasty, and rebuilt in the sixth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty. It was covered with iron tiles and赐 with a bronze bell, elephant skin drum, and Wujin Prince statue, more than six inches long. There were two large Buddhas and many small Buddhas inside, all cast in copper. Later, it was destroyed by fire, and the iron tiles and bronze bell were mostly buried and disappeared. Recently, the monks of the temple discovered several iron tiles while digging in the soil. According to general research, they are indeed antiques from the Ming Dynasty and are now treasured in the temple. This summer, when President Jiang was stationed in Guling, he visited the temple and, together with his wife, examined the posthumous portrait of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty and the iron tiles, and gained a lot of knowledge. According to the monks, the original Wujin Prince and other objects are now gone. Even these iron tiles can be regarded as treasures.

### The Draft Law is Disregarded: Township Chiefs Arbitrarily Deduct and Coerce; Magistrate of Jiangyin Ordered to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin, September 29th Dispatch] Cai Runqi, commander of the Wuxi Garrison District, said that when he held individual talks with the 43 new recruits from the first company of new recruits and company commander Yang Yixin, eight people, including Cheng Hantang from Shanzheng Township, complained that they were not volunteers or draftees. Because they could not afford the family settlement fee, they were forced into the army by the township chief, and the amount of family settlement fee they received was too different from the amount of 10 million per person. Liu Qingzhi only received 600,000, Cheng Motang received eight dou of rice, Wang Jiuhang received 600,000, Teng Dan'guan received 600,000, Zhang Jinrong received 200,000, Li Rulin received eight dou of rice, Lu Wu'gao of Xieqiao received 1.02 million, and Hong Xing received 1.11 million yuan. Company Commander Yang believed that the matter concerned military service laws, so he wrote a simple confession record and submitted it to Commander Cai. Commander Cai specially telegraphed Magistrate Xu to thoroughly investigate the truth. Magistrate Xu has been ordered to check the roster of draftees and summon the township chiefs to the case for investigation.

### Pinghu County Grain Bureau Strictly Prohibits Advance Purchase and Sale of Rice Seedlings

### Haiyan Osmanthus Tide

### Gaochun Election Office Established

According to the statistics of the number of people registered and reported by each township, the total number in the county is about 130,000.

### Guangzhou Bans Dancing: No Problems in Implementation; No Impact on Tax Revenue; Austerity Should Start with Diet

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, September 27th Dispatch] The ban on dancing in Guangzhou has not caused a big reaction. There are more than ten dance halls here, with a total of one or two thousand dancers and employees. The Social Affairs Bureau said that the city's decision to ban dancing will be implemented from October 1st. If the measures promulgated by the central government have not been received, a temporary single law for implementation will first be drafted to ensure that commercial dancing is completely banned from October 1st. However, the dancers do not seem to have any opinions, and there is no sign that they are preparing to petition the municipal government. This is not because they have a law-abiding spirit, but because they all have their own ways. The dance hall owners have long been prepared to organize

black market dance halls

using the name of a social club or an alumni association to take advantage of the opportunity to open dance parties that are nominally non-commercial but actually commercial. Business can be done as usual, and taxes can be exempted. This is of course the best wishful thinking. For the dancers, there is even less of a problem. Those who have a way have successively transferred to Hong Kong and Macau to implement expansion in other places. Earning Hong Kong dollars is of course several times better than earning national currency! Even if they stay here temporarily, they can also switch to singing or working as waitresses in restaurants, and their income will not be less. Although some people predict that the number of private prostitutes will definitely increase after the ban on dancing, this is a matter for later. In short, the implementation of the ban on dancing in Guangzhou is absolutely no problem, and the people in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau have also said so.

Will the dance ban have an impact on municipal tax revenue? The authorities replied: "Absolutely no impact." This is indeed an honest statement, because municipal taxes

monthly income

the largest of which, taking August as an example, in addition to business tax, is slaughter tax and banquet tax. The slaughter tax revenue totaled more than 640 million yuan, and the banquet tax was more than 410 million yuan. Although the total amount of entertainment tax was more than 450 million yuan, this includes theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment taxes. The amount of revenue from dance halls is actually a very small number. Therefore, it is absolutely credible to say that there is no impact on tax revenue. However, another problem arises here: is the ban on dancing really able to fulfill the task of austerity? This is really questionable in Guangzhou. We can see from the tax revenue figures listed above that the consumption of Guangzhou people in dance halls is probably limited, while consumption on food is a huge number. The number of large teahouses and restaurants in Guangzhou is the highest among other cities in the country. This can be used as a new explanation for "Eating in Guangzhou." Moreover, every large restaurant must have

beautifully dressed

waitresses. The success or failure of a restaurant depends on whether the waitresses are beautiful and whether they can cater to customers. It can be seen that some people do not necessarily go to restaurants for food. The so-called "the old drunkard's intention is not in the wine," and their consumption in restaurants is actually dozens of times more than in dance halls. Therefore, if we want to vigorously implement austerity in Guangzhou, we still have to think about ways to do it in terms of diet in order to achieve practical results.

### Embezzlement Case on Yuehan Railway: 80 Tons of Cotton Yarn Smuggled: 300 Million Yuan in Handling Fees Illegally Collected: Principal Offender Li Wentao to be Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper Changsha, October 1st Dispatch] The embezzlement case on the Yuehan Railway in Changsha has been investigated and found that the accommodation of packages from Hunan merchants is still limited. The reason for the accusations from all parties is the smuggling of cotton yarn transported by Kong Xiangxiao of the Transportation Section. Kong was allocated a large batch of cotton yarn in Shanghai to aid the raw materials of the yarn mills in South China. In November, 880 tons were transported from Shanghai to Wuhan. Under the difficulty of waiting for thousands of tons of goods to be transported south, thanks to the power of wealthy capital, one carriage was dispatched daily from early June, totaling 17 carriages (capacity 40 tons). All of them arrived in Changsha in late June. Unexpectedly, when transferring from Changsha to Guangzhou, the railway bureau doubled the freight rate. After the Kong family specially dispatched personnel to mediate, all 680 tons of goods were calculated at the freight rate before the price increase. However, the actual Kong family's agent gave the station a handling fee that exceeded the freight rate. Therefore, the amount of embezzlement was more than 3 billion. Li Wenqing, the head of the Transportation Section, the principal offender, has confessed after being interrogated several times by the Changsha District Court Procuratorate and will soon be prosecuted.

Yarn Prices Rebound: Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, while manufacturers were unwilling to sell easily. As a result, closing prices generally rose. After measuring, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rebounded by 450,000 yuan from the previous day to 25.65 million yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 200,000 yuan, and Light Change Horse rose by 500,000 yuan. 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns were selling more quickly, with prices remaining stable. Most other brands of coarse and fine yarns saw more gains than losses.

Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises:

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw continued price declines due to tight credit, leading to more selling to settle accounts. Fine Longtou cloth briefly fell to 615,000 yuan. Subsequently, with absorption from dyeing factories and buyers, Fine Longtou cloth recovered to 639,000 yuan, a rise of 19,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortunes Blue Chicken Colored Ball and other cloths also rose by 5,000 to 23,000 yuan. Serge Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance and Four Gentlemen were in high demand, rising by 10,000 to 23,000 yuan. Bleached cloth declined, while Shilin coarse cloth and printed cloth remained strong.

Cotton Weakens:

Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained weak. Tight credit among industry players dampened enthusiasm for buying, leading to a soft trend. Increased selling to settle accounts caused prices to decline further slightly, and trading was sparse. Total daily transactions amounted to over 700 bales and another 1,000 dan. Factory prices opened at 2.8 million for Fire Machine, and 2.85 million for Fu Taicang, with 1,000 dan changing hands. Stacking prices were 3.3 million for Lingbin, and credit prices were 3.35 million and 3.39 million. Han fine cotton was 3.18 million, and Shashi cotton was 3.18 million and 3.2 million, with over 700 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 500,000.

### Export Tea Trading Sparse

Yesterday, the tea market saw continued inquiries from local merchants and buyers for various domestic teas, keeping the market relatively active and prices stable. As for export tea varieties, sellers had intentions to raise prices, but buyers were hesitant due to unfavorable prices in foreign markets. Therefore, they were unwilling to buy at high prices, resulting in limited trading and a stagnant trend at market close.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the sugar market saw prices weaken due to transportation disruptions from the north, leading to sluggish sales. The guild's assessment for spot goods was just over 20,000 yuan for medium white sugar, ranging from 790,000 to 795,000 yuan. Combined red sugar was 800,000 yuan, and four-and-a-half white sugar was 880,000 to 945,000 yuan. Shantou tea remained stable, ranging from 690,000 to 695,000 yuan, and cotton red sugar was 727,000 to 725,000 yuan, totaling over 100 bales. Xinghua white sugar was a little over 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, ranging from 770,000 to 780,000 yuan. Barrel packaging ranged from 700,000 to 750,000 yuan. Xing red sugar was a little over 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, ranging from 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, totaling around 400 pieces. Diao Qing was quoted at a little over 10,000 yuan, but no transaction occurred.

Hardware Prices Soar:

Nails are jumping again and again. Sandpaper has doubled in price in two weeks. Items such as varnish, hinges, leather belt buckles, and Three Stars steel saw blades are rising without limit daily. The increase in foreign exchange rates and smooth sales are the biggest reasons for the price surge.

### Bank Clearings Ease Credit

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, state-owned banks cleared out 148 billion yuan at the clearing house, easing credit conditions. However, the implicit interest rate remained at 2.2 cents, and many outside the Chinese stock market were paying 3 cents in interest. In the detailed clearing figures, the Central Bank cleared out 100 million yuan, agencies cleared in 35.3 billion yuan, foreign banks cleared in 15.1 billion yuan, agencies cleared out 35.6 billion yuan, and other banks included the Bank of China clearing out 2.3 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications clearing out 19.5 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank of China clearing in 4.7 billion yuan, the China Trust clearing in 2.6 billion yuan, the Postal Remittances clearing out 6.3 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury clearing in 6.2 billion yuan.

### Import Tax on Fuel Oil: All Increased by 50% Ad Valorem

[Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that the import tax on gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil has been uniformly increased to 50% ad valorem. Crude oil is temporarily exempt from import tax. Item 529 of the Import Tariff is amended as follows: A. Diesel oil with a specific gravity of 0.83 or higher at 20 degrees Celsius and a flash point (according to the Crepe method) of 85 degrees Celsius or higher, containing no more than 80% kerosene.

B.2 Crude oil (specific gravity of 0.83 or higher at 20 degrees Celsius, containing more than 3% light distillate when distilled at 150 degrees Celsius, and with a viscosity exceeding 2 degrees on an Engler viscometer at 20 degrees Celsius). The new regulations will take effect from October 1st of this year. In other news, Jianghai Customs will be closed for one day on Double Tenth National Day.

### Executive Yuan Approves Bank Closure and Liquidation

It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Finance to revise the "Points for Attention" into "Measures for Bank Closure and Liquidation," with slight revisions to the articles. The measures are recorded as follows:

Article 1: When a bank is closed and liquidated, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures, in addition to the company's handling procedures.

Article 2: The liquidator of a bank, whether determined by the shareholders' resolution or elected by the shareholders' meeting, shall be a legally practicing certified public accountant. If a shareholder or director serves as the liquidator, a certified public accountant shall also be selected to serve as a liquidator. The liquidators listed in the preceding two paragraphs shall report the date of their assumption of office to the court and the Ministry of Finance for record within the prescribed time limit.

Article 3: If a liquidator cannot be selected in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, the Ministry of Finance may petition the court to appoint a liquidator.

Article 5: The liquidator shall open a special account in the Central Bank of China in Fudi for the cash held in the bank's vault, the various receivables recovered, the funds transferred from interbank accounts, and the value of the property, and deposit them at any time for withdrawal and payment of liabilities. The check for withdrawal must be signed by the accountant serving as the liquidator.

Article 6: The liquidator shall, as soon as possible, completely repay all the deposits and remittances received by the bank within three months from the date of liquidation.

### Reader's Mailbox: A University Student's Plight After a Breakup - The Woman Abandons Their Old Love Due to Parental Opposition

Dear Editor: Enduring extremely negative emotions, I am writing this letter to you. I don't know if I should be doing this, but I have done it anyway, and I am very sorry. The facts of the matter are as follows: Last summer, I came from the distant Northeast to Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the country. I spent a great deal of effort to enter a national university and began my university life. Two months after entering school, I met a female classmate. In terms of academics, character, and manners, she met the standards of my ideal partner. We attended classes, experiments, and games together every day, and our friendship deepened day by day. Of course, a pair of young men and women in their youth are easily drawn into the whirlpool of love if they have shared interests. Naturally, we were no exception. Gradually, friendship turned into love, and we swore to each other that we would be able to grow old together.

This summer, I returned to the North during the summer vacation, and she also returned to her home in Sichuan. Things often change unexpectedly. I can't believe that in the short span of two months, our love would suffer such a serious blow. At the end of the summer vacation, I returned to Shanghai, and she sent me a letter from Sichuan, the gist of which was that her parents opposed our marriage. She said that our previous agreement was no longer possible to fulfill! I don't believe that a sane woman would so easily bow down to old traditions. I don't believe that a woman who once loved me would say such a thing to me. After receiving her letter, my spirit suffered a great blow. I felt that life was empty, and I became pessimistic about everything. Now she has come to Shanghai, and we are still classmates, but her attitude towards me has completely changed. She rarely talks to me and always tries to avoid me.

Sir, you must be able to imagine how I have been living these days? My academic performance has declined significantly, and I often use alcohol and tobacco to numb myself. Although I know it is harmful to me, I cannot extricate myself! Today I am writing this letter to you, hoping that you can give me some guidance so that I can find some meaning in life. Sincerely wishing you well, Xu Yi respectfully.

### A Brief History of Chinese Buddhism

— Lin Ye

(Compiled by释印顺 and 妙钦, published by大法轮画局, 36th year of the Republic, price 6,000 yuan)

"China's problem today is the problem of overall cultural renewal. In this overall renewal, the renewal of religious thought and religious life, I think, is the most fundamental and far-reaching work. ... If religious renewal is a necessary task in the rebirth of Chinese culture, then the Buddhist—the mainstream of Chinese religious tradition—reform movement is undoubtedly worthy of warm welcome and support from enlightened people in society."

—From Mr. Lin Tongji's preface to the book

This is a thin "Brief History of Buddhism" (only eighty or ninety pages), not a grand and extraordinary work. But it has its own unique characteristics, so it is still worth introducing here.

Studying Chinese Buddhist history is different from studying general history: First, one must be able to fully recognize the history of Buddhism's transmission and evolution in India. Second, one must have a fairly deep understanding of all of Shakyamuni's teachings. This should be an obvious fact.

The author of this book, Dharma Master Yinshun, has achieved great success in the study of Indian Buddhism. Those who have read "Indian Buddhism" and "In Search of the Source of Consciousness-Only Studies" will know this, so there is no need to elaborate here. I would like to quote a paragraph from the preface to "In Search of the Source of Consciousness-Only Studies" to show the close relationship between Chinese and Indian Buddhism and the author's historical perspective:

"In the development of Indian Mahayana Buddhism, there are two major schools of idealism: the True Mind School and the False Mind School. When they were transmitted to China, they became the Three Schools of the Treatise on the Land, the Treatise on the Compendium, and the Treatise on Consciousness-Only. These two major schools, the True Mind School, developed from the Mahasamghika-Ekavyavaharikas of eastern India; the False Mind School came from the Sarvastivada of western India... The classics of the East are always the pioneers of the times. The teachers of the West received the inspiration of their ideas, gave them rigorous speculation, and somewhat modified them. This kind of Eastern and Western Indian style is different; not only in the third period of idealism Buddhism, but also in the first two periods of Buddhism, there are such situations."

In this book, the characteristics of this "regional culture" are described in more detail. We only need to look at the titles of the four chapters in its eight chapters of the main text, which emphatically show spatiality, to understand. The table of contents of the whole book is as follows: Introduction, The Introduction of Buddhism to China; The Great Way Travels South; Southern Dynasty Buddhism, Sailing Smoothly; The Establishment of Idealism; The Body of Buddhism in the Central Plains; The Growth of New Buddhism; North, South, West, East and China; Buddhism in Flat Flow and Ups and Downs; "Change" can be regarded as a conclusion of this book.

In addition, there are many places in the content that refer to the "close relationship between time and space." To name a few: "The Buddhism of the Southern Dynasty for hundreds of years has undergone four changes from north to south... The South takes Wonderful Being as the ultimate, but it runs parallel with True Emptiness and reverses the slow rise of idealism. It is very different from the theory of constant idealism in the North (pp. 25-26). Although the study of the South is based on True Constancy and Wonderful Being, it can actually integrate the academic traditions from the Jin Dynasty; its metaphysical thinking is profound, which is beyond the reach of Northern studies. However, in terms of the integration of words and deeds, the Guanzhong and Luoyang areas used to emphasize the management of things and meritorious service, and the Jiangdong area emphasized strictness and aloofness. Measuring Southern Dynasty Buddhism with this standard, it is rather lacking in substance. The people of the North are simple and honest, and metaphysical theory is not their strength. They are mostly engaged in the study of things and images, and in diligent practice: such as the stone carvings of Yungang in Datong and Longmen in Yique, Luoyang... The grandeur and solemnity of its architecture and sculpture cannot be compared to the Southern Dynasty. Southern Chan is centered on Hengyue in Hunan, Nanchang in Jiangxi, and Anji in Anhui. It either moves southeast and enters the mountainous areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and northern Guangdong, or travels northwest, crosses the Yangtze River from Fengzhou, goes north to Jing, Li, and Nanyang, and transforms and practices in the He and Luo regions. Buddhism inherits the fate of unification, and the boundary between politics and the north and south is mutually exchanged. The Sui and Tang politics took the North to govern the South, while in academics, the North was Sinicized. In the past, the Five Barbarians rebelled when the Jin Dynasty declined, and Buddhism went south; now, with the decline of the Tang Dynasty, the Five Dynasties rebelled, and Buddhism went north. From then on, the center of Buddhism has always been in the South." Mr. He Changqun said: "The study of history must first determine the time and space relationship of historical events, and then the concept of historical evolution will be clear and free from vagueness." (Preface to the Chinese Historical Reference Atlas) It can fully prove that this view is correct.

The outline of the whole book is briefly described in the "Introduction":

Chinese Buddhism, which has been popular for nearly 1,900 years, can be said to have received from India: The Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties transmitted equivalent to the middle period of Buddhism in India; the Northern and Southern dynasties to the Northern Song transmitted equivalent to the later period of Buddhism in India. From the perspective of popularity in China, it can also be divided into two periods: "First, from the Han and Wei dynasties to the Sui and Tang dynasties, it was a period of receiving speculation (approximately biased towards saying). Translating and thinking about it, organizing it, its characteristic is to integrate and summarize. If it is obtained, it will be magnificent and magnificent, but if it is lost, it will be cumbersome and trivial, like a son of a noble family. The one who established the style of this generation is Shi Daoan of Xiangyang. Second, from the Li Tang dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, it was a period of continuing honest practice. That is, to practice and prove what you know, its characteristic is simplicity and practicality. If it is obtained, it will be simple and sincere, but if it is lost, it will be simple, crude, and poor, like a farmer. The one who established the style of this generation is the monk Yan Neng of Lingnan. The Buddhism of speculation and summarization was initially only a taste of "emptiness of nature"; then it differentiated into the "wonderful being of true emptiness" in the south and the "true constant idealism" in the north; to the extreme, it became the splendor of the Eight Schools of Mahayana. The Buddhism of honesty practice and simplicity initially inherited various schools and was hidden as two schools, namely the "wonderful being of true emptiness" of the Tiantai School and the "true constant idealism" of the Chan School; to the extreme, it became a mixture of Chan, Teaching, Discipline, and Pure Land" (pp. 1-2). Chinese Buddhism has a long history, and it is no longer just Buddhism that is popular in China, but it has become Buddhism that belongs to China.

In the current situation of extreme scarcity of books on the history of Buddhism, this book is well worth reading. However, it is not without merit; because this is a brief "historical outline," the author seems to be trying to save words, citing many "original texts" or ancient book "idioms." First, the source is not indicated, and second, the method of translating ancient Chinese into modern Chinese is not used - indicating "modern language"; this is inevitably inconvenient for beginners to read. If I am not mistaken, I hope that it can be considered and remedied in the future when it is re-printed! It will be more ideal than it is now.

### Pilgrimage on Foot - Bin Zhi

— Written by Ye Qiuyuan

Published by the Shanghai Zhitian Translation Institute in Beiping

"Pilgrimage on Foot" is a work by Mr. Ye Qiuyuan recording his travels in Europe and the United States. In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye went abroad to investigate the cultural undertakings of Catholicism, passing through India, the United States, the British Isles, and Rome, circling the globe for over a year. At that time, the war was still raging, and there were scars of war everywhere, so what he saw and experienced was different from peacetime. Religious people have always advocated peace, and the cultural undertakings run by Catholicism in various places are spreading the seeds of peace, but how much they harvest is not very obvious on weekdays, but it is easier to know the effectiveness of them during the war.

This book adopts the style of travel notes, but Mr. Ye's trip was mainly to investigate the cultural undertakings of Catholicism, so what he paid attention to was naturally focused on this aspect. Therefore, what this book records is mainly about Catholicism, and the scenery and culture of various places are only the background of the church's activities. Originally, religion has a global nature, but the customs and habits of various places are different, and religious activities must also vary according to the environment of each place. Catholicism has spread to every corner of the world, and the cultural and publishing undertakings it runs have achieved remarkable results. This cannot but be attributed to the bishops and priests of Catholicism in various places who are good at using the local environment. The book speaks very detailed about this point.

The whole book is divided into fifty-one sections, excluding the introduction. Four sections record the travel situation, two sections talk about the Catholic situation in India, twenty-one sections record the churches in various parts of the Americas, nineteen sections record the Catholic activities in the British Isles, and five sections talk about the pilgrimage in Rome. Mr. Ye likes to explore religious principles from a cultural point of view, so he traces the origin of everything he saw along the way that is related to the evolution of Catholicism. In the United States, he discovered the route of Catholicism's transmission from the Old Continent to the New Continent, and the process of its development in the Americas. In the United Kingdom, he traced the evolution of Catholicism in the British Isles. In India, although it is the birthplace of Buddhism, Catholicism also has many believers, and he pointed out the special undertakings of Eastern Catholicism. The Vatican in Rome is the holy land of Catholicism, and there are more relics there to promote the transcendence and holiness of Catholicism. Therefore, from this book, you can learn about the past evolution of Catholicism, the process of its transmission in various places, how to establish many great undertakings, and the relationship with the cultural development of various places.

This book is not only a book of travel notes, we can also regard it as "The History of the Spread of Catholicism" and read it as a department of cultural history. Catholicism has had a long history in China, and the churches in various places have done many sacred undertakings. We already know a little about the spread of Catholicism in China, but we are mostly isolated from the situation in other parts of the world. This book can be used to understand the cultural activities of Catholicism in various parts of the world in concise and easy-to-read words.

### "Talks on Domestic Science"

— By Meng Kun, Translated by Song Yi, Author: Fabre

One of the Kai Ming Youth Series

Some scholars often become famous for the main subject they study, and the author of this book is an example. J.H. Fabre was a French entomologist and a popular science writer. He gained more fame from the latter than from the former. He has countless readers of all ages, from different languages and skin colors. Like Professor Hayden, his name is also familiar to us. Many of his pamphlets have long been translated and circulated among children and adults. He was the only scholar before Hayden who could instill common sense of popular science into people. He just wrote in a more popular, vivid, and understandable way, and it was easier to accept and more relevant to daily life.

As a popular reading material, it is particularly difficult to write in some aspects compared to specialized works. It needs to be lively and not dry; step-by-step, from shallow to deep; related to life and for practical use; clever, interesting, and attractive. Fabre is not only an expert in these aspects but also a pioneer. Some recent children's or youth readings are mixed with stories and characters, extracting the true face of various sciences through the words of a character. That method was invented by Fabre. The "Uncle Paul" in this book has become a symbol of wisdom, explaining to his nephews喻兒 or 愛密兒 and niece克萊兒 or 瑪莉 the incomprehensible events they encounter in their daily lives; in this way, the reader unknowingly and orderly accepts "Uncle Paul's" tireless instruction. How clever it is to turn dryness into vividness, using examples, speculation, metaphors, and science common sense, all covered with a harmonious coat, making it accessible to everyone. Reading this book is like having a conversation, like listening to a poet lyrically chanting. What you read is not equations, not laws, not conjectures or theories, but just beautiful prose and charming essays.

This book is more practical and closely related to people's daily lives than the author's other works. It is divided into fifty-three chapters, each ranging from three thousand to five thousand words, individually analyzing an event until the reader has a comprehensive understanding; each chapter forms a separate paragraph, and there are clues connecting it to the previous two chapters. The arrangement is very clear, the layout is very reasonable, and the connection is very orderly.

The first thirteen chapters are about clothing, talking about various commonly seen fabrics from yarn, silk, wool, linen, and velvet, as well as some common sense of dyeing and printing, how to weave, how to sew, and general accessories to clothing, such as safety pins; it is very complete, but not profound, and does not lack anything. The following chapters from fourteen to sixteen discuss "Heat Conduction" and "Human Dwellings" with very simple examples. The next fifteen chapters are about the origins, manufacturing, applications, and properties of daily necessities. A total of ash, potassium carbonate, soap, matches, charcoal, coal and gas, kerosene, and glass are listed here, and several daily phenomena are analyzed, such as fire, heat, combustion, light, iron and rust, tinplate, and ceramics. Then comes the section on food, which occupies half of the book, all the way to the end, studying sugar, coffee, tea, salt, oil, water, vinegar, bread, rice, and other twenty or thirty items; yet it is patiently and skillfully, not missing any of the points that should be raised, and not tiresomely fatiguing the audience.

For example, when discussing the topic of "Light," Uncle Paul first lists the progress of various methods of fire-making by humans in the dark, talking about the characteristics and shortcomings, economy, and non-economy of each type of fire-making method. Then he talks about the manufacturing process of several kinds of candles. Then he talks about why oil can burn and the general principles of burning to emit light, how to use ventilation to make it brighter, the principles of lamps and the principles of smoke, analyzing so-called lamp wicks, so-called safety lamps, and Mobil lamps, and finally tracing the relationship between air and combustion. What would have required many words to record, Uncle Paul spoke about so briefly; what originally required some cultivation to understand, Uncle Paul wrote so that even old women could understand; what even if understood might not be immediately applicable, Uncle Paul started from practice, not empty.

In short, this book and its sister works are equally beneficial to the public. In terms of form, it is characterized by popularity; in terms of content, it is based on practicality. This is enough to provide the general public with reading material, so that their lives can gradually be changed to be in line with science, so that they can scientifically explain and scientifically deal with various daily encounters, and not rely on traditional superstitions or just wander around in confusion.

Fabre was born in 1823 and died in 1915. Some of the older scientific concepts and scientific views in his books have been supplemented or revised by the translator, and some have been annotated. Books of the same nature as this booklet include "The Story of Science" (translated by Song Yi), "Tales of Chemistry" (translated by Gu Junzheng), and "The Story of Domestic Animals" (translated by Cheng Shaozong), most of which are published by Kaiming, and there are also two or more translations. These books are similar, but "Talks on Domestic Science" is most relevant to the lives of ordinary people. Fabre's most famous immortal masterpiece is "Insect Records," a total of sixteen volumes, unprecedented and unmatched. There is a translation by Wang Dazhong in our country, which is incomplete, and it was published by Commercial Press last year, and can also be read as an interesting common sense reader.

### "Watch on the Rhine"

— By Shi Jimei, Author: Lillian Hellman, Translator: Feng Yidai

Published by: New Masses Publishing House

"Watch on the Rhine" is a work by the American playwright Lillian Hellman in 1944. It was once made into a movie, and when the stage play was performed on Broadway, the New York Times drama critic Atkinson commented: "This is the best work written by Ms. Hellman... It is a very important play. The theatrical world should be proud of this script."

The story takes place in the late spring of 1940, in the countryside of the United States, about twenty miles away from Washington, in the Farrelly's home. The male master,育岌 Farrelly, has passed away. His wife, Fanny, is sixty-three years old this year, and her demeanor is still elegant. She is a nervous woman. Her son David, who is thirty-nine years old, is not yet married, and now gets along well with the lodger Martha Ter Blancowitz. Fanny is very unhappy about this, because Martha is married. Her husband Dirk is a Romanian count, but this aristocratic couple lives in the Farrelly's house, and they are deeply in debt and very poor.

This morning, Fanny is more excited and nervous than usual, because her daughter Sarah, whom she has not seen for twenty years, and son-in-law Kurt Muller, are returning with three children - from troubled Europe.

After twenty years of separation, the reunion of family members is naturally joyous. Fanny is so happy that she even forgets that she vehemently opposed this marriage in the first place; the whole family is very excited. Only the Romanian nobleman named Dirk observes with his sharp eyes, coldly investigating everything. This group of ragged, wandering people, whose children can speak the dialects of many places, Kurt, an engineer, has a gun wound on his face, and the bones of his hands are also broken; what is particularly strange is that their luggage is not locked, but an old briefcase is locked very tightly. Therefore, the count became suspicious, and he began to prepare to seize his target like a vigilant hound at any time and place.

Finally, after ten days, the time is ripe. At first, it is an extremely peaceful twilight, but it gradually becomes tense, because Dirk tells Kurt about a piece of news on the afternoon paper: Max, the leader of the anti-Nazi underground movement in Germany, Colonel Freeden, has been arrested. Max is Kurt's comrade and good friend, so Kurt is leaving. However, the cunning Dirk knows everything. He proposes a deal: ten thousand dollars? Or report to the German embassy? The choice is his. However, Kurt says: his money is public donations, not to buy his life; after a long stalemate, Fanny and David are eager to get rid of this shameless nobleman and are willing to pay the money. When they go upstairs to get the money, Kurt kills Dirk. And he, Kurt Muller, is also leaving tonight, because he is going to create a new ideal world. He kisses the children, and then turns to Sarah, he says: "May the living have the best chance to live. I want to live. I want to live with you."

This is the story of "Watch on the Rhine". With World War II as the background, although the story does not directly write about the reality of the war, the author clearly tells us the great significance of this war, and the sacredness of the war zone workers. And let's look at what Kurt Muller said; "... We say that the world is not good, because there are people starving. Before the world is good, people will steal, lie - kill. But no matter what the reason, who does it... it's all not good. I want you to remember this, no matter who does it, it is a bad thing. But you can all live to see that there will be no more killings in this world, in the whole world, in every place, in every city, there will always be people who are responsible for preventing killings. They need the same as us: to give every child a happy childhood. For my children, I also think about their children, think about it, it will make you happy. In every city, every village, every house in the world, there are always children who are loved, and he will create a good world for him... Everyone in this world can die peacefully in bed..."

As long as there are people alive who are suffering, then we are all guilty. Maybe, it's not our fault, but seeing that the world is still not good, there are still people starving, there are still killings and arson happening, people don't even have the happiness of dying peacefully; children still don't have a happy childhood... Everything, even if it's not our fault, don't we feel ashamed? - This book inspires us living people to have the right to "not suffer," and also to understand how we ourselves are "guilty." To understand that this world should not be so "not good," and to also know that a "good" world is what everyone should strive to create and enjoy fairly.
