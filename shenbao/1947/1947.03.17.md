### Maintaining Traditional Friendship with the US and Strictly Implementing the Sino-Soviet Treaty: Minister Wang Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The first session of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 AM on the 16th. 239 Central Committee members attended. After Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Wu reported on documents, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, stating briefly that the government's foreign policy over the past year had been carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the instructions of the Chairman. He then elaborated on (1) China's relationship with and position in the United Nations, (2) Sino-US relations, (3) Sino-Soviet relations, (4) diplomatic issues with Britain, France, and other countries. The report lasted two hours and the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.

[Another dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang delivered a foreign affairs report at the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 16th, elaborating on major diplomatic events and China's foreign policy over the past year. Before his report, Wang stated that this oral report was a supplement to the written report he submitted to the session and would be limited to a few issues concerning fundamental foreign policy. In his report, Wang clarified China's foreign policy, which can be summarized as supporting and upholding the United Nations organization, maintaining traditional friendship with the United States, strictly implementing the Sino-Soviet treaty with the Soviet Union, and not adopting retaliatory measures against Japan but seeking full military guarantees to prevent it from launching another aggression. Wang first reported on China's relationship with the United Nations, stating that since its establishment in May last year, the UN's organization has become increasingly complete, its power has become increasingly strong, and its status has become extremely important. Wang believes that the United Nations can be expected to develop into an organization for maintaining world peace, because after the war, countries, regardless of size or strength, have a fear of war and urgently hope for the rapid realization of an organization capable of maintaining peace. Wang summarized China's position on the United Nations as advocating for limiting the use of the veto power without amending the UN Charter, promoting international armed forces and disarmament, and constantly urging their early implementation. Wang then reported on Sino-US relations, stating that China's basic policy towards the United States is to maintain the traditional friendship between China and the United States and to develop Sino-US cooperation. He stated that during the past year, General Marshall's mission to China assisted in the repatriation of more than two million Japanese prisoners and residents in China. If these Japanese had not been repatriated on schedule, it would have greatly hindered China's recovery and reconstruction efforts. Wang also reported on the signing of the Sino-US commercial treaty, the issue of the US military advisory group, and the issue of US economic assistance. When discussing Sino-Soviet relations, Wang reviewed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast last year and the government's active preparations for taking over the administrative rights of Lushun and Dalian. Regarding the Moscow Conference, Wang detailed the reasons for his refusal to allow the foreign ministers in Moscow to discuss China's internal affairs in any way, and expressed his belief that the foreign ministers would ultimately respect the Chinese government's position and the sentiments of the Chinese people and cease discussing China's internal affairs. Subsequently, Wang reported on the Japanese issue, stating that China is determined not to adopt a policy of revenge, but in the military sphere, there must be sufficient guarantees to prevent Japan from engaging in aggression again. Finally, Wang reported on the protection of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, and the recent negotiations concerning the Xisha Islands. Regarding Sino-British relations, Wang stated that significant progress has been made recently. The prospects for Sino-Indian diplomatic relations are also very optimistic. Wang's report lasted a total of two hours.

### Proposals on Foreign Affairs Have Been Reviewed and Completed

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Proposals on foreign affairs from the plenary session were reviewed and completed in the review committee on the afternoon of the 16th. According to sources, the main points are as follows: (1) Reaffirming China's determination to uphold and cherish world peace. China's post-war reconstruction depends on international peace and cooperation. China should consistently strive for mutual respect and mutual assistance among friendly countries to eliminate international contradictions. (2) The permanent members of the UN Security Council should strengthen their ties. (3) China, with a friendly attitude and a firm stance, will strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance so that the treaty truly becomes the foundation for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. (4) The sovereignty of member states stipulated in the UN Charter, with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as the basis for world peace, must be implemented. (5) The integrity of territorial sovereignty is what the country sincerely depends on. This party will continue the efforts and maintenance of the national revolution for more than 50 years. (6) This party should express deep sympathy and respect for the movements for national independence around the world, but should do its best to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. (7) Do not adopt a policy of revenge against Japan, but the resurgence of its militaristic aggression should be prevented by cooperation among the Allied nations, and its political democratization should be promoted. As for the heavy losses of life and property suffered by China in Japan's war of aggression, it should be responsible for earnestly compensating for them through just, fair, and legal demands. (8) Under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, international capital and technology cooperation are welcomed.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Central Committee members from various regions who came to Nanjing brought many proposals related to party affairs in various regions.

It is learned that after being sorted out, there are more than 20 other items that are not listed in the five proposals.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Foreign Minister Wang reported at the plenary session's foreign affairs review committee. At 7:00 AM on the 16th, he received a telegram from our ambassador to the Soviet Union, stating that the China issue Marshall mentioned discussing outside the meeting specifically referred to the issue of US jurisdiction over China.

A tank car of kerosene was burned in Shangqiu a few days ago, and a tank car of Western medicine was burned in Daying, both due to prolonged delays in freight transport, resulting in accidents. Many transportation businesses have gone bankrupt.

### Relief Troops and Garrison Troops Joined Forces Yesterday Afternoon, The Siege of Nongan City Completely Lifted, The Communist Army's Fourth Offensive Collapsed Again

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th Urgent Dispatch] The war on the outskirts of Changchun took a sharp turn for the better, and the National Army achieved another victory. The communist troops in the pocket-shaped area around Nongan and between the Chang-Ha lines completely collapsed at dawn on the 16th. The National Army is attacking in multiple directions.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th, 2:00 PM] The fourth offensive launched by Lin Biao's communist troops in Songbei has now been completely defeated. Nongan City, which was besieged for 60 hours from the evening of the 13th, has been relieved. This is the result of General Du Yuming's new command. According to preliminary estimates, the communist troops suffered at least 20,000 casualties. The remaining communist troops are fleeing in all directions north, northwest, and northeast around Nongan. The National Army in Nongan, Dehui, and other places is pursuing and intercepting them in separate ways, continuing to expand the results of the battle.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The communist offensive on the Changtao Line was frustrated. The highway between Changchun and Nongan was completely opened at noon on the 16th. The elite troops of the National Army that reinforced Nongan entered Nongan County at 2:00 PM on the 16th, joining forces with the garrison troops. The threat of Nongan City being surrounded on three sides by heavy communist troops was lifted. It is generally believed that the main battle near Nongan has entered a decisive stage, and the fate of the main force of the communist troops near Liangyimen, 20 li southeast of Nongan, can be determined within 24 hours.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The war at Wanbaoshan in the northwest corner of Changchun has ended. The communist troops, from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and 5th brigades of the East Manchurian Military Region, totaling 30,000, fiercely attacked Wanbaoshan from the 13th. The artillery fire was fierce, and they attacked for three days, but were all severely beaten by the National Army, suffering heavy losses. Before dawn on the 16th, the communist troops made a desperate all-out attack. After the National Army calmly fought back, they were defeated near Xinanhhe. The National Army took advantage of the victory to recover Laochenjiawotun, 25 li northeast of Wanbaoshan, and advanced to 50 li north of Wanbaoshan. Another surrendered brigade commander, Dai Huajin, reinforced the battle at Liangyimen.

Relief Process

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The communist troops who suffered a disastrous defeat in their fourth invasion of the outskirts of Changchun had a total force of about 120,000 people, forming the 1st, 2nd, and 6th communist columns. They crossed the river in five directions from Wujiazhan, Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu on the 8th, with great momentum. The National Army used a small force of several battalions to block their main force at Xiaoshantun, northwest of Dehui, for three days. It was not until 7:00 PM on the 13th that the communist troops from all directions approached the outskirts of Nongan and engaged in pre-war battles with the garrison troops. At 1:00 PM on the 14th, the communist troops bombed Nongan for two hours and then began to attack the city. From dawn on the 15th, the attacks did not cease. The Nongan National Army always firmly defended the city walls and did not retreat a single step. At this time, the new forces of the National Army pre-positioned in the suburbs of Changchun began to attack Nongan to the southeast and south in separate ways. At noon at 12:00, they advanced to Baijiagangzi, Lujiatun, Liangyimen, Qianbian and Dijiawopeng, south of Nongan City. The communist troops resisted with all their might, and the battle was fierce. By midnight at 12:00, the communist troops were gradually unable to support themselves. At dawn today, the National Army inside and outside Nongan City launched another fierce attack, and the communist troops completely collapsed and fled in the wilderness, in an extremely embarrassed state. At noon, the National Army entered Nongan City from Baijiagangzi, Luojiatun, and Liangyimen, and shook hands with the National Army in the city.

[Another dispatch] Thousands of communist troops have surrendered to the National Army in the Nongan area today. In the Battle of Nongan, communist troops were killed everywhere. In the Luojiatun and Liangyimen areas south of the city alone, 1,500 bodies were left behind. Reporters from various newspapers and news agencies here are scheduled to go to the county on the 17th for an on-site inspection.

### The Battle Situation on the Jinpu Line Takes a Sharp Turn for the Better, The National Army Enters Sishui and Tai'an, The Curfew Time in Jinan is Shortened

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The National Army recovered Sishui at 4:00 PM on the 16th, but the fighting in the suburbs is still fierce. Also, Nanxinji, southwest of Sishui, was also recovered by the National Army this afternoon.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The battle for Tai'an is in full swing. Wang Yaowu's troops marched south along the Jinpu Railway and joined forces with the National Army marching north between Wande and Feicheng on the 15th. On the 16th, Wang Yaowu's troops continued to march south and have now crossed Jieshou, flanking Tai'an with the National Army on the west side of the Jinpu Railway. After defeating the resistance of the communist troops, one of the National Army entered Tai'an this afternoon and will join forces with the National Army marching north from Dawenkou within days.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th] There has been no major contact on the outskirts of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang in recent days. The battle in the mountainous area of Mount Tai on the Jinpu Line is continuing. The strength of the communist troops has increased to four divisions and one brigade, with more than 60,000 people. The National Army is strengthening its pressure from west to east. Chen Yi, fearing an attack, has moved his headquarters to the large mining area near Zichuan. At the same time, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government has also moved to Shantouzhuang, east of Zichuan.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th] The situation in Jinan has eased. Starting from the 16th, the curfew time, which originally started at 8:00 PM, has been changed to 9:00 PM. When things were tense last month, the business corps members who were called up were immediately demobilized by the authorities in consideration of the difficulties of the business community.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] More than 3,000 remnants of the communist Zhang Taisheng's troops sneaked into Shanchengji and Huoshenmiao on the border of Xiao County and Yongcheng, 60 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou, on the 15th, with the intention of attacking Xiao County. The National Army is encircling and attacking them.

### 60,000 Troops Gathered Between Dalian and Pulandian, The Communist Army Plans to Resist Takeover, Military Inspection Discusses the Situation in Liaodong

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] According to a military observer, judging from the communist troops' continuous reinforcements and disturbances in recent months, the communist troops really have the intention and determination to desperately "defend" Dalian and refuse the government's takeover. Dalian is the main supply base for the communist troops in Hebei and Shandong, and the hub connecting northern North Korea and North China. Its military, political, and economic relations have a great impact on the overall situation. Since last winter, the communist troops have retreated all the remaining troops in southern Liaoning to the area north of Shihe, and have relied on special forces to actively replenish and train. Therefore, their independent divisions and other units were revived. Later, their 12th and 29th brigades also entered this special area one after another, but the 11th brigade never had the opportunity to enter. In addition, a part of the reinforcements from Shandong and another group of cadres were transferred to form three regiments on the spot. Recently, Korean communists landed in Dalian. Thus, the total force between Pulandian and Dalian, including regular and disguised communist troops, has reached more than 60,000 people. The National Army's future task of taking over Dalian will definitely not be achieved without bloodshed. The communist troops will resist with all their strength, which is expected. However, the morale of the National Army waiting to advance is extremely high, and they have full confidence. After the National Army's takeover task is completed, the entire southern Liaoning area will no longer have communist troops to worry about.

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] The preparations for the takeover of Dalian have been basically completed. The National Army in Pulandian and other places is removing various obstacles for the receivers. Gong Xuesui may come to Shenyang next week to handle the takeover matters.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Chairman met with Dong Yingbin at 9:00 PM on the 16th and gave many instructions on the issue of taking over Dalian.

[Our newspaper, Changchun, 16th] After the National Army began to attack on the outskirts of Nongan and Dehui, the communist troops collapsed. The National Army is now tightening the pocket of Changchun, Nongan, and Dehui. The communist troops surrounded include the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 17th, and 18th divisions. The National Army marching north along the Changtao Line joined forces with the Nongan garrison troops at 12:00 noon today.

### The Joint Defense of Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe is Inaccurate, Wang Hongshao Speaks Freely to Reporters About Military Affairs

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Headquarters, spoke freely about the current military situation at the invitation of the Beiping City Reporters Association this morning: (1) In the Chahar and Suiyuan area: Suiyuan is stable, only Qingshuihe, Tuoketuo, Helin, and Fengzhen, which border with other provinces, have occasional small disturbances. There is a communist Suiyuan military region in Fengzhen, training troops. Small units of Outer Mongolian troops are seen searching for information in the areas bordering Outer Mongolia in northern Suiyuan. There are more than 1,000 communist troops near Pingdingbao, north of Guyuan, Chahar Province. There are three regiments of communist troops in Chicheng, Yanqing, and other places in eastern Chahar. Communist troops harassed Fanshanbao, south of Chahar, the day before yesterday. (2) After the National Army recovered Gucheng in Hebei Province, the National Army did not advance further. At the moment, a part of the communist troops sneaked into the mountainous area of western Hebei, and most of them sneaked into the plains of central Hebei. There are two brigades south of the Yongding River, with no major movements. There has been no major activity near the two armies in eastern Hebei. There are often small reports of damage south of Lutai on the Beining Line, and communist troops are sneaking around south of the railway. The National Army continues to protect transportation and security.

[Another dispatch] According to Wang Hongshao, the reports of the joint defense of Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe are inaccurate. At the moment, Rehe is still under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters. However, the central government representatives in Rehe decided earlier and the Suiyuan political review meeting recently suggested to the central government to assign Rehe to the Beiping Headquarters, but so far no order from the central government on this matter has been received. He did not acknowledge or deny the reports that the 12th war zone had been transferred back from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, only saying that troop movements are common in military affairs, and that the strength of the National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not been weakened.

### Internal Friction Among the Communist Troops in the Northeast is Becoming Increasingly Serious

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The pro-war faction in Yan'an has long proposed to replace Zhang Xuesi, because Lin Biao, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, is not enough to make the people of the Northeast believe in him, and his party qualifications are too shallow, fearing that he cannot be firm in his will. After Lin learned of this, he expressed that people who had not decided could not be commanded by Zhang, and therefore friction occurred between the two troops. This kind of friction has recently become increasingly serious.

### The National Army Recovers Jinpenwan

The Location of He Long's Headquarters

[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The National Army recovered Jinpenwan, the location of He Long's headquarters and the concentration of Yan'an military agencies, this afternoon. The area belongs to Ganquan County, 20 kilometers west of Linzhen Town, which was recovered by the National Army on the south bank of the Fen River the day before yesterday. From this important stronghold, 15 kilometers northwest along the main road, you can enter the territory of Yan'an County, and 20 kilometers further will reach Lian County.

[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The communist units under the command of He Long on the southern line of Yan'an have been identified as the 4th, 11th, 358th, 359th, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd guard brigades, as well as the engineering, transport, artillery, and assassination regiments.

[United Press, Beiping, 15th] Colonel Sears, head of the US observation group, who recently withdrew from Yan'an and arrived here, told a United Press reporter today: "The evacuation work in Yan'an is proceeding day and night in a planned manner. Very few people are currently staying in the city, and Europeans and Americans have also taken refuge in the mountains. Most of these are rescue workers."

### More and More Communists Defect

The Youth Training Corps of the First War Zone

Has Incorporated 35 Squadrons

[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The number of CCP members who surrender and defect continues to increase. To date, the Youth Training Corps of the First War Zone has incorporated 35 squadrons. Some have been given funds to return to their hometowns, and the sick and wounded have been given medical treatment.

### The Repair Work of Ji-Chang Railway Ying Jiu Jian is Progressing Smoothly

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 16th] The repair work of the Ji-Chang Railway between Yingchengzi and Jiutai has been progressing smoothly in recent days. The Jiutai water plant has also been repaired, and the Ji-Chang regular telephone line will be connected soon.

### All-Around Conference Anecdotes

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] All-Around Conference Anecdotes:

(1) Yesterday the weather was overcast and layers of clouds densely covered the sky, but today it is a clear blue sky and the climate has also turned warmer, making the conference venue appear more lively. Two hundred and twenty-three Central Committee members and sixty-six Supervisory Committee members attended. The atmosphere inside the conference was also much more lively. However, because the National Assembly Hall is spacious, it still seemed quite sparse. Nevertheless, compared to past Central Executive Committee meetings, such as the one held in the Chongqing National Government Auditorium, which was small and crowded, and the Second Plenary Session of last year, which borrowed the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission Auditorium and also appeared packed and congested, this is vastly different. One Central Committee member said that the provisional capital is indeed not as good as the capital, which is certainly a true statement.

(2) Today was the opening session of the conference. The chairman was Sun Ke, with Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng on his left. It was shortly after his sixtieth birthday. He was immaculately dressed in a Western suit, frequently leaving his seat to coordinate and direct things, appearing very busy. On his right was Deputy Secretary-General Wang Qijiang. On one side was the newly appointed Nanjing Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Shouxian, and on the other was Wang Gongji, who is about to go to France to head our country's press office in Paris. These figures sat as usual on the chairman's platform, writing with great speed and handling matters with ease and proficiency. Their dignified presence added much to the conference.

(3) Because reporters from various newspapers were unable to attend the conference, it relied on Central Committee members who are currently active in the press to personally write reports. Among the Central Committee members with press qualifications are Chen Bulei, Chairman of the Central Daily News; Pan Gongzhan, President of the Shen Bao; Cheng Cangbo, President of the Xinwen Bao; Xiao Tongzi, President of the Central News Agency; Ma Xingye, President of the Central Daily News; Huang Shao-gu, President of the Heping Daily News; Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily News; and chief writer Hu Qiuyuan. Chairman Ma personally wrote an article titled "Gleanings from the CEC Meeting" for the Central Daily News yesterday, greatly enhancing the quality of the newspaper. It is commendable that these people do not forget their journalistic duties while attending the conference and continue to serve the readers.

(4) An important item on the agenda of today's opening session was Foreign Minister Wang's report on foreign affairs. During the report, the entire venue was silent, listening attentively and with nervous anticipation. Foreign Minister Wang spoke with measured pauses, clear organization, and systematic order, maintaining the demeanor of a veteran university professor. The audience sat upright and held their breath for two hours. Speakers praised Foreign Minister Wang for being eloquent and capable, stating that it is certainly not easy to negotiate on the international stage. Before yesterday's report, Wang arrived at the conference in the same car as Luo Jialun. Wang sat in the first seat of the second row, closing his eyes in quiet contemplation to gather his energy before taking the stage. After taking the stage, he spoke fluently and logically. Everyone in the audience was impressed by Foreign Minister Wang's eloquence.

(5) When Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs today, it seemed that he had more white hair than at the Second Plenary Session of the previous year, but his voice was still strong and resonated to the back of the hall. The report was entirely from memory, and the dates and numbers were presented without error. The chapters were divided as follows: first, the relationship between China and the United Nations and its position; second, the process of diplomatic negotiations between China and the United States and China and the Soviet Union; and third, the issues of China and Japan and the issue of Vietnam, as if he were delivering a lecture, with systematic order. Before Wang's report, he said, "After you all leave the venue, you will surely be surrounded by reporters," hoping they would keep it confidential. After the meeting, reporters from various newspapers eagerly inquired with the attending Central Committee members, but they all kept silent and did not reveal the main points. It can be said that Wang had foresight.

(6) After the opening of this morning's first meeting, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng first announced a three-minute moment of silence to mourn the revolutionary martyrs who had died. The entire venue was solemn. Afterwards, he read a telegram from Henan Province, stating that the breaching point at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River had been closed, and the completion was joyfully announced at dawn on the 15th. Upon hearing the news, the entire venue erupted in warm applause, rejoicing for the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims.

(7) The Director-General did not personally attend the conference today. Yesterday, he walked into the chairman's platform wearing a khaki Zhongshan suit with a smiling face. Seeing the Kuomintang completing the work of returning power to the people, he seemed to have infinite comfort in his heart. Today, Jing Hengyi wore a skullcap without a crown, resembling a Turk. Ju Zheng's small Uyghur-style hat and Ding Weifen's peculiar hat were quite eye-catching.

(8) From the Second Plenary Session to the Third Plenary Session, a year has passed. Many comrades in the Party have gained more white hair. Looking around, the hair is frosty, and it seems that there are more Central Committee members with white hair than with black hair. However, the whiteness of each person's hair is different. Shao Lizi has a head full of white hair; Chen Cheng and Chen Lifu have white temples but their crowns are still gray; Chen Shuren has a mix of black and white; Zhang Zhiben has white hair in the front but still has black hair in the back; Bai Chongxi and Bai Yunti, although their surname is Bai, have no white hair.

(9) The drafting committee for the declaration immediately nominated Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Bulei, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Luo Jialun, Cheng Zhonghang, and Hong Lanyou, a total of nine people. Today, Li Weiguo, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Huang Shaogu, President of the Heping Daily News, were added. Both Li and Huang are standing directors of the Youth League and have been in the Party for many years. They are mature beyond their years and are suitable to shoulder this important task.

### Marshall Has Resolutely Rejected Suggestions for Out-of-Conference Discussions on the China Issue, Indicates Possible Consideration if the Soviet Side Raises the Issue of Stationing Troops

[This Newspaper Dispatch] Washington, 16th Broadcast: It is learned that Marshall has resolutely rejected out-of-conference discussions on China's internal affairs in the Soviet capital, but indicated that if Molotov raises the issue of the US and Soviet Union stationing troops within China, he would consider it separately.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] As of late tonight, Marshall has still not responded to the Soviet Foreign Minister's letter regarding the China issue.

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Bevin must wait for instructions from his own government before giving an affirmative response to Molotov's suggestion. However, in any case, his opposition to discussing the China issue in a manner exceeding the exchange of opinions will not change. He maintained this position during the Moscow discussions in 1945.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Marshall and Bevin are carefully reconsidering Molotov's suggestion in light of China's opposition to participating. Furthermore, the two are quite busy during their stay in Moscow, so it is unlikely that they will place the China issue as a top priority. Bevin has even declared that if such a meeting is held, it should be limited to reviewing the implementation of the 1949 agreements. Bevin also guaranteed that he would not discuss Far Eastern issues before exchanging views with the various autonomous territories. It is believed here that Molotov may withdraw the suggestion. Surprisingly, even Chinese left-wing elements who have always sympathized with the Soviet Union have taken a unified step with Chinese right-wing elements to oppose discussing the China issue here.

### Americans Understand Our Country, Friendship with China Has Not Wavered, US China Service Society Announces Results of Public Opinion Survey

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch] According to the results of a public opinion survey released by the United Service to China (American relief organization for China), the civil war and political turmoil in China have not shaken the traditional friendship of the United States with the Chinese people. The results of a national Gallup survey indicate that two-thirds of the American people believe that it is important for the United States to continue to aid China, and half of them even believe that assistance to China is "extremely important." The above-mentioned national survey was conducted by the Gallup Poll Organization at the request of the United Service to China. At the same time, another public opinion survey organization also conducted a public opinion survey in the city of Boston in Pennsylvania to investigate the opinions of local people on China. Three-quarters of the people believe that the United States should be concerned about the welfare of the people of other countries, and generally express the greatest concern for China. The results of the public opinion survey in the city show that most Americans believe that Chinese people need educational opportunities more than anything else. They do not believe in the previous belief that China is overly bound by its old ideas and cannot obtain the benefits of education. Seventy percent of them said that they would personally help the Chinese people to obtain this opportunity. The above two surveys were conducted during the news reports of the US reporters stationed in China about the civil war and political turmoil in China and a small number of people holding anti-American parades.

### After the Announcement of the New Economic Program, Prices in Various Regions Have Tended to Stabilize

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] After the announcement of the economic emergency measures program, various regions across the country are implementing them vigorously. According to reports from various regions to the Executive Yuan, prices have generally tended to stabilize.

Yunnan

The report of February 22 stated that after the implementation of the program, gold shops immediately closed down, foreign currency was no longer in circulation, and in terms of prices, compared with early February, not only did they not rise, but there was also a downward trend.

Hubei

The report of February 22 stated that in the ten days before the program was promulgated, prices rose by an average of about 50%. After the implementation of the program, prices stopped rising and there was a downward trend, and the market gradually stabilized.

Tianjin

Before the promulgation of the program, the market was extremely unstable due to the influence of the gold rush in Shanghai. After a meeting was held on February 5, an emergency measures program to stabilize prices was decided, stipulating the investigation and prohibition of the gold and silver black market, supervision of the grain market, control of yarn and cloth transactions, and prohibition of commercial banks and money houses from engaging in the habit of operating in gold, silver, yarn, cloth, and grain, or using them as loan collateral. The market was slightly stabilized. After the promulgation of the program, gold and silver still had no price, and the black market disappeared. In terms of prices, yarn and cloth were stable, grain prices were weak, and general prices, except for export goods that had increased due to the influence of foreign exchange adjustments, there were few fluctuations in other daily necessities.

Jiangsu

After the implementation of the program, prices have tended to fall. Qianjiang rice fell from 100,000 yuan per stone to 80,000 yuan, and other counties have also tended to fall.

Beiping

The report of March 2 stated that before the program was promulgated, in early February, due to the volatility of the gold rush in Shanghai and the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the price of gold was higher than in other parts of the country, and prices soared accordingly. After taking expedient measures on February 6 to stop gold transactions and control the general market, although the black market was not eradicated, the price of gold had fallen, and the economy tended to stabilize. After the implementation of the program, the gold and silver black market disappeared, and in terms of prices, no hoarding or speculation of daily necessities or violation of price limits was found. General prices gradually stabilized, and the prices of rice and wheat food generally fell by 10% to 15%. The price of coal and grain had not increased by the end of February. However, recently, due to the collection and purchase of grain in Chahar, Suiyuan, Jehol, and Liaoning, the prohibition of external transportation, and the dissolution of the Mentougou Coal Mine Trade Union by the Wanping County Government, coal transportation was suspended, and the supply and demand were unbalanced, causing the price of coal and grain to rise slightly.

Qingdao

The report of February 27 stated that after the implementation of the program, prices have been affected by the military situation in central Shandong. In recent days, the prices of daily necessities have soared and have not fallen. Wheat flour is still around 70,000 yuan, rice is between 1,000 and 1,200 yuan per catty, and coal dust is at an unstable price of over 11,000 yuan per hundred catties.

Zhejiang

The report of February 28 stated that before the program was promulgated, on February 15 in Hangzhou, the price of top-grade rice was 120,000 yuan per dan, medium-grade cotton was 360,000 yuan per hundred catties, and top-grade firewood was 16,000 yuan per hundred catties. After the implementation of the program, prices have tended to fall. Gold and silver jewelry shops in Hangzhou have closed down, and there is no black market. In terms of wages, the salaries of employees have not been paid according to the cost of living index. Currently, as prices have tended to stabilize, there have been no incidents of factory closures, strikes, or absenteeism.

Sichuan

The report of March 3 stated that prices have tended to fall since the implementation of the program.

Anhui

The report of March 3 stated that before the program was promulgated, prices had once soared due to economic volatility. Gold rose from 45 million yuan to 1 million yuan per tael, rice rose from 40,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per dan, firewood rose from 5,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan per hundred catties, vegetable oil rose from 1,000 yuan to 2,400 yuan per catty, kerosene rose from 500 yuan to 3,200 yuan per catty, and cloth generally rose by more than double. However, after the implementation of the program, prices in the provincial capital not only did not rise, but instead tended to fall daily.

Chongqing

After the implementation of the program, the open trading of gold and silver has completely stopped, and only sporadic transactions remain, which have not yet disappeared. Prices have either fallen or are in a stable state.

Editorial

### The Resumption of Civil Aviation

After a two-month suspension, the China and Central Aviation Companies have resumed flights yesterday. Four aircraft departed from Shanghai, and three from Nanjing. Due to repeated aircraft accidents, passengers are cautious, so patronage has not been very enthusiastic. Although this matter is a minor one, its significance is very great, and it concerns the future of our country's aviation industry, which deserves our attention. Since the establishment of civil aviation companies in our country, people from all walks of life have had much to say. The main points are nothing more than mismanagement, poor equipment, poor communication, or smuggling, dereliction of duty, and arrogant attitudes on the part of flight crews, leading to frequent overload, damage, and accidents. The media has repeatedly called for improving civil aviation to ensure passenger safety, but human effort has not been reduced, and ultimately, the effectiveness of overcoming nature through human effort has not been achieved. In recent months, shocking aircraft accidents have been frequently seen, creating an unprecedented disaster for our country's aviation industry. After continuous disasters, the government established the Civil Aviation Administration to strengthen the control of civil aviation. For the internal reorganization of the Central and China Aviation Companies, flights on all routes were suspended for about two months, and resumed only yesterday.

The activities of the transportation industry are like the blood vessels of the human body, which need to circulate and cannot stagnate, causing the phenomenon of obesity and paralysis. Now that the Central Aviation Company has resumed flights and air transportation is active, it is a welcome event, but there is still doubt as to whether the internal reorganization and aircraft equipment are completely satisfactory. Therefore, we still have unlimited concerns about the progress of the civil aviation industry in the future.

Aviation is a combination of scientific tools, which must be combined with scientific management to achieve its inherent performance. At the same time, scientific equipment is changing with each passing day, and high technology must be adopted at any time to achieve daily progress. The China and Central Aviation Companies in our country already have a considerable history in the civil aviation industry, and their organization and capital are extremely strong. During the Anti-Japanese War in the rear area, they made good contributions. However, after the post-war recovery, it is regrettable that the Ministry of Communications neglected management and the company's organization and personnel were not adequately rationalized. After the three aircraft accidents in Shanghai last Christmas, the Ministry of Communications established the Civil Aviation Administration. In recent months, the work of the Civil Aviation Administration, such as enriching meteorological equipment, special preventative measures to ensure aviation safety, and adjusting the supervision, maintenance, and management personnel of the Central and China Aviation Companies, have all been progressive manifestations, which are barely satisfactory. However, after repeated aircraft accidents, the Control Yuan and the Senate successively published investigation reports, and the case of the China Aviation Company's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing flight crashing in Tianmen, western Hubei, even involved the alleged smuggling of 200 gold bars, causing the aircraft to lose balance and suffer this tragedy. To this day, the families of the victims of each tragedy are still filing lawsuits, without any results, and are left to lament helplessly. In theory, the transportation authorities should make a clear announcement of the causes of past aircraft accidents after the resumption of flights to dispel public doubts. The appeals of the bereaved families should not be dismissed with a document expressing condolences to the victims, and the past should not be glossed over! In fact, the responsibility for the airline's accidents should be clarified, and the grievances of the bereaved families should be redressed. This is how it should be done administratively, it should also be done in terms of a sense of responsibility, and it should be done even more so morally!

As for the improvement of the civil aviation industry in the future, the scientific and technical aspects depend on the exploration of experts, while the investigation reports of the Controllers and Senators contain many improvement suggestions, which are all very important. Now, during the resumption of flights by the Central Aviation Company, we would like to express our views as a supplement to the improvement suggestions of all parties, hoping that the relevant parties will refer to them: (1) There should be a civil aviation law concerning navigation, responsibility, compensation, and pensions in the civil aviation industry. This is a kind of social security legislation, which seems necessary in our country today; (2) The fare after the resumption of flights should not be increased, but the insurance premium or the company's additional insurance premium can be increased. Due to the increase in insurance premiums, the company's articles of association should also increase the amount of compensation for passengers, which should not be too different from the compensation for company employees, and especially should not be different from the compensation for foreign passengers, so as to avoid the suspicion of treating the lives of domestic passengers as worthless. The increase in life insurance premiums can also increase the company's prudence; (3) Prepare in advance for everything, the company should have sufficient parachutes and life belts, and teach passengers the safe use of technology in advance to reduce the danger in case of emergency; (4) The aviation traffic inspection system should be restored to prevent aircraft or passengers from carrying gold and contraband, so as to ensure the safety of the journey; (5) Civil aviation and military aircraft should have flight agreements, such as regulations on the flight altitude of round-trip routes, and allowing civil aircraft to land at military airports in emergencies. All of this will not only help ensure passenger safety, but also remedy the defects in the social security and relief system of our country's civil aviation in its infancy.

In short, our country's civil aviation industry is currently in a critical stage. If it lags behind, it must make progress, and it can go one step further. Clear the clouds and see the blue sky. The future of national construction is very far-reaching. At this moment, when the country is facing difficult times, the nation's vitality and the aviation industry's vitality cannot withstand any more setbacks!

### Commentary on the Method of Wage Assessment

The Method of Implementing Wage Assessment has been passed by the National Economic Commission's Price Committee. The full text contains fourteen articles. Its purpose is nothing more than to replace the quantitative distribution of employees with appropriate compensation. The Executive Yuan has designated only Beijing and Shanghai as places where prices are strictly controlled. In these two cities, all salaries and wages calculated according to the cost of living index shall be based on the highest amount in January of this year, and a flat-rate allocation of six kinds of daily necessities shall be provided as a subsidy. Although the cost of living index in other important cities has also been frozen, the quantitative distribution of daily necessities has not been implemented, so it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments to show fairness. Read the first article of this method, which excludes the places designated by the Executive Yuan for strict price control, and the price of the six kinds of rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton cloth, and sugar, which are used to increase or decrease wages as stipulated in Article 6, is exactly the same as the flat-rate goods currently distributed to employees, and its meaning is self-evident.

What needs to be pointed out here is that the method of quantitative distribution is more fixed and uniform, while the method of wage assessment is quite flexible, and there are gains and losses in its application. Although the actual distribution of goods in Shanghai is not enough to meet the urgent needs, the price difference has already been converted into cash, which in fact is not much different from the discretionary wage increase. However, the price difference is calculated based on the retail market price, which is completely mechanical, and is ultimately different from the wages after assessment. Because once it is assessed, there will be room for flexibility. Article 6 clearly states: "The assessment of wage increases or decreases shall be based on the detailed situation of the prices of major daily necessities in the local area at that time, and shall be reported to the local government for approval." Article 7 also states: "When implementing wage assessment, close contact should be made with neighboring areas." If it is purely mechanical, like the flat-rate distribution of goods or the conversion of price differences into cash, then the words "assessment," "approval," and "contact" would not be applicable.

When prices are stable, it is not bad to adopt a mechanical subsidy method or a flexible one. When prices fluctuate sharply, it seems theoretically more convenient to adopt the latter, i.e., the assessment method. Because the cost of living index at the bottom has been frozen, and the quantitative distribution of subsidies remains unchanged, it is really difficult to say whether it can be fully implemented in practice.

However, there is also an important point to note in the assessment method, that is, the proviso in Article 8 of the original plan: "No changes shall be made before approval." This is based on the precedent of all price negotiations, and a general rule has been discovered, that is, the black market comes before the negotiated price. In other words, the black market leads the negotiated price, and the negotiated price follows the black market. This has created a phenomenon that there is a black market whenever there is a negotiated price. Wages are different from prices, and theoretically they do not support the creation of a black market. However, if the negotiated price is not very reasonable, or is not decided for a long time, so that labor and management have to find a way to reach an agreement on their own, then it is no different from a black market. Furthermore, the failure to reassess in a timely manner when "prices change, and the cost of living increases or decreases too drastically" will make it impossible to reduce labor unrest, which is especially inconsistent with the intention of this legislation. Therefore, when implementing this wage assessment method, it is necessary to always stand on a proactive position, and especially to grasp the timeliness, so as to avoid the above-mentioned abuses.

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures Program, whether wages and prices can be coordinated has been a major concern. Now, the measures for the distribution of daily necessities, the measures for converting price differences into cash, and the measures for implementing wage assessment have been formulated one after another, and the legislative work can be said to have been completed. The central task from now on is of course how to stabilize prices, and to achieve the elimination of labor unrest and the stabilization of workers' lives, it is especially important to properly use these methods.

### Contradictions Found in the Potsdam Agreement; Bevin Believes They Should Be Corrected; Marshall to Meet with Stalin Soon

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin has initiated the correction of contradictions in the Potsdam Agreement regarding Germany at the Council of Foreign Ministers to meet the needs of the current situation. Bevin believes that the principles of the Potsdam Agreement need to be redefined, but this work must be based on the entire agreement and not be treated individually. The principle of economic unification is the most important principle of the Potsdam Agreement, but although the four powers recognize this principle, they still act independently in its implementation. Britain has made it clear that it will object to the execution of other provisions until the four powers have reached an agreement on the execution of this provision. Although Bevin and Molotov have exchanged accusations in the meetings, they both possess a high degree of diplomatic skill, so the door to compromise is not closed. Marshall, as a newcomer to the Council of Foreign Ministers, has received general praise for his prudence. Take Molotov's suggestion to discuss the China issue as an example. Marshall encountered this unexpected problem at the beginning of the meeting, but he did not move a muscle and waited for Bevin to propose an informal discussion, which eased the atmosphere.

[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Experienced observers in Moscow today expect the U.S. Secretary of State and other foreign ministers to be summoned to the Kremlin to meet with Premier Stalin. This rumor is consistent with the arguments of Republican Senators in the United States, who are urging Marshall to express the U.S. policy in the Mediterranean to the Soviet leader.

### Sixth Day of the Council of Foreign Ministers: Discussing the Displacement of Refugees and Land Division

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Special Dispatch] The sixth day of the meeting of the four foreign ministers was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, and the meeting lasted for four hours and fifteen minutes. The themes discussed today were the displacement of people and the re-division of territory. Vyshinsky first reported on the external representative work of the discussion on the German peace treaty, stating that the foreign ministers' representatives were currently in a stalemate on the issue of whether to invite Albania to participate in the consultative meeting. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then proposed that although no agreement could be reached on the issue of Albania, the work of the foreign ministers' representatives should continue. After discussion, this suggestion was endorsed by all the foreign ministers. Vyshinsky then made a lengthy statement on the fact that some Soviet citizens were still living in concentration camps. Marshall explained the U.S. position and suggested that this issue be handled by the International Refugee Organization. The International Refugee Organization was established to solve such serious problems, and if the Four Foreign Ministers' Council tried to interfere in this matter, it would not only be of no help, but would also make the matter more complicated. French Foreign Minister Bidault spoke for the first time during the discussion of the issue of displaced persons and made a very significant suggestion. He believed that since the population density within the country was already higher than other countries, (1) German minorities outside Germany should be prohibited from entering Germany; (2) The transfer of the German population decided at the Potsdam Conference should be temporarily suspended; (3) Displaced persons should not reside in Germany; (4) An agency should be organized to handle German emigration. Bidault also stated that France was prepared to fulfill its responsibility to accommodate Germans. Regarding the issue of prejudice against Germany in European countries, Bidault's suggestions were even more statesmanlike.

Regarding the issue of redefining borders, Molotov read a report, and Marshall immediately explained that the re-division of the border in the U.S. occupation zone was based on historical, economic, and cultural considerations. Molotov suggested that the Allied Control Council should approve future border changes. However, Bevin believed that the Allied Control Council was unlikely to reach an agreement on such matters. Molotov wanted to ask the Council of Foreign Ministers to make this decision, but no one agreed to his suggestion. The first week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council ended in this way. In the first week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council, only one resolution was reached, namely the liquidation of the Prussian state. The next meeting of the foreign ministers will be held at 4 p.m. on the 17th of this month, and is scheduled to discuss the economic principles and reparations issues proposed by Molotov.

Displaced Persons Can Be Classified into Four Categories

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Special Dispatch] British Foreign Minister Bevin, in discussing the issue of displaced persons, divided them into four categories: (1) prisoners of war; (2) displaced persons of the United Nations; (3) displaced persons of enemy countries; and (4) German refugees and deportees. The second category is the most difficult. Two million people have returned home from the British occupation zone, and there are currently 230,000 people, the most numerous and worrying of whom are 111,000 Poles, followed by 82,500 people from the Baltic states, 4,700 Yugoslavs, more than 7,800 prisoners of war, and 29,000 people of various nationalities who have not yet been identified, but are considered to be people of the United Nations. The policy of the Council of Foreign Ministers is not to force them to return home, but to use other methods to speed up their resettlement elsewhere, but they are not allowed to stay in Germany permanently, and currently they are being used for productive work.

### British and American Foreign Ministers Confer on the Palestine Issue

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to unofficial sources: British Foreign Minister Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall have discussed the Palestine issue at length in Moscow. Bevin told Marshall that the United States could no longer evade its moral responsibility for solving the Jewish problem. It is reported that the Palestine issue is being discussed simultaneously in Washington, London, and Moscow. Regarding the proposal by the British to organize a committee on the Palestine issue by major countries, it is reported that the representatives of China, France, and the Soviet Union have expressed their support, and the United States has no objection either.

### New U.S. Ambassador to Britain Arrives in London to Take Office

[United Press, London, 16th] The new U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, arrived here today to take office. He must wait for King George VI to return from South Africa before he can present his credentials.

### Rumor Has It That According to Truman's Aid Plan, the U.S. Will Lend Us 500 Million Yuan; Total Foreign Loans Reach Over 5.7 Billion Yuan

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The "Army and Navy Journal" predicted today that China and several other countries will receive U.S. financial assistance under Truman's aid plan. The entire aid plan will cost approximately 5.75 billion yuan, and China may receive the largest share, amounting to 500 million yuan. According to its editor, a close friend of General Marshall, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid may reach 5.75 billion yuan, distributed as follows: Greece and Turkey will receive a total of 400 million yuan, China will receive 500 million yuan, Korea will receive 200 million yuan, Austria will receive 155 million yuan, the Balkan countries will receive 200 million yuan, Germany will receive 475 million yuan, and Japan and other Pacific regions will receive 200 million yuan. Truman made the decision on a large-scale aid plan after learning of the factual reports of the Army, Navy, and Air Force advisors, General Marshall, and other experts. Some call this plan the Monroe Doctrine of the world, and others call it the New Lend-Lease Act. The president's proposal will inevitably interfere with the freedom of all places. It is said that the total amount of the figures expected to be obtained by the aforementioned countries is less than 5.75 billion yuan, and the newspaper did not explain the reason. It is thought that the countries it listed are only part of the aid target.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 16th] The Egyptian government has decided to extend the Anglo-Egyptian trade agreement for one year, starting from the 1st of this month.

### The Door to Compromise on the Straits Question Closed for Turkey: Views of Turkish Political Figures

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 15th] Regarding the Dardanelles Straits issue, political figures here stated: As far as Turkey is concerned, the door to reaching a compromise has already been closed. Considering President Truman's statement on foreign policy to Congress, the hope of the Soviet Union obtaining a solution that satisfies its desires appears slim. Therefore, the Dardanelles Straits will likely maintain the status quo. Turkish figures generally expressed satisfaction and approval regarding President Truman's foreign policy statement. However, the "Ulus" newspaper, which is semi-official and authoritative in public opinion, held a slightly different view. Diplomatic figures here paid close attention to this. According to an article published in the newspaper by a well-known economist, "Although American consideration of financially assisting Turkey is very important, it cannot solve everything. Only the restoration of world security can allow Turkey to revive its economy."

### U.S. Economic Aid Plan for Greece Is Not Interference in Greek Internal Affairs: State Department Official Willard Declares

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The U.S. State Department released its weekly "Our Country's Foreign Policy" broadcast tonight, with Deputy Director of the Middle East Division Willard speaking, saying: We do not intend to interfere in Greece's internal affairs, nor do we intend to have any political party in power while suppressing another. We do intend to economically assist Greece, so that the Greek people can maintain the government they desire in an atmosphere free from threats.

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The legislative draft for implementing President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey is reportedly complete and will be submitted to the House of Representatives by Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Monday. Congressional authorities stated: The draft does not specifically limit the method of assistance but will adopt a method similar to the wartime Lend-Lease program, with payments made in installments. This measure will allow the United States to send economic and military missions to Greece and will transfer surplus military materials to Greece and Turkey. Regular army and navy equipment may also be supplied to the two countries. The nature of the military missions will be similar to the U.S. military missions sent to South America and China, but the deployment of U.S. troops will not become a reality.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Republican Senator Taft today raised the question of whether the Soviet Union would declare war if the United States provided financial and military aid to Greece and Turkey, and demanded that the government express its opinion. It is said: "I want to know how our senior military officials feel about the possibility of the Soviet Union waging war if the United States implements this plan. If the Soviet Union wanted to forcibly establish a communist government in Cuba, we would almost certainly go to war, and the situation would be exactly the same."

Representatives of Greek Parties Send Telegrams of Thanks to U.S. President

On the day Taft raised the question, the White House announced telegrams of thanks from spokespersons of all Greek parties, except the Communist Party. The presidential announcement stated that these telegrams proved that all parties wanted unreserved cooperation with the United States, guaranteeing a commitment to constructive revival and loyalty to the principles of peace and freedom.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] The leader of the American economic delegation stationed in Greece, is expected to arrive here today from Athens to confer with government officials on the matter of loans to Greece.

### Truman Fishes, Receives Two Secret Letters from Marshall

[Associated Press, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 15th] President Truman is apparently pleased that his aid proposal for Greece and Turkey will be passed and will continue his vacation here until the 19th. The lack of an official response from Moscow and the excitement in Congress are factors in the president's decision to take a temporary vacation, according to authoritative sources. Today, before embarking on a four-hour fishing trip, the president received two secret letters from Secretary of State Marshall. The letters were delivered by airmail, the first time since Truman addressed Congress on the 12th. Marshall was fully informed of Truman's address to Congress beforehand, but the two have not had telephone contact since. Presidential spokesperson Rose announced that, barring any changes, Truman will remain in Key West for several more days after the 17th.

### McNutt Extends Return to U.S.

Three More Agreements Between U.S. and Philippines Pending Signature

[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th] U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Paul McNutt was originally scheduled to return to the United States this morning but has now extended his stay until the 17th or 18th to await the signing of three other agreements between the U.S. and the Philippines, including military aid and an extradition agreement. Yesterday, McNutt and President Roxas signed a military base treaty, a consular agreement, and a fisheries agreement here.

### Democratic Front Unites to Create Peace: Ambassador Koo's Insightful Speech

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States V.K. Wellington Koo gave a speech at the University of Virginia, saying: "There is no doubt that democracy will triumph over other ideologies. Peace is indivisible, and so are world prosperity and freedom. If nations cannot cooperate, the international future will be bleak and regrettable. The world situation is complex due to the existence of two opposing ideologies. Countries take different steps on certain issues, making cooperation difficult. Only mutual understanding can lead to cooperation. The world democratic front must unite and act together. The power of unity is greatest when democratic forces unite, because the foundation of democratic forces is the free will of the individual, not the forced will of the state."

### Franco-Bulgarian Relations Deteriorate: France Recalls Envoy to Bulgaria

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Officials announced today: The French government has decided to halt trade negotiations with Bulgaria and ordered two Bulgarian journalists to leave the country within 24 hours, in retaliation for Bulgaria's expulsion of French journalist Madame Bouillot. This action is not an infringement on press freedom. The accreditation of other Bulgarian correspondents in France will not be renewed upon expiration, and Bulgarian journalists will not enjoy the various conveniences afforded to other foreign journalists, but diplomatic relations between the two countries will not be severed. The French Envoy to Bulgaria, Mr. Paris, has been recalled to report on various incidents last week, including Bulgaria's interference in the French Embassy's deposits. Bulgaria recently issued a new currency and froze the old currency, limiting the circulation of the old currency to 2,000 units per person, with any excess subject to interference, thus causing the incident.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry stated that the Bulgarian Envoy to Paris left Paris this afternoon to return to Sofia, presumably with instructions from his government, and he may not return to Paris.

### Anti-Government Faction Active in Spain: Franco's Police Crack Down on Secret Organizations

[United Press, Zaragoza, 16th] According to an announcement by Spanish authorities today: The Spanish government has cracked down on an "insurrection plot" by anarchists and socialists. The organization allegedly attempted to paralyze the industry of Catalonia by blowing up the power plant near the Utrillas coal mine. In Madrid, police also raided an organization, arresting 122 members suspected of being terrorists and killing two of their leaders. In Barcelona, three people were arrested on suspicion of throwing grenades at a store. It was also reported that conspirators had blown up a railway bridge between Bilbao and Barcelona, but the incident was discovered before a train passed. However, authorities refused to disclose how many people were arrested in the alleged insurrection plot.

### Bastions of Defense Against the Soviets: A Look at the Political Situation in Greece and Turkey

[Central News Agency Reporter Wang Gongda, Ankara, 15th Dispatch] This Central News Agency reporter has found that Greece and Turkey are important links in today's anti-Soviet bulwark, but their situations are very different. The reporter stayed in Turkey for several days and visited Greece in mid-February this year, and obtained the above views. Some observers share the same view with the reporter.

The Turkish Government Is Strong and Powerful

Today's Turkey has a strong and powerful government and follows the policies clearly defined by Kemal Ataturk, just as China follows the policies of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. When the Turkish people follow certain policies, they have a Muslim spirit, ignoring all domestic and foreign criticisms and resolutely implementing the policies. The political and military situation in Turkey is stable. Although Kemal Ataturk has been dead for ten years, his closest comrade, the current President Inönü, is still following his aspirations, just as President Chiang Kai-shek is following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's aspirations.

Greece Currently Lacks Leaders

Presently, Greece has virtually no national leaders to speak of. King George of Greece is not Greek at all. The Greek royal family has constantly intermarried with European royal families and has German, Danish, and Russian blood. Since ascending the throne in 1910, King George has been exiled once by a public referendum and has been invited back to the country twice by public referendum. Greek Prime Minister Maximos is a banker who once served as the president of the Bank of Greece. He does not belong to any party and is not even a political figure. He was appointed Prime Minister simply because he can coordinate the eight political parties in the Greek parliament. The prominent Athenian politician, Tsaldaris, the current Greek Foreign Minister, is merely the leader of the most powerful right-wing party. He did not leave when the Axis powers occupied Greece and was still an unknown figure before the war. There is even less to speak of in terms of the prestige of a leader. Greek intellectuals told the reporter: "Unfortunately, we cannot get a leader like your President Chiang Kai-shek." Today's Greek government is indeed weak and incompetent. The Turkish government and military can prevent any actions suspected of left-wing disturbances in advance. Greece is not. Despite having American heavy weapons, British aircraft, and even ready-made British-style uniforms, its army is clearly insufficient to prevent communist harassment. This can be proved by the failure of its full-scale annihilation war in mid-February.

Current Economic Status of Turkey and Greece

The national economies of Turkey and Greece have been shaken, but the circumstances of the shaking are also different. One U.S. dollar is worth 2.8 Turkish liras, but one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for 5,000 Greek drachmas. Turkey is exhausting its national resources to support its million-strong army for defense against foreign aggression and is gritting its teeth and enduring suffering. Greece, however, relies on foreign countries for everything, and prices are extremely high, and the black market is rampant. The Greeks allow communists to even conduct propaganda and demonstrations in their capital, but Ankara would never allow such a phenomenon to occur. Greece can at most show the world that it is "democratic," even though it is bleeding in fact to quell armed rebellion. Turkey will never relax its strict suppression work and will not consider the comments of other countries in the world. But strangely, the comments received by the two countries are both "fascism."

A Glimpse of Slavic Criticism

The criticism Turkey receives from the Slavs is even less than that of Greece, and the criticism of Turkey from democratic countries is also far less than that of Greece. Turkey is successful in this regard because it has adopted extremely realistic policies. Greece is not; it is suffering from the contradiction between its realistic and idealistic policies.

Friendship Between Greece and Turkey Eliminates Old Grudges

Greece and Turkey had considerable old grudges in the past, but they have eliminated them in the past 25 years. Since the end of World War II, Greece and Turkey have been as close as long-time allies due to their common interest in jointly defending against Soviet aggression. After Truman delivered his speech on granting loans to Greece and Turkey, relations between the two countries became even closer. Western countries now call Greece and Turkey "the borders of democracy." The Turks believe that they are the boiling point of the U.S.-Soviet conflict. The Turks believe that their homeland is the bulwark preventing the "red tide" in the entire Middle East. The Turks believe that their army today, although not comparable to the United States, is undoubtedly the most powerful in the Middle East, and the Turkish government is undoubtedly the strongest in all the countries of the Middle East and the Near East. Due to the same interests, Greece and Turkey have now become a major anti-Soviet fortress in the Middle East. The Turkish government newspaper "Milliyet" believes that this matter "has the most important relationship to the peace and security of the world," so Greece and Turkey should now receive American aid at the same time.

The Status of the Two Countries Is Extremely Important

It is generally believed that the "sanitary belt" to prevent Soviet aggression starts from the Baltic Sea, passes through the eastern part of the Jutland Peninsula, winds to the port of Trieste, then along the Adriatic Sea, crosses northern Greece, the Black Sea, Iran, India, and central Korea at 38 degrees north latitude, and then along the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean. From this point of view, Greece and Turkey do occupy an important position in this anti-Soviet bulwark.

### Nehru Proposes Partition to Resolve Punjab Dispute: Muslim League Opposes, Demands New Elections

[Agence France-Presse, Lahore, 16th] Well-informed sources here say that a new dispute is likely to arise between the Congress Party and the Muslim League regarding Nehru's plan to divide the Punjab province into two regions. It is reported that Nehru has informed the Governor of Punjab, Sir Evan Jenkins, that the Congress Party will ask the Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten, to take office as soon as possible so that the province can be divided into two regions. Muslim League President Jinnah is reportedly opposed to this, believing that this move will economically harm the independent Muslim state after the partition, as the Punjab is the economic pillar of the Northwest Frontier Province and Sindh. Therefore, many believe that the Muslim League will demand new elections in the province to determine its future.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 15th] An official communiqué has just been issued stating that riots have broken out again in the Punjab province, with five villages looted and many casualties. It has also been learned that villagers in Swarupur in Rajputana have clashed with Kshatriyas, resulting in ten deaths and twelve injuries.

[Agence France-Presse, Peshawar, Northwest Frontier Province, India, 15th] British planes dropped leaflets over tribal areas near here today, warning them that if they attempt to attack Peshawar, the British will take severe action.

### Japanese Parliament to Be Re-Elected Next Month: Hirohito Ineligible to Vote

Matsudaira Tsuneo to Be Leader of the Liberal Party

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 15th] The Japanese parliament will be re-elected next month, and Emperor Hirohito will not be able to vote, but other members of the royal family may be able to vote. According to officials from the Tokyo Voter Registration Bureau, the emperor is not eligible to vote because the new constitution stipulates that he is a "symbol of the state" and is outside of politics.

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to well-informed sources, former Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira Tsuneo, may succeed Prime Minister Yoshida as the leader of the Liberal Party. According to the Kyoto Shimbun, Matsudaira is also said to be leading a movement to merge the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party.

### Yang Yongqing Urges Implementation of Children's Fund Plan

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Chinese Deputy Representative Yang Yongqing stated today at the United Nations Economic and Social Council that China sincerely supports the International Children's Emergency Fund and hopes that all countries can cooperate as soon as possible so that the fund can be implemented immediately. The fund has not yet started work since it was established at the last United Nations General Assembly.

### Former British War Minister Pelly Says British and American Naval Power Are Related

[Associated Press, Birmingham, England, 15th] Former British War Minister Pelly said in a speech here today that President Truman's speech on aid to Greece and Turkey shows that the United States itself has clearly declared its Mediterranean maritime status. Truman's doctrine should not be seen as taking over Britain's power and sovereignty. On the contrary, it recognizes that Britain relinquishing its responsibilities on the seven seas is an unduly heavy burden. If Britain and the United States want to promote a common policy in fulfilling maritime obligations, then it is only right that they share the responsibility for implementation. The interconnection of British and American diplomacy gives the greatest factual guarantee to world peace. The Anglo-French treaty will soon be aligned with the format that is being formed. Such unity between maritime powers will not only not undermine the world peace organization but will also consolidate its foundation.

### Arab Countries to Recognize Indonesia

[Associated Press, Batavia, 16th] According to a report from Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, today, Arab League representative Mouni recently informed Indonesian President Sukarno that Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Outer Jordan, and Yemen, due to their religious and blood ties with Muslim Indonesia, unanimously decided to first recognize the Republic of Indonesia as a sovereign and independent state on November 18 last year, as initiated by the Arab League. Formal steps to recognize Indonesia will be taken soon.

### Tense Situation in Paraguay: Opposition Denies Being Instigated by Communists; Rumors of Rebel Army Advancing on the Capital

[Agence France-Presse, Asunción, Paraguay, 15th] After the rebellion broke out in Paraguay, officials are confident that the government army can defeat the rebels within 48 hours, but so far, President Morinigo has kept his main forces in the capital. Rumors say that the rebel army is advancing on the capital, so the situation in the city is extremely tense.

[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16th] The Paraguayan Chargé d'Affaires in Argentina, Morinigo, brother of the President, recently announced that the situation in the country is normal everywhere except in Concepción, where the rebels are located, and that the rebellion can be suppressed immediately. The government has sufficient troops to dispatch but does not want to cause bloodshed as a result.

[Agence France-Presse, Asunción, Paraguay, 15th] Rumors that the Paraguayan rebellion was instigated by the communists were recently denied by opposition leader Berera.

### Tragic Accident on the Songhu Railway: Train and Truck Collide Violently; Negligence of the Crossing Guard Causes Disaster; Nine People Including Soldiers and Police Injured

[This Newspaper Report] Yesterday evening at 6:45 PM, at the intersection of the Songhu Railway and Yixian Road, half a kilometer from the Jiangwan Station, a tragic accident occurred in which a train and a truck collided. The truck overturned, and nine people were injured on the spot, including several with life-threatening injuries. The Dongmao Transportation Motor Vehicle Company, driven by driver Zhang Renxue, drove truck number 36765 from the North Railway Station to Wusong at around 5:50 PM yesterday afternoon, carrying many passengers. In the middle of the journey, more than 20 soldiers from the machine gun platoon and sanitation team of the 3rd Company of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the Youth Army 202nd Division requested a ride. Driver Zhang Xue仁 could not persuade them, so they all climbed on. When it reached Yixian Road (formerly known as Wai Ma Road) in Jiangwan, the road was rugged, and the truck body kept shaking. At the intersection of the railway and the road, one of the soldiers, Chen Dexing, was seriously injured by the impact. Traffic police officer Ye Zhangshi, number 2294, arrived upon hearing the report and ordered the driver and the truck to be taken to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau for investigation. After much negotiation, the truck was turned back to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau. It was 6:45 PM, and it was already dark. A train from Hejiawan Station to Shanghai happened to be arriving at the location. Crossing guard Zhong Baoxiang was negligent and did not lower the signal pole. At this time, the truck driven by Zhang Xue仁 was running at full speed, intending to cross the tracks, but could not brake in time and collided with the rear half of the train engine, causing it to overturn. The train was slightly shaken and continued on its way. The truck overturned, and the passengers fell to the ground. Five people were seriously injured, with blood and flesh blurred, and were unconscious. Later, ambulances from the police and fire department arrived and sent them to the Railway Hospital. One person who was slightly injured was also sent to the Railway Hospital. Two people were sent to the Police Hospital. Another person was sent to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment. The complete list of injured is as follows: (1) Sent to the Railway Hospital: Chen Dexing (most seriously injured), Zhu Yaozu, Wang Kang, Cao Ming, Zhou Zhirong (slightly injured). (All of the above are soldiers from the sanitation team of the Youth Army 202nd Division). Ye Huanyu (communication soldier of the 1st Battalion of the 202nd Division). (2) Sent to the Police Hospital: Ye Zhangting, Zhang Xueren.

The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government had originally planned to hold a collective swearing-in ceremony at the Great Victory Auditorium yesterday. However, the list of district chiefs, after being submitted to the Ministry of Interior by the Municipal Government, was not approved as scheduled.

### Head of Counterfeit Legal Tender and US Dollar Operation Surrenders; Clues to Accomplices Discovered; Possible Roundup in One or Two Days

The Second Investigation Brigade of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Command recently cracked a counterfeit legal tender and US dollar operation in Caohejing. The evidence and witnesses were all seized on the spot, and the main culprit, a Soviet named Luo Gaoqingkaofu, confessed to all his crimes. However, he claimed that he was only responsible for the plate-making and printing work, and that the distribution was not done by him. Therefore, the number of legal tender and US dollars that have already been issued is difficult to ascertain for the time being. It is heard that the Garrison Command has also obtained leads to Luo Gaoqingkaofu's accomplices and may be able to round them up within one or two days. It is also learned that the owner of the house where Luo Gaoqingkaofu's printing operation was located, Zhang Ziwen, was out when the case was cracked a few days ago and was not apprehended. Zhang surrendered to the Second Investigation Brigade on his own initiative at 11:00 AM yesterday. He was granted bail due to illness at the time. Zhang denied any knowledge of the counterfeit currency operation, but Luo Gaoqingkaofu rented Zhang's house at a high price of one million yuan per month, which raises some doubts. The investigators in this case will continue to investigate.

### Land Bureau Proposes Three Measures to Handle Unfinished Procedures for Land Allocation in the Central District

[Our Dispatch] The Land Bureau took over more than 5,000 mu of civilian land in the Jiangwan, Yinhang, and Yinxiang districts, which were requisitioned by the former Municipal Government for the construction of the central district. Due to the loss and incompleteness of the original case files, it is difficult to reorganize them. The former Municipal Government established the Central District Construction Committee and the Economic Management Committee for the Central District, and announced the "Regulations on Land Allocation in the Central District of Shanghai" and the "Measures for Employees of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and Government Agencies to Purchase Land in the Central District," and stipulated regulations on collecting overdue interest on land waste fees and paying official interest to facilitate the smooth implementation. All work was suspended after the outbreak of the war, and the area was heavily damaged by the enemy army, resulting in drastic changes. After the victory, many original landowners came to inquire about unfinished procedures. In addition to the unpaid price portion, the Land Bureau had previously formulated measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The bureau has also formulated measures to handle the delayed cancellation of title deeds and land occupied by the enemy army, and will submit them to the Municipal Government for approval. The measures are:

(1) For the portion of the original owners who delayed canceling the title deeds: Announce to the original owners a deadline to cancel the title deeds, and declare that after the deadline, the title deeds will only be used as vouchers for receiving the land price and will not have other legal effects.

(2) For the portion of allocated land occupied by the enemy army: Follow the four principles for handling land according to the order of the Executive Yuan and handle it according to the compensation method.

(3) Regarding the overdue interest on land waste fees and the payment of official interest: There are no clear records in the original files, it is difficult to investigate, and the amounts are small, so it is proposed to waive them.

The above measures, along with the entire process of clearing up the land allocation in the former central district, will be reported to the Municipal Government for approval. In addition, in order to complete the handling of this case, the Land Bureau cannot do it alone. Therefore, it is requested that the Municipal Government order the relevant bureaus to organize a temporary handling agency to assist in the process so that it can be completed as soon as possible.

### Fake Lawyers on Wanted List Allowed to Register After Suspension Period Expires

[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Judicial Administration has limited the resumption of business for "fake lawyers" who appeared in the fake courts during the occupation period to perform legal business. According to judicial sources, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has also decided on a handling method for "fake lawyers" who were previously wanted. The general idea is: "If the lawyer was only wanted for appearing in the fake court and has no other crimes, after the suspension period expires, he may be allowed to obtain a guarantee letter from two or more recommended officials and personally report to the local district court. After verification, the court will forward a request to cancel the wanted status and allow registration. As for those who have received lawyer certificates issued by fake organizations, they should apply for new certificates, and the deadline is extended to the end of this month."

### US President Lines Adds Two Perfectly Equipped Ships on Pacific Route

[Our Dispatch] The US President Lines is actively planning to build new ships. Two ships have been added to the Pacific route, one named President Cleveland and the other named President Wilson. Each ship has a gross tonnage of 22,900 tons, a length of 610 feet, and a width of 75 feet. They are powered by electric propulsion engines with 20,000 horsepower and a speed of 21 knots per hour.

The first ship, President Cleveland, will be completed and sail in July of this year, and the second ship, President Wilson, is scheduled to be completed and sail in September. After the victory, only the Monroe and Polk were operating on the company's around-the-world route, which was insufficient. Recently, the company and the US Maritime Commission planned to build five around-the-world ships, each with a gross tonnage of 11,250 tons and a length of 536 feet. They can carry 189 passengers and have a speed of 19 knots per hour, which is twice the size of the Monroe and other ships. After completion, there will be seven ships operating on the around-the-world route.

### Grand Gathering at Yiyuan; Bank of Communications Holds Lunch Yesterday to Commemorate 40th Anniversary

The Bank of Communications has reached its 40th anniversary. The bank held a commemorative meeting at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM yesterday. Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, came to Shanghai yesterday to participate. Other guests included Zhang Jiaao, President of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun and Chen Hang, Vice Presidents, Huo Baoshu, Director of the Banknote Issuing Administration, Wu Rencang, Director of the China Trust Bureau, Xu Ji, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Li Fuxun, Chairman of the Banking Association, Wang Zhengting, Central Committee Member, and representatives from various agencies, shareholders, employees, and their families, totaling more than 2,000 people. The commemorative meeting was presided over by Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Bank. Qian delivered a speech on the spot, reporting on the establishment and business development of the bank, and encouraged colleagues to work together to fulfill the mission entrusted by the government. Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister, then delivered a speech, stating that the Bank of Communications has achieved remarkable results under the leadership of Chairman Qian and General Manager Zhao. He hopes that the bank's colleagues will continue to work hard and serve the country and society more. Wang Zhengting, Zhang Jiaao, and Quan, the former chairman of the bank, also delivered speeches, encouraging everyone. Zhang was one of the founders of the bank and was particularly moved by the past difficulties. Now that they have been overcome one by one, he hopes that the bank's colleagues will strive for business development in the future. Xu, the Vice Minister, then proposed an ad hoc motion that Mr. Hu Jiang, the former chairman of the bank, was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in August 1938 and flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing. He was unfortunately killed by enemy aircraft fire, making him the first person in the financial community to sacrifice for the War of Resistance. He proposed that a statue of Hu be cast and displayed in the Bank of Communications to commemorate him and honor his loyalty. The entire venue unanimously approved. The ceremony was then completed with a group photo and lunch. In the afternoon, there were also recreational activities such as employee ball games, qingchang, Ping opera, and magic, which ended happily at around 4:00 PM.

### Many Indictments for Traitor Cases; Gu Nanqun Not Indicted

[Our Dispatch] Chen Zizheng from Shanxi was accused of handing over factories to the puppet regime after the so-called "Return to the Capital" during the occupation period in Shanghai, based on the enemy's guidelines for handling factories managed by the enemy army. These included the Hengda New Ji Textile Factory, located on South Street, Yangsi District, Pudong, and the Hengxingtai Oil Mill, located in Hebei, Caojiadu. Chen was assigned by the puppet regime to receive them. He later served as the manager of the Xinda Yarn Factory. The High Prosecutor's Office has completed its investigation and filed a public indictment on suspicion of treason. However, it is heard that Chen has already fled back to Shanxi. In addition, the treason suspicion case of Huang Yaqiang and others, and the enemy collusion suspicion case of foreign national Luo Jiaxuefu and others have been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. Gu Nanqun was accused of having many enemy agents lurking in the Nanyang Hospital when he was the director of the hospital. Chiang Bocheng was captured by the enemy army while being treated at Nanyang Hospital. After the victory, Gu was reported on suspicion of treason. After investigation by the Commercial Inspection Office, he was not prosecuted.

### Xia Peizhen Case Sets Precedent; Prosecutor Wins Appeal; Opium Offenders Can Be Exempt from Execution of Sentence if They Can Quit

[Our Dispatch] Since the victory and restoration, the government has been determined to ban opium and drugs, and the city's police authorities have made every effort to implement this policy. However, during the occupation period in this city, a large number of citizens were poisoned by the enemy. Therefore, the judicial authorities still adhere to the principle of actively influencing opium addicts and turning them from bad to good, giving them the opportunity to renew and improve. The District Prosecutor's Office once applied for exemption from the execution of the original sentence for Xia Peizhen, an opium addict, in accordance with the Law on Security Measures. At that time, the District Court rejected the application on the grounds that the defendant had been addicted to opium for a long time and needed to serve a full year before being able to adapt to the four seasons. Prosecutor Chuanbang of the District Prosecutor's Office appealed to the High Court. It is now learned that he has won the legal victory. The High Court collegially held that the defendant had served the detoxification sentence for two months, and the forensic medical examination showed that there were no signs of opium addiction, which is in line with the requirements of Article 88, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and that the execution of the sentence should be waived. The addiction to opium waxes and wanes with the change of seasons is also not supported by medical theory. The appeal should be considered reasonable, the original ruling should be revoked, and the imprisonment of Xia Peizhen should be waived. Although Xia has been released from prison under the amnesty, it has set a precedent for the problem of executing prison sentences for opium addicts after detoxification.

### Suspect of Colluding with Enemy and Trafficking Drugs, Former Puppet Yinxiang Township Chief Arrested

[Our Dispatch] Shi Jianqing, who served as the puppet Yinxiang Township Chief, Section Chief of the puppet China Trust Bureau, and technician of the puppet Ministry of Transportation, was recently secretly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office by residents of Tilan Bridge in this city. According to the secret report, Shi embezzled 500 dan of rice allocated by the puppet municipal government during his tenure as the puppet Yinxiang Township Chief, and opened the Yongda Drug Rehabilitation Center, openly selling drugs and other crimes. After the victory, he hid in the countryside for a long time, and recently appeared in this city again, and is still engaged in his old business of drug trafficking. Prosecutors and police officers have arrested him for interrogation based on the secret report and taken him into custody. The portion of the charge of treason will be transferred to the High Court for handling after the District Prosecutor's Office completes its investigation of his drug trafficking portion.

### Female Doctor Commits Suicide

### Revitalizing Greater Shanghai; Municipal Government Has New Measures; Funds for Construction Projects in Each District to be Raised Locally; Municipal Council Approves Implementation

In order to establish local undertakings and revitalize Greater Shanghai, the Municipal Government has formulated the "Measures for Raising Funds for Undertakings in Shanghai," with reference to the actual situation in this city.

The measures for raising funds for undertakings are: (1) The funds for undertakings in each district shall be raised through donations from the residents of each district.

### New Tools for Propaganda: An Overview of Radio Stations in This City

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Before the war, Shanghai had forty to fifty radio stations. After the victory, the number of restored and newly established stations reached as many as one hundred and five, including public, commercial, foreign-owned, semi-public/semi-commercial, and foreign stations with political backing. With so many stations, the airwaves were clearly chaotic. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters' Radio Inspection Section, in accordance with the Ministry of Communications' regulations, stipulated that Shanghai's public and commercial radio stations should not exceed ten K.C. (kilocycles), and foreigners were not allowed to set up radio stations in the country. After several months of rectification and suppression, the following eighteen stations were approved and licensed by the Ministry of Communications and remain in operation: China Freedom, Golden Capital, America-Rinji, Great China, Mainland, Eastern Sino-American, Yuanchang Heming, United, Gospel, Five Continents, Cooperation, People's Voice, 99, New Voice, Great China, New Shanghai, Datong, Jiancheng, and Chinese Culture. Among them, America-Rinji, Great China, and Mainland (originally two separate stations) share one kilocycle, while the rest share one kilocycle between two stations. In addition, there are the "Shanghai" station of the Central Broadcasting Administration, the "Municipal Police" station of the Police Bureau, and the "Victory" station of the Military Police Headquarters, which is currently applying for a license, making a total of three public stations.

Among the above twenty-one radio stations, Municipal Police and Victory are exclusively for the police and military police's own business and academic broadcasting, without commercials or entertainment programs. The Gospel radio station is set up to promote Christian doctrine, and apart from broadcasting the "Gospel" and hymns to church members, it does not have commercial advertising.

Regarding the equipment of these radio stations, they generally have simple machine rooms, broadcasting studios, and soundproof rooms. The transmitters they use range from 200 to 500 watts. As for the number of records, there is a significant disparity among the stations, but they can be rented from record companies at any time.

In terms of programming, the content is changed monthly, with little difference between stations. Entertainment and advertising programs are divided into storytelling, commentaries, Peking opera, spoken drama, Shanghai opera, Yue opera, freestyle singing, songs, comedy, stories, and other categories. Educational programs such as America-Rinji's radio science, Yuanchang Heming's law, and Chinese Culture's science lectures occupy only 15 to 20 percent of the daily program schedule because they are free broadcasts. According to the person in charge of the trade association, they often receive letters from listeners requesting more educational programs, which is a good sign. Among the entertainment programs mentioned above, the Shanghai opera by the Wenbin and Zhongyi drama troupes, the Yue opera by the Danggui and Fu Quanxiang drama troupes, and the comedy by Zhou Bochun and Yao Mushuang all have a large audience, so their prices are mostly around two million yuan per month. If the host personally broadcasts or adds a special program, an additional 400,000 to 500,000 yuan or more is required. Peking opera and singing are second. Each station has special programs on Sundays.

Radio station electricity rates are calculated on a monthly basis and are determined by the association. Every forty minutes is called a "block" (from the first day of next month, it will be changed to thirty minutes per block). The two blocks from 8:40 PM to 10:00 PM are the most expensive, at 850,000 yuan. Between 5:20 PM and 8:40 PM, each block is 800,000 yuan. Between 11:20 AM and 5:20 PM, each block is 650,000 yuan. The remaining blocks are all 400,000 yuan, from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily. In addition, there are small announcements, reported three times a day for 150,000 yuan, and full-day reports for 500,000 yuan. The average monthly income for each station, after deducting expenses and taxes, is around five million yuan. There are rumors outside that there is a black market for radio advertising, but the association explains that this is extremely rare. However, because rebroadcasting programs from various theaters requires installing equipment and additional management costs, it may be unavoidable to add to the customer's burden.

It is worth mentioning that each station has one or two female announcers. Their salaries are not high, but most of them are interested in the profession, opening up a new path for women's careers.

Among the public radio stations, the "Shanghai" station is the largest in scale. In terms of organization, equipment, and programming, it can be called the best in the country. The entire station employs more than one hundred people, and the transmission department has more than ten foreign staff members. The station currently has one shortwave transmitter with a wavelength of 25 meters, which is used exclusively for broadcasting news to foreign countries. It has three medium-wave transmitters, using 900, 800, and 740 KC. In addition to regularly broadcasting news, current affairs commentaries, literature and art, education, and community service programs, it also engages in advertising. After the closure of Soviet, American, and other radio stations, foreign advertising has all moved to the Shanghai Radio Station. Its music program is specially arranged and organized by experts, with composers as a unit, and generally broadcasts the works of one composer every night.

Recently, in order to expand its business, the Shanghai Radio Station has purchased more than 200 acres of vacant land near the Qiujiang Wharf, and is preparing to build a powerful new radio station, which can start broadcasting this year.

Spring is the season for broadcasting. I hope that the market can improve day by day, allowing the gentle tones of the radio hostesses to be broadcast into everyone's heart.

### (1) Selling a Brother's Property Without Permission

Li Danwen asks: After my father passed away, his estate was divided equally among my three brothers. Now my share has been sold by my eldest brother without permission. I would like to ask: (1) Is it effective to file a report with the local county government? (2) Which agency handles lawsuits in the current county jurisdiction? (3) If the other party also files a report with the court to confirm property rights in the future, how should I respond? (4) If a lawsuit is filed in the future, according to the three-level, three-instance system, must it be filed from the county intermediate court after going through the township office? (5) Is there a fee for filing a report? (6) What are the procedures for hiring a lawyer to litigate on my behalf?

[Union Lawyer Answers] (1) If property is sold by others without authorization, it cannot be remedied by filing a report. A lawsuit should be filed with the judicial authority where the real estate is located, requesting that the sale be declared invalid. This is a civil lawsuit, and not only must a complaint be filed, but the person himself or a litigation agent must appear in court to testify.

### Tensions Run High in Basketball League: Shantou Team Wins Hard-Fought Victory Against Giant; 28-25, a Three-Point Defeat of a Strong Opponent; Nearly a Thousand Spectators Rejoice

[Report by Our Newspaper] The Navy-Marine Corps Youth Team (Hai Lu Qing) formally sent a letter yesterday to the Basketball League Committee to withdraw from the competition. The reason given was that, in addition to the eight players selected from the Columbus team, the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team also had two representatives chosen to represent the navy in Qingdao. Moreover, due to the intense matches with various teams in recent days, many players were injured. The committee has approved their request, and therefore, all of the team's results will be canceled and not counted. The Giant team benefited greatly from this, gaining a significant advantage. The team was overjoyed to receive this news before the match.

Last night, in the Group A match, the Shantou team defeated the Giant team 28-25, maintaining their winning streak with six wins and zero losses. Nearly a thousand spectators were visibly delighted. In the Group A2 match, Jia Shen defeated Huayang 41-29. Shantou's actions sometimes seemed overly aggressive. The details of the matches are as follows:

Jia Shen Defeats Huayang

The Huayang vs. Jia Shen match was in Group A2. In the first half, Jia Shen was more active, with the "fat guys" (Huayang) trailing by four points, the score being 20-16. Resuming the game, Huayang's Sun Mingxin and Chen Zhaoting each scored two consecutive baskets, suddenly tying the score at 20-20. The situation changed, and soon they took the lead at 24-23. Jia Shen did not dare to relax; Xia Zeren led the attack, and indeed, all forces were mobilized. Soon, they regained the lead at 31-25. The "fat guys" only had five players last night, and after 45 minutes of running around, they all felt powerless. At 31-25, Jia Shen's Tao Yingshi fouled out for the fourth time, and Yan Shilu replaced him. The final score was 41-29, with Jia Shen winning.

Shantou Team Wins Against Giant

Chen Qingjiang broke through on the left and made a jump shot. This shot was crisp. Vonick reciprocated, but Chiang Sheh-lai fouled Qingjiang, giving him one point. N. Sassis also fouled, but Ji Nankang missed both free throws. Qingjiang made the score 5-2. The Giant team called a timeout, and He Lide also managed to score a basket (7-2). Tao Bolingji scored on a free throw, and Sassis scored under the basket. Chen again took over, and Lide continued to contribute, bringing the score to 11-5. Cai Yanxiong added another basket, making it 13-6. The Giant team desperately counterattacked, but with little effect. In the first half, the Shantou team led 18-10, and the spectators were overjoyed.

Because the Giant team was unaware that this match was related to the championship (due to the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team withdrawing), they had not gathered their star player, Gu Fo, and proceeded carelessly. In the second half, Jelong and Tao Bolingji increased the score by three points. The Shantou team called a timeout, making it 19-13. Lin Weicong replaced Ji Nankang, and Tao scored again, making it 19-15. The Shantou team panicked and called another timeout. Vonick made a long shot (21-17), and Lin Weicong quickly scored two points, making it 24-18. "Monkey" Tao Bolingji and Jelong scored, leaving only four minutes, with only a one-point difference (24-23). Cai and He each scored on free throws. Jelong made an odd shot, still with a one-point difference. Lin passed to Cai, who made a long shot. At this point, the Shantou team voluntarily gave up two free throws. The center pass came, and with 35 seconds left, Cai fouled out. Tao also fouled out ten seconds later, a coincidence. The final score was 28-25, with the Shantou team winning, but with much effort.

### Kangqiao Cup Awards Ceremony and Performance Yesterday: Xuanle Defeats Zhihe

The award ceremony for the small rubber ball competition organized by the Kangqiao Sports Association was held yesterday, presided over by Hou Junren, the district chief of the 12th district. After the awards were presented, there were originally two performance matches scheduled. However, the Kangqiao vs. Ye Qing match could not be held because Ye Qing was participating in the Mengxian Cup, and the schedules conflicted.

### Hubei Football and Basketball Teams Will Visit Beijing and Shanghai

[Report from Hankou by Our Newspaper] After the Hubei provincial football and basketball teams won the double championship in the Central China Games, their self-confidence has greatly increased. It is generally believed that when the "Hongxiang" and "Zhengxun" teams came to Hankou before, the Wuhan teams were still disorganized and could not withstand a strong enemy. This time, they showed their skills in Central China, which was due to the weaker strength of the Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi teams, but also due to the progress of Hubei's football skills in the past six months. Therefore, the local sports community suggested that these two representative teams should be slightly adjusted to prepare for visits to Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Anhui to make further observations. It is reported that this proposal is gradually becoming more concrete, and once the travel expenses are raised, a departure date can be set.

### Notes from the Basketball Court

Last night in the basketball league, the Shantou team maintained their winning streak, defeating the Giants by three points.

The Giants had already lost to the National Final, and their morale was low. Their star player, Gu Fo, did not play in yesterday's match. At the start of the match, they learned that the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team had forfeited twice, and their qualifications were canceled according to the rules, and their past results were not counted. In this way, the Giants only lost to Hualian in one match, and they still had a glimmer of hope for the championship. The whole team was determined to fight hard, and the battle situation became intense.

The Shantou team has been in good condition recently. The main reason for their victory last night was their consistent caution and cherishing of possession of the ball, rarely wasting it. Although they were under constant threat, they were finally able to maintain their victory. In the first half, Chen Qingjiang and He Lide were active, leading by as many as four goals with a score of 18-10. In the second half, Chen was closely guarded by N. Sassis, and He was also restrained by Vonick. Jelong also performed beyond his usual level, and the Shantou team was caught in a hard fight.

At 19-13, Lin Wei saw that the situation was not good and replaced Ji Nankang.

The Giants twice forced the score to be close at 24-23 and 26-25. Yanxiong's shot secured the victory.

If Gu Fo had been present, the situation would have been favorable to the Giants, and the battle would have been even more exciting.

Cai Yanxiong was a hero for the Shantou team. Apart from Du Lai, the Giants performed well, and Jelong's shooting and Tao Bolingji's intrusions posed a great threat to the Shantou team. (Changnian)

### Plan for Transferring State-Owned Enterprises to Private Operation: Committee Held Second Meeting Yesterday; Passed More Than Ten Draft Articles on Sale Methods, Carried to the Capital by Vice President Weng for Approval

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Planning Committee for Transferring State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Operation held its second meeting at the Bank of China Building in this city at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday.  Executive Yuan Vice President Wen personally attended and presided over the meeting. Wang Yunwu, Zhang Gongquan, Liu Gongyun, Li Fuson, Chen Guangfu, Qin Jianqing, Dong Daoren, Yang Gongren, Xu Kan, Hu Yunqiu, and others were present.  The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.  More than ten draft articles on the methods of selling state-owned production enterprises were immediately approved.  The draft articles contain detailed regulations on the steps, methods, timing, application procedures, and conditions for the sale. During yesterday's meeting, opinions were sought from the attendees on each article.  The extracted results were carried to the capital today by Vice President Weng to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation, so as to make a final decision.

Furthermore, Vice President Weng told reporters after the meeting: Since the first meeting of this committee was held in Shanghai on the 22nd of last month, several consultations have also been held in the capital. This meeting still focuses on the exchange of opinions, so as to facilitate submission to the Executive Yuan for approval later. As for the method of transferring to private operation, the overall plan has not yet been finalized, so it is not convenient to disclose it beforehand. However, the principle is to sell directly to private operation. He believes that the entire plan can be implemented within a month after it is finalized.

[Another Dispatch] According to informed sources: The methods for transferring state-owned production enterprises to private operation will generally adopt a bidding method for small-scale production enterprises. Large-scale production enterprises will be divided into several systematic and related segments according to the nature of their business, and then transferred to private investment and operation in stages and batches by issuing stocks. The valuation of each enterprise may be difficult. However, because there was a valuation list for the takeover at the time of the initial takeover, it can also be used as a reference for valuation.

### National Banks and Bureaus Promote Deposit Business: Four Banks Joint Office Formulates Outline

The Four Banks Joint Office, considering that the deposit business of various national banks and bureaus was quite developed before the war, but during the war, due to the impact of rising prices and high market interest rates, some deposits gradually left the banks. Since the restoration, this phenomenon has not been eliminated, so it has formulated a seven-point outline to strengthen and promote the deposit business of various banks and bureaus, and ordered all branches to handle it. The content is recorded as follows:

(1) The local branches should discuss and adjust the deposit interest rate standards with reference to the local market conditions, and the local banks and bureaus should handle it consistently. (2) The Farmers Bank and the Cooperative Treasury should universally promote rural savings. (3) The postal savings business should be popularized in the interior, and a comprehensive campaign should be launched to encourage savings, and the Central Bank should give preferential transfer interest rates. (4) Conduct various trust and special savings deposits to stimulate depositors' interest (such as group dividend deposits, etc.) (5) Simplify deposit and withdrawal procedures, and allow fixed deposit receipts to be pledged at any time, and the interest taken shall not be higher than 30% of the deposit interest. Priority should be given to depositors' remittances. (6) The Ministry of Finance shall supervise commercial banks and villages to expand the absorption of deposits, and shall be allowed to transfer deposits to the Central Bank at the most preferential interest. (7) When commercial banks and villages stop business or go bankrupt, the Ministry of Finance shall order them to clear all deposits within the shortest period of time to protect the interests of depositors and increase public confidence in the banks.

(Another Dispatch) After the promulgation of the Outline for National Banks and Bureaus to Promote Deposit Business, a reporter from the Joint Credit Information Center specially visited the person in charge of the Four Banks Joint Office to inquire about the situation of bank deposit business and the prospects after the implementation of the Outline. The person in charge informed that bank deposits have three significant characteristics: (1) The proportion of current deposits is increasing, and the proportion of fixed deposits is decreasing. (2) The proportion of institutional deposits is increasing, and the proportion of industrial, commercial, and individual deposits is decreasing. (3) The nominal figures of deposits are increasing, and the actual monetary value of deposits is decreasing.

The various items stipulated in this Outline, such as adjusting deposit interest rates, intensifying savings absorption, simplifying deposit and withdrawal, and protecting the interests of depositors, are all countermeasures against current malpractices. The government has been engaged in saving expenses and increasing income in order to stabilize the monetary value. Recently, the trading of gold has been banned, the circulation of foreign currency has been prohibited, the prices of necessities have been controlled, and hoarding has been strictly prohibited. In the future, the outlets for hot money will tend to narrow, and it may gradually return to banks and be deposited. National banks and bureaus are implementing government policies and handling loans for production enterprises, and it is appropriate to take this opportunity to actively promote deposit business, intensify the absorption of hot money, and use the contraction of currency to assist production, which is truly a win-win situation.

### Taiwan Sugar Refineries Plan to Sell by Unit

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that the current estimated value of Taiwan Sugar Corporation is NT$30 billion. The company has a total of 36 sugar refinery units. Relevant parties have stated that in the current period of rampant high-interest loans, it may not be possible to fully promote the transfer to private operation by issuing stocks. It is better to sell the affiliated sugar refineries by unit for private investment and operation. It is learned that the daily sugar extraction capacity of each sugar refinery unit varies from 1,000 tons to 3,600 tons. The estimated value of each unit ranges from US$2 million to US$3 million. If they can be sold by unit, there will inevitably be competition between factories, which can also improve the production efficiency of each sugar refinery.

### Raising Deposit Interest Rates by National Banks Still Awaiting Careful Consideration

[Report from Our Newspaper] A certain senior person in the financial community stated: The Ministry of Finance is still carefully studying the plan to raise interest rates by national banks, and implementation is still pending. It is heard that many senior officials of the Ministry of Finance oppose this method, and their main reasons are three: (1) If the interest rates of national banks are raised, the hidden interest rates in the market may also rise, and the result will stimulate prices and oppress legitimate industry and commerce. At the same time, in terms of the current trend of prices, it is quite difficult to absorb a large amount of hot money by raising interest rates. (2) After national banks absorb deposits, they will in principle lend them out at low interest rates. In this situation, unscrupulous merchants may use various methods to deposit funds borrowed at low interest into national banks at high interest, or flow into the black market at high interest, and this kind of malpractice is difficult to prevent. (3) If national banks absorb deposits at high interest rates and release them at low interest rates, the resulting deficit will inevitably be huge. If the national treasury subsidizes it, it will inevitably expand the fiscal deficit and accelerate the issuance of currency, which is greatly contrary to the purpose of stabilizing the entire economy.

### Export Commodity Trends After Foreign Exchange Adjustment

— Zhang Bo'an

Since the beginning of spring, Shanghai's export commodities, first stimulated by the subsidy policy, and then by the foreign exchange adjustment, have all risen in unison, creating the largest wave since the victory. The trends of each commodity are described below:

(1) Tung Oil The recent price of tung oil has increased by 290% compared with the end of last year. If calculated based on the recent price in New York of US$0.375 per pound, the delivery price in New York is equivalent to CN¥500,400. The price in various British territories in Europe ranges from £220 to £245 per ton, and the equivalent CN¥ price is as high as CN¥500,000 and as low as CN¥440,000. After deducting freight, insurance, and taxes, the domestic price is too high, and it is mostly impossible to export. Moreover, the current inventory in various producing areas in China is extremely thin, and the new oil extraction is expected to start at the end of this month. If new goods are launched on the market, the domestic price may be reduced.

(2) Hog Bristles The increase in hog bristles is also very high. Shanghai No. 17 black hog bristles, weighing 133 pounds per case, have risen from CN¥1,020,000 to CN¥3,000,000, an increase of 294%. Hankou No. 17 black hog bristles have risen from CN¥1,400,000 to CN¥5,500,000, an increase of 392%. Chongqing No. 27 black hog bristles have risen from CN¥1,300,000 to CN¥3,900,000, an increase of 300%. Currently, the US government is selling pre-war inventories, so except for Shanghai, which is uniquely popular, other bristles such as Sichuan, Hankou, and Tianjin are very weak. The New York market price for Shanghai bristles is US$2.10 per pound, equivalent to CN¥3,350,000, and Sichuan bristles are US$2.60 per pound, equivalent to CN¥4,150,000. Hankou bristles have fallen from US$4.20 to US$3.50, equivalent to CN¥5,780,000. According to the current price, it has also hit the top. The export volume of hog bristles last year was 9,000,000 pounds. After the foreign exchange adjustment this year, it has risen three times, so the export is expected to increase.

(3) Tea The export of tea has long been hindered by the excessively low foreign price. After the foreign exchange adjustment, the increase rate is only 170%, which is not as high as others. The current authorities have frequently paid attention to the export of Chinese tea. If a bumper harvest is obtained this year, the export can be increased. The export volume of tea last year was 7,500,000 pounds, only one-tenth of that before the war.

(4) Casings According to industry insiders, the export value of casings this year can reach 8,000 barrels, with a total value of US$52 million. The appreciation rate is 654%, which is better than the rate of any other export commodity. Currently, the New York market price has fallen from US$0.62 per pair to US$0.52 per pair. Buyers are waiting and seeing, and there is still a downward trend. Therefore, the equivalent CN¥ price per barrel is CN¥7,800,000, deducting freight and other expenses of CN¥1,000,000, for a total of CN¥6,800,000. However, the manufacturing cost of Shanghai casings is CN¥7,600,000, and the current price is CN¥7,200,000, which is tantamount to losing money. Therefore, export transportation still depends on lower production costs to be able to do it.

(5) Feathers The increase rate of feathers has also reached 220% to 285%. Recently, sales have been booming. Foreign merchants have frequently favored them, and foreign goods have come one after another. The domestic price is still low and the foreign price is not weak, which is quite a feeling of prosperity for a while.

(6) Raw Silk The increase rate of raw silk can be said to be one of the lowest of export commodities. The highest increase rate is only 170%. Recently, the market situation has been poor, and holders have sold off one after another. Foreign firms are not moving forward. Jardine Matheson and Swedish firms are cutting prices sharply, and only Indian firm Haiwu is still interested, so the market situation is still difficult to look at.

(Other) Other items such as frozen eggs and egg yolks have also been resurrected recently. Wuzi cannot be exported. Lace, handicrafts, foreign pillows, straw hats, buttons, etc., have been affected by the rise in market prices and frequent price cuts abroad, so exports have been greatly affected.

### After the Adjustment of Consolidated Tax and Stamp Tax, Flour Manufacturers Put Forward Requirements: (1) Cancel Price Limit and Restore Free Trade (2) Add CN¥819 Per Bag of Flour

The Fourth District Flour Industry Association, due to the Ministry of Finance's increase in taxes on flour, decided to report to Mayor Wu today to adjust prices and request the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original tax rate. According to Mr. Cao Qidong, the person in charge of Fuxin Flour Mill, the mill recently received a letter from the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance stating that each mill must calculate stamp tax at a rate of 3 per thousand in the future. At the same time, a letter from the Commodity Tax Bureau stated that the consolidated tax on flour has been changed to CN¥1,000 per bag since the 10th, an increase of CN¥700 compared to the previous rate, and the tax difference for the week from the 3rd to the 9th of this month must also be recovered. In the past, when the flour distribution meeting was held in the municipal government, Mayor Wu allowed each mill to pay CN¥20 per bag for stamp tax for the distribution of essential goods for people's livelihood, regardless of the distribution price. Currently, the mill's distribution price is CN¥45,000, and the stamp tax for this week's distribution will be CN¥115 more per bag than the previous CN¥20. The cost per bag of flour is between CN¥52,500 and CN¥55,000. China Trading Bureau distributes 100,000 bags of foreign flour at CN¥30,000 per bag, but the factory must advance 200,000 bags of flour. Although the government has subsidies, the difference can only offset each other, and there is no profit at all. Moreover, Mayor Wu had already recognized the cost item as the minimum price limit. Now that the government has increased taxes from the Ministry of Finance to balance revenue and expenditure, the government's tax revenue is not levied on the factory's profits, but directly transfers its property to the national treasury. Therefore, the factory requires two points: (1) Within the current price limit, the additional tax amount will be borne by the consumer, and CN¥815 will be added per bag of flour. (2) If the price limit system for flour can be cancelled and free trade can be restored, the factory will abide by the government's increased tax rate. He continued to say that recently, China Trading Bureau and China Cereals Corporation, two institutions, have thrown out huge amounts of benefit flour on the free market, while private flour mills are suffering through difficult years for the national economy and people's livelihood under the government's price limit policy.

### Cube Sugar Waiting for Shipment to Shanghai

Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in view of the need for cube sugar, in order to adapt to the market, has moved the selection of high-grade raw materials from the Taiwan Provincial Head Office to process and manufacture a kind of snow-white cube sugar, which has now been produced in large quantities and is waiting for shipment to Shanghai. The first batch has more than 1,000 boxes, each box containing 25 pounds, and the selling price is estimated at CN¥3,000 per box. It is also learned that during the turmoil in Taiwan Province last time, all 17,000 employees of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, including the Huwei, Tainan Madou, Xinying and Kaohsiung Dong et al. Companies, and the machinery, etc., were all safe, and there was no problem with the sugar supply.

### Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Plans Production

The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, jointly operated by the government and merchants, has recently formulated a production plan since its establishment in late last month. The company's Pudong smelting furnace, Wusong steelmaking furnace, and Huangxing Road steel rolling mill are expected to start construction in May. The steelmaking furnace will produce 670 tons of steel per day, and the steel rolling mill will roll 200 tons of steel per day, with a value of CN¥4 billion. After construction starts, the amount of scrap iron smelted per month in this city will be more than 1,500 tons. The amount that was previously sent to Japan because it could not be used can all be recovered by the factory. China Trading Bureau's Ma Yuanyou has 4,000 to 5,000 tons of scrap iron seized from the enemy, which will also be smelted and cast by the factory. The 3,000-horsepower machine of the entire factory has been approved by the Public Utilities Bureau's Standing Review Committee to connect to electricity, and the construction will be completed soon. It will become the only large-scale smelting factory in Shanghai after the Shanghai stock issue. Its products will be used for machinery manufacturing and the construction industry.

### Lottery for Unified B Type and C Type Public Bonds on the 10th of Next Month

The 23rd redemption lottery for the B type bonds of the Ministry of Finance's 25th Year Unified Public Bonds totals 36 branches, totaling CN¥12.6 million. The 16th redemption lottery for the 27th Year National Defense Public Bonds totals 10 branches, totaling CN¥500,000. The 7th lottery for the 3rd installment of the 30th Year Construction Public Bonds totals 5 branches, totaling CN¥2 million. It has been decided that the above three types of bonds will be drawn on the 10th of next month at the Ministry's Shanghai Office.

### Silver Shops May Reopen, Gold Allocation Not Yet Approved

The silver shop industry in this city has been ordered to suspend business for more than a month. After repeated appeals from the industry, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to reopen and will announce the operating regulations for the silver shop industry the day after tomorrow (the 19th). It is heard that the free trading of gold may be allowed, but the Central Bank will no longer allocate it. Therefore, the silver shop industry is still extremely panicked after hearing the news and has sent representative Yao Guiqing to Beijing yesterday morning. Labor representatives are also scheduled to depart for Beijing today to petition the Third Plenary Session, requesting the restoration of the allocation.

### Representatives of Import and Export Industries to Petition Central Bank Today

The Import and Export Industry Association originally scheduled to petition Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank, last Sunday, but since some opinions had not been agreed upon and it was learned that President Zhang had gone to Beijing on official business, it was decided to send representatives to petition today, requesting the improvement of import and export settlement and import methods.

### Rubber Import Quotas Too Small, Manufacturers Request Appropriate Relaxation, and Differentiation of Raw Rubber and Products

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Rubber Industry Association submitted a document to the Import Control Committee last week, requesting that the import quota of raw rubber be re-determined according to actual needs, and that raw rubber and products be differentiated, and that the import of old tires and waste materials be prohibited. The reasons were that according to actual field investigations, rubber factories in Shanghai alone need 1,739.5 tons of raw rubber per month, while the import quota of rubber and products announced by the Import Control Committee for February-April is only US$1.1 million, which is only enough for one month's use in Shanghai! The total amount of raw rubber needed outside of Shanghai is at least equal to Shanghai, so even if the quota is all raw rubber, the national monthly need is US$2 million. However, this mere US$1.1 million needs to be used for three months, and a part of it needs to be allocated to finished products. Therefore, the ratio to actual needs is one to ten. Under this situation, it is difficult to maintain the rubber industry, so it is hoped that the Import Control Committee can酌情 consider the actual situation and relax the quota. In addition, chemicals needed in the rubber industry, such as zinc oxide powder and lithopone powder, etc., also hope that the government can have appropriate allocation. The chairman of the industry association, Hong Nianzu, told reporters: The rubber industry's reputation last year had its special reasons, and this kind of prosperity cannot last. The outside world compares the rubber industry with the cotton textile industry, which is due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation. There are three reasons for the rubber industry's buzz last year: (1) Last year's supply of raw materials had the allocation of enemy property, and the price per pound was always between CN¥500 and CN¥1,000 per pound. In other words, the price of raw materials was quite stable; (2) The dumping of foreign goods last year was not as fierce as imagined; (3) Most of the domestic rubber factories stopped work before the War of Resistance, and the people urgently needed to replenish them after the war, so the demand was greater. With the above three reasons, coupled with the rise in the price of rubber products, which lagged behind the general price level, the people felt it was cheaper and were happy to buy, creating last year's prosperity. This year, all the favorable factors have ceased to exist.

### Yellow Weasel Skin Price Rises, Leather Market Sees Gains and Losses

[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of yellow weasel skin suddenly rose again yesterday, and other fox skins, white dog skins, leopard skins, etc. also rose in unison. It is learned that a certain foreign merchant made a good profit from exporting various skins to Europe and seized the opportunity to absorb them at low prices when the market price fell recently. Because very few goods have recently returned to Shanghai from the producing areas, and the goods in the market are becoming increasingly scarce, the market price has rebounded. It is also heard that a large number of yellow weasel skins have arrived in New York, and buyers are cutting prices sharply. The leather market, raw cowhide, sole leather, etc., has been falling for days, and the market rebounded firmly yesterday. The price of various patterned leathers continues to decline.

### Jinshan Branches Stable

A hundred boxes of Jinshan branches opened yesterday. The goods were still good. The higher price was CN¥660,000, and the next highest was CN¥426,000. The market was flat.

### Introduction: Overview of Listed Stock Manufacturers on the Exchange

### Overseas Chinese Compatriots Passing Through Hong Kong: Extorted Upon Landing, Losing All U.S. Dollars at the Nation's Gate

— Hong Kong, 10th [Day] Airmail Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent, Zi Jian

Since the latter half of last year, an average of two or three American ships carrying overseas Chinese returning to the country have arrived in Hong Kong each month. Smaller ships carry two or three hundred people, while larger ships carry thousands, so the average number of overseas Chinese arriving in Hong Kong each month is generally over a thousand. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, overseas Chinese first encounter exorbitant demands or extortion for baggage handling, and even theft and robbery. Almost every time a larger ship arrives, such as the "General Meigs" or "General Gordon," letters from returning overseas Chinese appear in the newspapers, recounting the suffering of being extorted or having their luggage stolen upon landing. Some people lose their entire lifetime of hard-earned savings abroad when they arrive at their nation's gate! This is truly one of the most unbearable tragedies imaginable!

After the war, Hong Kong promulgated a wharf control ordinance, ostensibly aimed at preventing theft in wharf warehouses and on ships, as well as facilitating friends and relatives meeting ships and travel agencies picking up clients. However, it has largely deprived them of these conveniences. Regardless of who the passengers on the ship are, their friends and relatives can only wait outside the wharf's iron gates, beyond the line of sight. It is said that on the day the Papal Nuncio to China came to Hong Kong on a southern tour, the Governor sent his adjutant to welcome him. That adjutant, thinking himself a special person, did not bring any kind of permit or document in advance, so the wharf guards stopped him. As a result, the adjutant and other priests had to wait for the Papal Nuncio outside the iron gates. Needless to say, the friends and relatives of our returning overseas Chinese compatriots have it even worse!

Overseas Chinese Cry Out About Stolen Luggage

Under such strict controls, it would seem that large pieces of luggage sent from the ship into the warehouse and claimed the next day by returning overseas Chinese with their tickets should not be stolen or lost. But the opposite is true. With each ship arriving in Hong Kong, there are always hundreds of pieces of luggage that go missing. Passengers' luggage is sent to the warehouse, either east wing or west wing, upper level or lower level, for the passengers to find themselves. Passengers run up and down in the warehouse, rummaging through trunks and suitcases. If they find eight out of ten pieces of luggage, they may be willing to sacrifice the two missing pieces if they are not important, because they are already exhausted from wandering around the warehouse for half a day! This ordeal is not only experienced by returning overseas Chinese, but also by passengers who come to Hong Kong from Shanghai on an ocean liner that docks at the Kowloon Wharf terminal across from Hong Kong. Many people must have had such an unforgettable experience.

Coolies Demand U.S. Dollars

When passengers disembark with their small luggage, wharf coolies compete for business, originally charging fifty cents per piece but now demanding three to five dollars. From the ship to the wharf, from the wharf to the customs inspection station, from the customs inspection station to the outside of the wharf's iron gates, there are three stages with three different sets of coolies handling the luggage, each demanding a separate fee, even though the total distance of these three stages is less than three minutes! Why this short distance must be divided among three groups of coolies is truly "Heaven knows." The coolies know that the passengers are returning overseas Chinese, so they refuse anything but U.S. dollars. If you don't pay, they will surround you in groups of three or five, creating a threatening atmosphere. Of course, those who suffer are the people who are "alone and helpless"!

Unforeseen Disaster Causes Indignation

Having traveled thousands of miles to Hong Kong, and after experiencing the above-mentioned ordeals, can returning overseas Chinese finally breathe a sigh of relief and be reunited with their families in their homeland for the rest of their lives? No! No! No! They are destined to suffer. Being ridiculed abroad is not enough, being extorted in Hong Kong is not enough. When they take the train into the homeland, customs officers outside the platform have recently been confiscating the U.S. dollars they have worked so hard to earn over the years, because the government has issued a decree prohibiting the import of foreign currency exceeding one hundred U.S. dollars! This government decree is intended to target illegal merchants, but overseas Chinese who have made great contributions to the country on a daily basis are now suffering an "unforeseen disaster" because of it! If you were an overseas Chinese returning home, how would you feel when the money you earned with blood and sweat is confiscated at the very moment you joyfully step into the nation's gate after enduring so many hardships! What would you do! What would you do!

The government has clearly stipulated, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has also issued express telegrams to overseas Chinese organizations to the effect that foreign currency cannot be brought into the country. So, returning overseas Chinese "fearfully and anxiously" comply by carrying national currency, but the national currency cannot exceed five hundred thousand yuan. What use are a hundred U.S. dollars and five hundred thousand yuan? You may blame the reporter for being too foolish, asking why returning overseas Chinese cannot "remit" their money back to the homeland? Fine, if a returning overseas Chinese has a total of five thousand U.S. dollars, he will receive sixty million yuan in national currency when he remits it back to the homeland. How much will this five thousand dollars be worth in another six months? How much will it be worth in another year? If you have U.S. dollars in your hand, why wouldn't you exchange them all for national currency? Enough, the reporter is not a returning overseas Chinese, but having witnessed the various sufferings of returning overseas Chinese, one cannot help but express a few words of indignation.

Staying in Hong Kong to Reconsider

The reality is that returning overseas Chinese cannot return to the homeland to starve. After thinking it over, they all come to the same conclusion: to stay in Hong Kong first and then reconsider. If it is inconvenient to return to their hometowns, they can simply call their families to Hong Kong for a reunion. Anyway, they have money in their pockets, and if their property is protected, they don't have to worry about not being able to survive. So, the house that returning overseas Chinese originally planned to build in their homeland will have to be built in Hong Kong. The factory or trading company that returning overseas Chinese originally planned to open in their homeland will either not be opened at all, or it will only be opened in Hong Kong! In short, the capital that returning overseas Chinese brought back could have been the sweet dew that nourishes the impoverished homeland, but now it is prospering this "externally strong but internally weak" colony! Overseas Chinese return at an average rate of thousands per month, so in the past six months there have been six thousand people. And if each person brings back five thousand U.S. dollars or equivalent wealth, then there are at least thirty million U.S. dollars. Not to mention the continuous stream of people returning in the future! This number may not be large, but it is not "insignificant" either. On the one hand, we are frantically encouraging exports and attracting foreign exchange, and on the other hand, we are acting like wealthy sons and looking down on the wealth accumulated by overseas Chinese drop by drop. Is this really the case? The reporter does not believe it, not in a million years, but disbelief cannot change the ironclad facts. Therefore, in order to comfort returning overseas Chinese and enrich the country's wealth, it is hoped that the relevant authorities can think of ways to help returning overseas Chinese, including guiding them upon landing, handling cash, etc. Even if these things are not as easy as "breaking a branch," they are not as difficult as "moving a mountain," and a complete solution should be worked out immediately. What is past is past, but the future can be pursued. Prospering someone else's colony is a small matter, but losing overseas Chinese compatriots' nostalgia for the homeland is a major matter, and it seems that prudent handling must be requested.

### Peasant Tears at Hangzhou's Temple Fair

— Hangzhou, 12th [Day] Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng

The sun brought warmth, and the lingering spring chill was blown away by the warm breeze. The plum blossoms in Lingfeng, Hangzhou, are dressed up and smiling, the plum blossoms on Gushan are in full bloom, and the plum blossoms in Chaoshan are in full bloom, all competing for beauty. From the West Lake, following Shengtang Road to Lihu Lake, strolling along Jingjiang Road, a branch of red plum and a branch of white plum inside the wall of "Shenglu" have jumped out of the wall, filling the branches with flowers, and a fragrant aroma stirs up boundless spring sorrow. The old willows on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway have sprouted tender green branches, whispering softly to the wild grass. In the green wilderness, the yellow walls of the Buddhist temples are exposed. They are also tidied up to allow thousands of devout men and women to worship.

Swollen Feet, Shoes Dragging - Pilgrims to the Temples

Hangzhou's temple fairs have come with the arrival of spring, and the number of rural peasants coming to offer incense is greater than the number of people from major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai coming to enjoy the spring scenery. Many of these peasants come from Quzhou, Yanzhou, Shaozhou, and Jiaxing, and from across provincial borders from Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taizhou. In recent days, in the city of Hangzhou, one can see groups of peasants wearing short jackets of different colors such as blue, cyan, and gray, wearing cloth shoes, the women having combed their hair into buns, some wearing eight-panel red skirts and inserting flowers made of red paper. They all carry yellow cloth bags, with the words "Pilgrimage to the Temples" and "Pilgrimage to Tianzhu" printed on the bags.

Many of these pilgrims come by civilian boats, and some even walk. On the road, they do not eat any meat. Once they arrive in Hangzhou, the most important thing is to inquire about the route to burn incense. They are also organized, with one person as the "incense head," who directs and designs everything. Each person who comes to Hangzhou to burn incense probably contributes about a measure of rice. After arriving in Hangzhou, other expenses are handled separately. Poor farmers only blame themselves for not burning incense, so even though they cannot afford to burn incense, they still have to save for two or three years to burn incense once. In Hangzhou, peasants mostly walk to the various temples to burn incense. As we were walking on Bai Causeway, we saw several female pilgrims whose feet were already swollen and their shoes were dragging. We also saw eight or nine male pilgrims who used copper hooks to tie into the flesh of their arms, and used copper wire to hang a tin incense burner weighing seven or eight pounds, and walked forward in this way. It is said that this kind of behavior is to "fulfill a vow" and "make a vow."

The Fate of the Peasants - Ruled by Buddha

In this time when spring has arrived, it is the season for cultivation. How can they have time to burn incense? Originally, their coming to burn incense is also like the prayer before every event in Christianity, expressing a kind of pre-blessing. They seek the Buddha to grant them "flourishing mulberry flowers" and "abundant harvests," and even that silkworm cocoon prices can be sold high, and rice prices can also be sold high, and that after paying off debts, they can also add a few more clothes for the children. Of course, they do not know how to raise silkworms well or how to grow rice well. They only know that everything is given by the Buddha. Without the Buddha, everything is gone. They even only know that their fate is ruled by the Buddha, and that their fate is perverse, which is destined in the previous life. What grievances they have, what oppressions they suffer from the bullies, they can only turn to the Buddha for salvation. Because of the consistent habit that "the yamen is as deep as the sea" and "officials protect each other," they use the imagination of "Buddha" as a spiritual comfort.

Today, the world has progressed to the atomic age, and our peasants, who make up the majority of the people, are still so pitiful. Whose responsibility is this? We have seen this kind of pilgrimage since we were children. Who knew that it is still like this today? We are surprised that many people are talking about the rural economy and improving the rural areas, but why is the countryside still so undeveloped? We are even more surprised that the gentlemen who promote sericulture and improve the rural cooperative movement, why their scientific and rational power cannot break the peasants' concept of "Buddha giving"?

The Abbot Asks for Alms - Generously Donating

When they go to the temple to burn incense, the abbot takes out the ledger and asks them to write a little. Of course, they also generously donate, even if it is five thousand or ten thousand yuan, but these money are full of their sweat and blood.

In these days, the incense on Tianzhu Mountain and Chenghuang Mountain is the most prosperous, and of course the other temples are not bad either. The business of rickshaws and tricycles is not very good, and even boats are not necessarily doing well. According to an experienced boater: "Those who are relatively rich take tricycles, and the second is to take a boat together. Taking a boat is mostly along the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon to Jingci Temple to burn incense, and they will never go anywhere else. We can't earn a few dollars here." From these words, we know that the loyal, lovely and pitiful peasants are not "borrowing Buddha to burn incense"!

In the early days of the temple fair in Hangzhou, the store that probably benefited the most was Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy. After the peasants asked for blessings from the Buddha, they also wanted to do their best. The best-selling items in Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy are fever medicine and plasters, followed by medicinal wine, and then ginseng tonic pills or ginseng and donkey-hide gelatin. Because fever medicine can cure internal problems and plasters can cure external problems, curing both internal and external problems can be regarded as doing one's best. Alas! These millions of vast peasants are blindly fighting against the disease!

Willing to Compete with the Buddha - Improve the Countryside

It is said that pilgrims from the countryside will continue to come to Hangzhou to burn incense from now until the sixth day of the fourth lunar month. Those who come to burn incense at this time are all for silkworms. After they go back, they will call the people next to them to burn incense. After the "silkworms open the door" (that is, after the silkworms make cocoons and sell them), they will come back to fulfill their "vows."

Of course, we will not object to them coming to Hangzhou to burn incense, but after the incense is burned, what will the Buddha give them? At the same time, what should our local government give them? If the local government gives them benefits that they can believe in, then they can also play around when they come to Hangzhou, and will not have to come and go in a hurry. Therefore, we hope that the local government can compete with the Buddha for a while.

### On Currency Management and a Proposal to Issue "Price Index Treasury Bonds" (Part 1)

— Li Chonghuai

"China's economy is already full of holes, and the situation is dire. Mere criticism and blame will not help. I offer my humble opinion to experts at home and abroad, hoping it will spark constructive suggestions to address the current situation." - The Author

1.  The Announcement of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan"

Following the gold and price surge around February 10th, the government announced the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" on February 16th, including prohibiting gold trading and foreign currency circulation, strictly implementing price controls, coordinating the supply of essential civilian goods, strictly managing production, developing export trade, and striving for budget balance, etc. In terms of the wording of the plan, it seems to have considered all aspects of the overall economy. However, upon closer examination, one deeply feels that hidden worries abound, the future is fraught with crises, and it is just beginning. In the days following the announcement of the measures, it may stabilize finance and prices temporarily, as it is still a sedative for a turbulent society. However, in the near future, prices will likely continue to rise, and it may not be of much benefit to the overall economic panic.

The author believes that the flaw in the plan lies in its inability to effectively manage currency, and therefore, prices may not be stable.

2.  The Root of the Current Economic Problems

Before discussing the main text, let us briefly analyze China's current economy. After eight years of war against Japan and more than a year of civil unrest, the government's war expenditure has been enormous, and the production base has been almost completely destroyed. Government expenditures are usually covered by taxes, state-owned enterprise revenues, public debt, and currency issuance. Taxes are built on the foundation of prosperous production. Production stagnation and empty markets cannot rely on taxes as a major source of revenue. At present, state-owned enterprises are still in their infancy, and capital expenditures are actually greater than revenues. In a process of rapidly depreciating currency and soaring prices, it is almost impossible to issue public debt by ordinary means. Therefore, the only resort is to issue currency. Inflation is not necessarily a bad thing; if material resources can increase relatively during inflation, then prices may not necessarily rise. Planned, chronic inflation may promote industrial and commercial prosperity and reduce unemployment. However, conversely, if inflation occurs while material resources decrease, and the inflation is unplanned and jumps erratically, it becomes malignant inflation. The result will be to disconnect production from trade and promote a crazy rise in prices. The most obvious product of malignant inflation is high overnight interest rates. Because currency increases (assuming that the speed of currency circulation and usage habits remain unchanged) and material resources are scarce, prices soar, thus commercial profits are particularly high, which causes short-term lending rates to increase abnormally, causing people to be unwilling to make long-term and risky investments. Therefore, it is difficult for production enterprises to obtain capital, and it is difficult to add and replace machinery and equipment to increase production. If currency continues to be issued but production does not easily increase, then prices will inevitably rise. If prices rise, then the government will inevitably increase currency issuance. If there is no appropriate way to stop this vicious cycle, it will inevitably be endless.

3.  Currency Management is the Focus of Solving Current Economic Problems

In the aforementioned economic state, there are three key factors: one is the quantity of currency, one is interest, and one is material resources. If the currency is not continuously increased (hereinafter, all are relative), then prices may not rise again, interest rates can fall, and production can increase. If interest rates are generally low and flat, and long-term investment is profitable, production can increase, and price increases can be reduced. If the supply of material resources increases, the momentum of price increases slows down, commercial profits are viewed as lower, interest rates will inevitably fall, production can benefit, and currency issuance can also be reduced. If the quantity of currency, interest rates, and material resources can all be controlled, it is the best policy to stabilize prices. However, interest rates themselves are attached to the mutual relationship between the quantity of currency and prices. Therefore, the most effective method is to start with managing currency and increasing material resources.

However, there is also a distinction between importance and priority between these two. There are two ways to increase material resources: one is to import from foreign countries, and the other is to increase domestic production. The latter is restricted by interest rates and inflation, as mentioned earlier. Inefficient transportation mechanisms and the failure of goods to flow smoothly are also factors hindering production, which cannot be effective in the short term. The former requires a large amount of foreign exchange and friendly foreign donations. In the past, China maintained low exchange rates, which meant encouraging imports. However, with limited foreign exchange resources to supply unlimited needs, it is naturally difficult to maintain for a long time. Relying on foreign friendly donations and relief supplies is one example, but it is feared that it will not last long. The "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" seems to focus on foreign in-kind loans. However, it is currently difficult to be certain whether the other party is willing. Even if everything goes well, if currency is still issued without management, or the rate of increase in material resources is not as fast as the rate of increase in currency, then prices will still continue to rise. Therefore, what we can manage with greater certainty is the quantity of currency. The quantity of currency is the most important link in the economic system, and it itself has the power to control other factors. Neglecting this and focusing on that, any other measures will fail.

4.  The Way to Manage Currency is to Find a Way Out for Society's Surplus Purchasing Power (i.e., Hot Money)

What the author means by currency management is not to absolutely not increase issuance. Unless the country can be spared war consumption, it is impossible to absolutely not increase issuance at this time. Even if the country is peacefully unified, issuance will still increase in a situation where production has not recovered and everything is waiting to be revitalized. This increased issuance is originally the government's purchasing power created out of thin air. However, this excessive purchasing power is transferred to the people's hands, and there must be a way out for it. The outlet for the purchasing power obtained by the people (referring to income excluding donations and taxes) is nothing more than consumption, savings, or investment (collection is relatively small, so it is omitted; savings in a certain definition - as referred to by Keynesians - are equal to investment). During the war, the rate of expansion of fiscal deficits in Britain and the United States was far greater than ours, but the price increases were limited. The reason for this is partly due to the effectiveness of price controls, but the most important thing is that the people's remaining purchasing power, in addition to consumption, still has reliable savings and investment targets, either investing in industrial and commercial enterprises, or purchasing government bonds, or depositing funds in banks, and the banks then purchase government bonds as operating assets. During the war, this asset accounted for more than 60% of the liquid assets of British and American banks. These purchasing powers, on the one hand, increase production and the circulation of materials, and at the same time, through the bridge of public debt, enter the government's hands for re-expenditure. In China, it is not the case. It is difficult for the purchasing power obtained by the people, apart from consumption, to find a reliable outlet. China does not have a sound capital market, making it difficult to guide people to invest. The interest rate on deposits in national banks is too low to guide savings, thereby expanding production credit. The rate of currency depreciation is too fast, making it difficult to issue public debt. Therefore, most of the people's surplus purchasing power goes to hoarding goods, or depositing money in commercial firms, or even underground money houses and bill-splitting companies, etc. The former increases the need for material resources, promoting price increases, and the latter increases the expansion of speculative credit, which is also a factor promoting price increases. Therefore, the management of currency lies in how to absorb the surplus purchasing power of the Chinese people other than normal consumption and transfer it to the government. This is the purpose of this article.

5.  The Failure of the Gold Policy Lies in the Limited Amount of Gold Reserves

Let us first briefly review the policy of selling gold. The sale of gold, in essence, is nothing more than a substitute for government bonds. Because it is not easy to issue public debt, the government has to take gold to absorb the people's purchasing power. Originally, the value of gold is stable, which is in line with the people's demand to protect the value of savings. Currency is constantly inflating, and general prices are rising. The price of gold should be high, and if it is not high, it will not easily absorb currency. Therefore, the rise in the price of gold is not the cause of the rise in other prices, but a compass for inflation. If the price of gold has the same rate of increase as general prices or rises ahead of prices, it indicates that the price of gold absorbs more purchasing power in the market, which invisibly reduces the people's power to compete for goods. If gold does not rise ahead of prices, it can further prove that the rise in prices is not due to the rise in the price of gold. As far as we know, the highest price of gold in Shanghai between January and March of last year was 1,194,000 yuan per tael, and the lowest price was 795,000 yuan. The average price of gold in Shanghai from January 5th to January 12th of this year was 3,633,333 yuan per tael. Compared with the highest price between January and March of last year, it has only increased 1.9 times, that is, compared with the lowest price at that time, it has only increased 4.5 times. What about the price increase during the same period? According to the Shanghai Essential Commodity Wholesale Price Index published in the monthly report of the Central Bank, it was 92,842.5 in January 1946, and the average for January 6th to 13th of this year was 654,633. The latter is 7 times higher than the former. It is that the rate of gold price increase is not as high as that of prices, which is enough to prove that the rise in gold prices and prices is the result of currency inflation, and it is not that gold prices stimulate prices.

The use of gold policies is enough to absorb some currency and slow down the momentum of price increases. Impartially speaking, we cannot simply accuse it of being wrong. However, the gold policy ultimately failed because the power that gold could exert was limited by the amount of gold reserves. The authorities failed to consider this clearly, which was a mistake. The gold rush before and after February 10th was indeed stimulated by factors such as the issuance of large-denomination banknotes during the Lunar New Year, the promulgation of export subsidies, and the increase in import taxes. However, the basic reason is probably that the news of the emptiness of gold reserves leaked into the hands of speculators, which led to a rush to buy and raise the price of gold, and finally forced the government to abandon the gold selling policy.

The economy after the Central Bank abandoned the gold trading policy is worrying. The gold that has already flowed into the market is now freezing huge purchasing power. The exact amount of gold in the market now is unknown. According to the most cautious and lowest estimate, it is at least five million taels, which is worth 2.4 trillion yuan in legal tender at the current Central Bank's purchase price. Can the government bear this expenditure? If this huge amount of legal tender purchasing power is added to the market, what will be the impact on prices? It goes without saying! The safest method seems to be to suppress the list price, as a nominal purchase, so that this batch of gold remains in the people's pockets or in the safes of banks and firms. This may be the current policy of the Central Bank. However, the people are unwilling, and it is feared that the trend of smuggling will be difficult to curb!

6.  Review of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" - Still Lacking Tools to Manage Currency

Now that the gold open trading policy has become a thing of the past, let us see what effect the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" announced on the 16th can have.

(1) Regarding budget balancing: It is feared that it is impossible for the government to reduce unnecessary expenditures. Even if it can be reduced, it is very limited. May I ask, if it is an unnecessary expenditure, why should the government include it in the budget? The author deeply fears that fiscal expenditure will not only not be reduced as a result, but may even increase further. Because managing prices, unified purchasing of daily necessities, and strengthening taxes will inevitably increase some institutions and expenses. Increasing taxes is by no means something that can be effective in the short term; sound taxes must be built on the foundation of industrial and commercial prosperity. In other words, we must first start by cultivating tax sources, otherwise it is digging flesh to repair sores and killing chickens to get eggs, which only reduces the reproductive capacity of industry and commerce. Auctioning off enemy and puppet assets can achieve the purpose of partially contracting currency and increasing material resources, but how much is the quantity and how to use it are all problems. Recruiting private shares for state-owned enterprises or selling them to the people also requires technical research. The government may not be willing to transfer businesses that already have income; the people will naturally not be willing to invest in businesses that do not yet have a foundation. Therefore, it is impossible to use these methods to seek current fiscal balance. Then there is no doubt that currency will continue to be issued.

(2) Regarding cracking down on speculative trading and stabilizing the financial market: Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency in order to strengthen foreign exchange management is a step that the government should have taken long ago. Purchasing foreign currency at high prices can indeed reduce the black market for foreign currency and increase foreign exchange resources, but the Central Bank has to pay a price for the purchase. The impact of abandoning the gold policy has been mentioned earlier. As for strengthening the measures to control the financial market, it places too much emphasis on rigid political means, and it is also questionable what effect it has on price stability. The fundamental shortcoming of China's banking system is the disconnect between the central bank, commercial banks, and money houses. In other words, the overall financial market is not a mobile organic body. The central bank is only the government's bank and has not become the bank's bank. The main reason is the lack of an artery that communicates from the central bank to various financial institutions. In the British and American banking systems, this artery is government bonds and securities. This is not only the magic weapon for the central bank to use in the open market to expand and contract credit, but also a complementary tool for the discount rate and reserve ratio. It connects the financial institutions of developed countries and becomes the major blood vessels around the heart, allowing the central bank to freely control the expansion and contraction of market credit. At present, although the Central Bank of China has tried to achieve centralized deposit reserves, rediscount, and re-mortgage, and has also achieved considerable results in controlling the "quality" of loan credit, it is still difficult to flexibly control the entire financial situation because of the lack of this blood vessel that communicates the entire market. The rigid control of the financial market in the new plan further increases the separation between the central bank, commercial banks, and money houses, ignoring the chain of economic links, and restricts industrial and commercial loans too strictly, which may greatly hinder the circulation of materials. If materials do not flow smoothly, it will naturally be difficult for supply and demand in various places to mutually adjust. Furthermore, even if the financial market has been placed under strict management, the people's surplus purchasing power created by the government's increased currency issuance is fundamentally not in the hands of banks and money houses. Therefore, the government's management of banks and firms still fails to reasonably control this surplus purchasing power. What will happen to the people who use it to compete for goods?

Spring and Autumn

### The Style of Gong Zizhen's Modern Poetry (Part 1)

— Yu Heng

During the Qing Dynasty, there were two outstanding and unconventional poets who truthfully repaid the artistic value of poetry with the vitality of their lives. One was the ill-fated Huang Zhongze, and the other was the unrestrained Gong Zizhen.

By the Qing Dynasty, poetry had long lost its true value due to the frivolous play and addiction to the format of examination poems, and had been misunderstood by ordinary "men of letters" who called themselves "poets." They regarded poetry as a kind of formal literature, neglecting the special content that poetry should have, misunderstanding the definition of poetry, and unconsciously believing that poetry was a boring social activity, a literary appendage, so the style of poetry became increasingly inferior. Even Wang Yuyang and Yuan Mei, who were famous at the time, could not escape this rut. Especially Yuan Mei, whose later works were entirely based on the background of sensuality and the Little Cangshan Suiyuan, and whose subject matter was social drinking with friends, was simply worthless. However, at that time, he interacted with all the dukes and "celebrities," and everyone strove to have their poems praised by the Suiyuan Poetry Talks, so the poetry talks completely became a world of conformity and flattery. This atmosphere of no right or wrong spread to the Jiaqing and Daoguang years, and there was even less talk of poetic principles. Fortunately, at this time, Gong Zizhen rose in the southeast and illuminated the literary world.

Gong Zizhen's poems are bizarrely gorgeous, heroic and strange, and unrestrained. The beauty of his mood is just like the praise he himself is very proud of: "Returning Yang and shaking Qi Sheng Jingling."

Some of the 315 poems in Jihai Miscellaneous Poems are difficult for people to understand after reading them, because they contain a secret love affair, so before we explore the techniques and implications together, we should first mention his love story:

Gong Zizhen was in the capital, and his official position was a member of the Ministry of Rites, in charge of the sacrificial department. Although he was an idle official in a cold department, because of his bold personality and love of oddities and hospitality, he naturally associated with princes and gentlemen. At that time, the Qingyuan King greatly appreciated him, and the Qingyuan King's Fujin (Princess) even admired his talent unexpectedly. The two could not help but exceed the scope stipulated by feudal forces and the etiquette and ritual norms. Gong Zizhen had a poem that was widely circulated for a while, "Remembering the Lilac Flowers in Taiping Lake inside Xuanwu Gate," which was actually written for her:

"Leaning on the empty mountain, I am tired of traveling. I dreamed of Langyuan in the west of the city in spring. A steed delivered a letter late at night to the Zhu Mansion, sending it to the person in white in the wind." Not only this poem, but also many "Remembering Luan Branches in the Capital", "Remembering Peonies", "Remembering Begonias", "Remembering Lilacs"... These are often unavoidable excuses, and the poem is:

It is a pity that there are no such flowers in the south, and their waists are slightly similar to begonias. It is hard to forget the house south of the Huai Market Street, where a cartload of drafts of various flowers is arranged in a small queue.

It is a pity that there are no such flowers in the south, and their beauty is even more extravagant than peonies. It is hard to forget the early return from the West Pavilion, and I gave it to the dressing table full of mirrored clouds.

It is not that these flowers are later in the south, but that there is a difference of two points between the fat in the north and the thin in the south. I would like to move the branch to the north to ask about the oil-green car in the Southern Dynasty.

I have been looking for fragrance for several years in my youth, with exquisite and beautiful jade intertwined. It is hard to forget the red mud temple in the drizzle, where I leaned on this flower with my spring fur soaked.

Although these poems cannot be regarded as Gong Zizhen's representative works, they are all climaxes in the Jihai Miscellaneous Poems and the most memorable page in his life. Later, when the Qingyuan King found out, Gong Zizhen was afraid of being victimized as a result, so he left the capital in a hurry (April of Daoguang Jihai). All of his infinite sorrow was written in the miscellaneous poems. Wu Changshou's Chronicle of Mr. Gong Zizhen did not detail the reasons for his departure from the capital, but only said: "His high talent touched the taboo of the times... so he begged to be allowed to return home to recuperate." This is naturally unreliable official talk.

According to legend, after leaving the capital, he encountered a swordsman who came to make trouble for him. Fortunately, Gong Zizhen, who "strikes the sword in his youth and plays the flute," was not a weak scholar. So he drew his sword and dealt with it, and the swordsman had to admit defeat. In the miscellaneous poems, there is the sentence: "Fortunately, you were born in a peaceful time, otherwise the peach blossoms would fall under the sword," which probably refers to this matter.

From then on, he never dared to go to Beijing again, but he still needed to welcome back the family members who had failed to travel out of Beijing with him in a hurry. So he sent a servant to the capital, while he wandered near Beijing, and finally did not dare to enter again. In his miscellaneous poems, he wrote of his frantic emotions at that time: "Looking north at Guling and south at wild geese, seven lines of cursive script reach the capital." "Gradually approaching the southern city, the sky is five feet high, and I dare not dream of Guling when I turn on the light."

Two years later, he died of a sudden illness. To this day, some people suspect that his death should be related to this matter, but unfortunately there are insufficient documents to examine it in detail. Fortunately, this is not a study of his life deeds, so let's put it aside and explore the flavor of his poems.

The uniqueness of Gong Zizhen's poems lies not only in the words and ideas, because the combination of beautiful words and meanings is not necessarily the best poem. In addition, there must be a special style that can express the personality of a great poem, that is, the style. Gong Zizhen's style can truly be said to be soaring and resounding, unlike ordinary vulgarity. His style fully expresses the integration of skill and talent. Let's take his two "Autumn Heart" poems as an example: "Autumn heart is like the sea and like the tide, only the autumn soul cannot be summoned..." and Wang Yuyang's popular "Autumn Willow": "Where is the most soul-stirring place in autumn? The setting sun and the west wind at Bai Xia Gate..." Compared with this, we can see the level of style. Gong's poems are like a swordsman staring intently with his sword in his hand; Wang's poems are like a shyly smiling daughter. The same use of words such as "autumn" and "soul" has different tones and different spirits.

The style of Huang Zhongze's poems is mostly sad and pitiful, such as: "The setting sun advises guests to go upstairs," "I am worried and think about buying poplars to plant," "The ghost envies the horse doctor at the grave," and so on. Compared with Gong Zizhen's "What sword is the cold northwest?","Beauty is like jade, sword is like rainbow", "The strong wind is strong and簸春魂", which can capture people's hearts, they are no match. Huang's poems are like Changji's ghostly talent, and Gong's poems are like the immortal energy of Qingyun.

I have discovered that there are two major 作风 of Gong Zizhen's poems, which are the bridges that transform the ordinary into the strange and the decayed into the pearls:

1.  Strange spelling: In ancient times, poets used must have a source for every word and phrase. If there was anything inappropriate, they would not use it. Because of adhering to the old rules, it was difficult for the qi to be broad, and the new creation of poetry became increasingly less. Gong Zizhen, on the other hand, is good at using unrelated adjectives or verb nouns, such as "Articles should have old waves," "The ancient makeup of the Six Dynasties lies in the dream," "Osmanthus outside the wind waits for the autumn tide," "The shadows of flowers in the four compartments are angry than the tide," etc. These are all wonderful combinations of strange spellings, which are the result of genius and skill, and often speak what the ancients have not said, liberating the field of poetry.

2.  Clever bifurcation: The third and fourth sentences of each quatrain often have a distance that readers absolutely cannot imagine. This is a unique technique of Gong Zizhen. For example: "For fear that Liu Lang's heroic spirit will be exhausted, he rolls up the curtain to dress and look at the Yellow River." The bold and unrestrained imagination is expressed in these fourteen words. Also: "A guest from the Guan Mountain reported in front of the door, come and listen to the sound of night rain in the West Zhai." "If Lu Ge is really in hand, he only begs to shine on the book city with his slanting intestines." "New poems urgently remember soul-stirring things, and share a spoonful of soup with rouge" are all written with inspiration that exceeds ordinary emotions. This kind of style has been rare since the Tang Dynasty.

In modern times, there are two people who extremely admire Gong Zizhen, Su Manshu and Yu Dafu. Their poems are very close to Gong Zizhen's style. Naturally, they are influenced by Gong Zizhen's style. At the same time, they are also poets who have written poems with life vitality with the vitality of their lives. They have successively died in this turbulent era, and we should also pay eternal remembrance to them.

### The Elegance of the Lotus Pond

— Xu Shiqi

### White Gate Spring Colors

— Qin Ling

Secluded willows, ancient dikes, emerald lake, green mountains—these are inexhaustible expressions of longing.

If you desire to reside in the most suitable city, then choose Jinling. It's both a city within mountains and forests and mountains and forests within a city. It's tranquil without being desolate, lively without being chaotic, possessing modern qualities while also retaining ancient simplicity.

My time living in Baixia (Nanjing) wasn't long, but I'm willing to share half of the affection Baixia has given me with you. It truly is a place with both mountains and water, magnificent yet delicately beautiful. In spring, the sunlight sparkles on Zijin Mountain. Riding in a carriage on the wide avenues adorned with green trees, the fields emit a warm, sweet scent of earth and flowers. From here, head straight to Ming Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Linggu Temple. Your heart will surely open up. Flowers and plants dance in the spring breeze, and the sound of hooves startles the butterflies in the flower bushes. The gentle breeze through the woods caresses your face; spring lives in your heart. Close your eyes and dream of a bygone era. If you're deeply interested, ascend the mountain path to explore Zixia Cave. Overlooking Jinling from here offers a feeling of floating in space. Do you believe it?

In summer, Baixia might be a bit hot, but so what? As the sun begins to set, the shores of Xuanwu Lake are filled with young people. I love this willow embankment the most. Fine willow branches, misty and verdant, embrace the lake. Strolling slowly along the embankment, the evening breeze gently lifts the corners of your clothes. The white stone architecture of the distant Five Continents Park lies quietly in the twilight. If you know how to row, hire a small boat and wander upon the green waters. Lotus leaves spread densely across the water's surface, and lotus blossoms peek into the boat. Stop rowing, hide yourself among the lotus flowers, and rest quietly for a while. The breeze from the water, carrying a faint fragrance, will wash away all worldly concerns.

And don't forget the reed flowers of Mochou Lake. Although Mochou Lake has a hint of solitude, its charm is quite profound. Qingliang Mountain, frowning at the lake, exudes a faint yellow hue. Clumps of reeds by the lake are adorned with a few white blossoms. And then there are the ancient pagoda trees in front of the Weiqi Pavilion—they belong to another world, secluded and detached in this quiet corner, with a faint sorrow, a subtle melancholy.

Also, be sure not to forget Drum Tower. The deep red walls are hidden in lush green trees, full of ancient charm. Below the tower is a pine forest. On moonlit nights, this is the most beautiful place. The towering red building has witnessed the vicissitudes of the ancient city. Surely, the past grandeur evokes a low, quiet sigh from the Drum Tower.

Furthermore, if you have time, Jiming Mountain, Beiji Pavilion, Rouge Well, and Bailuzhou (White Heron Isle) are all extremely interesting places to visit. Otherwise, stroll leisurely through the small streets and back alleys. Won't the lanes of Wuyi (Dark Clothes) and the bridge of Zhuque (Vermillion Bird) evoke a strong sense of nostalgia in you?

Every morning, the sound of horses' hooves knocks on the window of the ancient city's morning dreams. Carts full of fresh fruits and vegetables are brought to the market. The carters' light, rounded, practiced calls echo in the clear air, giving people a sense of warmth and ancient simplicity. And at night, the bells of Jiming Temple are deep and resonant, urging people to sleep. This city, in every place, doesn't forget to remind us: "Its essence forever belongs to the era of our ancestors."

Spring has come. When the ever-smiling sunlight shines on Stone City, everything returns to life: birdsong, flower fragrance, mountain scenery, water colors. This ancient city has floated to the surface of a lake of happiness, bringing you my blessings.

### Gorky's First Work

— Fu Bo

Gorky's first work, "Makar Chudra," was written during his vagrant years in the Outer Caucasus, while working at a factory, using his holidays. He personally delivered it to the chief editor of a newspaper.

The chief editor glanced through it and noticed that the byline was missing. He looked up and asked the waiting youth:

"No pen name?"

"No, write one in yourself—just use Gorky—Maxim Gorky."

The chief editor seemed surprised and doubtful at this suddenly spoken name. He frowned and asked:

"Is this your real name?"

"No, I don't want to give my real name. It's better to use a pseudonym."

The article was soon published, and the name "Gorky" appeared in the world for the first time. That was on September 25, 1892, in the newspaper "Kavkaz" of Tiflis (Tbilisi).

### Jottings on the Lake

— Yao Yu

Spring

The gentle east wind blows the goddess of spring to the human world.

Spring is lively, full of vitality...

If summer is a robust youth, then spring should be a sacred maiden; if summer is a rigorous thesis, then spring should be a beautiful poem.

Spring is great. It turns the willows by the lake green, and also the small grasses in the wilderness. If spring had feelings and purpose, it should belong to everything in the universe. However, spring also brings people many "troubles." Therefore, I love winter, and I love the days at the end of winter when spring is about to come but hasn't yet. Murmuring Xin Qiji's lyrics: "Before spring comes, first ask: I resent it opening late, and then it withers and falls early; the news of this year's flowering season is certain, but I only worry about the wind and rain without a sure sign..." Who can remain unmoved!

"Contradiction," "love" and "hate," "joy" and "trouble" make up the greatness of spring, and also reflect the greatness of life.

If there were no "contradiction," "love" and "hate," "joy" and "trouble," this world would become a dead world; it is on this basis that people and people, people and things become more closely connected and understood...

We are currently in a turbulent era, full of contradictions. We need not curse, nor praise. Use discernment to replace numbness, and analysis should outweigh emotion.

Spring, let me cast aside my sorrow for the departed, and from the contradictions come to know what is "love" and what is "hate"!

Tower

I have loved "towers" since I was a child; I love the towers in the setting sun even more. Three or five eagles circle around the top of the tower, one circle, two circles, three circles... Strangely enough, I never feel lonely towards a lone tower. I often stare at her with unblinking eyes, until she enters the gate of dusk with the stars....

At this moment, I get up early. As long as I aim my gaze at the window facing the lake, I can freely gaze at the towering tower standing in the lake, and my heart seems to have faith and dominion.

She—the tireless guardian of the night—many of the miscellaneous trees and weeds by the lake have succumbed to last night's gale and heavy rain and broken, but our guardian of the night! Still stands tall in the middle of the lake.

I once imagined: if there were no tower in the lake, Xizi (West Lake) would become a soulless maiden, losing her allure and vital beauty.

Towers, according to legend, are used to suppress demons. Reviewing the story of the vines climbing high on big trees and the small grasses on the ground comparing heights, I feel that towers can not only suppress demons, but also suppress the shameful dependents and incite the despicable cowards in the human world!

I pray silently to the rising sun:

Let us universally build a "tower" in our hearts!

### Poems from Dream Outside the Tower

— Xu Chengyu

Reply to Tieqiao

Magnificent clouds stretch ten thousand miles, pressing down on the sky,
The spring wind stirs the pipes of harmony, responding to the dawn.
To answer your heroic feelings, I crafted a beautiful verse,
Suddenly, a fine line arrives, complementing my newly brewed wine.
I did not meet Yang Xiong discussing scriptures, as he went away,
Let's share with Tao Qian carrying wine to me.
Drunk, how would I know that I am a guest,
Drinking with you with a cup of radiant jade.

Spring splendor is like embroidery, falling in colorful profusion,
Beautiful scenery is right before us, something for you,
People remember the sorrowful poems of the Three Xiang Rivers,
Poems composed with excellence like Xiumen's Eight Eulogies.
Seeking secluded spots, I wandered under the moon with Master Lin,
Listening to music, I secretly watched the clouds of the sea.
Knowing that the landscape is endlessly meaningful,
No need to hear the beauty of "Rear Court Flower."

You, sir, are especially rich in good poetry,
No need for your page boy Xiao Xi to follow when the poems are done.
Your five-hued brush is still full of heart,
A band of empty river under the moon resembles an eyebrow;
Your untamed melody mirrors a solitary crane in flight,
Do not sing of sorrow, or mimic the weeping night monkey.
All the more, I admire these poems newly grown strong,
Yellow silk newly cut from the young wife's words.

In the Gorges I have met you several autumns,
Your writing has been praised as equal to Cao and Liu.
The desolate homeland lies three thousand miles away,
Gazing longingly at Yuan Long's hundred-foot tower;
When will the seas be at peace, beyond the borders,
Last night I dreamt of taking in the capital in my dream.
On the day we return together in a spring boat on the Chu River,
Do not forget the White Heron Island south of the heavens.

### A Collection of Tolstoy's Sayings

— Translated by Jin Ning

Those who do evil without knowing the truth, we pity their sacrifices, we grieve for them, because they only inflict violence on those who attack them; but those who know the truth and do evil, under a mask of hypocrisy, harm not only themselves and their victims, but also millions of others, but these are blinded by the lies for evil.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 200

— Ye Jingfeng

"Let's go upstairs too." I watched as people gradually diminished in size. By the faint light from the street, I could gradually make out the positions of various departments in the hall. I had only taken two or three steps when suddenly everything went pitch black. The streetlights had also gone out.

"The power's out," I muttered to myself, one hand on "04's" shoulder, cautiously moving forward.

"No, it isn't," "04" told me, "there's still light by the self-ladder." "The Big Fool" calls the elevator the "self-ladder"; it's a new term he invented, probably by analogy with "bicycle."

"Are you going to the second floor or the fifth floor?" Someone asked me outside the elevator door.

The fifth floor is my temporary headquarters; even if I want to go to Mr. W's office on the sixth floor, I have to go to the fifth floor first, because the elevator only goes to the fifth floor. It's correct for this person to ask if I want to go to the fifth floor. But why ask about the second floor? Because so many dramatic changes had happened in the fire hall, one scene after another, it was somewhat like watching a movie, so I completely forgot what Mr. W had just said upstairs about the hallway on the second floor, which can lead to the room next door. Now, suddenly hearing this person ask about the second floor, I was a little confused and involuntarily blurted out this question:

"The second floor?"

"Yes, the entrance here is blocked by Japanese soldiers, so most of the comrades have gone to the second floor to go through the passageway and participate in the flanking attack."

When I heard this, I remembered what Mr. W had said about the passageway. I smiled at my own confusion and thought of Yaoqun and Hucheng:

"Did you see our young lady and..."

"Yes, they left early... They were as happy as if they were going to a fair."

"04" and I went to the fifth floor. The corridor still had low lighting to maintain some brightness, so I knew the street's current hadn't been cut. The darkness on the street probably meant the enemy had deliberately destroyed the streetlights to conceal themselves. I walked to the door of my room and was just about to push it open when I heard someone speaking inside. It was Mr. Hejian's voice, speaking rapidly, completely in Japanese. I understood that Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi were probably talking inside. I felt it was inconvenient to enter the room, so I turned around to prepare to go to the sixth floor, and instructed Big Fool to wait at the entrance of the corridor, and if anything happened, he could come to the sixth floor to find me.

"...chase to the entrance of Dongjiaominxiang, stop firing, leave two sentry posts, the main force does not need to return to headquarters, disperse and rest in various branches, waiting for orders..."

As soon as I entered Mr. W's office, I heard the tail end of this order. Mr. W was issuing orders on the phone and nodding at me, gesturing for me to sit down. Mr. Dai and Secretary Ma were also in the room, still sitting in their original seats, as if they had never moved. We all raised our hands in greeting.

"You've come at just the right time," Mr. W said with a smile after issuing the order, "we were just about to discuss the issue of whether to keep or abolish this organization, and I hope you'll participate and give your opinion."

"This probably needs to be asked of Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi," I offered this readily available opinion.

"They're both on the fifth floor," Mr. W told me.

"That's right, I just came from the fifth floor. Someone is talking in my room. Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi are probably there. Mr. Hejian's voice was very urgent, maybe he was arguing with Miss Pingzi about something. I didn't want to intrude, so..."

"What kind of relationship do Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi have?" Mr. Dai asked very cautiously. Mr. W probably hadn't had time to report Miss Pingzi's behavior to Mr. Dai.

"In some way, the two people seem to be cooperating," Mr. W replied concisely.

This sentence, if it were coming out of my mouth, would have to be transformed into at least three or four, even five or six sentences, and perhaps still wouldn't be able to be said so clearly and concisely. I felt very satisfied with this answer. Even if Mr. Hejian himself were here, he would probably only be able to answer in this way.

### Remembrance

— Sha Lei

I remember too many people and too many things. I often feel the weight of my soul. Every dusk, in the sound of the night wind or by the fireplace, the remembrance of those old friends and past events makes me unbelievably weak.

Some painful memories are poignant, but some gentle old images hurt me even more. When the rich fragrance of jasmine in March accompanies those lovely faces and kind voices, I can't bear the burden of living.

I can't stand that kind of fragrance and sweetness, I tremble.

Therefore, you will realize that I am indifferent. I seem to have the forgetfulness skills of someone with neurasthenia, contemptuously shedding the burden of history.

"Yes, it was also such a rainy night, we walked under the dim streetlights, the two of us holding an umbrella with only half of it intact, we were all fighting to bear the rain pouring down from the half-broken part, we finally decided to take turns tasting that coolness..."

"We then went to the small restaurant," you continued, "we ordered so many chicken wings..."

"Oh, did that happen?" I replied very lightly, I won't go back to that big forest to discover those beautiful times.

I just watched silently, neither cold nor affectionate, I just want today to flow by peacefully, and tomorrow to be as peaceful as today. Remembering yesterday and fantasizing about tomorrow both make me heavy.

Sitting opposite each other in wicker chairs, everyone smoking a cigarette, listening to the noise in the teahouse that has nothing to do with us, this is my supreme happiness.

It is really gratifying that we can stand together again, because the broken time is still continuing, because your reappearance allows me to unload many huge buildings of remembrance.

I want to tell you why I like to keep the windows closed. Under the sun and the bright moon, some eyes and songs are often patrolling, among the many stars in the boundless dark blue, which one has not stopped in my dream?

Tomorrow I may buy a dark curtain, so that I can have a more peaceful rest. My friend, let me always be with you, on the opposite bank of my life. Your demeanor always shines with a child's heart, making me return to a childhood of unknowing.

### Wenzhou Talks Alone

— Wang Cong

Modern Christians no longer stubbornly deny science. They are willing to say that true science is in harmony with God's common sense, and they also cite that the first telegram Morse sent when he invented the telegraph was What Hath God Wrought. That means what great things God has done.

The conclusion of some missionaries is, of course, quoting Professor Simpson, saying: "Small scientists vilify God, but great scientists always agree with Christian views."

In fact, religious belief and other aspects of knowledge can be absolutely separate, not related to each other. The explanations of some missionaries are inevitably superfluous.

Einstein is a Christian, which does not impair the existence of his "theory of relativity."

Religious belief, from a certain perspective, is just the sublimation of emotions after being repressed. There is no doubt that musicians have contributed the most to this.

Blessed are those who have faith.

But those who have clear understanding are often in pain.

My reason is—

Knowledge is constantly changing and advancing with time and space.

And belief is based on eternal, hazy piety, constant and firm. There are no "why" words to ask.

"Honesty" can often defeat "hypocrisy."

Since the Three Dynasties, people have loved fame; what they love is often false fame. As the saying goes, "puffing up one's face to look fat," this is exemplified by the Qi people with one wife and one concubine described in Mencius's books.

If people can see through this falsehood, I think they can save themselves a lot of irrelevant trouble.

During the Han Dynasty, Zhao Tuo, the King of Nanyue, rebelled. This King of Nanyue's was about status and money. If he had been born in the 1950s, he could have gone to the United States to play. The reason for his rebellion was only to gain the vanity of the two words "Emperor."

Emperor Wen of Han was truly a remarkable hero. He sent Zhao Tuo a letter. He started off with a killer move. He said, "I, the previous Emperor, am the son of a concubine." Translated into colloquial language, it means: "I, the Emperor, am the son of my father's mistress."

Zhao Tuo's vanity was completely shattered. "Damn it, the venerable Emperor begins by admitting that he is the son of a concubine. Do I still need to rebel?" Without spending a single soldier, the ambitious man had no choice but to surrender.

### On Recent Developments at the Commercial Press

— Black Star

I really want to systematically visit several of the more famous bookstores in Shanghai, and ask them how many difficulties they are encountering today with such difficult publishing conditions and such low purchasing power.

First, I went to the Commercial Press. The contributions of the Commercial Press to Chinese cultural history and academia should be unparalleled.

As everyone knows, their large-scale printing factory and China's only encircling library - the Oriental Library - were both destroyed in the flames of the anti-Japanese war.

The losses of these two units alone are already impossible to estimate.

The Commercial Press has a total of four institutions across the country, located in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Beiping (Beijing), with the head office in Shanghai.

The Shanghai head office and retail department are located on Shanghai's famous cultural street, the so-called Qipan Street (Checkerboard Street); the actual location is at the intersection of Fourth Road and Henan Road. Their editorial department is located on Avenue Edward VII, and the printing factory (very small in scale) is located in Wangjiasha.

The current general manager and director of the editorial department of the Commercial Press is Mr. Zhu Jingnong, a well-known figure in academia, who does not need our introduction. Former general manager Wang Yunwu is now one of the directors of the Commercial Press, and it is expected that he will be of great help to the future development of the Commercial Press.

The person who spoke to me in the editorial department was Mr. Su Jiqing, who only came to Shanghai from Chongqing a month ago. Mr. Su has always been responsible for editing the "Eastern Miscellany" magazine. Mr. Su has graying temples, which shows how hard he has been working.

I asked Mr. Su a few simple questions:

About the situation of publishing books recently.

Mr. Su said: We still publish one book a day now, but there are too many books that are backlogged and have not been printed, even books that had their paper plates made before the "August 13th" incident have not yet been published. However, now that the post-war conditions are better than during the war, the books can naturally be printed more quickly.

In terms of printing, the factory in Shanghai is now very small, so we still use the wartime method of contracting out printing.

Regarding the relationship between the Commercial Press and the authors, Mr. Su said that most of them are royalties, taking 15% of the selling price of the book, and settling accounts three times a year. Very few are paid by manuscript fee, and even if there are, it is 15,000 yuan per thousand words.

I asked whether the government could provide any subsidies to the Commercial Press, which had suffered too heavy losses during the war, after the "post-war recovery"?

Mr. Su's answer was negative. He said;

"The Commercial Press has decided to be self-reliant and does not intend to accept any subsidies." However, the Commercial Press has a certain relationship with the Ministry of Education, which is that all works of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau are entrusted to the Commercial Press for printing, and all printing and distribution are handled by the Commercial Press. The Commercial Press also pays the royalties for these books.

This is the only relationship between the Commercial Press and the government. (To be continued)

### Intolerable City, Sighing Before the Painted Buildings

— Zikai (Feng Zikai)

### Thoughts on Tree Planting

— Shu Xiang

"Arbor Day" has passed.

Every time that festival comes, our local officials are very busy. This year is no exception. On Dragon Mountain in this coastal city, at around eight o'clock, there were already many people crowded together, everyone trying to see the magistrate's posture when planting trees. The magistrate's hands are really white, and it's difficult for him to use this heavy hoe to plant trees, many common people secretly said.

My humble dwelling is very close to the mountain, opening the door and seeing the mountain. When I saw many people crowded on the mountain, I naturally thought of the annual Arbor Day. However, every year trees are planted, but this mountain never seems to have more trees growing. Tree seedlings have almost become leaky buckets here, like pouring water on Cow Mountain, wasting the magistrate's efforts and the fresh tree seedlings in the farm.

Chinese people are good at bullying flowers and trees. Apart from public parks where there is police protection, wherever you go in the mountains and wilderness, you will always see many tourists who will casually break branches and peel bark. Even big trees are treated like this, so tree seedlings that are planted are either trampled by tourists or wantonly cut down by woodcutters.

During the War of Resistance, trees were the most effective protection. Adults and gentlemen could squeeze into solid underground rooms and air-raid shelters, but ordinary people could only hide under the shade of trees. Airplanes roared overhead, and bombs exploded all around. At that time, I really hoped that the leaves would grow denser and denser. When I lived in a place with barren Cow Mountain, the first feeling was disappointment, the second was hatred!

The flames of war spread, and the newspapers sometimes reported news of bombings and attacks in certain places. This year, on Arbor Day in our county, a meaningful couplet was hung at the entrance of the agricultural and forestry farm:

"Do not forget the wild cries of air raid alarms, when women and children carry each other, seeking shelter under trees.

It is essential to seek permanent national defense, join together and plant forests."

The effectiveness of tree planting, in addition to regulating water and drought, also has the meaning of air defense.

### Talking About Municipal Administration

— Chang Liu

It was rumored for a while that Shanghai's public utilities were about to increase prices, but according to the official announcement later, "public utilities" are not allowed to increase prices recently. If there is a shortage, the municipal government will compensate.

Not increasing the prices of "public utilities" is truly a blessing for the people, and the people benefit greatly. However, the municipal government has repeatedly appealed to the city council, asking for additional budget, which shows that the municipal government itself is already in extreme financial difficulty. I wonder where this huge "public utility" compensation fee will come from?

We believe that Shanghai's municipal administration has indeed reached a stage of extreme difficulty. As Mayor Wu said to reporters, he himself really wants to leave Shanghai. This means that Shanghai's municipal administration is indeed not easy to deal with.

On the one hand, Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the largest international city in the Far East. The population has exceeded four million. The problems facing us, such as housing shortages, traffic congestion, rising prices, sanitation facilities, municipal reorganization, market control, and the municipal government's financial difficulties, will cause even people with the highest wisdom and talent to feel extremely headache.

However, standing in the position of a citizen, we should encourage every unit and every staff member of the municipal administration. Since Shanghai is the model for all cities in the country, we should fight against all difficulties with all our strength. Life itself is a "war"!

We should have the determination to only "win" and never "lose".

Someone once said that we should fight against the most difficult problems, and Shanghai's municipal administration is no exception.

### Picking Cherry Blossoms

The Family of a Traitor Requests the Return of Valuable Furniture

Officialdom falsifies and is corrupt, undoubtedly furniture is mostly valuable. Gathering the tears of the people, shamelessly decorating the traitor's doorway!

Astonished by the strange request, how can they not know shame? The name of traitor, have they forgotten its filth, still wanting to savor it again?

### Love, Divorce, and Couples: Can Spouses Make Friends with Members of the Opposite Sex After Marriage?

— Fang

According to news reports: Last year's divorce statistics in the United States show that most divorces were caused by one spouse forming friendships with members of the opposite sex, and most often, by wives forming friendships with men. At first glance, this news seems very strange. Who would have thought that in the extremely open social environment of the United States, friendships with the opposite sex would become the most common reason for divorce? In fact, the so-called friendships here have already exceeded the bounds of friendship. People often cannot distinguish between friendship and love. Coupled with misunderstandings and the decline of love ethics, triangular relationships are easily formed, ultimately leading to the separation of couples!

In our current society, the ethics of love are even weaker. In the commonly seen divorce cases, this kind of situation is certainly not rare, so it deserves our attention.

Originally, although friendship to love needs to go through a stage, there really isn't a clear divide between them. No one can detect themselves in the beginning of love; often when you realize you are in love, the "beginning" has already passed long ago. Therefore, friendship after marriage, without caution or restraint, can easily lead to tragedy.

First, we must avoid one spouse forming friendships with members of the opposite sex alone after marriage. The couple should be a single entity. Any meeting or correspondence with any friend should be together. Even a single, even secret, date or letter, will be a poisonous cancer, an unfortunate root sprout. If there are things that a couple cannot disclose to each other, then they should not have gotten married in the first place.

Love is inherently a sacrifice. If you cannot sacrifice your opposite-sex friends for your lover, then frankly speaking, your love for your lover is really superficial, blind, a love built on shifting sands. Friends! You must seriously examine and consider this, otherwise a rash union will only be the beginning of pain!

Don't seek solace from friends when there are quarrels between spouses. This not only does not help the situation but can easily stir up waves, because this kind of consolation is bound to receive a positive response. At this time, the person being comforted will definitely feel that their spouse is not as understanding as a friend, thereby deepening the rift. In fact, friends, try to reflect, anyone is always polite and gentle to members of the opposite sex other than their spouse. Once they become your spouse, things will probably be different. Moreover, your spouse, during the stage of loving you or during the stage of friendship with you, must have been able to comfort you better than your other friends, right? Therefore, when there are disputes, the main thing is understanding, not seeking consolation from others.

As a third party, you must not insert yourself into a couple's dispute. One-sided consolation must not exist, as it is harmful without any benefit. A couple's disputes can only be resolved by the couple themselves. Any external force only increases the disputes but never leads to a perfect solution. You should not have or maintain friendship with one spouse alone. You should regard a couple as a single entity, which will reduce many unnecessary misunderstandings.

Marriage is a cooperation. You cannot push the responsibility of happiness onto your partner alone; you must also bear half of the responsibility yourself. With mutual loyalty, mutual help, mutual understanding, and mutual tolerance, marriage will always be beautiful and happy.

(Editor's note: Mr. Fang's idea is that after men and women get married, they should abandon all their opposite-sex friends, or at least not allow you to interact with your opposite-sex friends alone. This point of view, in principle, is worth discussing; it is hoped that readers can offer some unique opinions.)

### The Sweetest Thing

— Qing Tong

The American Chemical Society has received a report: Professor Weelert of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has invented a new chemical substance that is four thousand times sweeter than sugar. It is said that putting a tiny bit on the tongue will cause a sensation of sweetness for half an hour.

During the war, this invention was formulated in the Netherlands but was not revealed to the enemy. It is the sweetest of a family of seven brothers, the other six being from one hundred and twenty to two thousand times sweeter than sugar. Professor Weelert claims that other artificial sugars leave an aftertaste, but this one does not have this drawback. Another benefit is that its sweetness is extraordinarily high. Saccharin (a derivative of coal tar) is two hundred to seven hundred times sweeter than sugar, and Dulcin is even worse, only seventy to two hundred and fifty times. Compared to its four thousand times, the superiority is obvious.

Professor Weelert is a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam and chairman of the International Committee for the Naming of Organic Chemistry. He believes that his discovery may alleviate the current global sugar shortage.

The Netherlands has begun manufacturing this newly invented orange crystalline substance. The establishment of a factory in the United States is also under discussion.

How this thing can actually be used still needs to be reported after testing. Moreover, actual use must comply with the regulations of many countries. (Translated from the second issue of the Beverage Magazine)

### Record of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

"They're going to Chongqing too. My cousin just left two months ago. He never mentioned this to me at all." Fatty Xu rushed to explain to Old Zhu for her. "Old Zhu, didn't you meet him here? It's Professor Hu, who studies biology all day long! He doesn't play mahjong, watch plays, drink wine, or want friends—a bookworm!"

"Oh! Hu Juewen. That's right, that's right," Zhu Zhaonian understood. An image of a short man with disheveled hair and beard, wearing a large blue cloth gown, immediately appeared in his mind.

"Letters going to and from the occupied areas are easily lost. Maybe Juewen simply didn't know we were coming," the young woman, called Lan by Old Zhu, explained. Her words were slow and clear, and her attitude was slightly reserved. "Mr. Zhu, I never thought I would meet you here! At that time, Li Xiang and I all thought you had an accident on the ship to Haiphong. Who knew it was a terrible rumor!"

Speaking the last sentence, her voice couldn't help but tremble, and Old Zhu's heart also trembled. He almost wanted to shout for a while, and wanted to rush over and tightly grasp the pair of hands that he hadn't touched for eleven years. In the end, he lowered his head in despair and couldn't speak for a long time.

"That's true. That year, many friends in Shanghai all thought you were dead. Who would have thought that two years later, you would still be alive and return, but it was your brother who really lost his life. Hahaha!" Fatty Xu, who was not concerned, found this incident quite interesting.

Zhu Zhaonian slowly raised his head, looking at the person he could never forget and smiled sadly.

"Terrible rumor," he murmured. "This rumor has caused me too much loss!"

The young woman suddenly turned around quickly, facing the window, and remained silent for a long time.

Old Xu glanced at Old Zhu without much attention, and then looked at the watch on his wrist.

"Come on! Old Zhu, let's go drink!" He said cheerfully, "Although my wife is gone, A Shi's cooking is still good. Today, we're welcoming your sister-in-law, let's add a few dishes. Since you are acquaintances, it's good to have companions. Let's go!"

He gestured, pointing to the dining room on the left. Zhu Zhaonian nodded and was the first to walk out of the reception room. He did not look at the young woman again.

"Second sister-in-law, please have dinner. We'll discuss the car later." The host greeted. (Sixteen)
