### The President Inquires About Shanghai's Financial Situation; The Executive Yuan Simultaneously Invites Responsible Parties for Talks, Encouraging Them to Make Earnest Efforts to Assist Production

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At 4 PM on the 28th, the President received Qian Xin-zhi, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Communications, at his official residence. He inquired about the financial situation in Shanghai after the currency reform and listened to Mr. Qian's opinions. Mr. Qian offered the President three suggestions: (1) The currency reform was a timely measure, although it was felt to be somewhat late. The response after the reform has been excellent, and it is hoped that the government can strengthen its implementation with the greatest determination. It is also hoped that the government will replenish the reserve for issuance, and that the assets of state-owned enterprises will be converted into negotiable securities by issuing stocks as soon as possible. (2) After the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates, the people have exchanged gold, silver, and foreign currencies for Gold Yuan Certificates, and the floating capital in the market has in fact increased compared to before. It is hoped that the government can use effective measures to guide this increased floating capital into proper channels, so as not to stimulate prices. (3) Stabilizing prices to promote industrial production. The President agreed with these points. The conversation lasted one hour before Mr. Qian took his leave.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At 3:30 PM on the 28th, Premier Weng Wen-hao of the Executive Yuan convened a meeting at the Yuan, inviting the heads of commercial banks, business leaders, and representatives from the Bankers' Association and the Silver Industry Association for discussions. Those present included Xu Ji-qing, Li Fu-sun, Qin Run-qing (represented by Shen Ri-xin), Chen Guangfu (represented by Wu Kejia), Du Yue-sheng, Song Zi-liang, Chuan Mu-bo, Yu Zuo-ting, Wang Meng-shu, Xu Guo-mao, Tan Gong-yuan, Wang Shao-xian, Zai Ming-li, Wang Zhi-xin, Rao Tao-shu, and more than ten others. Minister of Finance Wang Yun-wu and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Bai-yuan also participated. The meeting lasted for about two hours. At the beginning of the meeting, Premier Weng and Minister Wang explained the significance of convening the meeting, which was to review the financial and economic measures taken over the past week. Premier Weng first expressed his appreciation to the financial community for faithfully implementing national policies over the past week, and then gave instructions on lowering market interest rates for all banks, assisting production enterprises, depositing foreign exchange reserves, and facilitating domestic remittances, encouraging them to continue their earnest efforts. He also expressed hope that the Shanghai business and financial leaders would cooperate effectively with the government to ensure that the emergency financial and economic measures could be thoroughly implemented. After the opening remarks by Premier Weng and Minister Wang, Li Fu-sun and Xu Ji-qing spoke, explaining how the Shanghai business community had complied with the government's emergency financial and economic measures and the instructions given by the President during the previous meeting. They also expressed their firm commitment to supporting the government's unfulfilled policies and continuing to promote them. Subsequently, Du Yue-sheng, Wang Zhi-xin, Yu Zuo-ting, and others spoke in succession, offering suggestions. The main points of their suggestions were: (1) They hoped that bank interest rates could be gradually lowered, rather than being rigidly stipulated. They felt that the proposed reductions to within one cent after September 1st and within five points after September 16th were too low, which would affect the survival of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and create a situation where funds would not be lent out. (2) They hoped that the capital increases for banks would not be too high, and that completing the capital increases within two months was too short of a time limit. They expressed that increasing the capital of Shanghai banks to one million Gold Yuan Certificates was beyond the capacity of most banks. (3) They hoped that the stock exchange, which had been ordered to suspend operations, would be restored in the near future. (4) The Legislative Yuan is discussing the acquisition of commercial shares in the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. They hoped that the government could reconsider. If the government believes that the directors and supervisors of commercial shares in these banks are not entirely suitable, they can be replaced, but they do not support the central government's acquisition of commercial shares. Regarding the deposit of foreign exchange reserves with the Central Bank, they expressed their willingness to cooperate with the government, deposit as much as possible, and convene a meeting of the heads of banks and commercial banks in Shanghai within eleven days to discuss the technical issues of the deposit. Finally, Premier Weng concluded by saying that he had personally recorded the opinions of the Shanghai financial community and would keep them for future reference. He stated that he would consider adopting all feasible suggestions to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, Li Fu-sun and Wang Zhi-xin returned to Shanghai at 6 PM on the 28th, while Du Yue-sheng and Xu Ji-qing took the night train on the 28th and the morning train on the 29th to return to Shanghai. In addition, the heads of various state banks and bureaus who came to Nanjing to attend the board meeting of the Four Joint Offices, including Qian Xin-zhi, Xi De-mao, and Cheng Yuan-fan, also returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 28th.

### Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Must Be Exchanged Within Four Days, Amounting to US$12 Million; Premier Weng Claims Initial Success in Economic Reform

Board Meeting of the Four Joint Offices

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Four Joint Offices held its 370th board meeting on the morning of the 28th, chaired by Premier Weng Wen-hao. The directors present were Wang Yun-wu, Chen Qi-tian, Liu Gong-yun, Song Han-zhang, Qian Xin-zhi, and Secretary-General Xu Bai-yuan. First, the Secretariat reported on the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures and the reactions in various regions, generally indicating a stabilizing trend. Subsequently, the heads of various banks and treasuries reported on the general business conditions after the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates. They expressed optimism about the work of collecting gold, silver, and foreign currencies. According to the reports received as of the 26th, a total of over 10,170 market taels of gold, over 200,530 market taels of silver, over 906,200 silver dollars, over 5.15 million US dollars, and over 9.2 million Hong Kong dollars have been collected, totaling approximately US$12 million. In the future, various banks and treasuries will further improve the collection techniques to facilitate customers. Premier Weng then instructed that the economic reform has achieved initial success. In the future, for stabilizing the market, adjusting supply and demand, strictly prohibiting speculation, cracking down on the black market, channeling funds, and assisting production, close coordination should be planned to accelerate the completion of the reform policies. Following this, proposals were discussed.

1.  Regarding how to formulate the lending policy in the future, three points were decided in principle.

    (1) The general budget for the second half of the year should be revised according to the Gold Yuan unit. Various agencies should use the funds in installments in accordance with the provisions of the Public Treasury Law. All loans secured by the budget should be stopped.

    (2) Market interest rates should be gradually reduced. The original differential interest rate standard should be abolished. Loans that have not yet matured should be calculated according to the new method from the 23rd of this month.

    (3) With price stability and the gradual normalization of production and sales, the original ordering loans and entrusted production methods should no longer be applicable. Procurement may be carried out when necessary.

As for the lending targets, scope, loan review procedures, and post-loan assessments, how to redefine them will be discussed by a special project team and then submitted for review.

2.  Domestic remittance rates should be gradually leveled, and various banks and bureaus should handle them in accordance with the following principles.

    (1) Various banks and bureaus should charge low fees for remittances, and the Central Bank should allocate funds at any time.

    (2) When handling remittances, banks and bureaus should still strictly verify the name, address, and purpose of the remittance in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance to prevent abuses.

3.  Revise the Provisional Rules for Interbank Rediscounting by the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank (full text on the left corner).

### Zhang Li-sheng Arrives in Tianjin

Claims that if the Economic Reform Plan Fails, the Entire Nation Will Suffer a Major Disaster

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Fu-zhou went to Tianjin at 8 AM on the 28th.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Fu-zhou arrived in Tianjin on the 28th. During the conversation, Mr. Zhang emphasized that the general public has already exchanged all their gold and silver notes for Gold Yuan Certificates, which is truly moving. He especially hopes that banks, money houses, companies, and stores that have gold, silver, and foreign currencies will also actively contribute them. He pointed out that this is not a loss, but if the economic reform plan fails, the entire nation will suffer a major economic crisis. Regarding stabilizing prices, Mr. Zhang said that the government will comprehensively study the transportation and sales costs of various goods to restore prices to a normal state. Although the current price limits cannot be said to be short-term, they cannot be said to be frozen for a long time. Regarding the issue of capital inflow to the Northeast, he said that Director Wang Fu-zhou will study and resolve the issue.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] According to Director Wang Fu-zhou, the government has several thousand tons of nickel coins in storage from the war, which are being distributed to various places to meet the needs. In addition, silver and copper coins are being produced in large quantities.

### Sorghum is Ripening, Autumn Harvest is Approaching; The Northeast Can Strengthen Economic Warfare; Provincial and County Governments Decide to Establish People's Self-Defense Committees Immediately

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The sorghum in the Northeast is ripening, and the authorities attach great importance to the autumn harvest. Provincial, city, and county governments have decided to immediately establish People's Self-Defense Committees to strengthen economic warfare, protect the land, and harvest grain. The commanders of the garrison troops in each county will serve concurrently as the chairmen of the Self-Defense Committees. Wang Tie-han, Chairman of Liaoning Province, and Dong Wen-qi, Mayor of Shenyang, will also serve concurrently as the chairmen of the People's Self-Defense Committees. Moreover, with the autumn harvest approaching, bandits in the Jilin and Liaobei areas are organizing "Grain-Snatching Guerrilla Teams" to widely roam and seize grain.

Reorganization of the Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters on September 1st

[Our Pan-yang Dispatch, 28th] It is reported that the Political Affairs Committee of the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters in the Northeast has received an order from the Executive Yuan to reorganize its new establishment on September 1st. The Political Affairs Committee will have one chairman, fourteen appointed members, and one secretary-general. It will have four departments: political affairs, economy, culture and education, and land. There will be five to seven appointed inspection commissioners. The committee is currently considering technical issues related to the reorganization. Due to the special environment in the Northeast, the organization may be slightly larger than stipulated. Reorganization is inevitable. The laid-off personnel will be properly resettled so they do not lose their jobs.

### Four Committees of the Control Yuan Hold a Meeting; Discuss Raising the Salaries of Public Servants and Teachers; Decided to Transfer to the Finance Committee for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Economic, Resources, Agricultural and Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committees of the Control Yuan held a meeting on the morning of the 28th to discuss Chai Feng's proposal, "Please Correct the Government's Decision to Raise the Salaries of Public Servants and Teachers According to Pre-War Standards." The participating committee members spoke one after another, and most of them believed that it was necessary to draw the government's attention to the issue of the treatment of public servants and teachers. However, whether it is necessary to propose a correction案 is still under study. It was decided to transfer it to the Finance Committee of the Yuan for further discussion. The main contents of the case are as follows: "The government's tax revenue and the fees of state-owned enterprises will be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. However, the treatment of public servants and teachers still follows the old system and is far from pre-war standards. However, finance and economy are related to the entire politics. If we want political integrity, it is necessary to: (1) Eliminate corruption, (2) Improve efficiency. However, to achieve these two, it is necessary to improve the treatment of civil and military public servants and teachers. According to the new system, the treatment of public servants and teachers is paid in Gold Yuan, but this Gold Yuan is only half of the pre-war silver dollar, which has been effectively halved. The standard in the Beijing-Shanghai area is based on the original salary of 40 yuan for the Gold Yuan, but in reality, only 20 yuan of the pre-war silver dollar is obtained. If the original salary is 800 yuan, it can get 142 Gold Yuan, which is 71 silver dollars, less than one-tenth of the pre-war. Senior executives may be able to use their powers to obtain subsidies. Therefore, in order to eliminate corruption and improve efficiency, the treatment of public servants and teachers under the new currency system must be free from additional subsidies, and should be increased together with pre-war tax revenue standards, without any discounts.

### Regarding a Certain Anonymous Person's Case; The Control Yuan Committee Emphasizes Investigation

Jiang Jingguo Has Also Focused on This

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Before the announcement of the Emergency Economic Measures, a certain anonymous person who went to Shanghai to speculate and made windfall profits has attracted a lot of attention. The Control Yuan also exchanged views on this in the small group committee on the morning of the 28th, believing that it should be investigated. However, no decision was made. It is also learned that Jiang Jingguo, who is stationed in Shanghai to supervise the implementation of the emergency financial and economic measures, has recently focused on this, and some people are pinning their hopes on Mr. Jiang's major measures.

### Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel; Regional Payment Standards; The Executive Yuan Stipulates Implementation This Month

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Executive Yuan has decided on the regional payment standards for the salaries of civil and military personnel, stipulating that they will be implemented from August and paid in Gold Yuan Certificates. The standard is based on the Beijing-Shanghai area, with 40 yuan as the base. For those with a base salary exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan, the excess amount is calculated at 20%. Those exceeding 300 yuan are calculated at 10%. For areas outside the Beijing-Shanghai area, if prices are lower than the Beijing-Shanghai area, the payment will be reduced accordingly.

Editorial

### Compassionate Intentions and the Resolution to Eliminate Evil

—A few words to university professors and authorities about clearing out professional students—

During the implementation of currency reform and economic stabilization measures, another important government measure is to actively eliminate Communist spies lurking in society, including the investigation and crackdown on professional students who lead student movements. Three days before the Emergency Economic Measures Order, the Executive Yuan ordered local security authorities to implement four measures, one of which was to strictly prohibit students from engaging in strikes, demonstrations, incitement, and other behaviors intended to obstruct the suppression of rebellion, and designated that such offenders be handled by special criminal courts. In his speech on the 22nd, the President, in addition to economic measures, specifically reiterated his determination to crack down on the Communist Party disrupting schools. In the past ten days, security authorities in the capital and other cities such as Pingjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have taken actions to assist in the implementation of this order, and special criminal courts are also summoning people for questioning according to law. We cherish education and have repeatedly written articles urging university teachers and students to automatically sanction students who disrupt schools. Now that the situation is slightly different, we would like to say a few more words to university presidents and professors, and provide some suggestions to the authorities responsible for carrying out this task.

First, we must point out that it is a tragedy of the times that these young people who have received higher education cannot be persuaded by reason and instead are exploited by the Communist Party, or are unknowingly manipulated by them without realizing it, ultimately facing sanctions under national law, or being convicted and punished due to conclusive evidence, or taking risks and fleeing to Communist-controlled areas. But at the same time, we must also point out that the thorough elimination of Communist spies, including important figures active in universities, is as important as economic reform, meets the needs of the times and public opinion, and is also a government responsibility that cannot be "tolerated again." This matter must be done thoroughly in order to restore stability to universities; like the reform of the currency system, this major undertaking can only succeed and must not fail.

We believe that eliminating the troublemakers among students is something that meets the demands of public opinion. Because now, unless someone is blindly acting as an outer member of the Communist Party, no one can deny that the large-scale student movements in recent years have been led by a core of Communist professional students. Just by looking back, we can all remember that university student strikes, demonstrations, and other behaviors have increased since the Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion Order last May. The more tense the military situation in the suppression of the Communist Party, the more frequent, widespread, and violent these destructive student movements became. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there were 96 student movements in this academic year, with a loss of 506 days of study time. Especially since April and May of this year, their incitement activities have become more violent, and the student masses clearly understand that all student movements are led and controlled by Communist Party infiltrators. Scientists, professors, and presidents of universities often distrust the government's warnings and have long been deceived and manipulated by them. Now, they also painfully feel that the level of students is declining day by day, and the sympathy of society is increasingly being lost. They have gradually realized that the source of all unrest lies in the lurking Communist spies, whose behavior is no longer tolerable. The most heartbroken are, of course, the students' parents, who see the tuition fees provided with their sweat and blood being wasted as if thrown away, leading to excessive tolerance on the part of the schools and the government. Therefore, just as the depreciation of the legal tender has reached its limit and is deeply criticized by the people, the disturbance and rampant behavior of professional students in schools has also reached a point that society cannot tolerate.

The government's relatively mild and tolerant attitude towards students who cause trouble is not only due to the psychology of "fear of hurting the vase when trying to catch the mouse," but also due to excessive respect for the status of scholars and professors, originally hoping that their education would solve the internal affairs of the schools themselves. However, facts have proven that this is not possible, and today it is necessary to take pressure to eliminate them. As for authorizing special judicial institutions to handle this matter, it can be said to be an extremely last resort. We have already mentioned that cracking down on student movements in this way is a sad thing for China today, but on the other hand, we must remind the principals and professors that this is something that must be done for the sake of the country and the future of education, and that everyone must work together to do it.

The facts are very clear, but we are still saying this again today because experts and professors specialize in their fields and are often "easily deceived by those who know their ways," or they overestimate their own status and the importance of their fields. Moreover, some young lecturers and professors are even moved by the inflammatory instigation, shifting their dissatisfaction with the current situation to any action by the government, and thus may become an obstacle to the government's implementation. At present, the response of the presidents of various well-known universities is very fair: President Hu Shi of Peking University mentioned that university students are not people in concessions, Acting President Wang of Shanghai Jiaotong University said that the government is handling things according to law and that the school cannot protect illegal elements, and President Chen of Nanjing Jinling University said that "school education is not only cultivating young people, but also educating young people to respect the law." All of them can recognize that the government is handling things according to law and that students must comply, which can indeed show a fundamental meaning. However, we still deeply hope that the school authorities will take responsibility together, because it is all for the benefit of the school itself. The principals must still stand at the forefront and must not completely entrust the security and judicial organs to handle the matter without asking, and should not have an equal or biased mentality that would cover up the evil and cause harm. Principals and professors have more contact with students on weekdays and observe them more closely. Although it is said that some universities are too large, they are ultimately more attentive than the police's investigation. In order to restore the stability of the school, eliminating troublemakers is certainly important, but protecting the innocent so that there is no injustice is also necessary. Both of these require the school authorities to frankly provide materials and give the security authorities the assistance they should have in their implementation. Those young people who have been deeply poisoned and trained to deliberately sabotage really cannot be tolerated. The school must also have the determination to eliminate evil in order to protect the interests of pure students and the school. Secondly, we want to remind the local administrative and security organs that are implementing the Executive Yuan's orders that the Communist Party's "student movement" work in schools, especially in higher education, is a long-standing conspiracy, and now is the time to thoroughly eliminate Communist spies without tolerance. But here there is a most important prerequisite, that is, the government is taking this action to eliminate military obstacles and stabilize order, but another purpose is to truly cherish education and to restore the stability and progress of universities. Therefore, those who implement the orders must certainly have a psychology of security above all else, but they must also not ignore the standpoint of education and must not hurt the feelings of the school authorities and the majority of pure students. We have earnestly hoped that the security authorities will be responsible and also be prudent. The great statesmen of our ancestors treated crimes and punishments with what is called "compassionate intentions and no rejoicing," which is enough to represent the government's mood in eliminating Communist Party students today. Those in charge of security and special justice must understand this intention in order to be good at implementing this task. We are eliminating troublemakers in order to protect the right to study of the majority of good students; we are cracking down on reactionaries in order to preserve the higher education of the country. No matter how insulting the past behavior of the professional students towards the government's military and police, there must be no retaliatory psychology today, but must absolutely abide by the law. Simply put: the authorities enforcing security must have a firm stance, but their methods must be gentle; the methods can be decisive, but the attitude must still be peaceful. This will win the sympathy and cooperation of the school authorities and can achieve twice the result with half the effort; otherwise, disturbing the grass and alarming the snakes will cause many complications and will not be able to accomplish the task. As for the personnel in charge of the special criminal courts, they certainly have legal knowledge, but they must also have political demeanor. The list obtained from the investigation may not be completely reliable, so the summons must be meticulous, and the evidence must be complete, so as to ensure that there is no injustice. The school authorities may have cases of bias and tolerance, but if the special criminal court acts in a civilized and prudent manner, it will be able to obtain the assistance of the school under the current general situation. Using a compassionate mentality to assist the sense of responsibility in enforcing the law, then sincerity will be able to move people, and even young people with strong blood and energy will be able to calmly be convinced.

We also feel that the educational administrative authorities, at a time when this autumn semester has not yet started and the security and judicial organs are already implementing orders, must not only not relax their responsibilities, but must also stand up and take responsibility for making comprehensive and active plans to cooperate with this solemn task. In the Ministry of Education's attitude toward universities, only skillful coping is not allowed. If the methods are not unified, they are often investigated afterwards, and rarely eliminated in advance. Now that the government has risen to take responsibility, the Ministry of Education must not shirk its responsibility from now on, but must provide materials, provide methods, and assist the security authorities in various ways, in order to atone for its past failures to fulfill its responsibilities.

Finally, we would like to reiterate to university presidents, professors, and pure students who advocate reason: the government's determination and actions this time are not only a political necessity, but also the only way to ensure the safety of education. We must recognize that the Communist bandits' sabotage and rebellion have reached a point where they are absolutely opposed to the interests of education and the country. Today's actions are to eliminate traitors, not to "persecute" young people; they are to clear away obstacles to the country's survival, not to infringe on the freedom of schools; they are to drive away the demons that are anti-science and anti-education, not to destroy the dignity of academia and education. The government should certainly maintain a cautious and careful attitude, and university teachers and students must recognize the times, distinguish between benefits and harms, and cooperate in order to enable the authorities to fulfill their tasks well and restore the stability and progress of schools.

### Two Convicted of Escorting Students to Communist Areas Sentenced to Ten Years' Imprisonment; Three Students from Central University Sentenced to Five and Six Years' Imprisonment Respectively

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei, students from Central University, and Communist liaison officers Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui, five people who planned to sneak into Communist areas to participate in rebellious work, were previously tried by the Capital Special Criminal Court, and the verdict was announced at 10:50 a.m. on the 28th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and continued to implement it, and shall be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights." "Zhu Chengxue jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and prepared to implement it, and shall be sentenced to six years of imprisonment and six years of deprivation of civil rights." "Hua Binqing and Li Fei jointly intended to undermine the national system and seize national territory, and prepared to implement it, and shall each be sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights."

Chief Judge's Explanation

After the presiding judge announced the verdict, he also explained: Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui were working as traffic liaisons for the bandits and had repeatedly escorted students to Communist areas. They should have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Considering that they were workers with limited knowledge, although their crimes were heinous, they were ignorant and exploited, so they were given a lighter sentence, reduced to ten years of imprisonment. Zhu Chengxue and the other three originally acted together, but according to the confessions of Li Fei and Hua Binqing during the interrogation by the Police Department, it was Zhu Chengxue who invited them to go, which clearly shows that Zhu was the initiator, so Zhu was sentenced to one more year. According to the indictment, the crimes of the three should also be punishable by death or life imprisonment, but the circumstances of "contacting the Civil League to surround the Youth Department" are only suspected and there is no conclusive evidence, so only the "preparation to work in the Communist area of Chaoxian County" is based on Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Crimes during the Suppression of Rebellion, which should be punishable by ten years of imprisonment. However, considering that you are university students and the state has spent money to cultivate you, we still have hope for you and will reduce the sentence by half again so as not to affect your future. In law, the sentence has been reduced as much as possible. As long as you abide by the law in the future, you can even be granted early parole. The court has considered this case carefully. If you are still dissatisfied, you can apply to the Central Special Criminal Court for a review within ten days of receiving the judgment." Zhu Chengxue and others seemed surprised by the lenient sentence, so they had expressions of surprise and realization, because before the judgment, Zhu and others frequently inquired whether they would be sentenced to death. Tao Yuangui seemed to be overwhelmed with repentance and asked the presiding judge to be merciful, saying that there was an old father at home with no one to support him and asked for a reduction in sentence. The presiding judge rebuked him, saying: "Your sentence has already been reduced, the judgment has been made, and you can be released early as long as you abide by the law in the future." At this point, the court ordered the five convicts to be escorted back and adjourned.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Liao Zuorun and Hua Wu, students at Central University suspected of being Communist spies, have been issued summonses by the Capital Special Criminal Court.

### Chengdu Nickel Coin Frenzy Gradually Calms Down; Central Bank Branch Delays Announcement of Universal Telegraph Order; Industrial and Commercial Groups Jointly Telegraph Center to Investigate

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the Central Bank's corruption in the Chengdu nickel coin turmoil, the Chengdu newspapers unanimously reported on the 28th that Yang Xiaoci, the branch manager of the Central Bank, used his power to suppress the head office's telegraph order for universal use of nickel coins and secretly used a huge amount of 7 trillion legal tender to purchase nickel coins, making tens of trillions in profits, causing extreme chaos in the Chengdu market. Today, it has aroused resentment among the people of Chengdu, and public opinion is in an uproar. Industrial and commercial groups have jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate and severely punish them.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 27th] In this nickel coin turmoil, the Central Bank of Chengdu received a telegram on the 21st ordering universal use, but it was delayed until the 25th before it was announced. During this period, countless people made billions of profits by buying and selling nickel coins. The supervisory committee member stationed in Chengdu believes that the bank has major suspicions of corruption and embezzlement and has decided to formally file a report.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 28th] The huge waves in the market caused by the Chengdu nickel coin turmoil gradually calmed down on the 28th. Most of the shops have resumed business, and the city government has generally set price limits, with rice at 54 million yuan per double stone. However, most of the goods in the market have been snapped up, resulting in supply falling short of demand. The Provincial Federation of Commerce today telegraphed the President, requesting that the nickel coins be recalled and recast to prevent the harm of coins. The provincial government has decided to set hard price limits and prohibit hoarding, with severe penalties for violators.

### Qingdao Arrests Gold Speculators; Rumors of a US Dollar Black Market Re-emerge; US Military to Exchange US Dollars for Gold Yuan for Payroll

[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 27th] Since the currency reform, the US garrison in Qingdao will pay the Central Bank US$800,000 monthly to exchange for Gold Yuan to pay salaries to Chinese and foreign staff.  Excluding 30% that will flow back to the US, the government may acquire US$400,000 to $500,000 in foreign exchange. The annual amount is enough to cover the expenses of over 100 divisions of the National Army for one month.

In the past, US dollars were priced at nineteen "nan zha," therefore, over the past three years, of the millions of US dollars that flowed into the Qingdao market, it is normally estimated that about one million remain in Qingdao.  However, since the Central Bank began exchanging the new currency, the first day was exceptionally crowded, reaching 200,000 yuan. In subsequent days, it has not been able to break this record, and so far, it has not even reached 300,000 yuan.

Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the Western Pacific Fleet, announced his full cooperation to completely eliminate the circulation of US dollars in Qingdao. On the day of the exchange, Major General Smith, Commander of the Marine Corps, and Captain Johnson, Chief of the Qingdao Harbor Service Department, specifically instructed their troops to be vigilant and informed their subordinates on how to save, deposit, and exchange US dollars through the military post office to send back home. Whether the circulation of US dollars can be completely eradicated will depend on the trend of price developments, especially on whether the US soldiers will disregard the orders of their superiors and still demand US dollars.

However, as a matter of fact, on the first day of the Gold Yuan's appearance, the US dollar black market can be said to have completely disappeared.  Places such as Weixian Road near the Central Bank, which used to be crowded and openly active, a phenomenon that could be called the only miracle in the country, suddenly vanished, like a desolate and silent battlefield after a fierce battle, leaving people to mourn.  But recently, rumors of a black market have resurfaced, and so-called "gold speculators" have been arrested one after another, reaching 250 people in the past three days.  These people have been operating in the black market for years, numbering over a thousand, but they merely rely on running around to search for and supply big clients and make small profits.  Therefore, the previously blatant public appearance was practically ignored by the government. On the one hand, it could be explained as impossible to catch them all, but on the other hand, it inevitably raises suspicions. The new mayor, Xi Xue, who is known as a capable person, visited the black market on the street after taking office and was shocked.  Within a few days, the currency reform was announced.  How to thoroughly investigate the big clients or even cooperate with the Sui District to decisively search private residences will depend on his planning and how he tackles the current difficulties.

Whether it will return to the old ways depends on the overall situation, which cannot be judged solely from Qingdao's perspective. However, the phenomenon in Qingdao can undoubtedly serve as an indicator for the future.

### Jinan's Gold Jewelry Shops Resume Business; Silver Smugglers Seized in Xuzhou

### Hong Kong Gold Prices Plummet

Shanghai Remittance Also Lower Than Official Rate

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] Hong Kong gold prices have been declining since the opening this morning, falling to 302.5 yuan per tael in Shanghai currency at noon. This is the lowest gold price since August 20th. After China's currency reform was announced on August 20th, gold bars fell 15 pounds, resulting in 317 Hong Kong dollars per tael. When trading opened today, gold was at 311 Hong Kong dollars per tael, but due to the large number of sellers, it fell by about 9 yuan, before rising slightly to 304.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael at the close of trading. Financial observers believe this is due to the decline in the US dollar exchange rate, which is now 5.04 Hong Kong dollars per US dollar, compared to 5.22 on August 20th. Shanghai telegraphic transfers from banks here are 130 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan, and Guangzhou telegraphic transfers are 126 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan, both lower than the official exchange rate. The official rate is 133 Hong Kong dollars for 100 Gold Yuan.

### Four-Power Talks on the German Question Reach Agreement in Principle; Technical Details to be Resolved by the Leaders of the Four Occupying Armies in Germany; Publication of the Communiqué Delayed Due to the French Cabinet Crisis

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 28th Broadcast: According to highly reliable sources, the talks in Moscow on the Berlin issue have reached an agreement in principle. The technical details will be resolved by the military leaders in Berlin, and then sent back to Moscow for discussion in order to finalize an agreement to lift the blockade of Berlin. Other issues related to Germany and Europe will be discussed by the four-power foreign ministers in Paris.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: The resignation of the French Marie cabinet has had a major impact on the four-power talks on the German question. The four-power communiqué, originally scheduled to be released tonight, has been temporarily postponed. There will be no meetings between the three-power ambassadors and the Soviet side for the next two days. The four-power talks on the German question could have concluded, but the resignation of the French cabinet will cause a standstill.

[Associated Press, London, 28th Telegraph] After numerous Kremlin talks, the Soviet Union and the three Western powers have apparently reached some agreement on the Berlin issue. It is expected that a four-power joint communiqué will be released simultaneously in the four capitals on the evening of the 28th. It is reported that the Western envoys will decide when to release the communiqué and its contents when they review it in Moscow on the 28th. According to well-informed sources, some technical details still need to be resolved before the communiqué can be released. It is reported that the communiqué will definitely be brief and lacking in detail.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th Telegraph] According to well-informed American sources, the three Western power representatives proposed to Molotov today the establishment of a four-power standing financial committee to handle the issue of issuing East Marks in Berlin. As for the organization and powers of the committee, that side does not wish to continue making statements. In addition, the British Foreign Office announced that the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, met with Bevan's chief advisor, Strang, this morning.

[Associated Press, London, 27th Telegraph] Authoritative sources here have confirmed that the core of the issue lies in the Berlin currency system and the lifting of the blockade. According to the most well-informed sources, if an agreement is reached, the Western powers' West German plan will be completely unrelated to the agreement. It is reported that the Western powers have clearly refused to consider the Soviet proposal that they abandon the West German plan in exchange for lifting the blockade, which has been going on for about four weeks. The Western powers' main goal now is to ensure that all the details of the agreement are completely formulated in Moscow so that there will be no more breakdowns when the matter is returned to the four-power occupying military government chiefs in Berlin.

### French Socialist Party Refuses to Support Reynaud; Marie Cabinet Resigns En Masse; White-Haired Ramadier May Make a Comeback

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th Telegraph] French Prime Minister Marie's cabinet resigned on the morning of the 28th, only one month after taking office, and France has entered a state of anarchy again. President Auriol made another attempt to mediate and consult in order to form a new cabinet. The political crisis was already very serious, but it had not reached a desperate stage. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 28th, the cabinet was deadlocked over Finance Minister Reynaud's economic reform plan, and Marie resigned as a result.

Well-informed sources said that the main reason for the collapse of the Marie government was the refusal of the Socialists to support Reynaud's economic decrees. Therefore, Auriol may ask the Socialists to nominate the Prime Minister. It is widely rumored that former Prime Minister Ramadier, with his white hair, may make a comeback. Ramadier was in power before the Schumann cabinet. At the same time, the collapse of the Marie government has reopened the door to power struggles between the left-wing Communists and the right-wing De Gaulle French People's Rally. Although De Gaulle is not technically prevented from taking power at present, this step must be recommended by the President of the National Assembly to the cabinet to dissolve the parliament and hold a re-election, so this move is not very likely.

### French Elections Postponed

To Prevent De Gaulle from Regaining Power

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th Telegraph] General De Gaulle's hopes of regaining power early have been indefinitely blocked as of the 27th. The French National Assembly passed a motion on the evening of the 25th by a vote of 245 to 193 to postpone the general election. General De Gaulle had hoped to win an absolute victory in the general election in October this year, as he did in last year's local elections. The result of the parliamentary vote decided that the general election would not be held until extensive technical reforms of the electoral mechanism had been completed. This is tantamount to saying that the general election will not be held as long as the anti-De Gaulle parties are willing to postpone the election. The middle parties fully manipulated the vote in parliament and received tacit support from the Communist Party.

Not to be Integrated into the Aid to China Plan

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th Telegraph] Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman met with representatives of the Department of the Army all day today to discuss the ECA's aid to Korea plan.

### South Korean National Assembly Passes Law to Punish Pro-Japanese Collaborators

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 28th Telegraph] The South Korean National Assembly has now passed part of the law to punish pro-Japanese collaborators. The first chapter defines pro-Japanese collaborators and their punishments. The so-called pro-Japanese collaborators include: (1) those who signed the Japan-Korea Protection Treaty and the Annexation of Korea Treaty in the late Joseon Dynasty; (2) those who accepted titles from the Japanese government; (3) those who killed independence activists and their families; and (4) those who organized groups to harm the independence movement. The first three will be deprived of public office for life and have two-thirds of their property confiscated. The latter will also be deprived of office for 10 to 15 years and sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years. When the National Assembly discussed the bill, two young people in the audience shouted against the bill and distributed anti-bill propaganda. It is reported that the two young people are members of a certain right-wing party.

Two Soviet Officers Assassinated

[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast, Berlin News: The Soviets today arrested a reporter from the Associated Press and four American soldiers and have notified the American authorities to send personnel to escort them back to the American occupation zone.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 28th Telegraph] Associated Press reporter Meehan was arrested by Soviet troops at 0:43 AM on the 28th, detained for about 13 hours, and released this afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th Telegraph] Associated Press correspondent in Berlin, Meehan, Lippert, a reporter from the Pioneer Tribune, and a German reporter who accompanied them were arrested by the Soviet authorities. The two reporters were arrested by the Soviet police on their way to the city hall in the Soviet sector of Berlin, where demonstrations against the city government had been held recently. The American military government has demanded the immediate release of the two American reporters.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th Telegraph] According to news received here, two Soviet officers, including the commander of the Soviet forces in Berlin, Paniban Osyur, were assassinated today.

### United States Urges Western European Unity; Hopes for Practical Military and Political Cooperation

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th Telegraph] Diplomatic circles said on the 28th that the United States hopes that the non-communist countries of Western Europe can conclude the current movement and form a military alliance, and finally cooperate politically. This plan is a major part of American foreign policy. Well-informed sources said that this move shows that the United States is actively taking action and does not intend to appease the Soviet Union, in contrast to the appeasement of Germany in 1940. This policy is considered to be conducive to world peace.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th Telegraph] US State Department spokesman McDermott said today that the United States is very sympathetic to the French government's initiative to convene a five-power conference to study the establishment of a European parliament. The parliament will probably be organized by countries participating in the Marshall Plan. McDermott emphasized that the US government supports any plan that Europeans intend to take to politically and economically unite Europe. However, the US government has not yet received a request to send observers to the five-power conference.

### Berlin City Government Plans to Relocate: City Council Chairman Demands Security Guarantee from the Soviets; Kotikov's Reply is Stern

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] Following two disruptions of City Council meetings by Communist thugs, the elected Berlin city government planned on the 27th to move the city hall out of the Soviet-occupied zone. Acting Mayor Herr Fürstenberg and City Council Speaker Dr. Suhr discussed moving the city hall to one of the Western-occupied zones, both being non-Communists. However, the final decision to relocate the city hall depends on the reply of Soviet Berlin Commander Major General Kotikov.

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] Speaker Suhr sent a letter to Soviet Berlin Commander Kotikov, requesting clarification on the Soviet Union's responsibility for the safety of the Berlin City Council. It is believed that this letter may be a prelude to the city government's application for a new city hall site outside the Soviet-occupied zone.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th] The Berlin City Council, recently elected by the Four-Power Agreement, has been unable to convene due to Soviet dissatisfaction, leading to demonstrations by the Socialist Unity Party. City Council Chairman Dr. Suhr sent a letter today to Soviet Berlin Commander Kotikov, requesting attention to the events that occurred at the City Hall in the past two days and urging the implementation of necessary measures to ensure the safe and undisturbed convening of the Council. He also asked whether, during future City Council meetings, Soviet authorities would order future Communist demonstrations to be held at a certain distance from the City Hall. According to the statement from the Soviet Information Bureau regarding Kotikov's reply, the following questions were raised: (1) Does Dr. Suhr wish for Soviet authorities to interfere in the Berlin labor-management relations that are dissatisfied with the City Council? (2) Does Dr. Suhr wish for Soviet authorities to demand that the City Council change its current policies? (3) What policies should the Soviet Union adopt to please Dr. Suhr? The conclusion of Kotikov's reply stated that Dr. Suhr must clearly express his views on the above points so that he (Kotikov), within his authority and following the precedents of European democratic countries, can take necessary decisions.

### German Socialist Party Declaration: Opposes West German Constitutional Draft

### Allied Control Council: Heated Debate Between the US and the USSR; Soviet Representative Attacks MacArthur for Oppressing Japanese Labor; US Representative Accuses the Soviet Union of Distorting Facts

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] At a special meeting of the Allied Control Council held at 4:00 PM on the 28th, Soviet Deputy Representative Kislenko attacked MacArthur's labor policies for violating the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolution guaranteeing the rights of Japanese labor organizations, democratic groups, and unions. He demanded that MacArthur's restrictions "prohibiting strikes and collective bargaining by Japanese civil servants" be withdrawn. During an hour and forty minutes of debate, United Kingdom representative Shawcross also partially supported Kislenko's views. Allied Control Council Chairman and US representative Sebald firmly denied the Soviet attacks, condemned the Soviet Union for oppressing labor within its own borders, and attacked Kislenko for distorting facts for his own benefit.

This objective is "extremely obvious," not only in Japan but also in other unfortunate countries where the Communist Party participates in labor unions and destroys democracy. Sebald stated: If MacArthur had not taken action at that time, "a great tragedy would have already occurred." The occupying forces have adopted a completely friendly attitude towards Japanese labor, and Japanese workers enjoy far more freedom than American workers. MacArthur's recommendation to tighten control over civil servants was issued only after the deteriorating situation caused by the excessive actions of civil servant unions. Sebald pointed out that the temporary ordinance of the Japanese Cabinet will be replaced by permanent legislation passed by the Diet. Chinese representative Shang Zhen hoped that the rights of civil servants mentioned in MacArthur's letter would be fully included in Japanese law and warned against reactionary elements using the prohibition of strikes to further their purposes.

### US Anti-Espionage Bill to Adopt Severe Measures

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Un-American Activities Committee is preparing to introduce a severe US anti-espionage bill on the 28th. It is understood that this opinion will be listed in its internal report on the investigation of Soviet spies and Communist personnel within the government in wartime Washington. The report will clearly state that as a result of the committee's investigation, it was found that the McCarran-Nixon Communist Control Act was too weak in dealing with espionage issues, and new, more stringent measures are necessary. Attorney General Clark and other Justice Department officials have long believed that the current anti-espionage law is too lenient. They stated that under current law, regardless of the evidence, it is very difficult to prosecute foreign spies.

### Deteriorating Relations Between Yugoslavia and Hungary; Yugoslavia Strongly Protests Hungary's Violation of Friendship Agreement

[United Press, Belgrade, 27th] Government authorities today accused Hungarian leaders of plotting to overthrow Marshal Tito and attempting to seize power in Yugoslavia. The government sent a 15-page official letter to the Hungarian Legation, accusing the Hungarian government, especially Communist Deputy Prime Minister Rajk, of inciting "the Yugoslav people's revolution and overthrowing the legal government of Yugoslavia." The letter demanded that Hungary cease this behavior, which "can only be interpreted as an attempt to coerce the people of another democratic country." The Yugoslav government declared, "The moral and historical responsibility for this situation lies entirely with the Hungarian government." Yugoslavia also sent a similar protest letter to Romania on Wednesday, accusing its government and its Foreign Minister Ana Pauker of unfriendly behavior. The letter criticized Hungarian government officials for "violating the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between Yugoslavia and Hungary, and openly launching an anti-Yugoslav campaign."

### Malaya Offers Reward for the Arrest of Twelve Terrorists, Seven of Whom are Leaders of the Malayan Communist Party

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 27th] The Malayan Federal Government believes that the main party leaders of the Malayan Communist Party are the leaders of the terrorists. Yesterday, it publicly offered a reward of 120,000 yuan for the arrest of these twelve ringleaders. Several well-known Communist Party members are among those wanted. At least seven of them had traveled to England as representatives of Malaya to participate in the victory parade. These twelve are Wu Tianwang, Li Song, Peng Kunying, Fang Chunluo, Zhou Yakang, Deng Fuliang, Chen Tian, Liu Ma, Weng Chenghua, Song Wenheng, Bai Ziying, and Huang Qing. (All of the above are transliterations.) Wu Tianwang was once regarded by the United States as one of the three main leaders of the Malayan Communist Party. After attending the British Communist Party Congress in London last year and returning to Malaya, he gave travelling speeches encouraging listeners to join the Communist Party. He brought a small flag of the British Communist Party to Malaya, which bore the message from the British Communist Party to Malayan comrades, guaranteeing support for the Malayan Communist Party in the struggle for freedom. This flag has been discovered in Kuala Lumpur. Li Song traveled to Calcutta this year as a representative of Malaya to participate in the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Chen Tian attended the International Youth Conference in Prague and only returned from the United Kingdom a month before the riots.

### World Post-War Situation Unstable and Turbulent; Bullitt Blames Roosevelt; Wavering China Policy and Excessive Appeasement of Stalin

[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Life magazine, owned by Luce, began today to publish a series of articles by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and France, William Bullitt. Bullitt's articles, titled "How We Won the War and Lost the Peace," analyze American foreign policy from 1933 to the present under the successive administrations of Roosevelt and Truman. The articles discuss America's current position in the world, the reasons for its entry into this situation, and its current direction. However, Bullitt stated that these were his personal observations. In the first article, Bullitt attributed the post-war instability to Roosevelt. He criticized the late president for failing to obtain compensation for American Lend-Lease aid during the war, demanding that Stalin guarantee respect for America's vital interests in a free and independent Europe and a free and independent China. Bullitt stated that Stalin's struggle against Hitler in 1941 gave the United States control over power in world politics, but the United States failed to use this power to require Stalin to guarantee that Europe and Asia would enjoy freedom and peace after the war. Bullitt's article stated that he and several other people had strongly urged Roosevelt to write to Stalin, requesting a formal and public guarantee that he would not invade Europe in the future, nor make demands on China before granting the Soviet Union Lend-Lease aid. Unfortunately, Roosevelt rejected Bullitt's suggestions because (1) such guarantees were of little value because Stalin could renounce them later; and (2) he (Roosevelt) was confident that he could use appeasement to transform Stalin from a Soviet imperialist into a democratic partner. Therefore, Roosevelt's decision was responsible for the creation of today's situation. Bullitt insisted that if his advice had been adopted, Stalin would not have been able to gain control over 120 million people in Eastern Europe as he does today, and the communist threat in China would have been eliminated. Even if Stalin had disregarded his promise and broken his word, the American people would have been alerted and prepared for a response. Bullitt's article also repeatedly discusses American policies towards China and Japan, and the resulting situation in China. In essence, it states that when Roosevelt took office as president in 1933, he had a definite belief in American foreign policy: that the consequences of Japan's invasion of China in 1931 could not be adequately addressed by adhering to President Hoover's policy of refusing to recognize any agreement that would undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Roosevelt's view was such that he instructed Secretary of State Hull to inform Japan that in fact, there was no problem between the United States and Japan that could not be resolved peacefully. Bullitt stated that the American government's reliance on this definite belief in peaceful methods was the origin of America's unwise policy of appeasing Japan, which resulted in the unfortunate Pearl Harbor incident. The article further stated that three years after Roosevelt took office, by early 1936, the United States was in a state of complete isolation. At that time, among the major countries, only China, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, was able to cooperate closely with the United States. On March 7 of the same year, Hitler marched into the Rhineland, and news that Japan might attack China again also reached Washington. In the summer of that year, Roosevelt was forced to reassess the international situation based on America's security needs. One of Roosevelt's conclusions after the reassessment was that the American people could, at times through peaceful means, and when necessary through war, prevent any country from destroying China's independence, mobilizing China's manpower and resources, and ultimately attacking the United States. Bullitt stated that this was a new development of the old Open Door Policy. After Japan's invasion in 1937, Roosevelt realized that his desire to maintain America in a state of peace was incompatible with his intention to prevent Japan from ultimately mobilizing Chinese manpower and resources to wage war against the United States. Therefore, on October 5, Roosevelt delivered his "quarantine the aggressor" speech, which sparked strong domestic opposition. As a result, two months later, after Japan sank the American gunboat Panay near Nanjing, Roosevelt continued to allow Japan to purchase materials in the United States necessary for its invasion of China, including scrap metal. Bullitt suggested "demanding that Stalin provide a written guarantee as a condition for the United States to provide Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union, but Roosevelt rejected this, risking the danger that the Soviet Union might occupy and rule Central and Eastern Europe after Germany was defeated, and that the Soviet Union would threaten China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity after Japan was defeated." After Roosevelt decided to take a gamble, relying on his ability to appease Stalin in an attempt to transform his Soviet imperialism into cooperation with our democracy, Roosevelt did his best to please the Soviet dictator. Subsequently, pro-Soviet propaganda was launched in full force domestically. One of these propaganda lines stated that the Chinese Communists were "merely land reformers and had nothing to do with Moscow." At the same time, a network of sympathizers with the Soviet Union was established in Washington, and the advisors sent to the Chinese government and Latin America at that time were actually apologists for Soviet policy.

### Inspections Begin: Bank Warehouses: Nearly 9,000 Pieces of Sealed Cloth: To Be Confiscated if Stored for Over Three Months: Goods Other Than Daily Necessities Will Be Treated Similarly

[Report from this newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, the economic supervisor of the Shanghai district, ordered the Special Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday to immediately inspect the amount of cotton yarn and cloth stored in various warehouses. If any materials registered with the Social Affairs Bureau are found to have been unstored for more than three months, they will be sealed and confiscated. Upon receiving the order, the police bureau immediately dispatched teams to carry out the task. A total of eighteen banks' warehouses were inspected throughout the day, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank, China Construction Bank, Four Banks Joint Savings Society, Shanghai Bank, Continental Bank, Asia Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Yatung Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Jincheng Bank, China Reclamation Bank, China Industrial Bank, Donglai Bank, and Jiangsu Chenmin Bank. A total of 3,052 pieces of overdue cotton yarn and 5,930 pieces of cotton cloth were found and immediately sealed. This is the first move by Chiang Ching-kuo after taking office as economic control supervisor to suppress prices in the city through revolutionary measures.

[Another report] The Economic Supervision Committee resolved yesterday: (1) Regarding the decision of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Committee to establish the Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee, Inspection Committee, and Price Review Committee in this city to strengthen the implementation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures, it was decided to establish them successively within the next week. (2) All yarn and cloth stored in warehouses for more than three months will be confiscated. Those who refuse to sell stored materials will be dealt with according to the laws against hoarding and speculation. (3) Apart from daily necessities, other types of goods will be subject to similar handling measures.

### Wu, Yu, and Chiang Confer: Exchange of Opinions

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Guozhen, Yu Hongjun, and Chiang Ching-kuo conferred yesterday morning and fully exchanged opinions on enforcing price limits and strengthening inspection work. The inspection of warehouses is particularly emphasized by the management authorities. Yesterday's sealing of yarn and cloth was only the beginning. As for the inspection of land and water transportation, it is currently being carried out by the customs and the garrison command. Regarding the investigation of merchants who secretly raise prices, the responsible personnel stated that the principle is to avoid harassment, and those who are found to have committed offenses will be dealt with strictly according to the law, while those who make false accusations will also be dealt with according to the law. Furthermore, inspection personnel must first present proof of identity when carrying out their work. The targets of the actions will focus on large companies and merchants.

Another report: Preparations for selling materials and suppressing prices are also actively underway. Wu Guozhen and Jiang Biao visited Yu Hongjun yesterday and had discussions.

### Several Cases of Price Increases Penalized

[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Kangcai, a meat vendor at the Xikang Road market, sold pork on the 28th at a price of 2.4 million yuan per catty, exceeding the "August 19th" market price of 1.8 million yuan. A customer, Liu Zeng, reported this to the police on duty, who took Zhou to the Putuo Road Police Substation and sentenced him to seven days of detention.

On the same day, a small cigarette shop at 1269 Putuo Road sold cigarettes exceeding the "August 19th" market price. The Putuo Road Substation dispatched police to summon the shop owner, Wang Rongqing, to the station and sentenced him to seven days of detention.

Jiangning Road Heng Taiyu Southern Goods Store also sold preserved eggs on the same day exceeding the price limit. Police officers took the acting accountant, Huang Guoyuan, to the station for questioning, and after confirming the facts, sentenced him to five days of detention.

In addition, street vendors Du Yichuan and Yan Baicheng were sentenced to two days of detention for raising prices.

Multiple Shoe Stores Penalized

[Report from this newspaper] The Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade received reports that several shoe stores in the city were violating the law by exceeding the "August 19th" price limit. Yesterday, it dispatched 15 teams of auxiliary police to Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, Jinling Road, Xizang Road, and other locations to conduct random inspections. As a result, Hui Luo Company's shoe department, Xinguang Shoe Store at 798 North Sichuan Road, Youaisi Shoe Company at 1308 North Sichuan Road, Dongxin Shoe Store at 1279 North Sichuan Road, Bata on Nanjing Road, Huadong Shoe Company on Nanjing Road, Yichangheng Shoe Store on Nanjing Road, Fulu Shoes and Hats Store at 327 Jinling Road, and Shanghai Shoes and Hats Store at 487 Jinling Road, and more than ten other stores were found to have violated the law.

### Scalpers Buy Chickens and Ducks: Social Affairs Bureau to Arrest Them

[Report from this newspaper] The person in charge of the Chicken and Duck Industry Association stated to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday that the industry will comply with orders and not exceed the "August 19th" price limit for chicken and duck prices. However, this will inevitably lead to two malpractices: (1) Scalpers will privately buy chickens and ducks at prices that are one or two jiao higher than the price limit and resell them for profit. (2) Chicken and duck vendors will directly sell to retailers or users at higher prices. They requested the Social Affairs Bureau to stop these practices. The Social Affairs Bureau will cooperate with the military police to arrest scalpers to protect the interests of legitimate chicken and duck merchants. As for the second point, they stated that investigation is difficult and they are unable to help.

### Requests to Revise Ticket Prices for Peking Opera and Yue Opera Not Approved

[Report from this newspaper] The person in charge of the Drama Industry and Yue Opera Industry Association submitted two difficult situations to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) Summer is the off-season for theaters, and business is generally poor. Therefore, ticket prices are reduced in the summer as a rule. If theaters adhere to the "August 19th" prices, it will be the lowest average price for the year, and the expenses of the theaters will be unsustainable. (2) Too many famous actors are unwilling to perform in the summer. In early June, Yue Opera stars are all resting. The "August 19th" ticket prices are based on the prices for ordinary actors. Therefore, they request that the ticket prices be adjusted when famous actors perform in the future. The Peking Opera theater requested an adjustment of 90% of the ticket prices, and the Yue Opera industry also requested a revision of the new ticket prices. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected both requests and instructed them to strictly adhere to the "August 19th" prices and not to request adjustments casually. The Yue Opera theaters that are performing new plays are allowed to use the ticket prices of Yin Guifang at the Lyceum Theatre as the standard and are not allowed to exceed them. In the future, if there are famous actors performing, they must submit a report stating the reasons before approval will be given.

### People's Service Stations Begin Work: Choices for Ten Station Chiefs Determined: Citizens Encouraged to Report Secretly

The People's Service Station of the Pacification and Construction Brigade will begin work today (the 29th), accepting suggestions from citizens regarding the government and secret reports regarding unscrupulous merchants and corrupt officials. The station chiefs for each station have been decided as follows: (1) Huangpu District: Ding Dequan, (2) Lao Zha District: Cui Yijun, (3) Xincheng District: Yang Linyu, (4) Jing'an Temple District: Chen Shangzhang, (5) North Sichuan Road District: Wang Guofan, (6) North Station District: He Jinchu, (7) Tilanqiao District: Cui Wenbin, (8) Xujiahui District: Li Qinglan, (9) Lujiawan District: Zhang Huaien, (10) Penglai District: Shi Daoli. The locations are temporarily set up in front of the district government offices. Furthermore, in order to explain the significance of the establishment of the People's Service Station, the brigade issued a message to the citizens as follows: People say that Shanghai is a preposterous island. After experiencing it for a short time, we who have come to Shanghai believe that Shanghai is a deep abyss of pain. We have witnessed the cruel brutality of the communist bandits at the front lines. In Shanghai, we are even more aware of the crimes of unscrupulous merchants who manipulate and speculate. A small number of them have become rich, while the majority of kind people are trampled underfoot, living miserable lives under the iron heel of existence. These few shameless scoundrels do not love the country, do not love the government, have no warm blood, and have no conscience, and are deeply hated by the vast majority of our kind people. It is only because these people usually have money and power, create chaos and blessings, collude and conspire, and act as accomplices that everyone dares to be angry but dares not speak out. Today should be the time for the forces of justice to rise. We boldly appeal to all compatriots in Shanghai who have blood and righteousness: The pain in everyone's heart should be transformed into powerful action today. Now that the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures have been promulgated, this is the president's will, the government's decision, and also the key to the life and death of the country and the vital livelihood issues of the people. This measure can no longer be allowed to be destroyed or obstructed by these few scoundrels. The kind, patriotic, and righteous people should unite to ensure its complete implementation. Our team is ordered to be stationed in Shanghai, and we sincerely want to serve everyone. In order to communicate the opinions of the people and the government, and in order to combat the conspiracies of unscrupulous merchants and scoundrels, it has been decided to set up secret reporting boxes in the Huangpu, Xincheng, Lao Zha, Penglai, North Sichuan Road, North Station, Tilanqiao, Xujiahui, Lujiawan, and Jing'an Temple Road districts to publicly accept citizens' secret reports on illegal merchants and corrupt officials. Anyone who hoards, speculates, engages in illegal transactions, or harms the implementation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures, or colludes with officials, regardless of whether they are wealthy or powerful, are welcome to be reported. We believe that as long as everyone can unite and rise up together, we will surely be able to eliminate this scourge of society."

Dispatching a Company to Police Bureau

The Pacification and Construction Brigade has been ordered to dispatch a company of fifty people to be assigned to the Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau to carry out economic inspection work, which will officially begin next Monday (the 30th).

### Kuomintang City Party Headquarters Holds Cadre Meeting

It is estimated that more than 2,000 people will attend, and Yu Hongjun, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Tao Xisheng have been respectfully invited to attend and provide guidance.

### Salary Calculation Method for Employees of State-Owned Factories: Social Bureau Receives Instructions from the Ministry

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the government implemented currency system reform and announced measures to reorganize finances and strengthen economic controls, regulations stipulate that the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises should not exceed those of civil servants of the same level by more than 30%. However, the salaries of most employees of state-owned enterprises in this city are calculated according to the cost-of-living index, similar to those of private enterprises. If the new regulations are followed, their actual income may decrease. Therefore, employees of state-owned enterprises such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the various affiliated factories of the China Textile Construction Corporation are worried and hope that the government will provide an explanation. It has been learned that the Ministry of Social Affairs yesterday telegraphed the Social Bureau, stating that workers in state-owned factories who were previously paid according to the cost-of-living index should continue to be treated the same as workers in private factories. Staff members should still receive a 30% increase in salary compared to civil servants of the same level.

### Cultural Circles Hold Tea Party to Welcome the Ma Silians

[Our Newspaper's Report] After violinist Ma Sitong and his wife, Wang Muli, came to Shanghai from Guangzhou, the cultural circles of this city held a tea party at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday to welcome them. Mr. Ma will give a short-term performance at the Lyceum Theatre and the Cultural Hall in Shanghai. The date has not yet been decided because Mrs. Ma has recently been feeling unwell and cannot provide piano accompaniment. Therefore, the performance date may be around the 10th of next month. However, the Shanghai Broadcasting Station has invited Mr. Ma to give a broadcast performance from 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM next Saturday evening, which will be broadcast simultaneously on long wave 900KC, 800KC, 1390KC, and short wave 11780KC.

### General Tenants' Association Holds Symposium, Strongly Advocates Rent Freeze, Should Not Be Treated as an Exception, Resolves to Petition the Authorities to Stop Rent Increases

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai General Tenants' Association held a symposium on rental issues at the Daguan Society on Nanjing West Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. The meeting was attended by Jiang Hao, Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Shoutang, Ge Jiazhen, Zhang Zhongyuan, representatives of the Wuxian Tenants' Association, representatives of the Nanjing Road Business Association, and more than 80 tenant representatives from various neighborhoods. Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi was also invited to attend. During the meeting, the representatives argued that since the income of citizens has been frozen, rents should also be frozen in accordance with government laws and regulations. As a result, eight resolutions were passed: (1) Rents should be frozen in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. (2) Petition Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo, economic supervisors of the Shanghai area, to stop rent increases. (3) Request the Land Administration Bureau to pay attention to the economic emergency measures. Since the government has clearly stipulated the freezing of prices, it is not necessary to request further clarification on whether rent is an exception. Moreover, according to Supervisory Committee member Ni, rent should be considered a commodity price according to law.

### Four Floods in Shaanxi Flow Through Lu Territory's Luokou to Observe the Autumn Flood of the Yellow River

— Our Special Correspondent Li Tian

[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 24th] Since records began, the Yellow River has changed its course seven times and breached its banks 1,580 times, resulting in countless losses of life and property and weakening the nation's vitality. Therefore, although the Yellow River is the birthplace of ancient Chinese culture and the cradle of the Chinese nation, what it has left to the Chinese people are only countless painful memories. Now that the autumn flood season is approaching again, in this year of particularly frequent floods across the country, your reporter cannot forget the Yellow River, which is particularly prone to disasters. Taking advantage of the fact that the fourth flood in Shaanxi in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is expected to flow through Luokou in the province on the 24th, I made a special trip to the riverbank for on-the-spot investigation.

Accompanied by Director Kong of the Shandong Repair and Prevention Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Bureau and Engineer Chen Yungong, your reporter left Jinan by jeep early in the morning of the 24th and headed north. After the car exited Tianqiao, what came into view was a vast expanse of sorghum, its red ears solid and drooping heavily in the sunlight, forming a yellow sea, which can be called a unique spectacle found only in the north. After arriving at Luokou, we first rested at the flood control team. To the left of the team's gate, there was a forest of steles, all of which recorded the meritorious deeds of predecessors in controlling the Yellow River. Then we ascended the riverbank and saw the rapid current, the turbulent waves, the surging rush, and the surrounding danger. According to a person in charge of the flood control team: the current water level has reached 30.02 meters, which is the highest water level record this year. The water is only about three meters away from the top of the levee at the highest point, and less than two meters at the lowest point. Even at the current water level, the water surface is already three or four feet higher than the tops of the sorghum stalks outside the levee. One can imagine the severity of the damage and the extent of the disaster if the levee were to break.

Many Dangerous Works in Lu Territory

From Luokou eastward, within the 35 kilometers under the control of the National Army, there are nine dangerous works, including Gajia Gou, Jijiabang, Houzhuangzhuang, Fujiazhuang, Huojialiu, Hetaoquan, Chenmengquan, Wangjiali Hang, and Hujia'an. Within the 22 kilometers westward from Yukou, there are four dangerous works, including Laoshuzhuang, Yangzhuang, Caojiaquan, and Beidianzi. Within the 32 kilometers westward from the north bank of Luokou, there are thirteen dangerous works, including Dawangmiao, Wangjia Yao, Qiujianbang, Li Jiabang, Xijia Daokou, Wangzhuang, Nantan, Gujiagou, Wulipu, Xujiafang, Yuansuozhuang, Shuiniu Zhaozhuang, and Doufuwo (of which the Wangjia Yao and Gujiagou sections are in the hands of bandits). Director Kong told me: there has been river defense since Mengjin, but the total length of the Yellow River's west bank is about 200 kilometers in Henan, 160 kilometers in Hebei, and more than 700 kilometers in Shandong. If we include the more than 200 kilometers of civil embankments that have been taken over by the government, it reaches more than 900 kilometers. Therefore, on average, there is a dangerous work every ten or so kilometers. Therefore, the total length of the stone embankment of the Yellow River in Shandong is as long as 70 kilometers, so there are the most dangerous works in the territory of Lu. Of all the breaches in the 93 years since the sixth change of course of the Yellow River in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty, those in Shandong accounted for two-thirds of the total.

Another reason why the Yellow River breaches its banks so frequently in Shandong is that after the Yellow River enters the territory of Henan, the widest point of the riverbed reaches more than 20 miles, while in the territory of Lu, such as between Yue Zhuang and Cao Jia Quan, about 20 kilometers northwest of Luokou, the river surface is only more than 400 meters wide, and at the narrowest point in Lijin, it is only more than 300 meters wide. Therefore, the maximum capacity of the Yellow River channel in Henan can reach more than 30,000 cubic meters per second, while after entering Lu, it is only 8,000 cubic meters per second.

Heading to Beidianzi

We sat in the jeep and continued to inspect Luokou along the Yellow River embankment via Laoshuzhuang, Yangzhuang, Caojiaquan, to Beidianzi. In the past, trees were planted everywhere on the west bank of the Yellow River embankment, forming an endless expanse of green. When cars drove on it, people outside the embankment could not see the cars because they were shielded by the shade of the trees. However, since the seventh change of course of the Yellow River in Huayuankou, Henan in June 27, most of the villagers believe that the Yellow River will not come again. Over the past ten years, all the trees have been cut down. Today, not only is the river embankment not beautiful, but also when there is a need for materials in case of danger, temporary requisition is also difficult.

Yangzhuang is about fifteen or six kilometers away from Jinan City and about eight kilometers away from the old Jinan Airport. This place is the largest dangerous work near Jinan City. The water channel is biased towards the south bank, the water depth reaches 15 meters, and the flow is particularly fierce. The repair and prevention office has built stone embankments here to resist floods. The north bank of Yangzhuang is the bandit area, so the defense here is particularly important. After we stopped for a while, we continued westward.

When the car passed near Caojiaquan, more than ten workers were urgently filling a dangerous work with grass bags. Director Kong said: Don't underestimate them. If no one repairs it for a few hours or overnight, there may be trouble. In the past, most of the breaches in the Yellow River were due to the dishonesty of the people involved. Many of the river workers were corrupt and enriched themselves. Either the funds were insufficient, the workers were insufficient, or the materials were insufficient.

Beidianzi is the end point of our trip. This is an ancient ferry, and the city of Qihe County is on the opposite bank of the river. Before the train was open, people going to Beiping from Jinan mostly went here to Jihe to stay overnight. Now, due to the interruption of the train, this place has actually become an important ferry for the exchange of materials between bandits and us. When we inspected, we saw a large number of mules and horses transporting cotton yarn to the north on a ferry.

Five Construction Zones

Heading west from Beidianzi, you officially enter the bandit area, and of course we cannot go. Director Kong said: River work can be divided into five zones according to the difficulty of construction. The first is the pure Communist bandit control zone, which is not discussed here. The second is the pure National Army control zone, where construction is not difficult. The third is the bandit-us connection zone, where there are many difficulties. The fourth is the buffer zone, where the bandits do not dare to come, and we do not dare to go, but in case a breach occurs, the common people are always the people of the country. Therefore, we still have to try our best to mobilize the people and requisition labor and materials to give them emergency repairs. The fifth is the area where the bandits are active, such as the area from Zhukou to Dongkou in western Shandong last year, where the bandits entered and exited three times, and this year they have entered and exited twice. Three of our repair and prevention personnel were killed, and more than 30 were captured and missing. The loss of materials is countless. At the end of June this year, western Shandong was in urgent need of help. Before Kaifeng was lost, the government subsidized the employees who escaped from the construction site from Dongkou Linhui with only 30 million per person, which could not even buy a quilt. But in extremely difficult circumstances, they have completed the most solid river defense project. Mr. He, a 76-year-old scholar who has served in river work for more than 40 years, said that he has never seen a river defense project that is "strong in construction and solid in materials" like the current Lu Xi repair and prevention project. The reason is that as long as the Yellow River breaches its banks by one meter in Lu Xi, the entire Lu Xi and even northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. Therefore, we have to make the greatest efforts and brave all difficulties to repair the river embankment.

Autumn Flood Can Be Safely Passed

At 2:00 PM, your reporter returned to Jinan. At this time, the water level in Luokou had dropped back to 29.20 meters. On the way back, a gratifying piece of news is worth reporting to the people of the country: Last year, during the autumn flood, there were a total of five major floods in Shaanxi in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The highest water level in Luokou reached 30.5 meters. This year, Shaanxi has already had four floods, and the highest water level in Yukou is 30.02 meters today. In addition, there was less snowfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River last year. According to reliable estimates by the repair and prevention personnel, the water level in Luokou this year will definitely not exceed last year's record. Due to the day and night close guarding of the river defense personnel, the autumn flood, which has the highest water level and the most fierce flow among the four floods of the year (Peach Flood,伏Flood, Autumn Flood, Ling Flood), can be safely passed.

### An Overview of Taiwan's National Economy

— Wu Shouren, Our Concurrent Special Correspondent

[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 26th] Your reporter has traveled to Taiwan for eight months and has made many observations on the economic situation in Taiwan. The conclusion reached is that the system is based on agricultural economy, supplemented by industrial economy. Analyzed, the agricultural economy is based on food. Here, I will first give a general description of its production:

Looking at Food Production from the Japanese Colonial Period

Because of the superior conditions in terms of weather and environment, Taiwan's food harvest can be two crops a year. During the Japanese colonial period, it was known as the "rice granary." The highest production in the past was in 1938, with a total of 1,402,444 tons, while its own consumption was only 734,516 tons. The remaining 600,000 tons were all supplied to the Japanese mainland. Looking at such a large gap between supply and demand, we can imagine how prosperous the rural economy was. However, the lives of farmers were still only able to maintain a basic livelihood. This is probably due to the degree of exploitation by the Japanese colonial policy.

During the war, due to the lack of fertilizer and the conscription of strong men from the countryside, food production declined sharply year by year, reaching only 1,068,121 tons in 1944. In 1945, when the island was recovered, it was only 638,828 tons. The degree of sharp decline from a stage of food surplus to food shortage is alarming. To study the crux of the problem, we need to first focus on Taiwan's geological problems. In fact, the construction of Taiwan's agricultural economic society simply has no inherent conditions to rely on. The geology is a sandy accumulation layer, unlike the mainland, which can rely on natural fertilizer and irrigation. Although there are 19 major rivers, each one is as stubborn as the Yellow River. If appropriate guidance is not given, not only will there be no water conservancy, but also floods will occur every year due to typhoons and floods, harming farmland. Therefore, during the Japanese colonial period, they focused on these two problems. For irrigation, they used chemical fertilizers, with the highest supply reaching 600,000 tons. For water control, they built many water conservancy projects. The total length of the dikes in the province reached 419,153 meters. However, the intention of the Japanese government was very harmful. Most of the fertilizer manufacturing plants that supplied irrigation to Taiwan's farmland were located in Japan, and the dikes for water conservancy also had to be properly maintained and repaired every year, otherwise they would lose their effectiveness, making Taiwan unable to escape from Japan and becoming a fake independent agricultural society. Therefore, after the recovery, the first difficulty was the severe panic caused by fertilizer. According to statistics, in 1945, farmers only received 2,000 tons of fertilizer supplied by the government. The second difficulty was dike breaches and floods. At that time, the government had just recovered and did not pay attention to water conservancy issues. According to statistics, in 1945 and 1946, the total length of dike breaches in the province reached 50,000 meters, and approximately 100,000 hectares of farmland were damaged. Both of these were the main reasons for the sharp decline in food production.

Seeking Water Conservancy Construction and Increasing Fertilizer Imports

Afterwards, the government worked hard to govern, first seeking water conservancy construction and increasing fertilizer imports. To this day, the former has repaired 24,000 meters of dikes, and the latter's fertilizer imports were 85,000 tons in 1946. Therefore, food production was able to increase to 891,417 tons, which was just enough to meet the province's consumption. In 1947, fertilizer imports were still 85,000 tons. Due to the restoration of water conservancy, the increase in cultivated land, and the successive return of conscripted strong men, food production had increased to 999,012 tons. In 1948, the central government allocated fertilizer purchased from the United States, totaling 95,000 tons. However, because the food year has not yet ended, production cannot be accurately calculated, but it is generally estimated that it will increase significantly compared to last year. From the aforementioned figures, we can see that Taiwan's food has returned to a normal supply-demand balance in 1946, and since 1947, it has even reached a stage of oversupply. When the whole country is generally experiencing food shortages, this has to be said to be the superiority of Taiwan's agricultural economy.

Taiwan Sugar Enjoys a High Reputation, a Painful History

In addition to food, the Taiwan Sugar, which occupies an important part of the agricultural economy, should be considered. Taiwan Sugar enjoys the highest reputation in the mainland, and is known to women and children. It also has a certain reputation in the international market. This is the foundation established by the Japanese colonial policy. According to the elders of Taiwan, when food production was as high as 1.3 million tons in 1935, the Japanese government was alerted to the high surplus of food in Taiwan, which would endanger the rural economy of the Japanese mainland. Therefore, it adopted a policy of suppressing production. In order to achieve this policy, the Taiwan Governor-General forced compatriots to convert part of their farmland to sugarcane cultivation. At the same time, Japanese financial groups also invested heavily in setting up large-scale sugar factories in various parts of Taiwan to purchase sugarcane for sugar processing at a limited price, on the one hand to supply the needs of the mainland, and on the other hand to dump it on the international market, in order to achieve the purpose of pure exploitation. Why do I say this is pure exploitation, because Taiwan's natural conditions such as rainfall, sunshine, and temperature are not suitable for sugarcane cultivation, and the damage of typhoons has a greater impact on sugar factory equipment and sugarcane than on food crops. Moreover, food crops can be harvested twice a year, while sugarcane takes 18 months to harvest. In terms of the farmers' own interests, under the circumstances of Japanese financial groups purchasing sugarcane at a limited price, sugarcane cultivation does not have any real benefits. However, because it is beneficial to Japan, it has made Taiwan Sugar have today's scale.

Tracing the history of the formation of Taiwan Sugar's current scale, this is a page of painful memories. 121,362 Jia (each Jia equals 14.4 Mu) of sugarcane cultivation area from farmland were successively owned by the Taiwan Sugar Industry Order of the Taiwan Governor-General of the Japanese administration. The highest sugar production reached 418,000 tons, and what the sugarcane farmers got was the meager profit they earned from the limited-price purchase. Apart from the minimum necessities of food and clothing, they did not taste more sweetness than others. After the recovery, all the sugarcane fields were taken over and continued to be planted, and the 35 sugar factories operated by Japanese businessmen also resumed work one after another. By 1947 and 1948, production had reached 263,596 tons, of which only 51,000 tons were needed in the province, and the rest were supplied to the domestic, Southeast Asian and Japanese markets for publicity dumping. Your reporter observes that the different characteristic of Taiwan's sugar industry today and in the past is that in the past, it was one of the important resources for Japan to exploit Taiwan, while now it is one of the lifelines of Chen Village's economy. We can understand the general situation by looking at the treatment of sugarcane farmers by Hetang Company.

Sugarcane Farmers' Sugar Sharing System, Enjoy Four Types of Loans

Although sugarcane needs 18 months to harvest, the income of sugarcane farmers must be 12 months later than that of field farmers. In other words, field farmers harvest three times, and sugarcane farmers harvest only once. The hardships between them can be imagined. However, because the sugar industry company has a unique remuneration system, the sugarcane farmers' basic livelihood is also not a problem. This unique remuneration system is called the sugar sharing system. In short, for example, if a sugarcane farmer plants and harvests sugarcane that can produce 1,000 kilograms of sugar, then the sugarcane farmer can get the discounted price of 500 kilograms of sugar, and the rest can get 500 kilograms of sugar in kind, allowing the sugarcane farmer to freely dispose of and sell it freely. Currently, the discounted price set by the sugar industry company is NT$350 per kilogram. In addition, sugarcane farmers can often enjoy four types of loans, including sugarcane seedling loans, farming loans, land rent loans, and fertilizer loans. At present, the average annual production of each sugarcane farmer's household is about 41,344 kilograms, and its surplus income is used to pay for the 18-month living burden, which is more than enough.

### Zhejiang East Settles the Sea, Warships Directly Attack the Bandit Nest

Killing More Than Seventy, Capturing More Than Sixty

[Our Dispatch] According to the announcement of the First Military Region Command of the Navy: Recently, there have been gangs of bandits Wang Rongxuan and Xu Xiaoyu in the sea area of Dinghai, Zhejiang East, harassing the area, and the situation was once quite tense. After the Zhejiang Pacification Command and the Naval Base Command launched a clean-up operation, on the 21st of this month, warships such as Lian Guang, Xiang Shan, and Yi Ning transported anti-bandit troops to land on the northeast ends of the Liheng Island bandit nests. Our army attacked from both sides. More than 200 bandits stubbornly resisted the mountain. After gradual advancement, more than 70 bandits were killed, and more than 60 people were captured. The remaining bandits have been surrounded at the top of Jiaozhi Mountain, and it is not difficult to wipe them all out. At 7:00 PM on the same day, our Yi Ning and Xiang Shan boats discovered a bandit boat in the sea area of Li Qingshan and immediately opened fire to bombard it. Many bandits were killed or injured, and the rest jumped into the water to escape. The bandit boat was hit in the stern and captured. In addition, one escaped bandit was captured on the water.

### A Bandit Spy Was Discovered in Chongqing Court, Duan Pingyuan Hid Under the Bed, Unable to Escape the Police Network

[Our Dispatch from Chongqing, 28th] The Chongqing Police Department arrested a Communist bandit Duan Pingyuan in the plaintiff's seat of the District Court on the 28th. Duan Pingyuan was originally a surrendered bandit, but according to a tip-off, he still had the intention of colluding with the Huaying Mountain bandits to disturb the security of the rear. The police department had been investigating for a long time, but was unable to determine his whereabouts and could not arrest him. On the 28th, Duan was suing someone in the District Court for a rent case. He was suddenly discovered and tried to escape on the spot, hiding under the bed of a certain civilian's house, and was finally detained.

### Zhenhai Rent Surge

— Our Correspondent Meng Weizhong

[Our Newspaper, Zhenhai, 24th Dispatch] The "Zhejiang Provisional Measures for Rent Reduction of 25% for Tenant Farmers," were formulated and promulgated as early as the 15th year of the Republic of China, spanning over two decades. In the initial stages of implementation, numerous difficulties were inevitable. However, based on the results of various counties that implemented the measures, they "reduced tenancy disputes," which was convenient for both officials and the people. Zhenhai, in eastern Zhejiang, took the lead and was able to thoroughly implement the rent reduction measures from the beginning. Over the years, both tenants and landlords have been able to smoothly navigate the "rent barrier," which cannot be attributed to anything other than the power of this method. Recently, in order to implement land reform, our government authorities promulgated the Land Law. When the news spread, the farmers rejoiced. The tenant farmers throughout this county, concerned about their rights and interests, specifically published a "Declaration by the Chenmin (common people) of Zhenhai County to Support the Suppression of Rebellion and Implement the Land Law" in newspapers on August 11th, declaring that rent for this year would be paid according to Article 110 of the Land Law, which stipulates that land rent should be 8% of the assessed land price and the government-announced standard land price (converted to rice). When this news reached the landlords, it caused extreme resentment, and the "rent surge" incident thus began.

When the Land Law was first promulgated, agricultural association cadres were already brewing implementation plans. When a typhoon struck the county on July 6th, affecting 57,728.04 mu of land and 23,725 people, it became the fuse for this rent surge. On July 27th, the farmers of various villages south of the river, in light of the severe typhoon disaster and the approaching time for early rice harvest and rent collection, proposed abolishing the fixed rent (37.5% rent payment) and requested the county government to approve rent collection by village according to the Jiangbei (north of the river) custom. The county rejected this request, stating that it would "be difficult to change the established customs and regulations, which would only lead to disputes." Subsequently, the county agricultural association, concerned that the Chenmin in various places had differing opinions on rent payment and fearing disputes, convened a joint meeting of over thirty executive directors of agricultural associations from various villages on August 6th to discuss a unified rent payment method. After deliberation, it was decided that "starting this year, rent will be paid at 8% of the land price according to Article 110 of the Land Law." Representatives were appointed on the spot, including Zhang Yunfa from Qinghu, Gao Shanfang from Xinqi, Lu Maotang from Zhenpu, Li Lianggui from Daqi, and seventeen others. Led by Gu Jingyong, the executive director of the county agricultural association, they petitioned the county government on the 11th and then went to Shanghai and Beijing. They arrived in the capital on the 12th and submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Land Affairs on the 13th. The Executive Yuan received them through Secretary Li, the Ministry of Social Affairs was personally led by Minister Gu, and the Ministry of Land Affairs was led by Vice Minister Tang and Director Wu. They praised and encouraged the representatives' spirit of rushing to Beijing and striving for their own interests, and promised to discuss the matter at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting. They requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to handle the matter. On the 14th, the representatives went to Hangzhou again to petition the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, and the Provincial Farmers' Association. As a result, Director Hong of the Land Administration Bureau expressed his acceptance and stated that he would wait for orders to handle the matter. The representatives returned to the county on the 16th. After the petition, the tenant farmers, while waiting for official orders, except for paying the pre-collected grain tax on behalf of the landlords, temporarily suspended rent payment.

After this blow, the landlords were panic-stricken, especially the charitable estates, schools, and small property owners who had invested in land. They jointly refuted and issued a public statement on the 24th. At the same time, they appointed representatives to petition the province, supporting the 25% rent reduction decision to counter the tenant farmers.

The rent payment dispute between landlords and tenants seems to have moved from a dormant state to a serious stage. Chairman Chen of Zhejiang Province has not made a concrete statement because the relevant official documents have not arrived, but he has stated that the provincial government is determined to reduce the burden on tenant farmers, but the legitimate rights and interests of landlords will be protected. Under these two principles, it is hoped that this incident can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily for both tenants and landlords.

### Baoding Parricide Case: Sick Mother Buried Alive, Dying with Seven Orifices Bleeding, Gruesome Death

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 28th Dispatch] Citizen He Long, whose mother had been suffering from paralysis for more than half a year, hated her to the core and often beat and abused her. At midnight on the 27th, after He Chuan went out, he suffocated his mother to death. He Long thought that burial would be costly and feared exposure, so he buried her alive in the courtyard before she stopped breathing. After neighbors reported the incident, the body was exhumed, revealing numerous wounds and bleeding from all seven orifices. This parricide case is currently under investigation according to the law.

### Investigation Report on the July 5th Incident (2)

(Continued from yesterday's second edition)

The Petition Process

(2) The petition process: (1) The City Council's Petition: At 7:00 AM on July 5th, students from northeastern provinces and cities gathered in front of the Zhongnanhai gate. By 8:00 AM, approximately 4,000 students from more than ten units swarmed into the Peiping City Council, destroying offices and dormitories with bricks and wooden sticks, shouting slogans such as "Oppose Hunger," "Oppose Persecution," and "Kill the City Councilors," and posting slogans. They climbed onto the lintel by stacking themselves on top of each other and changed the Peiping City Council plaque to "Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry Association" and "Three Olds and Four Youngs Association." Dozens of students from the Peiping Student Union held up green banners with red characters reading "We Want to Survive" and "We Want Freedom," and gave comfort to the students from the northeast provinces, making inflammatory speeches, welcoming the northeast students to join the student union, and destroying the "Peiping City National Mobilization Committee" and the "Peiping Public Anti-Communist Committee" (these two organizations were both located in the same building as the City Council). The workers and police officers maintaining order suffered minor injuries. At this time, the students sat in the middle of the road, demanding that the responsible members of the City Council come forward to answer, but no one came to meet them. At 11:00 AM, Director Chen Kefu of Lin Da (National Temporary University) and a professor tried to persuade the students to wait for a reasonable solution, but it was ineffective. The students then broke into the City Council again and caused further destruction. Mei Qinglan, the head of the 19th Regiment of the military police, had his glasses broken after being hit. After police persuasion, they were forced to withdraw and marched in a group towards the residence of Vice President Li on North Chang Street. (2) The Petition at the Residence of Vice President Li: At around 12:00 PM, a large group of students arrived in front of the residence of Vice President Li on North Chang Street. They sent representatives to visit the Vice President to petition. As the Vice President was attending a meeting at Jurentang (Hall of Benevolence), he walked back after a while and replied to the representatives, roughly saying: 1. He suggested that the government strengthen Lin Da and Lin Zhong (temporary schools), so that students from public and private schools would have the opportunity to study; 2. The resettlement and relief issues would be discussed with local authorities, and temporary funds would be allocated from the self-defense special tax, so the principle was no longer a problem; 3. The City Council would issue a statement based on the facts. When the students demanded that the City Council apologize to the students, the Vice President replied that the City Council was a representative of public opinion and that he could not control them. The students were dissatisfied and proposed going to Xu Huidong's residence to petition, so they marched in a group, shouting slogans, towards Dongjiaomin Lane. (3) The Petition at Xu Huidong's Residence: At around 2:00 PM that day, more than 200 unarmed police officers and a platoon of military police, with more than 20 armed personnel, had already arrived inside the gate of Xu's residence at No. 1 Dongjiaomin Lane to set up a defense and maintain order. A short time later, three student representatives arrived first, claiming that they wanted to see Chairman Xu or a responsible City Councilor to respond to the students. Xu did not receive them. The main body of students ran to the front of No. 1 and charged straight towards the gate. The police and military police blocked them inside the gate, and the gate was cracked. Seeing the emergency situation, the military police fired shots into the air, and the students retreated slightly. Zhang Nairen, an officer from the 7th Precinct, was injured in the head by a brick thrown by the student crowd while trying to dissuade them. He fainted on the spot and was taken to the hospital. The pistol he was carrying was also lost on the spot (the pistol was recovered from student Wang Dayou the next day, but one bullet was missing). Since the students could not enter through the main gate, they demolished an entrance in the southeast corner of the wall of No. 1 and rushed in, throwing bricks and stones at the military police. Later, the military police fired shots into the air again, and they retreated again. The students were divided into two groups, gathering to the east and west of the gate, sitting on the ground and shouting incessantly. The two sides were deadlocked until around 5:00 PM. Zhao Changyan, the battalion commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division, arrived with two companies of troops under the order of the Garrison Headquarters. Soon, four armored vehicles from the rapid reaction force arrived, two parked in front of No. 1 and two parked to the west of the gate. The soldiers of the search battalion were deployed to the east and west of the gate of No. 1, with sentries holding submachine guns and light machine guns, facing east and west, with their muzzles pointing at the student crowd. At this time, the students pushed eighteen representatives into the courtyard to negotiate with the military police. Bai Shiwei, the deputy director of the police bureau, informed them that he would be responsible for answering the questions tomorrow and asked the student representatives to help investigate the lost pistol of officer Zhang. He said that if they could not find it today, they could find it tomorrow. He also said that he had received an order from Commander Chen to announce a curfew at 7:00 PM, and advised the students to go back temporarily and that everything would be resolved tomorrow. The students, also because of hunger, thirst, and excessive fatigue, agreed to disperse immediately. At this time, the students who gathered in the east were outside the archway, and those in the west were to the west of the No. 1 gate, about sixty meters apart, with armored vehicles and search battalion soldiers deployed in the middle.

The Incident

(3) The situation at the time the incident occurred: At around 7:00 PM, Deputy Director Bai went out to the west to persuade the students to go home. When the students were mostly standing up and preparing to form ranks, suddenly a gunshot rang out, coming from the east. Immediately afterwards, gunshots rang out, lasting for about three minutes, and then stopped briefly. Then the gunshots rang out again for one or two minutes. Deputy Director Bai stamped his feet and shouted not to shoot, but no one paid attention. At this time, the students screamed and immediately lay down. After the shooting stopped, Chen, the captain of the Bao Zheng (security and discipline) team, and the company commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division went out to stop the shooting, but many people had already been killed or injured. It was reported that two students, Wu Zhaotai and Han Delin, died on the north sidewalk outside the archway in the east, and Sun Dexin died on the left side of the road near the sidewalk. Five people died in various hospitals due to injuries, including Yang Long, Bu Hongxun, Li Fuwei, Xu Guochang, and He Shouzheng. In addition to the nineteen injured, one civilian, Zhang Fengling, died. After the incident, the injured were taken to the hospital for treatment, and the deceased were awaiting examination by the court. By 8:00 PM, the students and soldiers had all withdrawn. This is the situation before and after the July 5th incident. (To be continued.)

### Zhenjiang Apprentice Escorting Money Robbed, Perpetrator Caught on the Spot

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th Dispatch] A bizarre robbery occurred in Zhenjiang today during the day. An apprentice from the Xinyi Wuyang Store was escorting money at noon when, while passing through Laoxin Street on Zhonghua Road, two men in military uniforms suddenly exchanged fake banknotes worth 15,000 yuan for the apprentice's legal tender. The apprentice noticed that the banknotes were fake, and a dispute arose. The swindlers abandoned the fake banknotes and snatched 300 million yuan in legal tender held by the apprentice. A patrol police officer from the nearby Gangwa Factory Branch passed by and caught one person on the spot and recovered all the stolen goods. The suspect confessed his name as Zhao Tijiang, a native of Anhui, and that he was the orderly soldier of You Zhanliang, a fugitive accomplice. You was currently residing at the Santai Inn. When the police went to investigate, You had already fled with his wife. The security authorities are currently searching for him.

### Empty Checks from Businesses Increasing Daily; Ministry of Finance Orders Prosecution According to Law

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank's Auditing Department recently sent a circular to all branches, relaying a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the number of depositors in businesses and shops issuing empty checks has been increasing daily in various places. This clearly shows that many people are taking advantage of the credit of businesses and shops to engage in empty speculation, which is affecting price fluctuations. This is a serious matter, and prosecution should be carried out strictly according to Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. In addition to the Ministry of Finance instructing all Financial Control Bureaus to pay attention to checking at any time, the Central Bank is requested to ask the branches in various places that handle check clearing, as well as various banks that handle clearing on their behalf, that if they find empty checks that are dishonored due to insufficient funds, overdrafts, etc., they should immediately retain the original check and immediately report the case to the local court according to the law. They should also report the handling situation to the Ministry at any time via telegram.

### Money Supply Remains Loose, Prices Rise; Rice Market Trend Turns Firm, Edible Oil Market is Not Weak, Prices Expected to Rise Further

The rice market is becoming firmer because the money supply is loose and the owners of the goods do not need cash, so the intention to sell is very weak. In addition, the tin market is rising, and people's hearts are very firm. Rice shops are taking advantage of the low prices to replenish their stocks, and the sales channels are also active. North City white japonica rice is reported at 20 yuan, up 8 jiao (0.8 yuan), thin indica and early indica are up 1 yuan each, and special high japonica rice is trading at 21.8 yuan. The various stalls in the South Market are up 5 jiao each. Indica rice is relatively flat, and old rice sales in the countryside are active, up 6 to 7 jiao. Yesterday, a total of 4,429 shi (unit of dry measure) of goods arrived in the North and South markets.

Flour prices are high in the interior, and there is not much stock on the market. In addition, there is a shortage of raw material wheat, which strengthens people's confidence. With the loose money supply, sales are also active. The warship brand flour immediately reached the limit of 7.26 yuan upon opening, and the market could not buy in. The old car brand flour had no transactions at the limit price of 7.57 yuan. The red bee brand flour was only one fen (0.01 yuan) away from the limit. Each increased by about 6 fen compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour was limited to 7.5 yuan, and the transaction price has already reached this limit. Large bags of bran increased by 1 jiao.

Grains are trending firmer, and transactions are still opening at the limit price. Because the money supply is loose, the owners of the goods are reluctant to sell. Soybean oil factories are still taking in a lot, and the price is slightly firmer at the limit price. There are Yantai gangs taking in corn, pushing up the price by 5 jiao. Chongming new corn is 13 yuan, and new Mingguang red sorghum opened at 9 yuan. Northern and Southern gangs are not taking in naked barley, and transactions are sparse. Green beans and broad beans are mostly sold in small quantities, and the market is stable. Sesame sales on the street are accelerating, and the price is squeezed to the limit. The top-quality raw peanuts from Xuzhou are all transacted at the limit price, and the market is firm.

Edible oil prices are slightly higher. Vegetable oil has reached the limit, and transactions are quite active. Because the money supply is very loose, and it is Saturday, the appetite on the street is stronger and sales are active. The factory price for vegetable oil is 47 yuan, the limit price. Soybean oil is approaching the limit. Da You soybean oil initially opened at 51.8 yuan, and the closing price retreated to 51.6 yuan. Other soybean oils were 51.5 yuan, up 5 jiao or 1 yuan each. There are few raw oil goods available, and few are opening. There were no transactions for Jitung raw oil. Jitung raw oil was 61.3 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil rose by 3 yuan, reaching the limit of 55 yuan. Soybean cakes are also reported at the limit price, with Lizi cakes at 4.6 yuan.

### Government Bonds Trading Ordered to Stop

Since the currency reform and the circulation of Gold Yuan, the trading of securities such as Chinese and foreign stocks has also been suspended from the same day according to orders. However, government bonds continued to be bought and sold. In view of this, the municipal authorities consulted the persons in charge of the five companies in the "500 Office" yesterday and informed them that government bonds are also one of the valuable securities and cannot be an exception to Chinese and foreign stocks. They were ordered to stop trading immediately, otherwise they would be charged with illegal trading on the black market. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, government bond trading has also come to a halt. However, the municipal authorities are still paying close attention to it.

### Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry Reduced from Yesterday

### Several Linked Focal Points of Economic Reform Plan

Legislator Huang Yuanbin hopes the government can achieve this

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The Central Youth Department held the seventh current affairs lecture at 8:00 PM on the 27th, with legislator Huang Yuanbin lecturing on "Several Linked Focal Points of Economic Reform Plan." Huang said briefly: In the early stages of reform, it is necessary to coordinate with political power to freeze prices, and then step by step, remove the factors that may affect price increases. The following items should be effectively achieved by the government:

(1) Exchange and register the gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people to open up legitimate channels for floating capital. (2) The government should exempt import duties and national transportation costs on raw materials and production tools in imported goods to reduce costs. (3) Obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government to eradicate smuggling and the phenomenon of capital fleeing to Hong Kong, and at the same time facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to absorb foreign exchange. (4) State-owned enterprises cannot raise prices. (5) Lower interest rates to a considerable extent.

Huang continued: It is important to make good use of US aid, reorganize tax revenue, and issue government bonds to maintain a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure. This will stabilize prices, and the prospects for economic reform will be optimistic.

### Measures for Remittances to the Northeast are Being Formulated by the National Bank

The Northeast will implement the public treasury system

Since the implementation of the new economic plan, the national banks have removed restrictions on the allocation of funds to their counterparts, but the Northeast is an exception. The Central Bank is trying to remedy this and will have a concrete decision soon. Xia Jin Xiong, Director of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and Wang Zhong, Director of the Northeast Region Branch, were ordered to go to the Northeast and North China respectively to inspect the actual situation and formulate effective measures. It is reported that the Central Bank plans to implement the public treasury system in the Northeast. The expenses to be paid by military and political institutions will be directly allocated by the treasury in the future, and the Central Bank will no longer be asked by the Suppression Headquarters to advance funds. After the establishment of the public treasury system, the problems of floating capital and remittances in the Northeast can be solved accordingly. The Central Bank will still adhere to the principle of guiding the floating capital in the Northeast.

### A Glimpse of Lining Market Prices

The standard market price of woolen fabrics remained calm yesterday, and the market atmosphere improved. This was due to the fact that the capital of various companies was gradually leveled out, the money supply was loose, and the hidden interest rate was reduced. Customers also needed to purchase goods for autumn and winter. The trend of lining silk and yarn products was generally firmer than that of woolen fabrics, and the buyers felt a little impatient, while the factory production was less than that of woolen fabrics. At the same time, calculated at pre-war market prices, the rate of increase was also less than that of woolen fabrics. Sleeve lining, foreign cloth and black carbon lining were the most attractive. Yesterday, sleeve lining was wholesaled at 1.25 to 1.5 yuan per yard, ordinary printed foreign cloth was sold at 1 yuan, black carbon lining, first grade was 4 yuan, second grade was 2.78 yuan, and third grade was 8.5 jiao. French and Western lining, gray soft lining, first grade was 8 jiao, second grade was 5 jiao, mercerized feather yarn, first grade was 1.2 yuan, second grade was 9 jiao, third grade was 6.5 fen, yarn back satin skin has not yet opened for bidding.

### Tea Market Meanders Higher

Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market continued to have limited transactions. Due to the lack of ships recently for exporters, the appetite remains unhappy. Although the trend is that the authorities are vigorously suppressing prices and people are wary, the price is constantly soaring, and the cost of reproduction is rising sharply, resulting in a meander higher in the market. However, insiders said that at this price, there is little profit. Therefore, the current industry is quite concerned and hopes that the salt area tea price will lead downstream. As for domestic floral varieties, they are all flat.

### Cotton Yarn Market is Mediocre; Cloth Market Closed Yesterday, Transactions Not Smooth

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was mediocre at the beginning of the day as buyers and sellers watched.

According to the cotton cloth merchants in this city, another 2,200 tons of cotton yarn will be shipped to South China within days. The merchants said that if the Transportation Administration Committee abolishes the export price limit system, the export volume of yarn and cloth may double.

### Stable Prices for Chinese Medicine

The market conditions for Chinese medicine are largely unchanged from Monday. Western cotton and ginseng are in short supply. Letters from the production areas report that while digging has begun, the quantity is reduced compared to previous years. Some goods are abandoned in the fields, and the cost of digging labor is quite high.

### Stabilizing Prices and Punishing Unscrupulous Merchants: Unified Action Across the Country

Wuxi

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, due to rampant speculation, prices of various goods are rising again. On the 28th, the county government dispatched a large number of personnel in groups to various urban areas and markets for investigation and supervision. They also notified each market and industry that hoarding and speculation are prohibited, off-market transactions are prohibited, and prices must not exceed those of August 19th. Violators will be immediately arrested and sent to the Special Criminal Court for legal action. Additionally, there is no solution to the shortage of small-denomination banknotes. Notes from Xuan, Li, and Cheng counties are flowing into Wuxi. Fights have broken out due to merchants refusing to accept them, and several people have been arrested.

Suzhou

[Report from this newspaper] On the 28th in Suzhou, due to loose monetary policy, prices of various goods are rising along with Shanghai and Wuxi. In the rice market, early coarse rice is trading at 17.8 yuan, and white rice at 19.6 yuan. Negotiated rice sold at the door is 20 yuan, all of which is of inferior quality. The county authorities are still making every effort to control the situation.

[Another report] Not many gold yuan certificates have been issued here. The formal exchange work has not yet officially started. More are expected to arrive on the 29th. However, small amounts of legal tender obtained through exchanges by various banks and firms are being held back in compliance with orders, pending exchange, resulting in over 110 billion yuan being tied up. As a last resort, restrictions have been placed on customer withdrawals of small-denomination banknotes below 2,000 yuan, which has led to many merchants refusing to use small banknotes. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has ordered the banking industry to continue accepting them as usual to avoid causing unrest and indirectly affecting prices.

Hankou

[Central News Agency, 28th] The Hankou inspection team departed today, divided into districts, to inspect the markets. It was discovered that Sheng Xifu Hat Shop, Sanyou Industrial Company, and Gongtai Rice Mill were all raising prices without authorization. The managers of each store were arrested and will be severely punished.

Beiping

[Report from this newspaper] Prices in Peiping have remained stable so far. In the week since the currency change, food prices have fallen significantly. Funian flour has dropped from 9.8 yuan to 7.7 yuan, and rice from 2.2 yuan to 1.9 yuan. Although there have been fluctuations in cotton cloth prices, they remained at the current price of 30 yuan on the 28th. On the 28th, there was still a rush to exchange gold, silver, and U.S. dollars. The Peiping Unified Economic Conference was established on the 28th to strengthen price monitoring and inspection. Tongren Hospital was forced to restore its original prices after increasing its consultation fees, following intervention by the Medical Association.

Tianjin

[Central News Agency, 28th] Tianjin Gold Control Bureau inspectors, together with the garrison command's investigation and handling personnel, based on leads from gold brokers, tracked day and night from the morning of the 27th, for twenty hours, cracking several cases of private gold trading. Fifty-one taels of gold and 127 silver dollars were seized on the spot. Because the cases are still under investigation, and there are still connections, in addition to detaining and interrogating the relevant criminals, the inspection personnel are continuing to search based on the information obtained.

Chongqing

[Report from this newspaper] The inspection team dispatched three groups on the 28th. Zhengyang Winery on Linsen Road was selling each catty of wine for 200,000 legal tender on the 19th, and then raised the price by 0.25 yuan. After the manager, Mr. Huang, was detained, the price immediately dropped on the 28th. Jiang Shucheng, chairman of the Chongqing Department Store Association, was also summoned for questioning.

[Another report] On the 28th, Xiao Bangcheng, President of the Special Criminal Court, personally led court police to action. The managers Yang and Li Guanran of the New World Hotel and Linji Hardware Store on Zhongzheng Road were arrested on the spot for raising prices and taken to court for questioning.

Guangzhou

[Report from this newspaper] Over the past four days, banks in Guangzhou have exchanged a total of 8 million Hong Kong dollars, 13,000 U.S. dollars, 98 taels of gold, and 40,000 silver dollars.

### Export Control Commission Announces Export Situation for the Week: Hankou Bristles Profitable, Tianjin Bristles Lose Money

[Report from this newspaper] The Export Control Commission announced yesterday the overseas market conditions and foreign exchange settlement of exported goods last week as follows:

In the first half of this week (August 16th to 21st), rumors were rife domestically that a new economic plan would soon be implemented. Most industries adopted a wait-and-see approach, and prices fluctuated. Exported goods generally showed a downward trend, with the index increasing by about 25% compared to last week. Overseas market conditions were generally stable, except for slight increases in duck feathers, sesame seeds, rapeseed, and cottonseed cake, and decreases in soybeans, broad beans, and vegetable oil. Based on the initial domestic and foreign market prices of the week, Shanghai and Hankou's hog bristles, feathers, sausage casings, egg products, raw hides, tea, gallnuts, and other exports were profitable. However, tung oil, Tianjin hog bristles, bean seeds, edible oil, raw silk, and Chinese medicine had slight losses. The largest loss was for Tianjin's No. 55 long bristles, with a price difference of 42%. On Friday, after the government explicitly announced the currency reform, the export industry had a good response. The exchange rate between the gold yuan and the U.S. dollar had been rigidly set at a ratio of four to one, and price variations are expected to be eliminated. The overseas market conditions for exported goods this week are briefly described below:

The initial overseas price of tung oil this week, F.O.B. was still 17.25 cents per pound in U.S. dollars. Due to a 25% increase in domestic market prices, the price difference loss increased to 24%. At the end of the week, a telegram from London stated that British importers' buying price was £146 per ton for bulk and £154 per ton for barrelled oil. Tung oil exports this week were still not enthusiastic, with many shipments to Hong Kong. Due to sufficient inventory in Hong Kong, prices are expected to fall. It is recently rumored that American experts have discovered new uses for tung oil, such as building airports, so the proportion of tung oil in military industries will increase, and future market conditions may be promising.

Hog bristles: The F.O.B. prices per pound for Hankou No. 17, Shanghai No. 17, Tianjin long No. 55, short No. 55, and No. 26 were $4.70, $2.30, $7.00, $6.35, and $4.95 in U.S. dollars respectively. Based on the initial exchange settlement price of the week, Shanghai and Hankou bristles could make profits of 13% and 54% respectively, while Tianjin bristles suffered losses.

Tea: Arrivals are still scarce. Green teas such as Chun Mee, which sell well in North Africa, are expected to increase in price by foreign merchants, and the market conditions have improved slightly. At the beginning of the week, the E.O.B. prices per pound for Keemun black tea and Tunxi green tea were 25 cents and 30 cents in U.S. dollars respectively. Exports were profitable, with the latter exceeding 10%. However, due to empty inventories, transactions were not numerous.

Raw silk: There was no change in overseas prices. Shanghai F.O.B. price for D-grade raw silk was $2.80 per pound. According to a silk authority who recently returned from Europe, due to insufficient silk weaving production capacity, European raw silk prices have fallen from $11 per pound after the war to $2.6 per pound. This price is obviously too low, and there may be a sharp rise in the future. Through the efforts of the International Raw Silk Conference, future raw silk production will be coordinated with silk inventory and consumption to take into account the interests of both raw silk merchants and silk weaving merchants. Therefore, the prices will certainly be better than the current situation in the future. Moreover, raw silk still has many excellent characteristics and will maintain its position in the international market.

Feathers: Among feathers, the overseas price of duck feathers has improved. This week's F.O.B. price was $0.435 per pound, and the O.I.F. price was $0.45 per pound. The F.O.B. price of goose feathers was still $0.535 per pound. Exports were profitable, with price differences of 35% and 16% respectively.

Sausage casings: The overseas market price remained unchanged at $75 F.O.B. Exports had a profit of 27%. It is reported that New York sausage casing prices have fallen, and the production of finished products in 27-yard packages originally sold there has been discontinued and is being converted to 13.5-yard packages for export to Switzerland.

Bean market: Overseas prices have fallen. The Hong Kong price of Hankou soybeans was 40 Hong Kong dollars per picul, and there are still reports of competitive sales. The overseas price of edible oil has also fallen. The Guangzhou export oil market is sluggish due to continuous low quotations in Hong Kong dollars. At the end of the week, a telegram from London stated that the selling price of barrelled rapeseed oil C&F was £135 per ton. Oilseeds rose slightly overseas. At the end of the week, the London buying price for mainland peanuts was $295 C&F per ton.

Cotton cloth: The overseas market remained stable. At the beginning of the week, the Hong Kong price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 20.20 Hong Kong dollars per piece. The price of high-quality cotton cloth was $10.5 per bolt, barely covering the cost of export. As for the export volume of cotton cloth, it has exceeded 200,000 bolts in June and July. Recently, with the Dutch authorities opening several ports in the Indonesian region, the cotton cloth market in that region is expected to develop.

### Mayor Convened Education Groups Yesterday to Agree on Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees Standards for Public and Private Schools: Municipal Primary Schools 12 Yuan, Junior High 21 Yuan, Senior High 25 Yuan; Private Schools Primary 20-30 Yuan, Junior High 35-50 Yuan, Senior High 45-60 Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] The fee standards for public and private primary and secondary schools in this city have been decided as follows: (1) Private schools: Primary schools 20-30 gold yuan, junior high schools 35-50 gold yuan, senior high schools 45-60 gold yuan. These standards include tuition and miscellaneous fees, and each school can set its own fee based on its environment within this range. (2) Municipal schools: Primary schools 12 gold yuan, junior high schools 21 gold yuan, senior high schools 25 gold yuan. These include tuition, miscellaneous fees, teacher training fees, sports fees, and maintenance fees. (Primary schools do not charge tuition fees.)

The Municipal Education Bureau held separate talks with the principals of public and private primary and secondary schools some days ago to discuss the issue of fees for this semester and listen to their opinions. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu personally invited relevant education groups to a symposium in the City Government conference room to discuss tuition fees. More than 40 representatives from units such as the Municipal Education Association, the Private Primary and Secondary School Joint Association, the Private Secondary Education Staff Friendship Association, the Municipal Secondary Education Staff Friendship Association, the Municipal Primary School Principal Friendship Association, the Municipal Primary Education Staff Friendship Association, and the Private Primary Education Staff Friendship Association attended. Li, the acting director of the Education Bureau, also attended.

Private Schools

The discussion began with the fees for private schools. The amounts proposed by the principals of various private schools were 30-40 gold yuan for primary schools, 50-60 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 70-80 gold yuan for senior high schools. The Education Bureau believed that they should be reduced to 20-25 gold yuan for primary schools, 35-45 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 45-55 gold yuan for senior high schools. Mayor Wu, after calculating based on the principle that private school teachers should receive the same treatment as municipal school teachers, believed that the amounts reduced by the Education Bureau were acceptable. The principals of various schools then pleaded with the mayor, and the mayor said: "The current situation is not good, and the people's ability to bear the burden is poor. It is impossible to restore the fee standards to the pre-war level. If the fee standards are set low today, the schools will have difficulties maintaining them, but if they are set too high, they will inevitably be criticized by public opinion. The city government can only try to find a balance, striving for fairness so that the schools can be stable, the teachers can maintain their livelihoods, and the people can afford it." Shen Tongyi, the principal of Nanyang Model School, immediately asked the mayor what would happen if the schools could not maintain themselves if they charged fees according to the standards proposed by the Education Bureau. The mayor replied that the board of directors should be asked to make up for the funds. If the schools want to increase teachers' salaries, they should also ask the board of directors for assistance and not increase fees. He also said, "You may not take into account the burden on the citizens, but the city government must." After a long debate, the mayor finally accepted the suggestion of Zhou Feicheng of the Municipal Education Association and widened the range, deciding that it would be 20-30 gold yuan for primary schools, 35-50 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 45-60 gold yuan for senior high schools.

Municipal Schools

The discussion then turned to the fees for municipal schools, and the private school representatives who attended all withdrew. The principals of municipal schools requested 18.7 gold yuan for primary schools, 28 gold yuan for junior high schools, and 32 gold yuan for senior high schools. The Education Bureau believed that, based on the previous semester's fees and the ratio of prices, primary schools should charge 11 gold yuan, junior high schools 21 gold yuan, and senior high schools 25 gold yuan. After discussion, it was finally decided that primary schools would charge 12 gold yuan (including 6 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for sports fees, 2 gold yuan for maintenance fees, and 3 gold yuan for construction fees). Junior high schools will charge 21 gold yuan (including 10 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for tuition fees, and 10 gold yuan for other sports fees, miscellaneous fees, and construction fees, with the distribution ratio to be decided at a meeting of school principals). Senior high schools will charge 25 gold yuan (including 12 gold yuan for teacher training fees, 1 gold yuan for tuition fees, and 12 gold yuan for other sports fees, miscellaneous fees, and construction fees, with the distribution ratio to be decided by the principals).

### Shanghai Student Parents Send Telegram: Eliminate Communist Spies, Rectify Academic Atmosphere, and Pay Tribute to Teachers Nationwide

[Central News Agency] Zhou Jiaoqing and 156 other student parents in Shanghai issued a telegram on Teachers' Day, stating: "As we celebrate Teachers' Day, we, as parents, feel the dignity of the teaching profession and remember the hard work of teaching. We would like to extend our highest respect to teachers nationwide. At this time when the country is facing many difficulties and needs talents for national construction, we are looking forward to promoting the teaching profession, cultivating talents, and giving full play to the effectiveness of education to save the country. However, the communist rebellion is rampant. It is not only engaging in military aggression in the front line, but also disrupting the rear, employing professional students to infiltrate schools, regarding schools as concessions, and using reading places as a base for communist plots, and then as a base for riots. The rules of the school have been abandoned, and the order of society has been destroyed. Not only that, but a small number of teachers who claim to be progressive not only do not admonish sincerely, but also echo in harmony, and even collude with the communists, agitating and bewitching young people, so that professional students become more and more arrogant; and pure young people are angry and dare not speak out. This not only tarnishes the teaching profession, but also loses the children of others. Now that the government has issued an order to eliminate communist plots in order to stabilize order, summoned professional students, and implemented the national policy of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, all patriotic compatriots should sincerely support it, and we deeply hope that people in the education sector will strictly rectify the ranks, and the government authorities should handle it strictly according to law. Eliminate communist plots and rectify the academic atmosphere. We are heartbroken by the communist disaster and hope for peace. We hope that our children will become talents and that teachers will shoulder the heavy responsibility of cultivating people. Therefore, we offer our foolish sincerity and send a telegram to the whole country, hoping that parents all over the world will speak out in unison."

### The Ministry of Education Plans to Improve Secondary Education: Selectively Subsidize Model Secondary Schools; The Amount Will Be Determined Based on the Situation of Secondary Schools in Each Province and City

[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing on the 28th] In order to improve the level of secondary schools and the professional standards and treatment of teachers, the Ministry of Education has recently planned to select public secondary schools with better foundations in various provinces and cities and provide subsidies to enable them to play a model role, in order to gradually improve the standards of secondary school education facilities and the level of secondary school students. Regarding the improvement of the treatment of secondary school teachers, the Ministry of Education formulated the salary standards for faculty and staff of national secondary schools in 1944 and issued them to various provinces and cities, referring to the salary standards to formulate the general salary standards for faculty and staff of secondary schools in each province and city, and has repeatedly supervised the implementation of the standards over the years. In the future, the number of model secondary schools in each province and city will be determined based on the number of schools reported by each province and city and the education situation in each province and city. As for the stock of equipment, teaching, and student levels of model secondary schools, etc., because China is vast and the financial resources, human resources, and education levels of each province and city are not the same, the Ministry of Education does not have mandatory standards.

Correspondent Zhong Zhen of This Newspaper Sitting Among Reporters from Various Countries at the London Illustrated News Banquet for World Games Journalists

### A Record of the Grand Gathering of the World Games Press Corps: London Illustrated News Hosts Banquet for Journalists from Various Countries

— Zhong Zhen, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper

[Special Cable from Our Newspaper in London] On August 1st (Sunday), at 8:00 PM on the third day after the opening of the World Games, the Sunday Pictorial, on behalf of the British Information Office, hosted a banquet at the luxurious Dorchester Hotel in London for journalists from various countries participating in the World Games. Approximately 400 people attended, representing 49 different countries. Only one special correspondent from our newspaper was invited from our country. The traffic was heavy that day, and the event was a great success.

The distinguished guests included the British Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan, and the Chairman of the current Olympic "Preparatory Committee," the Duke of Burghley. The Duke gave a speech in which he reported on the progress and difficulties of the preparations for the Games and expressed the hope that international cooperation would be strengthened through the Games. Duke Burghley was a famous British track and field athlete twenty years ago. He participated in the 10th Olympic World Games in Los Angeles, USA in 1932 and won the 400-meter hurdles championship. He is a veteran of the sports world, and his selection as chairman this time was not accidental. His speech was humorous and his demeanor was excellent. Afterwards, Mr. Hugh Cudliop, editor-in-chief of the Sunday Pictorial, rose to deliver a congratulatory speech to the guests and used various languages to say "Welcome," according to the alphabetical order of the country names in English, and the reporters from each country stood up and thanked him in their own language. This kind of welcoming ceremony was truly unique and full of interest. The food was abundant, and there was champagne and fine wine, a rare feast in post-war Britain. In addition, international singers (Viera) and famous pianists performed, and the guests and hosts dispersed happily at twelve o'clock.

### On Wine-Telling and Tao Qian

— Ma Bin

Regarding the time of Tao Yuanming's works, since the Song Dynasty, he only used the year of the Jiazi cycle without writing the reign title. His loyalty to the old country has long been praised. This discovery was first recorded in the "Annotations of the Five Ministers of the Selections of Literature," which states: "Tao Yuanming's poems written during the Jin Dynasty all include the reign title, while those written during the Song Dynasty only include the year of the Jiazi cycle. It is thought that he was ashamed to serve two dynasties, so he differentiated them in this way."

However, Yuanming's use of the Jiazi cycle to record time did not begin with the Song Dynasty. Before the Yixi era (405-419), he occasionally only used the Jiazi cycle, but after the Liu Song Dynasty, he completely omitted the reign title. Although this is a minor detail, it shows Tao's attitude towards the ugly abdication drama of the time.

In fact, Tao Qian had long foreseen the fate of the weak Jin dynasty and its demise. The warlords, such as Liu Yu and Huan Xuan, were rampant, and the hope of restoration had been extinguished. Therefore, Yuanming himself had long expressed the lament of "admiring all things for gaining their time and feeling that my life is coming to an end." He expressed this worry in many of his works, but previous people did not pay much attention to it. For example, when Yin Jingren went to serve as a staff officer under Liu Yu (when Liu was still Grand Commandant), Yuanming wrote in his farewell poem, "Good talents do not hide in the world, rivers and lakes are full of mean and poor people," which shows that his usual complaints were not insignificant!

Tao Qian's most concrete reflection on Liu Yu's usurpation of the Jin dynasty is none other than the poem "Telling of Wine." Although this poem uses wine to confuse the truth, a careful reading reveals his inner anger and his unforgettable feelings for the Jin dynasty. I will copy it down below:

"The double sun illuminates the southern land, the cries of crows are heard together. Although the autumn grass is not yet yellow, the gentle wind has long been divided. White pebbles adorn the clear shores, and the southern peaks are without remaining clouds. Yuzhang rises against the tall gates, and Chonghua's tomb is firmly established. Tears flow as I embrace my inner sighs, and I listen attentively to the rooster crowing. The divine land offers fine grain, and the western spirits instruct me. The princes of Liang controlled the armies, and the taro harvest cost them their lives. The Prince of Shanyang returned to a lesser state, and achieving fame was still not diligent. Bu Sheng was good at tending his flock, and found happiness in not being a ruler. King Ping left the old capital, and gathered the remaining partisans in the gorge. Double tombs were just being built, and three toes revealed a strange writing. Prince Ai loved the clear flute, and soared in the daytime over the He and Fen rivers. Lord Zhu practiced the nine teeth, and lived in seclusion away from the world's turmoil. Lofty within the western peaks, I always rest in familiar places. Heaven's countenance is eternally fixed, and Peng's longevity is not worthy of comparison."

The opening section of this poem, focusing on the beauty of the scenery, is not unusual. But when it comes to the two lines "Yuzhang rises against the tall gates, and Chonghua's tomb is interspersed with spirits," the condemnation of Emperor Gong's abdication flows forth like a river, once unleashed, impossible to restrain.

History records that after Liu Yu usurped the Jin dynasty, he deposed Emperor Gong as the Prince of Lingling. The following year, he instructed Zhang Wei to give him poisoned wine. Wei could not bear to harm the former ruler and drank the poison himself. Yu then sent troops to advance the poison, but Emperor Gong refused it and was subsequently killed.

Tang Dongjian once said that Yuanming's "Telling of Wine" was a lament for Emperor Gong, which is undoubtedly correct. In the poem, "The Prince of Shanyang returned to a lesser state" uses the story of Emperor Xian of Han to allude to current events, and the fates of Emperor Xian of Han and Emperor Gong of Jin were completely similar. After Cao Wei usurped the Han, Emperor Xian was demoted to Duke of Shanyang and eventually assassinated. Liu Yu's treatment of Emperor Gong followed the same method used by Cao Pi. The cyclical tragedy of history made the one-man scholar Tao Yuanming only able to "shed tears and embrace his inner sighs."

Huang Shangu has questioned the topic of "Telling of Wine", but if one knows the story above, it becomes clear that the "wine" in "Telling of Wine" is the poisoned wine that poisoned Emperor Gong, which has no relation to "Yi Di made it, and Du Kang refined it." Moreover, Yuanming put a lot of effort into thinking up such a topic!

Yuanming was born in a turbulent world and was the son of a declining aristocratic family. His feelings were naturally deeper than those of others. However, in a chaotic world, it is difficult to speak one's mind, especially during a change of dynasties. To express one's complaints often leads to losing one's head. During the transition between the Wei and Jin dynasties, harming men of letters seemed to be something the rulers enjoyed. Tao Qian grew up in such an environment, so how could he not be cautious and fearful? Therefore, in his works, he sometimes hides his true feelings severely. Only in his hidden feelings are there occasional touches of inner feelings and profound grief, such as "The trees are joyfully facing the sun, and the streams are flowing slowly," such as "Xingtian defies with majesty, his fierce will remains constant," such as "Wading along the banks of the Yangtze River... Suddenly the mountains and rivers changed," and the "Telling of Wine" and "Yin-An Farewell" mentioned above, everywhere one can see that Tao's inner life and his outward appearance were in extremely fierce conflict. However, Yuanming's strength lies in his ability to reconcile this contradiction. He was deeply influenced by the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi, so he was less concerned with gain and loss. For example, after the fall of the Jin dynasty, Yuanming had a sense of grief and sorrow like that expressed in "Telling of Wine," but he suppressed it, knowing that he himself did not have the power to recruit troops and buy horses, so empty and lofty expressions of integrity were unnecessary. For example, Tao's friendship with the high-ranking monk Huiyuan was unmatched at the time, but Yuanming never joined the White Lotus Society, which shows that in the midst of chaos, he only wanted to refrain from certain things and maintain his own integrity.

In this era of frequent changes, whenever I think of Yuanming's high-mindedness and detachment, refusing to be involved in worldly affairs, and then look at today, those who indulge in licentiousness and extravagance, doing everything, are numerous, I increasingly feel that maintaining one's own integrity is valuable.

### Tai Chi Chuan Arrives in Taiwan

— Chen Yixian

My brother, Weiming, recently returned from Taiwan and talked about the people there learning Tai Chi Chuan. There is value in recording it.

The Japanese occupied Taiwan for fifty years. Their own people practiced Judo, but they prohibited the Taiwanese from exercising and did not allow the organization of martial arts groups. After the victory, Xie Jinghu of Hsinchu City, Taiwan, a disciple of Weiming, established a Tai Chi Chuan club in the Zheng Clan Ancestral Hall. More than twenty people studied with him. Zhou Minyi, who had come to Shanghai in the past to learn boxing from Weiming for five or six years, also joined. The two sent letters inviting Weiming to tour Taiwan Province, and remitted a sum of one hundred million yuan as travel expenses. Weiming flew to Taiwan on June 24th. When he arrived in Hsinchu, Zhou and Xie held a meeting to welcome him. Previously, Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily had published the news that "Shanghai Tai Chi Chuan Master Chen Weiming is coming to Taiwan." At the welcoming meeting, about two hundred people who had heard the news came to observe. First, Xie Jinghu's students performed, then Chen Duoming performed Tai Chi Chuan, and Xu Wenfuf performed Shaolin boxing, Tai Chi sword, and double knives (the two are Weiming's top disciples, who flew to Taiwan at the same time), which was extremely exciting. My brother Weiming performed Tai Chi Changquan and Baguazhang, and also performed moving-step push hands with Duoming, which the Taiwanese had never seen before, and they applauded endlessly. Some guests who practiced external martial arts were also invited to perform. After the performance, they went inside to rest, but the visitors did not disperse. A certain boxer requested a hand-to-hand match. Weiming came out and said to the crowd, "I am here purely for sightseeing, not to compete. If you insist on a hand-to-hand match, we can study together." A certain gentleman immediately stepped forward, his body strong and sturdy. Weiming extended his right hand in a posture without striking. The gentleman suddenly grabbed Weiming's right arm, trying to drag him down. His strength was extremely great. Weiming followed him for several steps, and the gentleman's strength had quietly disappeared. Then he gently touched the gentleman's eyes with his left hand, merely indicating his intention. However, the gentleman did not understand the subtleties of internal martial arts and continued to hold Weiming's right arm tightly. Weiming slightly shook his right arm, and the man was shocked, retreating seven or eight steps, almost falling. The crowd who came to watch were finally convinced and dispersed with applause. After this meeting, Weiming's name as a national martial arts master spread throughout Taiwan. Someone from Northern Taiwan wrote a letter inviting Weiming to teach boxing, but Weiming declined because he wanted to return to Shanghai and did not have time.

Weiming founded the Zhi Rou Boxing Club in Shanghai in 1925, and was the earliest to promote Tai Chi Chuan in the South. It still exists today, and the club is located in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. Over the past twenty years, those who have studied Tai Chi with him have been numerous. For example, celebrities such as Xu Shiying and the late Xie Te, Wu Chaochu, Huang Fu, Hu Puan, and Guan Jiong, were all his disciples. In 1932, Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi specially invited him to Guangxi to teach boxing. The people of Guangxi knew about Tai Chi Chuan since Weiming began promoting it. Now he has given the Taiwanese a new impression of Tai Chi Chuan, and it must be recorded.

### Debt

— Mao Yi

When the young Herbert Hoover was still studying at Stanford University, he organized a concert and invited the renowned Polish pianist Ignacy Paderewski to perform for a high fee. However, the audience was not enthusiastic, and the young concert organizer Hoover found that he was four hundred US dollars short to pay the pianist. Paderewski generously cancelled the four hundred dollar debt.

Twenty-five years later, the Poles held a grand public reception in Łódź to welcome the visiting Hoover. At that time, Paderewski had been elected President of Poland. He thanked the Americans for saving the lives of countless Poles under Hoover's relief work. Hoover replied that he was merely repaying an old debt of four hundred US dollars.

### Eastern Scales and Western Claws

— Xian Si

According to the Korean Weekly, at least one in five Americans dies under suspicious circumstances, or violently, and must be formally investigated by government agencies.

Recent statistics show that there are now 4,409,780 Boy Scouts worldwide, with the United States having the most at 2,063,397, followed by the United Kingdom with 604,249.

### Strange Occupation

— Liu An

Dana Baine is one of the highest-paid stars in American radio broadcasting - but he hardly needs to speak.

He specializes in imitating the sounds of various animals, and he has a slogan: "From mosquitoes to elephants, I can imitate everything." He can imitate more than a hundred bird calls, the sounds of various livestock, and also the different "hissing" sounds of various insects and snakes.

He gets paid $35 for imitating a chicken for three seconds. Once he got $98 for imitating ten cat meows. The strangest time was when he had to imitate the sound of a person's upper and lower teeth colliding when startled. It is said that he imitated it very well.

### Gentleman on the Beam

— Yuan Yi

American thieves seem to have changed their style lately. Incidents of wanting money and making jokes at the same time are becoming more and more common.

A newly opened restaurant in Brooklyn was broken into by thieves at night, who stole the two hundred and forty dollars stored in the safe. When the owner discovered the theft and was about to call the police, he saw that someone had added a few hasty words to the large poster in the store that read "Choose what you like, satisfaction guaranteed": "Already taken care of, thank you for your kindness."

There is a small thief in Kansas City who specializes in sneaking into people's homes at night to steal. This person has a characteristic: every time he steals something, he always scatters many thumbtacks on the floor. If the owners hear the noise and get up to chase him barefoot, they are sure to step on the thumbtacks - when they scream in pain, the little thief can slip away quietly.

One night in a wine bar in downtown New York, two fierce-looking bandits came in. They showed their guns, and one herded the owner and seven customers into a corner, while the other went to the counter and put all the money in his pocket. Then, he jumped on the table, bowed to the customers, and asked, "Gentlemen, what would you like to drink?" The customers were so frightened that they had turned pale, and had no interest in drinking, but with the guns pointed at them, they dared not disobey and ordered a kind of wine. One of the two robbers then started pouring the wine, singing a melodious love song, while the other robber started toe-dancing. When the two robbers had had their fill, they sang together and left.

In Tulsa, two drivers were arguing on the road over a minor matter. Two policemen came and took them to court. The judge fined them sixty-five dollars. Later, the two people found out that the policemen and the judge were actually imposters.

### Surviving Writings of Shen Yunying

— Shi Shufan

Yesterday, Rong De, from Wuxi, showed me two frames of calligraphy by the extraordinary woman Shen Yunying of Xiaoshan, who lived at the end of the Ming Dynasty. One is a copy of the "Essay on Yue Yi," with only forty-seven characters remaining. It was written in the mid-autumn of the Chongzhen wuyin year (1638), six years before Li Zicheng attacked the capital. It was probably a casual creation while she was still attending her father (Zhi Xu) as a guard in Daozhou. It ends with a white text seal "Yunying Learns Calligraphy" and a red text seal "Shen Family's Daughter" on each side. The other page contains works expressing her feelings after returning to seclusion in her hometown. Although there are only a few hundred words, they can be compared to a painful history. One poem reads: "Looking back on all things, they are like passing waves. What has come of studying writing and swordsmanship? Daozhou has not been broken, but Jingzhou has fallen. I regret that I cannot be like Xie Xiao'e!" The second poem reads: "Returning to the long lane, my mind is lost! In my worn box, I find only a few remaining notes. What does this humble brush matter? It has been twelve years since the fires of war." The following is an appendix: "When I was attending in Daozhou, I used to copy this book. Until after the guiwu year, the bandits held up their spears. I could not hold the brush. Years of war and thousands of miles of travel, who was my companion? This year, it is the gengyin year. The world has completely changed, but the people and the books remain the same. Looking at this book, I cannot restrain my grief. My nephew Zhaoyang came to ask about writing, so I recorded these two quatrains to show him. Zhaoyang must work hard!" The end of the note is not signed, but it is marked with two small seals, "Aying" and "Returning from the Battlefield." It was five or six years since Zhi Xu died in battle at Matan Station and her husband Jia Wance died in Jingzhou. According to the epitaph written by Mao Qiling, Yunying returned to her hometown and supported herself by teaching embroidery and copying books. She lived a simple life and died at the young age of thirty-eight, buried in Jushan. There is a passage about Shen Zhaoyang: "Mao Sheng from Xihe has a friend named Shen Zhaoyang, a scholar, who is a member of the general's (referring to Yunying) clan. He once received the Commentary of Mr. Hu on the Spring and Autumn Annals from the general." Therefore, the source of this note can be said to be credible. During the Xianfeng reign, Ding Dachun also had a detailed inscription, prefacing the beginning and end: "In the xinhai year of the Xianfeng reign, I happened to be a guest in Yuanjiang and met Jiang Huisheng, an old painter from Suzhou, who was carrying the general's handwriting for sale. It was the household collection of the Shen Zhaoyang, a famous scholar mentioned in Mao's epitaph, which had been in his family for five generations. Jiang Jun bought it for thirty gold, hoping to give it to Commander Lu Lifu, but Lu was censured for losing military secrets. I then added twenty gold and obtained it." From Xianfeng and Tongzhi to the present, it has been hundreds of years, and I do not know how many people have lingered and sighed in between before it returned to Rong Jun. I have already decided to write a long poem and encourage you to take photos and make prints to spread it widely. (Editor's note: Mr. Shi's long poem will be published tomorrow.)
