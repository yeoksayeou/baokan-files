### My Proposal for Financial and Economic Reforms to be Considered by the US Government; Secretary of State Marshall Meets with Bei and Koo to Discuss the Overall Situation

[Washington, DC, United States Information Service, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall declared that the US government would consider the ten-point reform plan proposed in the statement by the Chinese government. He stated that the aid to China proposal had been fully approved by the International Financial Advisory Committee and had been submitted to the Budget Bureau. Once the Budget Bureau has completed its review, it will be submitted to Congress.

[Washington, DC, United Press, 28th] Treasury Secretary Snyder confirmed that the National Financial Advisory Committee, of which he is the chairman, has received the aid to China plan and is studying it. However, he declined to comment in more detail.

[Washington, DC, Central News Agency, 28th] Marshall held a meeting on the 28th with Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, for a general discussion on the US aid to China plan. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin also attended the fifty-minute meeting held at the State Department on the afternoon of the 28th and announced the above news to reporters afterward. According to Bei, the delegation has held three meetings with State Department officials, all of which were of a purely technical nature. When asked by reporters whether China had requested military assistance in addition to technical assistance, Koo replied that China would welcome any kind of assistance. China had not proposed any specific figures to the State Department, but would propose other plans for China's post-war recovery and reconstruction. After meeting with Secretary Marshall, Bei Zuyi also had discussions with Butterworth, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department.

[Washington, DC, Central News Agency, United Press, 28th] After meeting with US Secretary of State Marshall, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin told the press that the $300 million US aid to China plan would enable China to get a start in construction, but the overall construction work would require more time and more money. Today, Koo, accompanied by Bei Zuyi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, went to the State Department for a meeting with Marshall, after which he stated that they had a general discussion with Marshall on the overall situation in China. The technical delegation has held three meetings with US officials. Koo concluded by saying that China's plan for developing the Yangtze River has been put on hold pending the outcome of the request for US assistance. [This newspaper's report] Zhang Junmai, who is studying in the United States, recently sent a letter to members of the Democratic Socialist Party, saying that he had met with Marshall and Wedemeyer in Washington. Economic aid to China was the theme of the conversation, and the total amount of US aid would be more than $300 million. [United Press, approx. 28th] A World Telegram editorial on the 28th stated that both the Chinese and American governments should be held responsible for the crisis in the nine eastern provinces of China, but the time for assigning blame has now passed. What remains to be seen is the actions of President Truman and President Chiang. Washington and Nanjing should quickly unite, forget mutual recriminations, rush necessary American supplies and dispatch advisors to replace any Chinese civil and military officials who cannot produce the same aid effect.

### The List of Elected National Assembly Delegates Still Awaits Announcement

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The announcement of the list of elected National Assembly delegates is still pending, because many non-Kuomintang people who were nominated were not elected. Although the Kuomintang tried its best to concede under the method of concession to friendly parties, there are still those who are hindered by social elites and those who have too few votes to qualify as substitute candidates. It is estimated that there are more than 50 people from the Democratic Socialist Party and more than 30 people from the Youth Party. The Kuomintang has copied this list and sent it to the two parties on the 28th and 29th respectively, asking them to find a solution. The two parties are currently discussing it separately.

### The Key to the Kowloon Walled City and Shamian Incidents Remains Sovereignty; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Completes All Negotiation Preparations

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] There was no development in the Sino-British negotiations on the 29th. The stalemate in the disagreement between the two sides on the Kowloon Walled City issue has made our government's standing committee pay more attention to the basic reasons for discussing the issue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has completed the necessary preparations and is ready to engage in any procedure of negotiation at any time. A spokesperson for the British Embassy frankly admitted that the current deadlock in the negotiations lies in three matters: The issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon Walled City, the issue of the release of arrested residents, and the issue of compensation. However, according to those who understand the details of the Kowloon Walled City negotiations, although the deadlocks have different manifestations, the underlying cause is still the issue of sovereignty. Taking the second point as an example, China's position originally recognized that the Hong Kong government had no right to arrest residents in Kowloon Walled City, and the Hong Kong court had no right to govern this case. Therefore, Foreign Minister Wang had instructed Ambassador Zheng Tianxi in the middle of this month to engage in serious negotiations with the British government, requesting the immediate release of the two arrested residents as the first step in the negotiations. However, the British side completely disagreed with this, maintaining the dignity of the Hong Kong government as before and ignoring it. From this point of view, it is extremely difficult for the British side to hope in its note of the 24th that the issue of jurisdiction and the issue of eviction can be handled separately in resolving the Kowloon Walled City incident. At the same time, officials of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs also did not deny on the 29th that the negotiations involved basic principles and that it was difficult to reach a complete agreement quickly. A senior official discussed the future of Kowloon Walled City and even the entire Kowloon leased territory with reporters. He also acknowledged some reasoning: Since the signing of the Sino-British New Treaty in January of the second year of the Republic of China, all relations between China and Britain, including rights and obligations, should be re-evaluated in the spirit of equality and reciprocity in the Sino-British New Treaty. Regarding the Kowloon leased territory, our side considered our wartime allies and did not take it back at the same time, but we also declared that we reserved our rights. In terms of the law itself, the new treaty is superior to the old treaty, and the existence of the Kowloon leased territory undoubtedly violates the spirit of the treaty and is the last remnant of unequal treaties. Therefore, if we raise this issue at an appropriate time, our allies will have no reason to refuse to consider it. Moreover, if this issue cannot be avoided at any opportunity, we do not intend to evade it. Therefore, it is impossible to predict or limit the extent to which the negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City incident today will extend, and it depends on the extent to which both sides can compromise.

[This newspaper's report] According to a person in charge of the Democratic Socialist Party, the rumors that our party will run for president and vice president are completely untrue. The list of elected National Assembly delegates will be announced at the same time as the list of elected legislators due to various difficulties. The government plans to establish a semi-official institution to accommodate more than 200 National Assembly delegate candidates who have been affected by the supplementary measures for political party nominations. Xu Fulin, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party's Fu Committee, strongly advocated this.

### The Main Smuggling Base Has Moved From Hong Kong to Macau

Merchants Evade Taxes by Shipping Goods to Macau [This newspaper, Guangzhou, 29th] The technical issues of the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement have been resolved after Ding Guitang arrived in Hong Kong to negotiate, and it will be implemented soon. We will set up checkpoints in certain sections of Hong Kong and send personnel to jointly conduct inspections with Hong Kong Customs. It is recently learned that in order to evade taxes, Hong Kong merchants are mostly shipping goods to Macau, and then smuggling them into the mainland from Macau. This move has replaced Hong Kong's position as the "smuggling base camp". The amount of goods shipped from Hong Kong to Macau has been unprecedented since the restoration, and all goods except tobacco and alcohol are tax-free, so smuggling is increasing. If the Macau authorities do not assist in anti-smuggling, the Hong Kong agreement will still be difficult to achieve.

### Adjustment Measures for Employees of China Textile Company and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Determined; China Fisheries Company to Be Sold by Issuing Half of Its Shares; Important Cases Approved by National Economic Council

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] The National Economic Council (ÂÖ®Á∂ìÊúÉ) held its 32nd meeting on the afternoon of the 29th. Zhang Qun and Wang Yunwu were absent, and Chen Lifu chaired the meeting. First, Gu Yuzhen, Deputy Secretary-General, reported on the price fluctuations in the past week, stating that the price fluctuations in the week were minimal and the situation was good. Then, the discussion of the proposals began, and the following was approved: A. The salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Company (‰∏≠Á¥°ÂÖ¨Âè∏) and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (ÊãõÂïÜÂ±Ä) should be gradually reduced to comply with the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Employees of State-Owned Enterprises" passed by the State Council. The measures are as follows: Except for the ship employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company who join the Maritime Workers' Union, and the original adjustment method will still be used (i.e., adjusted monthly according to the index), all others will be adjusted according to the new method starting from January of this year. The adjustment period should be the same as the adjustment period for public school teachers, that is, once every three months, and should not be adjusted monthly. The adjustment percentage should be 70% of the adjustment increase percentage for civil servants (because the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises are three times higher than those of civil servants). For example, if the salaries of public school teachers increase by 100%, the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises can only increase by 70%. Each adjustment should be reduced by 10% until it meets the "Measures for Adjusting the Salaries of Employees of State-Owned Enterprises" (that is, the salaries can only be 30% higher than the salaries of civil servants). Each adjustment must be approved by the competent department. Expenses should be reduced and expenditures should be reduced. All surpluses should be handed over to the national treasury and cannot be used or hidden at will. If adjusted according to this method, the salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises can meet the regulations after one year. B. The sale of the China Fisheries Company (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞¥Áî¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏) will be based on the price assessment of the Ministry of Agriculture, using 1937 as the standard, with a remaining value of 2.81 million yuan. It is now revalued according to the price index in October 1937, which is about 160 to 70 billion yuan. Half will be temporarily retained as government shares, and half will be sold by issuing shares. C. The method of selling the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company (‰∏≠ÂúãÁ¥°ÁπîÊ©üË£ΩÈÄ†ÂÖ¨Âè∏) is that the 40% government shares of the company should be transferred to commercial shares two years after the company was established in accordance with the original contract. February of this year has reached the transfer period, so it is decided to transfer commercial shares.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] At the regular meeting of the National Economic Council (ÂÖ®Á∂ìÊúÉ) on the 29th, the implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan were discussed. The original plan (4) "Trial barter trade" was cancelled at the last regular meeting. Chen Lifu requested to restore it on the 29th, believing that the reason for canceling the provision in the original plan that the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office should try out barter trade with international cooperative organizations was because some people doubted the ability of Chinese cooperatives. In fact, Chinese cooperatives may not necessarily be unable to bear this responsibility. After discussion, the original plan (4) was restored in principle to try out barter trade, but the content was revised. The issue of the import and export linkage system for international trade was also raised again on the 29th. Tong Jiling advocated that international trade should adopt an import and export linkage system. Some people opposed it at the meeting, and the discussion lasted for a long time. However, it was generally believed that American aid was more promising, and the import and export linkage system for international trade was a general trend, which needed to be considered. Finally, it was passed in principle, but this is only one of the provisions of the implementation measures for the commercial part of the economic reform plan, and it is still difficult to achieve in the short term.

### Condolences to the Mayor and Regret for Education!

Yesterday, the long-brewing storm at Tongji University in this city finally escalated. The chaotic and expanding situation is simply beyond reasonable prediction. Mayor Wu personally went to the university yesterday morning to mediate at the request of the students, but unexpectedly, he was violently beaten by the student mob. Fortunately, the mayor was extremely patient. Even when he was about to be beaten to the ground by the students, he shouted loudly to prevent the military police from firing, so that the conspirators who deliberately created a mass tragedy could not carry out their scheme. Mayor Wu's magnanimity and spirit are truly admirable. From the time he entered Tongji in the morning to the time he was beaten in the afternoon until late at night, he still insisted on staying near the school, insisting that the academic atmosphere must be rectified, and he did not eat lunch or dinner. The mayor is working so hard for the local area and for education, and we especially want to express our sincere condolences.

The Tongji University student organization's self-government association does not comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry of Education, and President Ding's refusal to recognize it is justified. Even if the students have reasons, they can make a statement. However, they often go on strike, and a few students even move their bedding into the classrooms, occupy them, and prevent other students who are willing to study from being able to do so. They can only be manipulated by them. This is no longer the action that ordinary students should take. The school authorities chose the most important ones and gave them the punishment of expulsion or probation, which is also within the scope of their duties. Moreover, even with these punishments, if the students want to ask the school to be lenient, there are professors and alumni who can mediate. Why do the students insist on petitioning in Nanjing? Even more strangely, this is only a matter for Tongji and has nothing to do with other schools. However, yesterday, some university and middle school students went in groups to say goodbye and cheer them on. May we ask: What kind of original intention did the students of each school have when they first entered the school? After the teams gathered at Tongji, they were not satisfied with the noise and commotion, and finally resorted to violence, assaulting and insulting the mayor. The actions of the young people in the dignified academic institution are so perverse. What kind of system will be established? For decades, the country has spent countless money on education, and society has placed countless expectations on young people. But now it has come to this. We not only feel sorry for the young people, but also cannot help but cry for the future of the nation!

Now that the Tongji storm has escalated to this point, we believe that the education authorities must make a great determination and thoroughly rectify the academic atmosphere; otherwise, if they continue to muddle along and only seek to whitewash for a while, it will be even more difficult to clean up in the future. Whether it is the education minister or the school teachers, if they do not correct the decadent atmosphere of the school, they will not only harm the young people, but also be ashamed of the students' parents and the nation. The students who assaulted and insulted the mayor must be punished according to the law; other expelled members should be ordered to leave the school. As for the students of other schools, the principals of each school should lead them back separately and give them supervision or punishment. Conspirators who pretend to be students and mix in to cause trouble, and blind followers who carry leaflets and pamphlets of the Communist Party and spread them on the spot during this period of mobilization, should be brought to justice and prevented from succeeding in their evil plans. It must be understood that the situation today is already clear. The Tongji storm is not a simple internal school problem, but a link in the conspiracy of the hidden conspirators in Shanghai to create unrest for the Communist Party. Since Commander Xuan and Mayor Wu have jointly issued a statement the day before yesterday, emphasizing winter defense and maintaining security, they should do their best to prevent this kind of conspiracy that wants to use the school storm and young people as their capital for unrest, so as to curb the budding of turmoil.

The ancients said, "By treading on hoarfrost, one knows that solid ice is coming." It also said, "When one leaf falls, one knows that autumn is coming." From this storm at Tongji, we can see two points:

First, the decline of the academic atmosphere did not start today. If we still do not thoroughly rectify it today and try to correct the decadent atmosphere, then from autumn to winter, the bleak atmosphere will be even more unimaginable. Students beat the bureau chief last year, and beat the mayor this year. If this continues, the students will become thugs, and the violence will spread everywhere. Why should the country and society train these thugs? We know that this is only the behavior of a few tyrannical people, and it is definitely not what the majority of good students want to see. However, the majority of good students are a heap of loose sand, without organization, and only allow those few "professional students" to combine and charge around, and they have really become a bad influence. Teachers must be strict and then the truth can be respected. Today, we want to call for the rectification of the academic atmosphere. In particular, we want to ask the government and society to respect teachers and value the Tao with twelve points, so that teachers with both good character and learning can take on the responsibility of leading students. At the same time, they should do everything possible to stabilize the school environment and protect the right of general good students to study.

Second, in recent years, education has neglected a fundamental point, which is the principle of being a human being. In general schools, whether universities or middle schools, whether liberal arts or science, teachers who can teach young students how to be human beings through their own words and deeds are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. It is even questionable whether teachers can recognize a few of the students they teach. There is no emotional connection between teachers and students, and even less is there an appeal to personality. Not only do they become strangers as soon as they leave the school gate, but they also regard the lecture halls and classrooms as teahouses and taverns. In such an environment, good teachers can only sigh secretly and cannot do anything. And a group of young students who are roughly made are often very self-righteous and arrogant, do not pay attention to politeness, and have no consideration at all. How can we hope that they will take on great responsibilities in the future, and how can we hope that they will understand the times? Naturally, there must be fragrant grass within a hundred steps, and there must be loyalty and trustworthiness in ten households. There are of course truly patriotic and studious talents among young students, and the expectations of the country and society for them are forever earnest. However, the decadent atmosphere has spread and is waiting to be salvaged. If the authorities in charge of education still want to avoid treatment and hide their illness, and if those who bear the expectations of society only know how to cater to the crowd and refuse to point out the lost way and change course, then the harm to the country in five or ten years will be unimaginable. Yesterday's violent actions of Tongji students are only a small matter!

### Ministry of National Defense Executes Three Corrupt Military Officers

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense executed three corrupt military officers, Su Boyun, Liang Xianbang, and Qin Zhong, on the 29th. Su Boyun was a 54-year-old male from Chaoan County, Guangdong Province, and a colonel specialist of the Navy in the Hainan Island area. Liang Xianbang was a 37-year-old male and a former lieutenant colonel commander of the Yuehai Patrol Fleet. Qin Zhong was a 38-year-old male from Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, and a former colonel director of the Hong Kong Receiving Group of the Guangzhou Naval Commissioner's Office. In September 1946, Su Boyun transported supplies on the Dazhen ship to the Dongsha Islands, and met Liang Xianbang in Hong Kong. Liang requested him to provide documents certifying the naval vessels in the area to cover merchant ships to avoid customs inspection and smuggling. Su agreed to his request, issued the assigned documents, and accepted a bribe of 3,000 Hong Kong dollars from Liang. On November 11 of the same year, the merchant ships were changed to Hainan Boat Nos. 467 and 468, and smuggled goods were loaded and transported from Hong Kong to Guangdong. The smuggled goods were seized by the naval fleet at sea in Guangzhou and handed over to the navy for legal processing. Su and Liang were detained. Qin Zhong accepted bribes and committed fraud in Hong Kong when receiving ships and renting them to merchants for repair and use. The Naval Headquarters sent the offenders to the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation. After investigation by the Ministry, it was confirmed that Su Boyun was guilty of accepting bribes, and Liang Xianbang and Qin Zhong were directly profiting from the matters in charge. They were sentenced to death and deprived of their civil rights for life. After being submitted for approval, the three offenders were bound to the execution ground at 9:00 a.m. today and executed by firing squad.

### Actively Losing West Germany Reform Plan, Britain, America and France Consult, France Insists on Opposing Centralized System

[Reuters, London, 28th] There has been positive progress in the negotiations among Western powers on the West German issue. Following the agreement between experts from Britain, France, and the United States to gradually and completely incorporate electricity, coal, and gas into the French economy, a British Foreign Office spokesman reiterated that the proposals submitted by France to Britain and the United States regarding the reform resolution of the Frankfurt Anglo-American merged zone are being given the most serious consideration. It is therefore not impossible that the Frankfurt resolution will be amended. It can be seen from this that the British and American authorities, before the Anglo-American-French meeting on the future status of Germany is held in London in mid-February, will slightly revise the new resolution based on French opinions and put it into effect. This is tantamount to submitting it to the meeting of the three powers of Britain, America, and France as an accomplished fact. Under these circumstances, it is expected that France will lodge another protest. Although official details about the meeting of the three powers have not yet been revealed, if the future economic status of West Germany is discussed in detail at the meeting, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will inevitably demand full participation in the discussion. If the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg can eventually join the international control regime in the Ruhr area together with Britain, America, and France, France's fear of Germany's resurgence and the possible establishment of a centralized German central government in Frankfurt can be greatly reduced.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is reported that France has submitted notes to London and Washington regarding the reform plan proposed by the authorities of the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, suggesting the establishment of deductions in the merged zone and giving German states and state parliaments some centralized powers to strengthen the federal nature of Germany. France's suggestions include five points, which are presented in the form of questions, including: (1) Why is the power of the state parliaments smaller than the power of the Frankfurt Executive Committee? (2) Why is the power to levy taxes given to the central administrativeÊú∫ÊûÑËÄå‰∏çÊòØÁªô‰∫àÈÇ¶ÊîøÂ∫úÊú∫ÊûÑÔºüÊú∫ÊûÑÔºüÈÇ¶ÊîøÂ∫úÔºü(3) Why is the chairman of the Executive Committee not appointed by the Advisory Committee, but by the Economic Committee? (4) Why should the governors of the provinces and their officials work together in Frankfurt, but the independent authorities of the two countries must exercise their powers at different levels?

### Italy and France Form Economic Alliance Two Countries Submit Outline of Plan to US Italian-British Economic Negotiations Concluded

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The Italian and French ambassadors to the United States have submitted preliminary reports to the State Department, including the possibility of establishing an economic alliance between France and Italy. After proposing this report, they stated that the French-Italian economic alliance includes not only a customs union, but also the integration of the two countries' agriculture and industry, so that materials and labor can be better allocated. Mr. Ponzi also said that he and the Italian Ambassador Taichiani discussed with Lovett how to expand this economic alliance to other countries, such as the Benelux Group.

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] The economic negotiations between Britain and Italy in London, which lasted for 15 days, ended today, and a statement was issued stating that the scope of the negotiations included a wide range of economic and financial aspects, such as the large-scale exchange of goods between the two countries, the general status of the pound, the determination of the ratio of the pound to the dollar in the Italian exchange market, and trade between the two countries. The statement did not mention whether any agreements had been reached on any major issues.

[French News Agency, Rome, 28th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, in a brief report on his country's foreign policy, said that the Italian government is now closely observing the British proposal to organize an alliance of Western European countries.

### Benelux Three Countries Hold Joint Meeting

Discuss Further Economic Cooperation

[Reuters, Luxembourg, 28th] Well-informed sources said that the joint meeting of the cabinets of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is scheduled to be held here tomorrow, and a joint declaration will be drafted to respond to the suggestion of Britain and France to conclude a five-nation alliance, and Foreign Minister Bevin's proposal to establish a Western European alliance. The meeting was originally only a technical rumor, with the purpose of discussing the unification of the three countries' tariffs and other trade issues. However, since the publication of Bevin's theory, a new development has occurred in the Western European situation, which has made the meeting a significant political meeting. Furthermore, after the unification of tariffs in Benelux was realized on January 1st, the first stage of economic merger has been completed, and the second stage will start after this meeting.

[French News Agency, Brussels, 29th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak delivered a speech last night in the National Women's Association, declaring that the Soviet Union is now carrying out a defense plan. It must obtain a final victory to defend itself, and its current actions are intended to create this strategic defense zone. This is the main reason why the Soviet Union opposes the Marshall Plan.

### Secretary Marshall Agrees to Franc Devaluation

Believes it Will Help European Reconstruction

[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that France must devalue its currency in order to fulfill its mission within the framework of the European Recovery Program. However, this devaluation has formed a misunderstanding. Mr. Marshall firmly believes that the devaluation will have no adverse consequences for France's mission in the European Recovery Program, and said that the franc devaluation is in line with the documents drawn up by the sixteen countries at the Paris meeting. Mr. Marshall said that in this document, every participating country will guarantee the stability of its tendency and budget. Mr. Marshall went on to say that the need to stabilize the monetary system was raised in the European Recovery Program, so the devaluation of the franc is a step closer to the recommendations of the European Recovery Program. He said that the differences in opinion between Britain, the International Monetary Fund, and France have no impact on the devaluation, but only on the implementation method. Finally, Marshall declared that the franc devaluation does not affect the total amount of US aid to Europe, because all raw materials and goods are paid for at about the same price.

### Recalling Large Denomination Franc Notes

Parliamentary Finance Committee Opposes

All Banks Closed for Two Days

[Report] London, 29th Radio: Paris dispatch, the French National Assembly Finance Committee refused to accept the government's proposal to recall all 5,000 franc denomination banknotes.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] It was learned tonight that Prime Minister Schumann has reached an agreement with the Socialist Party on the government's proposed free gold trading bill, and the cabinet crisis is gradually easing. The bill may pass parliament by a few votes, but whether the Socialist Party cabinet members will continue to serve is still in doubt.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The French government today ordered all French banks to close for two days to prevent speculation when parliament debates the free gold trading bill. The French government also ordered a temporary ban on the use of 5,000 franc notes as a medium of exchange.

### Three-Power Conference Secretary Marshall Does Not Express Opinion

[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] US Secretary of State Marshall was recently asked by reporters today whether the three powers of the Soviet Union and Britain will hold a three-power conference to collect important current world issues, but Secretary Marshall refused to answer, only saying that this matter has not yet been answered until it is studied with President Truman.

### Marshall Opposes Reduction in 6.8 Billion Yuan European Aid Amount Only Concessions Can Be Made in Management

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall, hearing that supporters of the Marshall Plan in Congress intend to propose a compromise to reduce the total amount of aid to Europe in order to avoid a larger reduction, stated that he firmly opposes any reduction in the 6.8 billion yuan cost of European aid in the first fifteen months. But he stated that he is prepared to accept compromise suggestions on other parts of the bill, including the proposal of Vandenberg, who advocates not giving the State Department a veto power, but only giving the Secretary of State the power to make recommendations on diplomatic issues to the program administrator. Those close to Vandenberg said that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has tentatively decided to reduce the aid expenditure in the first fifteen months to 5.5 billion yuan to avoid a larger reduction.

### Two Congressional Foreign Affairs Committees Listen to Opinions from All Parties

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Former Secretary of State Acheson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the European Recovery Program is the first line of defense for US security. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is doing its best to prevent Europe's recovery, and if Western Europe can restore its ability to be self-reliant, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can also be improved. Mr. Acheson urged Congress to approve the 6.8 billion yuan cost of European aid in the first fifteen months and insisted that it should not be reduced. The "National Association of Manufacturers", which is powerful and controls most of the major industries and banks in the country, submitted written opinions to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, advocating that aid should not be given to countries that implement socialist car management policies, and advocating the establishment of a non-partisan committee, not subject to the interference of the State Department, to manage the Marshall Plan. Former Senator Lafollette, who is believed to be taking office as the general manager of the Marshall Plan, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arguing that the Marshall Plan should be managed by the State Department.

### Saar Coal Production Agreement Three Countries Have Signed

[French News Agency, Paris, 28th] According to official claims, Britain, America, and France have signed an agreement on the Saar coal mines, stipulating that 30% of the coal produced by the Saar coal mines in 1948 will be given to France as a priority. From April 1, 1949, the total annual coal production of the Saar security zone can reach 12 million tons.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] When asked what steps still need to be completed when the Saar economy is integrated into France, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry replied that not much needs to be completed. Only the general business relations between the Saar region and the outside world, especially Germany, still need to be arranged. Negotiations on this matter are in progress.

### Lebanon Proposes Establishment of Nine-Nation Committee

Assist the United Nations in Peacefully Resolving Various Disputes Among Organizations

### Japan Decides on Foreign Capital Acquisition: Formulates Policy to Prevent Foreign Manipulation, Only Accepts Loans, Does Not Welcome Investment

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Today's cabinet meeting decided on a surprising resolution regarding the policy of using foreign capital to revitalize Japan's post-war industry. The points of the resolution are as follows: 1) Accepting loans in major industrial sectors, but not welcoming foreign investment; 2) In several industries urgently needing foreign capital, the government will allow foreigners to participate in managerial positions; 3) Foreign investment must be accompanied by the import of foreign raw materials; only then will it be approved by Japan. The grade and import methods of these raw materials will be determined separately; 4) Religious, cultural, and tourism-related businesses are welcome for foreign investment, but industries of critical importance to Japan are not welcomed. Foreign observers believe that Japan, while accepting foreign capital to revive its industry, is already formulating its future economic policy. The trend of this policy is similar to that of the pre-war era, and foreign capital will be handled with extreme caution in the future to prevent other countries from controlling its industry.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to the Silk Industry Management Bureau, Japan's current raw silk production is about one-sixth of the highest production year before the war, 1930, with a monthly output of about 10,000 bales. The current standard will be maintained.

### Iraqi Anti-British Cabinet Established: Former Prime Minister Jabr Flees to Amman; Difficulties Arise in Renegotiating Anglo-Jordanian Treaty

[United Press, Baghdad, 29th] The new Iraqi cabinet has been established, with independent party member and former Senate Speaker Al-Sayed Muhammad al-Sadr as Prime Minister. The new cabinet includes many former ministers. The full list is as follows:

Minister of Interior: Matfi, Minister of Foreign Affairs: Bagji, Minister of Supplies: Hedar, Minister of Finance: Bassan, Minister of Public Works: Baban, Minister of Education: Moctar, Minister of Social Affairs: Lavee, Minister of Economy: Koba, Minister of Justice: Nasmi, Minister of Defense: Omari (named Mostafa). In addition, there are two ministers without portfolio: Omari (named Elmanat) and Farisi.

[United Press, Baghdad, 29th] Newly resigned Prime Minister Jabr, fearing arrest, has fled by plane to Amman, the capital of Transjordan. The new cabinet seems to be adopting an entirely anti-British stance, regardless of the significant oil concessions and two British air force bases that Britain possesses in Iraq. On the 27th, ten thousand Iraqis held a large anti-British demonstration, resulting in clashes, with twenty deaths and another two hundred thirty-five injuries. The Regent then declared the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty invalid, on the grounds that the treaty allowed Britain to continue using two airports in Iraq and to send troops into Iraqi territory in the event of a threat of war. The treaty was considered detrimental to Iraqi sovereignty.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Transjordan has requested the revision of the entire 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian treaty, not just the review of the military annex to the treaty, which was the original goal of the current Anglo-Transjordanian talks. It is understood that the Transjordanian delegation has submitted a new draft of the Anglo-Transjordanian treaty. Due to this development, after a meeting held today, it has been decided to postpone the meeting for two days. Although Transjordan's move was unexpected by the British side, Britain is currently trying to establish a new treaty system with the Arab world, so it is expected that Bevin will not reject Transjordan's request to revise the entire treaty outright.

### American Cats "Aid Europe":

European Rats Compete with Starving People for Food.

50,000 Cats to Be Sent to Exterminate Them.

[United Press, New York, 29th] The American Cat Society is preparing to seek 50,000 cats in thirty-nine states and Canada, as well as Costa Rica, to be shipped to Europe.

This plan was formulated because the London Daily Mirror emphasized in a front-page editorial that Europe needs millions of cats to catch the rats that are competing with the starving people of Europe for food.

The president of the Cat Society, Condan, emphatically stated: "We don't need noble cats, just ordinary cats, and so far we haven't received any generous donations from cat owners." He said that this plan must first seek the approval of the State Department's foreign distribution.

### Plans to Establish a Balkan Federation: Disagreements Among Eastern European Communist Parties; London Circles Pay Attention to Soviet Newspaper's Tone

[Reuters, London, 28th] Diplomatic circles here openly expressed their disapproval of the commentary published in the Soviet Communist Party's organ, "Pravda," on the 28th, which opposed the formation of a Balkan federation by the Balkan countries together with Poland and Czechoslovakia. The excitement felt by Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, who could be advised, was extremely great. The divisions in the historical views of Eastern European Communist Parties have been demonstrated by this. Moscow's opposition to the organization of a Slavic alliance including Poland and Czechoslovakia outside the Soviet Union has been declared in the most explicit way.

Dimitrov's deviation from the state independence policy stipulated in the declaration of the establishment of the Cominform on October 9th of last year has been openly prompted by Moscow to change his mind. Well-informed sources believe that Pravda's refusal to support Dimitrov's alteration of the Slavic federation outside the Soviet Union is based on the following reasons: 1) The Soviet Union is determined to maintain its leading position in the Pan-Slavic movement. 2) Bulgaria's hope to have the more industrially advanced Poland and Czechoslovakia participate in the Slavic Federation in order to assist the more backward southern Balkan countries is not created by the Soviet Union. 3) Moscow believes that the policies of communist countries can only be decided by Moscow. The Soviet Union is willing for the trade between Czechoslovakia and Poland to develop under Moscow's supervision, and does not want it to develop under an uncontrolled Balkan industrialization plan.

### US Establishes Air Force Base in Libya: Soviet Union Protests to Britain and the US, Accusing This Action of Violating the Italian Treaty

[United Press, London, 29th] Moscow Radio broadcast that the Soviet Union has formally protested to US Secretary of State Marshall, believing that the US's re-establishment of the Manla Air Force Base in Libya violates the treaty with Italy. The broadcast quoted a New York dispatch from TASS saying that the above protest was made on the 21st by the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin. The protest pointed out that the establishment of an air force base by the United States in a former Italian territory temporarily controlled by Britain violates the treaty. The broadcast also said that the same protest has also been made to Britain.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The US State Department stated today that it had received the Soviet Union's protest against the US's re-establishment of an air force base in Libya. It is believed that the State Department has not yet issued a response. Others said that when the United States negotiated with Italy, it fully complied with the treaty with Italy. Article 23 of the treaty with Italy stipulates that the "final disposition" of all Italian colonies, including Libya, should be jointly decided by the four powers within one year after the signing of the treaty. However, the annex stipulates that if the four powers cannot reach an agreement, the issue should be submitted to the United Nations. Since the four powers did not reach an agreement on this at the Paris conferences, they agreed that each colony should remain under British administration before a final decision is made.

### Soviet-Polish Trade Agreement Has No Political Conditions

Polish Foreign Ministry Issues Statement

[Reuters, Warsaw, 28th] A spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry said that the credit loan granted to Poland by the Soviet Union under the Soviet-Polish four-year trade agreement signed in Moscow on Monday does not have any political conditions attached. Some of the goods supplied by the Soviet Union to Poland may include military supplies, but there were no Polish military representatives present during the trade agreement negotiations. The Foreign Ministry spokesman also denied reports in foreign newspapers that the Red Army is setting up defenses on the Polish border.

She was healthy all her life, never suffering from illness, and none of her teeth fell out.

### India-Pakistan Negotiations Stalled: Security Council Continues Discussion

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 28th] After the President of the Security Council, Belgian representative Yichenhoff, continued secret consultations with representatives from India and Pakistan, he reported to the Security Council today on the progress of the negotiations so far and suggested that the issue of a plebiscite in Kashmir be immediately discussed on the Security Council's agenda. The Belgian proposal was made after India and Pakistan reached an agreement on holding a plebiscite to determine whether the people of Kashmir would like to become part of India or Pakistan; today, the Indian representative argued that the Security Council's consideration of the plebiscite issue should not precede the immediate action to end the conflict, thus causing a procedural obstacle. The Security Council is scheduled to continue discussing this issue at noon tomorrow.

### Deputy Prime Minister of Viet Minh Says Viet Minh's Strength Has Increased

[This Newspaper, Guilin, 29th] Longzhou News: At 1:00 PM on the 20th, four Vietnamese planes dropped more than 20 bombs on the sugarcane village at Nakok near the No. 1 boundary marker on the Guizhou-Vietnam border east road, and flew towards Liangshan at around 4:00 PM.

[United Press, Manila, 28th] President Roxas today signed a decree pardoning about 30 percent of the 5,000 Filipino traitors who collaborated with Japan. Those accused of espionage are not included, but this move still requires parliamentary approval.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former Secretary of the Interior Ickes today criticized Philippine President Roxas' pardon of Filipino traitors, saying: "I have always believed that Roxas collaborated with Japan during the occupation period and has therefore lost his qualification. This pardon of Filipino traitors is like pardoning himself, so there is nothing strange about this pardon when viewed in this light."

### Japanese Law and Order Gone, Train Robbed

Recently, a train robbery occurred, causing the law and order of Japan to deteriorate daily. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a train from Tokyo to Aomori was robbed by 150 bandits yesterday.

Moray -- "The Man Who Controls the President"

The London Economic Conference was certainly disappointing, but there were also a few lighter moments. Mrs. Hull and I attended a banquet given by King George of England. Beforehand, we had planned an excursion into the countryside, requiring us to leave the banquet to go several miles outside the city. I tried to make the conference successful, but I didn't have the sufficient conditions. The tension at the time made me exceptionally tired. Given the circumstances, I felt that I should rest no matter what. The banquet hosted by the King of England was attended by distinguished guests from sixty-six countries, and it was very lively. After waiting for a considerable amount of time, I felt that waiting any longer would make our trip impossible. So I suggested that my companion and I should leave quietly, without attracting anyone's attention. I could not obtain a shortcut to where the King could see me. Later, I learned that just as I left, the King sent someone to summon me, but when he learned that I was no longer there, I notified the appropriate British officials, stating that if the King agreed, I hoped to have an audience with him. I immediately received a reply expressing approval. I found the King to be very democratic. He received me sincerely and expressed his deep admiration for the American people. Then we talked about the London Conference and its objectives for about thirty minutes in a harmonious and friendly atmosphere. We agreed on the importance of the items listed on the agenda and the need to achieve appropriate resolutions for each item. The King said that he hoped to meet me again at a later stage of the conference; unfortunately, this opportunity never came.

The impasse of the conference was already showing obvious signs. It was at that time that I received news that the President was sending Moray to London as a liaison officer to inform us of the latest developments in Washington. The dramatic performance of Moray flying to President Roosevelt's yacht to see the President, as well as the various noises and speculations about Moray leaving Washington and New York, began to spread in the newspapers, as if to give people everywhere the impression that he had come to London with new instructions or a new opinion from the President, and might even take over the American delegation. For the next seven days, he was at sea, and the conference was waiting for the right moment. London newspapers published the news in large headlines, saying that Moray -- "the man who controls the President" -- was coming to London to take care of American interests there. Parisian newspapers exaggerated even more, and were extremely reckless and disrespectful to me, pointing out that I was not capable of handling the current situation for my government.

The reception for Moray was unprecedented, second only to the reception of an emperor. A delegation of senior officials, journalists, and other figures rushed impulsively to Plymouth to greet him, vying to pay their respects. After he arrived in London, he came to my office to visit me, shook hands with me, greeted me, and met with the delegation. The press hoped that he would receive reporters, so I accompanied him, but I retreated behind, and in the eyes of the journalists, Moray seemed to be the only American worth seeing. Thereafter, I rarely saw Moray, until the final crisis arrived. I decided to put all the tools he needed in his hands to see how long he could last in this situation in London.

Not long after his arrival in London, Moray conveyed a message to me, asking me to convey to the delegation that he wanted to focus on the issue of currency stabilization. He immediately began talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain and Frederick Leith-Ross, Economic Advisor to the British Treasury. It is said that the first meeting was held at the American Embassy, and Moray lingered there.

In the following days, the prime ministers, premiers, and other top officials of various countries vied to meet with Moray, as if he were a "magical piper." I continued to retreat behind, as if I were the least important person, like a burden to the conference.

One time, Prime Minister MacDonald asked me, "Can you call Moray to see me? I want to talk to him." Then he changed his mind and added, "If you like, you can come too."

A few days later, MacDonald called me in and spoke to me as if a teacher were lecturing a schoolboy. He said, "In a conference like this, it is not customary to issue statements to the press (I had issued one or two), you know? It's simply not done."

I retorted, "It's also not usually more customary for the leader of another delegation to bypass me and negotiate directly with one of my staff."

But in all respects, MacDonald was a respectable figure, extremely capable, and eloquent. He could attract attention in any group within a short time. He was a well-read scholar with an astonishing amount of general knowledge, especially concerning government.

Some major diplomatic representatives and some foreign newspapers were casually saying that Moray had come to London not only as a liaison officer but as the President's representative, endowed with full powers, to an extent even above the delegation. Moray was aware of this early on. As this news spread rapidly in England and the attitude of the European continent was distinctly unfavorable to the delegation, especially to me, Moray acted as if he fully represented the American government under the competition of various prime ministers, premiers, and high-ranking dignitaries; although he outwardly repeatedly protested and denied these factors that occupied this position.

Moray negotiated an agreement to stabilize the currency and telegraphed the President, asking him to approve it. He was so confident that the President would accept his opinion that he even notified senior officials in the British and other governments that he would meet with them at 10 Downing Street at noon on June 30. Soon, he called my hotel, earnestly requesting me to go to 10 Downing Street to sign the agreement that he believed was about to be established. I quickly and frankly refused to go, and firmly stated that as the representative of the London Conference, I was irrelevant to the issue of currency stabilization. He continued to plead, but I cut off his attempts to talk further.

This bizarre situation could not last long and was bound to end with a showdown. This performance ended with the return of a telegram from the President, in which he rejected the agreement proposed by Moray. At that time, I was preparing to leave for Revedon, and as I walked out of the door near the steps of the hotel, Moray hurried down to see me and said, "A telegram has come from Washington, which is unfavorable to currency stabilization. We must find a way."

So I glared at him. I knew that he had exhausted his skills and that everything was over. I started talking to him. I began by saying, "You should go back. First, there's nothing you should be doing here." I explained this in several aspects. Then I went to my car and went to the countryside for the weekend, because after friendly urging, I had agreed to go.

When I returned to London, the President's famous "bomb speech" had already arrived, in which he forcefully rejected Moray's currency stabilization proposal and expressed his views to the London Conference in a strong tone. The President said that if the conference allowed itself to divert its attention from broader issues to a purely artificial, temporary, experimental suggestion that would only appeal to a few countries inclined to convert, he believed that "it would be a disaster, nothing less than a world tragedy." This news caused an uproar at the conference.

Within hours of this speech arriving, Governor James M. Cox, Deputy Head of our delegation, rushed to my office; part of his job, which I had stipulated, was that he should meet with MacDonald every day. He came in a state of great excitement and said, "The British and other countries are so outraged by the President's speech that they have decided to convene a meeting of the Steering Committee at noon today, and then the Committee will convene a plenary session tomorrow, and then announce the indefinite adjournment of the conference at the plenary session. In the resolution, they will place the entire responsibility for destroying the conference entirely on the President's head."

I concentrated all my efforts on preventing this development, in order to restore calm before it reached a point of no return.

I went to see MacDonald; I sincerely urged him to revise his attitude and said something in favor of the conference continuing to be convened regularly. He said very sharply that he had no intention of doing so. He complained that the President's speech had destroyed the conference and had also destroyed his -- MacDonald's -- political position. He had originally wanted to strengthen his position through the success of the conference. I had received news that MacDonald had said in private that he might now have to resign as Prime Minister.

When the Steering Committee reopened, even if there was a slight improvement, hope was still extremely slim.

I managed to get the opportunity to speak, giving an opening speech of about twenty minutes. I held fast to my original ambition, arguing that the world's sixty-six nations had unanimously agreed on the absolute necessity of convening this conference and taking action by the conference to resolve the many financial problems that urgently needed improvement, unless the entire international community was allowed to continue to approach complete collapse.

Representatives of various countries took turns speaking, some supporting MacDonald and some supporting me. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett, Japan's Ishii, and the Swedish representative firmly supported my position. Chamberlain also agreed with my opinion.

Our arguments against adjournment were quite moving and had the power to break the Anglo-French plan. The result was so sudden that I felt as surprised as I was amazed. Even Prime Minister MacDonald deviated from his original position and acted with us in the opposite direction. After two hours of debate, the conference agreed that the conference should continue.

The following three weeks were all talk on paper, as we searched for occasional topics to discuss.

Moray returned home. Beforehand, he sent a telegram to the President, which in nature was a harsh review of the delegation. He claimed that the entire delegation had failed to represent the President at the conference, with the exception of Pittman. In fact, Pittman was one of the least contributing members. His resolution on the silver issue was an exception, but very few people were interested in it. Moray naively sent this telegram using the State Department's code, and the contents were learned by the American delegation. Every representative except Pittman hated it.

On the night of July 27, I boarded the "President Harding" to return home. Before leaving London, I received a telegram from the President: "Before you depart, I want you to know once again my love and trust for you. You have coped with great difficulties. Your spirit is commendable, and through your own courage and sincerity, you have saved the principle of continued international discussion of complex world problems from disintegration, preventing further consideration from becoming impossible. When you arrive in New York next week, I will be at Hyde Park, and I very much hope that you and Mrs. Hull will come that night."

I should state that from that time on, the President decided that he would no longer give Moray any privileges, let alone the power to govern the American delegation. This came from the President's own will. He said that his intention was only to call Moray to London as a liaison officer to bring the news that the delegation might want to obtain, and return to the United States after a few days to bring back the news that the President might want to obtain from a dedicated patriot. He told me that he was extremely shocked by the hype surrounding the news of Moray's arrival in London, and by Moray's encouragement or tacit approval of external rumors, or both, the intentions of which were obvious. The President assigned Moray some upcoming work, and within a few weeks, transferred him out of the State Department.

### Mayor Was Assaulted But Tolerantly Mediated the Tongji University Student Unrest Resolved Classes Can Resume Today Copies of Communist Propaganda Were Seized Arrested Students Await Interrogation

[Reported by this newspaper] More than a thousand students from Tongji University yesterday wanted to go to Beijing to petition. Mayor Wu was invited by the school to mediate the situation and dissuade the students from disrupting production order. Unexpectedly, he was assaulted and humiliated, causing a great disturbance. From morning to dusk, the area around Kiangse Road was heavily guarded by police and military, and remained in a state of chaos and tension throughout the day. Fortunately, despite being attacked by the students, the police and military remained patient and did not resist, preventing any bloodshed. The Mayor maintained a calm attitude throughout the incident and stated that there were obvious signs that the Communist bandits were inciting the students behind the scenes, attempting to create a bloody incident and blame the government.

The standoff between the students and the authorities lasted until 2 AM this morning before it was resolved. As a result of the negotiations, the leaders of each class pledged to persuade the students to resume classes in full this afternoon. Mayor Wu and Commander Yi left Kiangse Road at 2:05 AM this morning. In total, the Mayor remained outside Tongji University for fifteen hours to mediate the situation. At the same time, the Kanglong Winery near Tongji actually became a temporary joint office for the party, government, and military, and officials gathered there, which was unexpected.

### Students Begin to Act Military and Police Heavily Guarded

The cause of this incident was that the students' request to amend the new charter of the student union promulgated by the Ministry was not approved a month ago, and their request to withdraw the order to expel two students failed, which led to yesterday's disturbance.

On the eve of the students' plan to go to Beijing to petition, the authorities, in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, sent Police Chief Yu Shuping to the school at 2 AM in the middle of the night to dissuade them, but after talking until 3 AM, the students still insisted on their original proposal.

At about 1 AM yesterday morning, students from various colleges of Tongji began to act, and successively gathered at the Tongji Institute of Technology on Kiangse Road, and the number of people in the school gradually increased to more than 1,000. They planned to go to the North Station at 8 AM to buy tickets and take a train to Beijing to petition. At this time, students from Fudan University, Tongji Affiliated Vocational School, and the Affiliated High School also organized a "farewell group" to send them off. The military and police authorities had already patrolled and guarded the school in advance, cutting off traffic. As a result, the "farewellers" and the "petitioners" could only shout and call out to each other across the wall, and the situation gradually became tense, but the police, in addition to being stationed with sentry posts, did not move.

As the standoff continued until 10:35 AM, the students suddenly fought their way out of an unguarded side door, and the situation became more tense. The military and police immediately formed a line to stop them, with the cavalry in the front and the military and police in the rear. In an instant, they still surrounded the workers outside the school, so although the students rushed out of the school gate, they still failed to break through.

### Mayor Arrives to Persuade

At this time, the school notified the Mayor by telegram, asking him to mediate. When the Mayor arrived at Kiangse Road in response to the invitation, it was already 10:45 AM. After the Mayor got out of the car, he talked to the students, but the students were noisy and their opinions were different, and the discipline was quite chaotic. The Mayor said that he was very concerned about this incident, but according to the law, only ten representatives were allowed to petition. If the students could legally elect representatives to go to Beijing, he would be very willing to provide protection and assistance. Later, two student representatives asked the Mayor to mediate and order the withdrawal of the military and police. At this point, the situation had originally turned from tense to moderate, but unexpectedly, in the midst of continued negotiations, more than a thousand students from the law school, Guanghua, Daxia, St. John's, Shaoxing High School, Nantong College, Bu Wu, Tongde, China Women's High School, Ai Qun Women's High School, and the Affiliated High School also arrived in succession, holding flags and chanting slogans, with great momentum, which aroused the students of Tongji, and the situation became more arrogant, and shouts rang out again.

### Obtained Student Approval to Form a Five-Person Committee

At this time, Zhang Yuming, a student from the Department of Political Science, was kicked by a frightened horse. As a result, the students took advantage of this accident and shouted even more fiercely. In the chaotic situation, the military and police took the injured person to the "Kanglong Winery" near Tongji. The Mayor heard the news and went to visit him, and immediately ordered the Army Hospital to treat him. At that time, some students questioned him, and some insulted him. The Mayor immediately went outside to explain: saying that the mistake was not with the police, but because the students were rioting, causing the horse to be frightened. While talking, a large group of students suddenly rushed forward. The Mayor ignored them and immediately issued a warning to the crowd: "If the large group continues to move forward, the representatives of the student union should be responsible for any unfortunate incidents." Upon hearing this, the students eased up slightly. The Mayor continued to comfort them, and promised to mediate and absolutely uphold justice and determine right and wrong. At the same time, he also suggested forming a "five-person committee" to formally conduct mediation. The organization of the five people was that the students would elect one professor and one alumnus, the school would elect one professor and one alumnus, and the Mayor himself would jointly conduct mediation. At that time, the students immediately proposed Professor Yang Lie and alumnus Huang Boqiao. At that time, Tongji President Ding Wenyuan was hosting a reception for alumni and journalists at the Public Training Association to report on the incident. The Mayor sent someone to notify him, asking him to quickly send representatives to participate in the "five-person committee."

As the incident evolved to this point, it seemed to become clearer, and the students were also slightly quieter. The Mayor, seeing that it was past noon and he had not eaten a drop of water, went with the group of journalists present to the nearby "Kanglong Winery" to eat some noodles, and at the same time, he asked the student representatives in detail about the recent results and long-term causes of the student unrest.

As the standoff continued until 3:30 PM, Professor Yang Lie, the professor representative on the student side, reported first, but Huang Boqiao, the alumnus representative who was elected, said that he could not come due to illness. However, the school representative did not report until now. Only President Ding Wenyuan of Tongji had rushed to the City Hall to wait for the representatives to come to discuss the matter.

### The Prelude to a Big Chaos Begins Mayor Wu Was Twisted and Kicked The Mayor's Hat, Glasses, and Pipe All Lost

Just at this moment, there was a commotion in the front team, and the news came that Zhao Renbao, a sophomore from the Law School of Tongji, had been arrested. The Mayor immediately walked out of the winery to investigate, and the prelude to a big chaos began. When the Mayor arrived in front of the students, he heard the students shouting incessantly, some saying that two people had been arrested, and some saying that five or six people had been arrested. After the Mayor questioned the police, they admitted that they had captured one student, who had been sent to the police station. The Mayor immediately ordered his release, but because there was a considerable distance between the police station and the school site, it took time to go back and forth, so after waiting for a while, the students rioted again, and the large group suddenly rushed forward. The students who had been ambushed in the field next to the road had already gathered a lot of broken stones, but after hearing a shout, they saw stones flying all over the sky, falling into the military and police teams and the cavalry. The situation was chaotic for a while, the horses were frightened, and eight police officers were injured on the spot. Even a student surrounded the Mayor, first snatched the hat on his head, and then beat his head with bamboo sticks. At that time, the Mayor still planned to avoid it, but was then pulled by the students with his tie, and then strangled his neck. He fell to the ground and was kicked in the waist and legs. At this time, the Mayor was still afraid that the police officers would not be able to endure it, and still ordered the police officers not to shoot. At this critical moment, a few police officers rushed into the crowd and rescued the Mayor. But at this time, the Mayor had been robbed of his glasses and pipe, which he could not leave his body all day long, and was covered in mud and his hair was disheveled.

### Students Cause Trouble and Retreat to the School

Although the Mayor was assaulted and humiliated, he maintained a calm attitude throughout, and returned to the winery. At this time, the students knew that they had caused trouble, so they also retreated to the Institute of Technology. However, in the chaos, Gong Shaoxiong, a freshman from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tongji who was serving as a "traffic warden," was captured. He was a 20-year-old from Xiangtan, Hunan. Two reactionary propaganda documents were found in his bag, and he was immediately sent to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.

### Mayor Wu Makes a Speech to Reporters in the Winery

The Mayor made a speech to reporters in the winery, describing his experience of being assaulted and humiliated: "First, the students became impatient and began to shout 'Fight, fight' and then rushed to the police, trying to drive them away. Two of them pressed me down and beat me with bamboo sticks. I was wearing a hat, which was pulled off, and my glasses were also broken. I tried my best to prevent the police from shooting, but they shouted 'Don't let him get up.' After standing up, I immediately ordered them not to riot. If I had not been there in person, there would have been bloodshed. This move was undoubtedly instigated by the Communist bandits, who wanted to use this to create a bloody incident and blame the government. Communist propaganda was found on a student, which can be used as evidence." When asked by reporters if he could identify the murderer, the Mayor replied, "No, I don't have my glasses, I can't see everything clearly."

Soon, alumni Shu Zhendong, Qi Shao, and Jiang Yisheng arrived and reported something. The Mayor then summoned the student representatives again to talk, severely criticizing the students for intentionally creating a bloody incident and attempting to expand the chaos. It was very clear that the Communist bandits were instigating behind the scenes, and they should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. At this time, Commander Yi also heard the news and rushed to the scene and announced to the crowd: "The students' public insult to the local administrative chief is unprecedented both at home and abroad. I will strictly order them to hand over the list of culprits, otherwise they will be arrested without leniency."

### Military Police Enter Schools, Arrest and Expel Students

At that time, the mayor reiterated three conditions: 1. Resume classes immediately; 2. Hand over a list of ringleaders; 3. Hand over a list of expelled students. Student representatives returned to the school to convene a meeting to discuss a reply. After a short while, another student representative was seen leading three students claiming to be representatives from Fudan, St. John's, and Jiaotong Universities to meet the mayor, but when asked for their student IDs and what departments they were studying in, they hesitated and were unable to answer. They were then recognized by nearby students as imposters and were detained one by one.

By around 6 o'clock, the night was already dark, and Tongji University President Ding Wenyuan finally made his first appearance on Route Amoy. Presidents of various other universities also arrived one after another, all gathering in the liquor store to discuss solutions. At the same time, Li Ximou, Fang Zhi, Cao Jun, Chen Baotai, and others also rushed to the scene. At that time, no fewer than two or three hundred cars were parked along the roadside.

Thereafter, school officials shuttled between the schools and the liquor store, conveying opinions from both sides, but the students consistently provided no concrete response. Commander Yi then ordered military police to enter the school. Even at this time, university presidents and alumni repeatedly went back and forth to persuade, but with no effect. Some students shouted slogans, while others booed. After half an hour of delay, there were still no results. Commander Yi then ordered all students to be expelled from the auditorium. Unexpectedly, the students all held hands, unwilling to leave. Seeing that there was nothing they could do, the military police began to check student IDs one by one and forcibly separated them by school. In the Tongji group, the military police immediately arrested eleven students on the school's list of expelled students who were identified as leaders of this incident. It was later discovered that the list included a female student, Zhu Wenxiu, who was originally in her third year at Tongji but had suddenly voluntarily dropped back to first year. Her parents had already taken her away before the arrest. In addition, there was a male student, Huang Kelu, who had taken a year off but had suddenly participated again. Mayor Wu ordered that he be arrested as well. At that time, Tao Baichuan, Xie Renjian, Hu Jianzhong, and others also arrived to comfort the mayor and waited for news together at the Kang Long liquor store.

### Perpetrator of the Assault on the Mayor Discovered

A worker from a certain factory was discovered on the Tongji campus masquerading as a student. It was said that he was also there to participate in this incident. At the same time, a partially incomplete sheet of paper was found near a young man named Zhang who was posing as a Fudan student. The top part of the page seemed to have been torn off, and the bottom part had the following written in pen: "... Strengthen party spirit, discuss the Outline of the Land Law. (2) Work: (A) Strengthen leadership of the Rice Society, resolutely develop it, and make it the core work within the Torch Society. (B) Strengthen education in the Torch Society as a solid foundation." According to investigation reports, no students from Hujiang or Jinda Universities participated, but surprisingly, the school flags of Hujiang and Jinda Universities, as well as the flag of Mayor Ou's Qu Yuping (photographed by this newspaper) were in the procession when the incident occurred. At around 11 o'clock, military police discovered a student named Qu Yuping in the column of Tongde Medical College. He was identified by most people as one of the four students who assaulted Mayor Ou. After being briefly interrogated by the mayor, he was temporarily detained. The mayor repeatedly instructed that he be treated well and not be subjected to retaliation.

### Military Police Who Worked Hard Will Be Commended

After 12 o'clock, Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, Director Yu, and others moved from the liquor store to a classroom in Tongji University, where they asked President Ding to summon all the class representatives of Tongji University for a lecture. At the same time, Wang Ruihan, commander of the Second Unit of the Police Bureau's Security Corps, and Du Kaixun, squad leader, were summoned. Du, upon seeing the mayor being assaulted by students, was filled with righteous indignation and wanted to personally lead his men to rescue the mayor with guns, but was stopped by Wang Tang's scolding, narrowly averting bloodshed. The mayor expressed his deep gratitude for their sense of justice and loyalty, and indicated that the municipal government would provide special rewards to all personnel who observed discipline and made thorough arrangements. At the same time, the mayor expressed great anger that many middle school students had participated in this incident, and it was heard that he would investigate the middle schools that failed to provide adequate supervision and would impose severe penalties on the principals.

At 1:10 AM this morning, all the class representatives of Tongji University gathered to listen to instructions. The mayor indicated that he was not angry about the incident, but deeply saddened. It was discovered that some students were sent from Tsinghua University in Peiping to participate (the student's name was Chen Mingkang), which proves that the conspiracy behind the scenes to cause bloodshed was obvious. The good students were used by them and blindly acted impulsively, violating faith and justice. The mayor repeatedly explained that to love the country, one must first study and not cause trouble by gathering crowds. Finally, he stated that, apart from those who should be arrested and interrogated according to law in the future, if the other students could provide letters of repentance and accept persuasion, they could resume classes immediately and he would absolutely guarantee their studies and safety. Subsequently, Commander Yi offered conciliatory advice and conveyed to all students that their studies were the most important thing, and that they should peacefully resume classes immediately, and the government would do its best to protect them. Finally, Wu Zhaotang, Director of Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education, and President Ding explained that the Ministry of Education had sent Vice Minister Hang by night train to Shanghai, bringing with him a disbandment order. The authorities would not tolerate any further delay and would immediately dismiss Tongji University.

### Resolved Satisfactorily at 2 AM This Morning

After much persuasion, the class representatives expressed their willingness to take responsibility for persuading the students to resume classes, and wrote a promissory note for President Ding, which read: "We express our regret for the incident that occurred today and are willing to use our positions as class representatives to do our best to convey and persuade the students in each class to resume classes." It was signed by the class representatives: Huang Weide, Zhou Guangqi, Huang Rulin, Zhang Youzhen, Yin Shijie, He Genwu, Zheng Kangnian, Tao Dingguo, Chen Yinqi, Xue Xue, Lin Shigao, Zhang Lai, Zhang Xu, Ma Renbiao, and others.

President Ding took the promissory note to report to the mayor. Wu believed that a date should be added and personally instructed the class representatives. Initially, they hesitated and were unwilling to take this responsibility, but finally added a parenthetical note after the original text, stating "Resume classes as much as possible starting on the afternoon of the 30th." This student disturbance, which had been delayed for a long time with many twists and turns, was thus resolved. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, and others left the school and returned to their residences, at 2:05 AM this morning. Students from each school were checked by the schools and led back.

### Fourteen Students from Tongji, St. John's, and Fudan Arrested

Communist Publications Confiscated on the Spot

In addition, the students arrested yesterday who were identified as ringleaders included: Yu Shaoluo, Chen Wenjian, Zhang Jing'er, Wu Hong, Sun Renyuan, Huang Jingchun, Wang Shaoji, Zhang Zezhi, Su Wo‚Äôheng, Zhao Renbao, Zhang Hongnian from Tongji; Wang Zhenhe and Tang Xingbo from St. John's; and Bin Kehong from Fudan, totaling fourteen students. Among them, Pei Shaoxiong, a native of Xiangtan, Hunan, 20 years old, was a freshman in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tongji. Two magazines issued by the Communist Party in Hong Kong, "Welcoming the New Year" (Issue 49) and "European Travel Notes" (Issue 50), were found on his person. He was sent to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation, and the rest were handed over to the Police Headquarters for detention.

### Various Circles to Visit the Mayor This Afternoon

Mayor Wu was assaulted by a few ringleaders who incited the student unrest, and various leaders in the city, upon hearing this, expressed extreme indignation and decided to gather at the City Council at 11 AM this morning to meet Mayor Wu and offer their sincere condolences.

### Second Day of Tuberculosis Prevention Conference: Committees Split into Groups for Discussion

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association continued its meeting yesterday morning at the Chengzhong Sanitarium in Jiangwan and in the afternoon at the First Pulmonary Hospital in Hongqiao. The research, standards, finance, publication, and anti-tuberculosis fundraising committees of the association split into groups for discussion, and each group reached resolutions. In addition, the Research and Standards Committee held a joint meeting and resolved: 1. One scholarship to study tuberculosis prevention in England, funded by the British United Aid to China Fund (BUAC), will be awarded. Branch associations in Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Taiwan will be asked to nominate candidates, which will be submitted to the General Association for review and then approved by the BUAC before being sent to England. 2. The BUAC will be asked to fund two research scholarships for tuberculosis prevention each year.

After the meeting, Yan Huiqing, President of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, hosted a dinner for the representatives at the First Pulmonary Hospital. From 8 PM to 10 PM, the Tuberculosis Committee of the Chinese Medical Association held an academic lecture on tuberculosis prevention, with Yuan Yijin, Qiu Zuyuan, and Lauli giving lectures.

From 9 AM to 12 PM this morning, the directors and supervisors of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association will meet at the YMCA to elect honorary directors and review the work plans of each committee. At noon, the medical schools of Aurora University and St. John's University will host a luncheon at the Hongren Hospital. From 2 PM to 4 PM in the afternoon, there will be group discussions, and the press will be invited. At 4:30 PM, the Pasteur Institute will serve refreshments, and Mayor Wu will host a banquet at his official residence at 7:30 PM.

### Second Round of Rationed Cooking Oil for Each District, Unsold from Previous Years, Expected to Be Available Soon; 12 Liang for 15,000 Yuan Regardless of Type

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee held its tenth meeting yesterday morning. The agenda items were as follows: 1. The second round of comprehensive cooking oil rationing will be sold at a price of 15,000 yuan for 12 liang, regardless of the type of oil. The deficit will be submitted to the central government for subsidies. Oil purchase certificates will be distributed to each district starting today, and it is expected that the oil will be rationed before the end of the old year. 2. The remaining 1,403 dan and 76 jin of oil from the first round of rationing, which are currently stored in various retail stores, will be included in the second round of ration quotas.

### Food Rice Ration Price to Be Adjusted

3.  Due to insufficient supply of coal balls for workers in the second round of rationing, it was temporarily impossible to begin. Now, 100,000 dan have been produced and delivered to the meeting. All labor unions that have applied for wage calculation based on the cost of living index within the specified period will begin to be verified and allocated. 4. The price of food rice allocated by the Allocation Committee has not been changed since it was approved in June of last year. It was originally calculated at 60% of the market price at the time of issuance, with Burmese rice at 240,000 yuan per shi and broken rice at 168,000 yuan per shi. The current allocation price differs too much from the market price and will be adjusted starting this January, calculated at 60% of the market price for that month.

### Bookstore Manager Arrested for Hoarding Paper

The Municipal Police Bureau, based on a tip-off, discovered that the Wan Ye Bookstore at 39 Binqing Lane, Tiantong Road, was hoarding large quantities of paper. Yesterday morning, they dispatched economic police to investigate and found 100 reams of cover paper, 957 reams of newsprint, and a quarter of a ton of Maobian paper. The manager, Qian Juntao, was arrested and taken back for questioning.

### Extradition of Xu Jizhuang Problematic; Hong Kong Authorities Allow Bail Release; Our Lawyer Strives Without Success, Continued Hearing Scheduled for Next Week

[Reported by our Hong Kong correspondent on the 29th] Regarding the extradition of former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Xu Jizhuang, after his arrest, the Hong Kong Central Court heard opinions from all parties this morning. The judge allowed Xu Jizhuang to be released on bail after paying a cash deposit of HK$1 million, and a continued hearing will be held in one week. The amount of the bail deposit has broken records. The lawyer representing our government, Xian Bingxi, strongly opposed it in court, arguing that Xu might flee to Saigon or Macau, but to no avail. Xu was ultimately released on bail and smiled. Xu's concubine, Wang Baimei, looked troubled upon hearing that the bail was HK$1 million and is currently raising the funds. She carried an English novel, "A Tale of Two Cities," intending to give it to Xu, but was unsuccessful. Xu wore a gray suit today and looked haggard. The hearing lasted approximately 20 minutes, and Xu's defense lawyer, Marcus Da Silva, argued fiercely with our lawyer, Xian. It is rumored that Xue will receive HK$20,000 in public funds this time. After the adjournment, Xue Erwa stated that it was still questionable whether Xu Jizhuang could raise the huge sum of bail money.

### Accused of Election Fraud, Old Zhabei District Head Defends Against False Accusations and Denies Claims of Lard-Mixed Paste

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Guozhang, an assistant in the Old Zhabei District Office, witnessed instances of fraud during the recent Legislative Yuan election and yesterday filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against the district head of the district, Li Ruchun, and the head of the civil affairs department, Yu Qingjia, for election fraud. The District Prosecutor's Office opened a court investigation yesterday morning, with plaintiff Chen Guozhang, defendants Li Ruchun and Yu Qingjia, and related parties Deputy District Head Wang Chenghiong and election supervisor Ren Bozhang present.

According to Chen, the Old Zhabei District had a voting population of just over 10,000 people, but more than 50,000 ballots were cast. He also claimed that lard-mixed paste was used to reduce the stickiness of the seals on the ballot boxes, which were then sent to the district office where the seals were removed and ballots were inserted. The next morning, the seals were re-sealed, resulting in a surge in ballots. Li and others vehemently denied the accusations, stating that the district had more than 80,000 residents and only 50,000 people voted, which was far from the actual numbers. The claim of lard-mixed paste was completely false. After the interrogation, the court ruled that Li Ruchun should be released on bail, which was paid on the spot by Deputy District Head Wang Chenghiong, while the others were ordered to return.

In addition, Zhang Jun and Mao Pingshao, administrators of the North Station polling station, yesterday filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against Senator Pan Jiemei, who is also the principal of Municipal Central Fifteenth District Central National Primary School, election supervisor Yang Guangming, and Lu Huimin, Zhu Chunyu, Zhao Xudong, and others, for five charges: assault, intimidation, infringement of freedom, obstruction of election, and endangering public safety.

### Tenants Discuss Effective Countermeasures as Rent Is Calculated Based on Index

Recently, some companies and stores on Nanjing Road who continue to lease properties from the British company, Hardoon Limited, have received notices indicating that starting from the month of contract signing, monthly rent must use the monthly rent in the 26th year as a base and increase monthly according to one-fifth (for those without subletting) or one-quarter (for those with subletting) of the workers' cost of living index. Upon receiving these notices, the first month's rent was found to have increased by a staggering 13,640 to 17,050 times the previous monthly rent, causing alarm. After investigation, the Civil Code regarding leasing, Chapter 3 of the Land Law regarding housing and land rental, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Housing Rental Management, and the Housing Rental Regulations promulgated by the National Government on December 1, 1936, all have strict regulations regarding the increase or decrease of rent, and landlords must not arbitrarily exceed the scope of the law. It is reported that the companies and stores believe that Hardoon Limited's demand disregards our country's laws and is inconsistent with the general practice of adjusting rent. They are currently devising effective countermeasures.

### Coal Briquette Retail Price at 300,000 per Load: Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Adopt Negotiated Price System for Market Price

[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau believes it is inappropriate for coal briquette merchants to arbitrarily adjust market prices, turning defeat into victory.  It has decided to adopt a negotiated price system. The Social Affairs Bureau will provide a program to automatically calculate coal briquette price lists. If the prices of raw materials and labor listed therein change, coal merchants can adjust the price according to the program and implement it after reporting to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.

The Price Evaluation Committee's Fuel Subcommittee held its 18th evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. It initially reviewed the selling price of coal briquettes and decided that the coal briquette factory price for self-pickup is 5.2 million per ton, and the retail price is 300,000 per load, effective immediately.

The meeting also approved the automatic adjustment calculation program for coal briquette price lists provided by the Social Affairs Bureau. The base price of coal briquettes for factory pickup will be discussed at the next meeting. In addition, regarding the third phase of industrial worker coal briquette production and distribution, it was decided to hold a meeting to design and implement the plan after the Fuel Management Committee's raw materials arrive.

### Visiting the Elite Fifth Army

[Our Report from Kaifeng, 22nd] This time, in order to relieve Liu Bocheng, who was besieged by the National Army in the Dabie Mountains and was in imminent danger, the bandit leader Chen Yi, taking advantage of the National Army's weak forces in Henan, personally led a force of 100,000 to infiltrate Tongxu, Chenliu, Weishi, and Zhuxianzhen from the area north of Minquan and east of Qixian last month, forming a fan-shaped encirclement around Kaifeng. He attempted to seize the key military strongholds of Bian and Zheng, which the National Army would never abandon, without any effort. Even if he could not succeed, the pressure on the Dabie Mountains could be reduced. If he succeeded by chance, the overall situation in the Central Plains would be completely changed. This conspiracy, like a violent storm, began to attack this sandy city on the afternoon of December 12th. At that time, Bian was indeed very empty, and the military strength was frighteningly weak. As a result, there were rumors and alarms, and several scares in one night. Then, Lanfeng, Luowang, and Xinglong in eastern Bian, and Shanmou, Shaogang, and Xinghuaying in western Bian, all fell into the hands of the bandits. All external transportation and communications were completely cut off. Although the National Army's strong forces had been stationed in the city walls since the afternoon of the 13th, strengthening the city's defenses, the spies had already infiltrated outside the embankment, and the sound of cannons was deafening, and the situation was extremely critical. At this time, hundreds of thousands of citizens of Bian, under the common fear of death, mobilized to assist the National Army in strengthening the city's defenses, while silently praying for the arrival of the chasing troops day and night. "The new Fifth Army, which is stabilizing the Central Plains, is advancing westward from Zhecheng."

This news, like a spring breeze, rippled through the frozen sandy city, rippling in the trembling hearts of hundreds of thousands of citizens. However, "only the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one coming down!" One day, two days passed, and this spring breeze was still frozen by the cold current. Hundreds of thousands of gentry and people were still immersed in the abyss of terror. The new Fifth Army, this powerful mechanized unit, famous internationally and most feared by the Communists, had no news at all. The sandy city became a dead city, and a cloud of terror shrouded the sky above this sandy city.

Suddenly, from the afternoon of the 17th, the Communists outside Kaifeng stopped their attacks and fled south in droves. This historic city had a "scare but no injury." What was going on? Some said that this was due to the prestige of the city defense forces, resulting in the "Jiang Taigong is here, all gods retreat" effect. Some said that the bandits were feinting to the east and attacking the west, and seeing that Bian and Zheng were difficult to capture, they had fled to various strongholds along the Pinghan Railway and had already gained considerable advantages, so they abandoned Bian and Zheng and fled southeast. Both of the above statements are not without reason, but the most important thing is that the Fifth Army was pressing down on their backs with the force of a thunderbolt, digging out their heart and lungs (eliminating their most elite Sixth and Eighth Columns in the Suiqi area during the westward advance), making them panic-stricken and afraid to linger in the Bian-Zheng-Xu triangle area, and hastily retreating south.

### Lonely Wilderness, Tanks Galloping

The warm sunshine shone again on this windy and sandy city, and the heavy cloud of terror that was pressing on the hearts of every citizen also dissipated. Laughter was once again on the faces of every citizen, and the sound of comforting the troops resounded throughout the city. The soldiers defending the city, with their firm and persistent defense in the frozen wilderness, earned the heartfelt respect and gratitude of the citizens. Everyone slaughtered pigs and cattle toÊÖ∞Âãû them, and they deserved it.

The Fifth Army, which directly relieved the siege of Kaifeng, was far away in the bandit area, hundreds of miles away. All sectors of Bian were anxiously unable to go to „ÄÄÂãû. Fortunately, Deputy Adjutant Liu of the Fifth Army led a batch of tanks and more than a hundred trucks to Bian on the 20th to collect supplies. He often invited me to go and see them together. I was also happy to visit this elite army that I had long heard of. So, after Deputy Adjutant Liu left, Chairman Liu telegraphed Director Wu of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Speaker Liu of the Provincial Assembly, and telegraphed Commissioner Qi of the Provincial Government to ask him to represent Chairman Liu to go to the Provincial Government to gather and comfort the new Fifth Army. At 12:30, I, Director Yan, Commissioner Qi, Speaker Liu representing Councilor Kong, and Director Yuan Maoju of the Security Department, etc., five people, carrying three hundred million banknotes, took two jeeps, led by a large tank sent by Deputy Adjutant Liu in front, and four armed trucks in the rear, left the sandy city and set off for a certain place northwest of Qixian, east of Chenliu and Tongxu.

Along the way, there were still Communists wandering around the day before. Although we were wary, we did not hesitate. However, seeing the field fortifications everywhere, we could not help but be shocked. Most of the villages, large and small, were deserted, and the broken houses and thatched huts had no doors or windows. The desolate scene after the war cannot be described by those who have not experienced it personally. The tanks, like fierce tigers, galloped across the lonely wilderness in the setting sun, further showing that the atmosphere of war still shrouded this land. There were trenches and obstacles everywhere, but the tanks ignored everything and flattened them all. Seeing that there was no way to go, the tanks naturally made a road wherever they went, charging left and right, opening roads through mountains and making bridges over water. In this way, we were led by the tanks through deserted villages and wilderness, deep into the old nest of the Communists yesterday. At about 5:30 in the afternoon, we jumped out of the car, brushed off the dust, and shouldered the enthusiasm of hundreds of thousands of people, and entered the village we were going to.

### Recognizing Heroes in Desolate Village Huts

This is a very small and extremely desolate village, and in this small village lives the headquarters of the famous Fifth Army, and General Qiu Qingquan, whom we have long admired and have no chance to meet. Speaking of the Fifth Army (commonly known as the New Fifth Army), this is an internationally famous unit with a glorious history. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was the 200th Division, with the best equipment, the best training, and the best combat effectiveness. At that time, they were sent as the Expeditionary Force. In the Indian-Burmese theater, they fought alongside the Allies many times, and their fame shook the world from then on. Their glorious achievements are everywhere on the battlefields of India and Burma. After the restoration, they were transferred from the southwest to the capital. Soon, they were transferred to the east to suppress the„ÄÄ. At that time, the Communists were arrogant and did not take them seriously at all. However, the Communists' attitude of„ÄÄ contempt for everything was well taught by the Fifth Army this time. They no longer dared to underestimate the Fifth Army, and even felt a little fear in their hearts. From then on, the Fifth Army pointed its spears north and has been suppressing the Communists in the border areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu. There has never been a record of defeat in their battle history. Now, the Communists have openly discussed the topic of "how to eliminate the fragile psychology of fearing the Fifth Army" in every small group discussion. General Qiu Qingquan, who leads the Fifth Army, is even more of a„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄfamous general, a top student of the„ÄÄ„ÄÄsecond term of the military academy, and a graduate of the German Army University. He can write poetry, songs, and fu, and he can repel enemies thousands of miles away. He can kill bandits on horseback and write memorials when he dismounts. General Qiu is indeed a rare talent among modern soldiers. This unit, full of glory, and this dazzling victorious general live in this desolate „ÄÄdeserted little village, and we can immediately put it in, which is indeed a very happy thing.

The village„ÄÄ everywhere are tanks and ammunition. The engines of countless trucks are roaring like a great wind. The war horses are also constantly neighing. There is no sense of terror here, only a sense of tension and excitement. Deputy Adjutant Liu led us into a dilapidated and dirty small courtyard. There are only three small thatched huts in this courtyard. There are no doors on the doors, and each hangs a military blanket. The windows are blocked with cattail mats. In the midst of the noise, the door curtain of the east room was opened, and a thick smoke of burning firewood poured out, followed by a military officer who was not tall, not handsome, in his forties, wearing a yellow cotton uniform. Through Deputy Adjutant Liu's introduction, we learned that he was Commander Qiu, whom we had long admired. This general, this internationally renowned general, not only did not have a chest full of medals, but was as sincere and approachable as a common soldier. He was very grateful for our enthusiasm. He treated us as warmly as a countryman would treat distinguished guests. He was obviously very flustered. The room was full of thick smoke, and a few bricks formed a stove, with a few pieces of firewood burning. There were no seats and no tables. He apologized that the place was very sorry for the guests. But when we saw this famous general, who was working hard for the country, living such a hard life in this severe cold, we felt that he was more respectable and lovable. With the most sincere attitude, everyone represented the enthusiasm of all sectors of Bian, expressing their condolences and gratitude to him and all the soldiers. He was very grateful, offering smoke and tea, and was busy with joy.

In gratitude, he reported to everyone the course of the great victory on the way west from Henan: He said, "This army was originally ordered by the highest authorities to go to the Shenqiu-Xiangcheng-Xincai area to complete another task. However, after receiving the order, we immediately detected that Chen Yi's bandit troops had an attempt to invade Bian and Zheng. We immediately telegraphed the superiors to report the new situation and resolutely took action, directly advancing westward from Yongcheng via Bozhou, Luyi, and Zhecheng. This is because Bian and Zheng are the political and military centers of the Central Plains and must not be lost. Moreover, the Communists have always avoided fighting this army. This westward advance will not only relieve the siege of Bian and Zheng, but also find their main force and fight a happy battle. Chen Yi happened to discover that we were advancing westward at full speed, so he sent his most elite Sixth and Eighth and First-Class Columns to stop us in turn. When a part of our army advanced to Baimiao, Hedi, and Cen, south of Qian County, we came into contact with their Sixth Column. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the Sixth Column was completely defeated, and only a few remnants fled southeast. After the Sixth Column suffered a disastrous defeat, the Eighth Column came up. This was an unprecedentedly tragic war. As a result, the Eighth Column also suffered the same fate as the Sixth Column in the same area, and the remnants fled north of Minquan. Finally, they even brought up the Eleventh Column, which was vulnerable to a single blow. In just one night, they completely collapsed. In total, they suffered more than 20,000 casualties this time. Their 18th Division Commander was also killed, and more than 2,000 were captured. The weapons and horses are still being inventoried. We also suffered more than 500 casualties, and even company commanders and tank platoon leaders were killed or wounded. But in the final analysis, we got too much cheap. A few days ago, the highest standing committee issued an order, believing that our change of plan this time had quickly relieved the siege of Bian and Zheng and that the disposal was very appropriate. There are no bandit traces within dozens of miles nearby. We moved into this place yesterday. Although the bandits between Bian and Zheng fled because they felt threatened, we still cannot relax our guard. As long as there is no loophole to exploit, we will definitely kill all these mice." General Qiu reported the course of the battle with a flourish of gestures and a majestic momentum. After the report, it was already late. Although the host had the intention of keeping guests, the guests knew that the host had unspeakable difficulties. Everyone stood up to say goodbye, and I really felt a little reluctant. Seeing this situation, General Qiu wanted to talk to me again, and perhaps felt that keeping one guest to sleep over might not be a problem, so he insisted on keeping me for one night. The four people who came with me also hoped that I would stay overnight to discuss the unfulfilled intentions of everyone, and to collect more of their heroic and moving deeds. I was also happy to do so. So, in the twilight, they were protected by tanks and left in a puff of smoke. (Reporter Wang Shoumei)

### Li Xuelu's Tragic Case Opens Trial Yesterday, Accusers Kowtow to Seek Justice

[Our Report from Jintan, 29th] In the case of the murder of Vice Speaker Li Xuelu of Jintan, the District Court ordered bailiff Hu Yuanqing to take the defendant Yuan Wenbin's wife, Yuan Wu, to the Zhixi Bridge Tianliang Office and Yuan's father-in-law Wu Kun's home on the 22nd to search for 23 important letters related to the case. At 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, Judge Fang Xianjie still served as the presiding judge and opened the court to investigate and try the case. The audience was very crowded. All the original defendants appeared in court on time to answer questions. The accuser, Li Zhirui, was the deceased's great-uncle and grandfather, and he cried bitterly and kowtowed in court, begging for justice for the deceased. Defendant Yuan Wenbin submitted to the court a letter from Yuan from the detention center to his wife, asking her to collude and frame the others. After reading it, Yuan admitted that he had written it himself. Next, defendants Luo Jiannong, Yuan Xiping, Chang Guoying, and Jing Demao were brought up for interrogation one by one, and the letters between each person and Yuan were reviewed separately. Because the language in the letters was secretive and contained many secret codes, the defendants still stubbornly denied and argued that they had nothing to do with the case. The trial of the entire case lasted for four hours, and the facts of the case have gradually become clear. The court ordered a retrial at a later date. The defendants' request for bail was denied and they were returned to custody.

### Western Night Tales: A New Utopia Discovered in Hezhou County, Gansu

[Airmail from Lanzhou, 24th] A Utopia discovered in Hezhou County, Gansu. It turns out that there was an "Old Rent" in the Chengguan Town of the county, which was under the jurisdiction of the Han Tusi during the Qing Dynasty. Since the government changed the indigenous leadership and appointed Han Chinese officials, the area has been under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province (because the Han Tusi was under the jurisdiction of Xunhua, Qinghai during the Qing Dynasty, so it should also be under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province after the change of leadership). Later, in order to delineate the boundaries, the Qinghai Provincial Government exchanged it with the Xixiang of Linxia with the Gansu Provincial Government. Xixiang of Linxia was under the jurisdiction of Qinghai Province, but the authorities in Gansu Province did not manage the "Old Rent" of Hezhou. From the victory of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, the people in this area have never fulfilled any national obligations such as paying taxes or serving in the military, just like living in a Utopia.

Yongchang County, Gansu, suffered a severe drought and freezing disaster in the summer and autumn of last year, and the crops failed to produce any harvest. Most farmers sold their family property to make a living. After the severe winter arrived, they had nothing left to sell. The old and young went out together to flee to Ningxia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other places. Ten days ago, two families of more than ten people each from Wulong Township wanted to cross the Qiyun Mountains to Qinghai to find food. When they reached a place called Xuetaiban, they encountered heavy snow and biting north winds. These more than twenty people all died on the way due to hunger and cold. Later, they were discovered by travelers. Dozens of bodies were hugging each other, stiff and pressed under the accumulated snow, a very tragic sight. It is also heard that the county government of the county believes that the disaster is too severe and it is difficult to collect public food taxes. It only collected about half of the taxes. In order to achieve the assessment of the superiors, the person in charge of the Tianliang Office of the county recently „ÄÄÂ§ßÊ≠§Âì°„ÄÄ, so-called "Sweeping Collection Team," to go to various townships to collect taxes. Farmers who cannot pay taxes are also included in the collection of cattle, sheep, and horses.

Taoist Li Xingwu, 37 years old, from Wuwei, Gansu, is engaged in bone reading and fortune-telling in Lanzhou. In December last year, Chai Junyu, the wife of a citizen of the city, Cheng Wanzhong, went to Li Laodao's place for bone reading. Chai was naturally frivolous and Li was also an experienced philanderer. They hit it off immediately and had a secret meeting at No. 24 Zuogong West Road on December 7 last year. They were caught by the police station, who confiscated their hats, belts, and pants. Li Laodao was released on bail. After Cheng learned of this, he divorced Chai Junwang. Li Laodao actually kept her in a golden house and forgot to return. The matter was discovered by a reporter from the Northwest Daily and recorded. Li believed that this news was provided by Chai's ex-husband Cheng Wanzhong, obviously wanting to damage his reputation, so he sued the Gaolan Local Court. The local court held a public trial on the 19th of this month, and the audience was packed. This case is scheduled to be sentenced on the 23rd.

The climate in Minle County, Gansu, is extremely cold this winter, the most severe in the entire province. However, since New Year's Day this year, the climate has suddenly turned warm, with a spring-like scene. The grass in the sunny places near the county government is green, about an inch long. It is a truly rare thing to find green grass in the depths of winter, something that has not been seen in decades. (Reporter Song Lin)

### Mr. Cazanave, Consultant of Sichuan-Xikang Project, Talks about Construction

[Airmail from Chongqing, 26th] The French have always been interested in Sichuan's economic construction. Although Mr. Feyeux, the representative of the Far East Economic Delegation stationed in Chongqing and the engineer of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, was recalled to his country because the signing of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was far away, Mr. Cazanave, who has been living in Chengdu for more than two years, still talks about the Sino-French cooperation in developing Sichuan's resources with great interest and without any discouragement.

Mr. Cazanave is the representative of the Far East Economic Delegation stationed in Chengdu. After Mr. Feyeux left Chongqing, he took over all the work and often traveled between Chengdu and Chongqing. This short Parisian is a water conservancy and irrigation expert and has a deep friendship with Sichuan Chairman Deng Xihou and Xikang Chairman Liu Wenhui. Therefore, his Chinese business card has a line that he considers to be quite honorable: Engineering Consultant of the Sichuan and Xikang Provincial Governments.

First, he told our reporter: "Of course, the French are most concerned about the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, because all construction investments are completely based on the „ÄÄ ÂÖà„ÄÄcondition of convenient transportation.„ÄÄ Yes, the delay in signing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway cannot affect other aspects of the project.

According to our reporter, French economists are very concerned about the salt industry in Zigong. Mr. Cazanave has visited Zigong „ÄÄÂØü several times and signed a „ÄÄ‰πãÊ≠• contract with Sichuan Salt Company. In February last year, the French government „ÄÄÊÑè hired Professor Porlni to come to Sichuan for investigation. Professor Porlni is a famous geologist and petroleum expert in France, in his fifties, and currently teaches at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. It is reported that the report is still being compiled.

When the reporter asked him: "Mr. Cazanave, since you are the engineering consultant of Sichuan and Xikang provinces, can you tell us what suggestions you have for Chairmen Deng and Liu?"

He replied very frankly: Sixty kilometers upstream from Guanxian County is Xingwanping. According to his months of investigation, it is suitable for building a 100,000-horsepower power plant. He has written a report as thick as three inches and sent it to Deng Xihou for reference. It is reported that the Sichuan Provincial Government is rushing to translate it, and it will be sent to the Resources Committee for consultation as soon as it is translated.

Mr. Cazanave's „ÄÄË∂≥Ë∑°ÈÅçË∏è Sichuan and Xikang provinces. He is also a traveler. The only thing he feels at „ÄÄÂÆâ„ÄÄ is: his suggestion to Chairman Liu Wenhui to build a power plant on the Kangding River is now beginning to take shape.

The Kangding River is twenty-five kilometers long, and the water flows from Gaoyan Ï∂© to the bottom, totaling one thousand meters, which is indeed the most ideal place to build a power plant. Liu Wenhui has accepted Mr. Cazanave's„ÄÄ whole „ÄÄ opinion: building three plants along the Kangding River, each with 50,000 horsepower, 300 meters apart. According to reports, Liu has sent the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government to Beijing to ask for instructions. If the negotiation fails, Liu will decide to invest privately.

After Mr. Mu, the head of the Far East Economic Delegation, returned to Shanghai from the Philippines, he went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss with Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs. The content is confidential. Our reporter got a clue from Mr. Cazanave's casual conversation. Mr. Cazanave „ÄÄ said: Both the Chinese and French governments do not have a large amount of US dollars. Instead of using US dollars to „ÄÄcalculate Sino-French„ÄÄ's foreign raw material loans, it is more convenient to exchange goods directly. If the Mu-Chen talks are successful this time, there is a glimmer of hope for the signing of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. (Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)

### Recent Situation in Ningxia and Eastern Gansu

[This Newspaper Lanzhou 13th Dispatch] Mr. Deng Chungao, the Supervising Commissioner of Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, has recently inspected Qinghai, Hexi, Ningxia, and eastern Gansu in the past six months. He traveled tirelessly and without rest. After returning to Lanzhou, he met with reporters. In a very short time, the reporter asked him to express his observations on Ningxia and eastern Gansu.

He first talked about the provincial administration of Ningxia, believing that Ningxia's provincial administration has indeed made considerable progress. For example, household registration is the most difficult to manage well, but in Ningxia, the investigation, registration, and changes of the population, combined with a sound police system, have made the local public security very peaceful. Without an "identification card," it can be said that it is difficult to move an inch, and the communists have no opportunity to operate. Although Ningxia cannot compare with Gansu and Qinghai provinces, it is moving towards an ideal state day by day. The general public's knowledge level is also gradually improving. All counties have established county central elementary schools. Mongolian children in Alxa League's Dingyuanying are receiving compulsory education. In fact, these Mongolian compatriots, in addition to devoutly worshiping religion and sending their children to temples to become lamas, are rarely willing to send their children to study Chinese books. It is necessary to force them. Darhan Wang (i.e., Darizhaya) has made great efforts in popularizing education.

Ningxia's canals are crisscrossed, and its water conservancy projects are no less than those of Shaanxi in the northwest provinces. The harvest has been very good in recent years, and it can achieve the ideal of "sufficient food." Only two counties have suffered poor harvests due to waterlogging and drought, but the authorities have already handled relief matters. Ningxia has widely planted trees, and its achievements are also improving rapidly. Regarding the pacification zone in eastern Gansu, he said that a month ago it was already

Peaceful and Quiet: Only Huanxian still has a small number of communists lurking. The 82nd Division of the National Army is stationed in this area, with sufficient military strength and strict discipline. Commander Ma Yuan, who is stationed in Xifengzhen, in addition to military preparedness, also pays attention to assisting local education, construction, and comforting refugees, so he is enthusiastically supported by the local people. The rear hospitals in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, and the rear hospitals in Pingliang's Xifengzhen are relatively well-equipped. Recently, due to the smooth progress of the war, there are not many wounded soldiers in each hospital. Regarding the

Relief Work in Eastern Gansu: In addition to the central government allocating 300 million yuan in emergency relief funds to Qingyang, Heshui, and other six counties, the Gansu Provincial Government also raised more than 100 million yuan, plus more than 80 shi of yellow millet (grain) to handle emergency relief. The recent work relief projects in various counties utilize those among the refugees who have the ability to work, using work relief methods to repair the Qing (yang) Huan (xian), Qing (yang), and He (shui) highways in order to facilitate military transportation and reduce the burden on the people invisibly. The Gansu Provincial Government's proposed reconstruction plan for the Eastern Gansu Pacification Zone has great hope for the region if it can be promoted step by step.

After Deng finished talking about the situation in these two places, he comprehensively expressed his

Inspection Feelings: He believes that the official governance of our country has not yet reached a completely clear stage, and the task of the supervising commissioner is still quite important. The mission of supervision, in addition to passively eliminating corruption and malfeasance, should also strive to improve the service spirit and morality of public officials in order to increase administrative efficiency.

Supervising Commissioner Deng is from Xunhua, Qinghai, and

Serving His Hometown is his ambition. He is of medium build, with solid muscles, does not smile easily, and is awe-inspiring. In the past, he once headed the highest academic institution in the Northwest‚ÄîGansu College‚Äîand his students are all over the Northwest. He often said to people: "To eliminate corruption and reduce the absorption of local people's blood and sweat, and use it for the construction of the Great Northwest, is my lifelong wish."

### Drafting Strong Laborers Late at Night, Hasty Farewell to Family Members: The Conscription Phenomenon in Wuxian is Not Good, and the Authorities Have Sent Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Separately

[This Newspaper Suzhou 29th Dispatch] The first phase of emergency conscription for the 37th year is being actively promoted these days, but the township and town cadres responsible for the conscription work are handling it improperly, mostly implementing it late at night. The selected strong laborers put on their clothes in a daze and responded to the conscription, hastily bidding farewell to their families, which is reminiscent of the scene in the poem "The Stone Moat Official," causing anxiety throughout the city.

### Impressions of a Trip to Taiwan: The Equipment of All Levels of Schools Meets Standards

In recent months, articles about Taiwan have appeared frequently in newspapers, such as news reports and travelogues, because everyone has high hopes and ardent feelings for this precious island that has rejoined the motherland after its recovery. After all, Taiwan is a territory of China, and its people are descendants of the Yellow Emperor. However, it was controlled by Japanese invaders for half a century, and everything was disconnected from the motherland. After the recovery, to fully restore it to its Chinese identity is equivalent to undergoing a major revolution. The most important and first step that should be taken is a thorough reform of the education system. The highest administrative authorities in Taiwan Province are now painstakingly exerting their full efforts in this regard. Many people from other provinces who visit Taiwan also focus on education. Therefore, the "Taiwan Education Visit Group" organized by Shanghai education circles has emerged one after another, and the National Elementary School Principals' Visit Group led by Director Zhu Junti of the National Education Department of the Shanghai Education Bureau was the first, with a larger number of people, a longer visit time, a wider range of areas visited, and a more enthusiastic welcome and hospitality from the people of Taiwan.

I am also a member of this first visit group. Our trip to Taiwan was from December 3rd to 18th last year. The first place we landed in Taiwan was Keelung; we went south to Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan; from Tainan we continued south to Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and even the southernmost point, Eluanbi Lighthouse, facing the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan's administrative divisions are divided into nine cities and eight counties: Keelung City, Taipei City, Hsinchu City, Taichung City, Chiayi City, Changhua City, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung City, and Taipei County, Hsinchu County, Taichung County, Tainan County, Kaohsiung County, Taitung County, Hualien County, and Penghu County. Taipei and Kaohsiung are the largest cities, while the other cities are smaller than the counties in terms of administration.

We visited along the way without resting. Although the days were short, the journey was too long, so it was as tense as a military march. In total, we visited Taiwan's three highest institutions of learning‚ÄîTaiwan University, Taipei Institute of Technology, and Tainan Institute of Technology‚Äîas well as middle schools, normal schools, national schools, and kindergartens in various cities and counties. Visiting national schools was our profession, so we visited the most of them. The equipment of schools at all levels meets standards. But these are all legacies of the Japanese. Although we are entitled to this legacy, the atmosphere of the Japanese colonial era, the good ones should be preserved, while those that violate reason have gradually been eliminated.

In addition to visiting, we also toured several scenic spots. Regarding the various spots of scenic interest, someone has already published articles in the newspaper in the past, so I will not repeat them. What I know now, regarding the personnel issues in Taiwan Province, or may be of more interest to readers, so I will briefly describe it: During the Japanese rule in Taiwan, some Taiwanese were fortunate enough to enter the mainland and were not oppressed by the Japanese. They avoided mentioning their provincial origin and mostly claimed to be Fujianese. Originally, when Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Dynasty after Zheng Chenggong's death, it belonged to Fujian Province. Fujian and Taiwan are separated by a strip of water and have similar pronunciations, so Taiwanese and Fujianese can be said to be one family. After the recovery of Taiwan Province, the Administrative Governor's Office was established, with various departments under it, to handle all administrative affairs. After the "February 28th Incident," General Bai Chongxi personally went to Taiwan to quell the chaos, and then Taiwan was changed to a province. In response to the demands of the Taiwanese people, Taiwanese were given priority in the selection of department heads. Therefore, Taiwanese who had some qualifications and status in political and academic circles in the mainland, who usually claimed to be Fujianese, all restored their original provincial origin and were able to return to their hometowns and serve their communities.

To commemorate the "Trip to Taiwan," I am attaching the names of all the members of this visit group on the left:

### In Surging Waves and Terrifying Tides: Ta Kung Over YMCA

52 to 47, Hualian Significantly Defeats American Military Police

[Our News] Hualian and Ta Kung, two basketball powerhouses in the A-League, both played last night, creating a rare grand event. The city's gymnasium was packed, sweeping away the cold atmosphere of the past few days. As a result, Hualian's army thoroughly defeated the American military police, 105 to 40. In the first half, the score was 50 to 15, and the American military police were no match. Ta Kung, against the YMCA, went through a bitter battle. In an extremely tense situation, they defeated the YMCA by a score of 52 to 47. In the first half, Ta Kung led by four baskets, 30 to 22. In another A-League 2 game, Tongren defeated Dahua, 44 to 34. In the first half, Dahua led by one point, 17 to 16. The situation of each game is as follows:

The Tense Battle Was Unexpected

The final game between Ta Kung and YMCA was the most eye-catching. The tension of the battle was unexpected. In the first half, the YMCA took an 8-5 lead, then tied at 10 points and 20 points each. The score fluctuated, and Ta Kung led by eight points in the first half, 30 to 22. In the second half, Ta Kung led all the way, consistently leading by three, four, six or seven points. The YMCA chased closely, and the situation was quite dangerous. Ta Kung finally overcame the crisis and won 52 to 47. The YMCA used man-to-man defense, and the defense was very tight, making it impossible for Ta Kung to perform. As a result, both sides committed a large number of fouls, totaling 46 times. Five players were fouled out, namely Cai Wenzhang, Cai Wenhua, Tu Wenlong, Ma Han, and V. Kailoski, which shows the intensity of the competition. Ta Kung was trapped in a bitter battle in this tight situation, and it was difficult to break through. This is a sign that the connection is not yet fully skilled. The team's offense was not smooth enough, which was a major reason for the dangerous situation last night. With the first decisive battle against Hualian coming soon, Ta Kung should be prepared.

Five Players Were Fouled Out

The referees were Zheng Zhifang and Xuan Hegao. Cai Zhongqiang scored the first point, and Wenhua scored a point from a free throw. Wenzhang scored, and Ta Kung led 5-0. The YMCA counterattacked and took an 8-5 lead. Wenzhang and Wenhua worked hard, and then tied at 10 each. The difference between the two sides was often between one or two points. At 20-18, Ta Kung substituted players. Huang Bailing shot into the air, and the score was tied again at 20 each. At the end of the first half, Ta Kung led by four baskets, 30 to 22. After the break, the YMCA's counterattack was fierce, 31-34, with a difference of only one and a half baskets. After 39-33, Wenzhang and V. Kailoski were eliminated one after another. The situation was extremely tense. After 44-39, Wenlong and Ma Han were also dismissed for five fouls. Before the end of the game, Wenhua also said goodbye. When time ran out, Ta Kung forcefully defeated YMCA 52 to 47.

Hualian Scored a Total of 105 Points

In the A-League 1 game between Hualian and the American military police, Chen Xuechong shot accurately, and Wu Chengzhang dribbled in. The Da Li Company, Lian Jin, took the lead with 8-0 in an instant. Adi and Xuechong broke through the basket one after another, all using one hand, with beautiful posture. They led remotely with 16-2. The American soldiers called a timeout for help, but it was of little effect. The situation was completely controlled by Hualian. In the first half, Hualian took an absolute advantage with 50-15. After the break, the American military police lineup was greatly adjusted. Liu Fushan retired from Hualian, and Ren Xiangcheng entered the field. The American military police felt even more depressed, and their behavior gradually became abnormal. When it was over, Hualian defeated the American military police with an unprecedented record of 105 to 40.

Who will win the championship is still pending the committee's decision to schedule a rematch between the Chunghwa and John teams.

There are six more games today, five of which will be held in the gymnasium. Among them, the women's group between Tiyu and St. Louis is no different from the championship final. Tiyu has a strong strength, and St. Louis, the only Chinese women's team, also has hopes of winning the championship. Tonight's game will be very competitive, and the Jia Yi group between Jiayi and Portuguese Red is the B1 group final. The order is as follows:

John Completely Defeated Tiyu

The first pair of Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji against Li Guofan and Bossiji is no different from the future open doubles final.

Bossiji was greatly abnormal, and Li Guofan was also difficult to make a difference, and it became a one-sided situation. Hong and Hou won three points in a row, which laid the foundation for the overall situation, because John had full confidence in winning the second and third pairs.

### Chairman Huo Hosts First Reception for Reporters, Explains Efforts in Import Management, Rational Allocation, Simple Procedures, and Improved Work Efficiency

[Our News] Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import Management Committee, held his first press conference at the Bank of China yesterday afternoon at 3:30. More than 30 domestic and foreign reporters attended. Chairman Huo delivered a speech, explaining that due to China's economic capabilities and economic environment, the management of import and export trade adopts the principle of living within our means, that is, imports cannot exceed exports. In the early days of recovery, due to excessive optimism among the government and the public, the management of imports and exports was inevitably lax, resulting in great losses. Without unexpected external resistance, it may take five years of hardship like today to restore balance. In 1942, when the outcome of World War II was still undecided, the United Kingdom began to study the post-war trade management plan, and wartime control measures needed to retain some parts after the war. The implementation of management today has indeed achieved great results, and its vision and vigorous implementation are worthy of our admiration and emulation. Huo also pointed out that today's imports are entirely determined by foreign exchange. Before obtaining methods of increasing revenue, we can only learn the method of "drinking water in the desert," and inconvenience is inevitable. As for the allocation of import foreign exchange, it will depend on the importance of demand. For example, raw materials necessary for production naturally take precedence over luxury goods. Public utility power professions, because they can affect other industries, take precedence over other industries. Among coal and metal mines, the former also takes precedence. The Management Committee plans to conduct a comprehensive study on this in the future, and hopes that each industry will also conduct similar studies internally. As for exports, today's exporters often complain about insufficient costs and high freight rates. This matter involves the currency system and exchange rate, and is not only a trade problem. The committee will cooperate with all parties to do its best to assist so that domestic goods can be sold to overseas markets. Foreign businessmen in China will inevitably find it inconvenient due to our country's trade management. It is hoped that they can demonstrate a spirit of cooperation and overcome this difficult period together. All problems can be openly discussed and mutually understood. Finally, Chairman Huo also explained the future direction of the Import Management Committee's efforts, the main points of which are: Formulating various priority procedures to make the allocation rational. Stipulating various principles so that the acceptance of applications can be decided with one sentence, so as not to cause delays due to mutual evasion between various departments. To this end, an advisory group will be established to facilitate business applications. Using the status of an executive agency, to provide the government with practical information and make practical suggestions so that the government can consider the facts and not be too idealistic when deciding on import and export management policies. There were too many rules and regulations established in the past, and businessmen did not know what to follow, which will be simplified. Improving the work efficiency of the Import Management Committee to make it a service agency.

After Huo's report, reporters raised many questions, but no concrete answers were given at the time. It was only revealed that the fifth period quota is currently being compiled; the repeated price increase of kerosene is actually due to the increase in foreign exchange tariffs and the rise in general prices.

### National Bank to Accept Applications Immediately for Purchasing Part of Manufacturers' Finished Products

[Our News] The Four Joint Treasury is studying the issue of future loans. Responsible parties have stated: The National Bank will definitely not resume lending before Lunar New Year's Eve. During the period of suspension of lending, in order to alleviate the difficulties of Shanghai manufacturers due to sluggish sales of finished products and inflexible turnover, the government has decided to appropriately purchase their finished products, and the Four Joint Treasury has formulated eight temporary measures for Shanghai National Bank to purchase manufacturers' finished products on behalf of the government, entrusting the National Bank to handle it. Regarding the starting time of the purchase, according to the National Bank spokesperson, the bank has received a notice from the Four Joint Treasury and is consulting with the Three Banks and Two Bureaus on the technical issues of the purchase. From now on, the bank can accept manufacturers' applications.

In addition, there was an outside rumor that the National Bank recently allocated 50 billion to lend to five commercial banks in the city in order to maintain finance during the Spring Festival. The National Bank spokesperson said that this was absolutely untrue.

### Cotton Yarn Weakens, Cloth is Flat and Listless

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened slightly firm in the morning. Later, due to dyeing and weaving factories processing fine yarn, and a few merchant groups also buying in, prices gradually rose. Towards the close, as concerns about the implementation of registration spread and confidence waned, sales from various parties increased, causing prices to weaken. Consequently, fine yarns such as 42-count "Blue Silk" rose by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, due to the replication factory's absorption, reaching 58.4 million yuan. Coarse yarns like 16-count "Guangming" and "Sanming" remained firm in price due to active purchasing by local and external merchant groups. Other counts of fine yarn all continued to fall, ranging from 100,000 to 5-600,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw continued price increases due to Hankou merchant groups still coming to Shanghai with cash to purchase. However, upon hearing news of yarn price declines and potential export restrictions, confidence turned weak again. Chinese dyeing factories sold a large amount of grey cloth, and small manufacturers successively emerged to purchase cotton yarn. Transactions among dealers were also sluggish, and there was a lack of momentum. Consequently, the prices of various 12-pound fine cloths all fell by 5,000 to 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The overall trend was that, except for "Zhigong" and raw cloth which remained relatively firm, other cloths showed a flat and listless trend.

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 11,300 bolts, or 40 strips per application. There were 253 applications, and excluding four applications from manufacturers who purchased 720 bolts, the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.

Raw Cotton is Firm and Attractive

Yesterday, the raw cotton market saw slightly improved sales. Yarn factories from other ports began to replenish their stocks, and transactions became more active. Local yarn factories also had demand, and the market was slightly firm. In the afternoon, due to the weakening of cotton yarn prices, the ground became slightly soft. Later, as dealers still had ample funds, and retail investors covered their positions, the trend rebounded, with 1,020 bales traded. Factory delivery prices were 4.415 million yuan for "Kaihan Fine," 4.753 million yuan for "Yao Hua," and 5.787 million yuan for "Tuolisi," with 570 bales traded. Warehouse delivery prices were 5.704 million yuan for "Tuolisi," and 5.291 million to 5.373 million yuan for "Kaihan Fine," with 450 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 1.22 million to 1.23 million yuan.

### Consolidated Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Stagnant

Government bonds saw little change yesterday. Consolidated Class C bonds were relatively stable, while the rest were generally unchanged. About 4 million yuan was traded. Consolidated Class C bonds opened at 65,000 in the morning, with a high of 67,500, a low of 64,000, and then turned flat. In the end, Classes A, B, D, and E were flat compared to the previous close, while Consolidated Class C rose slightly by 1,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks saw a stagnant situation yesterday. Ewo Cotton Mill opened at 580,000, and retreated from 595,000 to around 560,000. There were mixed opinions among securities brokers and foreign firms. In the end, paper, telephone, and tram stocks were flat compared to the previous close. Ewo Cotton Mill, American Land, Wheelock, Yieh Kwong, Ewo Brewery, shipping, steel, and plantations were all slightly lower. Hong Kong Shanghai Electricity was flat. The process was quite sluggish.

### Qingdao Industrial Crisis

Industrial Association Qingdao Branch Representatives Petition in Beijing

[Our Report] The Industrial Association Qingdao Branch members, facing unprecedented difficulties in the local industrial environment, specially organized a petition group consisting of representatives Yin Zhizhong, Zhang Mingting, Yu Putian, Sun Xiangpu, Jiang Hequan, Yu Lianbi, etc., who arrived in Shanghai successively a few days ago, and jointly went to Beijing last night. They plan to separately petition the relevant ministries and departments of the central government, requesting assistance. It is claimed that the serious problems facing the industrial sector in Qingdao are sixfold: 1. Heavy and numerous taxes. 2. Lack of fuel, resulting in work stagnation. 3. The ban on transporting southern wheat to the north, causing the flour industry to halt. 4. Suspension of production loans, leading to factory funding shortages and forced shutdowns. 5. Insufficient foreign exchange quotas, resulting in high material procurement costs. 6. Political parties manipulating labor unrest, threatening safe production. Therefore, they plan to propose six suggestions to the central government: 1. Regarding profit tax, please follow the example of Jinan City and exempt business tax. For industries that meet national defense and people's livelihood needs, reduce it by half. All other proposed levies should be waived. 2. Instruct the Fuel Management Committee to supply 20,000 tons of coal per month for industrial use in Qingdao. 3. Instruct the Ministry of Food to cancel the transportation of southern wheat to the north and allocate as much imported wheat as possible. 4. Quickly open mortgage production loans, and issue 150 billion yuan in emergency production loans before the lunar new year. 5. Request the Shipping Management Committee to increase Qingdao's foreign exchange quota to US$2 million. 6. Strictly prohibit political parties from interfering in labor movements.

### Lack of New Purchases to Maintain, Chinese Stocks Generally Weak

Chinese stocks were even more uninteresting yesterday, with the current forward turnover period making the overall situation even more uncertain. Forward Yung Shing Cotton Mill even had no price quoted several times in the afternoon, making the situation even more bleak. There was a relatively strong sentiment of American loans, leading to weakness.

Initially, due to war news, the prospects for industrial loans were uncertain. Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened at 755 yuan and 785 yuan, and sold at 750 yuan and 788 yuan, then rose to a high of 760 yuan and 798 yuan. Outside the market, interest rates opened at 3 jiao 3 fen and 3 jiao 7.5 fen, and once forced down to a low of 740 yuan and 779 yuan. The 23rd serial number and others entered, and the market rose to 755 yuan and 793 yuan. The situation after the high remained volatile. The afternoon closed retreated to 740 yuan and 777 yuan. In the end, compared to the previous close, immediate delivery shares of Yung Shing Cotton Mill, China Textile, China Silk, New Kwong, Kung Hing, underwear, and China New Zhabei all declined slightly. Hsin Yi Match rose slightly. Hsin Ho, American Asiatic, Hua Feng, King Fook, French China, New China, Wing Foong, Tung Yee, Commerce, Yung Kung, and Lai On all fell by half a percent. Forward delivery, due to the relationship of premium prices, American Asiatic, New Kwong, and Tung Hing all rose by half a percent. Yung Shing Cotton Mill, Hsin Ho, Hua Feng, and King Fook rose slightly.

In the aftermarket, Yung Shing Cotton Mill started from 749 yuan and 779 yuan, with even more deserted transactions. Lacking maintenance, it retreated to within 740 yuan and 770 yuan. The national bank exchanged for a difference of 900 million. The 183rd entered immediate delivery, and the 232nd entered forward delivery, rising to 746 yuan and 777 yuan. With strong American loan sentiment, it was forced down to 734 yuan and 761 yuan, and then closed at 736 yuan and 761 yuan. Compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Hsin Yi, Hua Feng, New China, and Wing Foong rose slightly. French China and Zhabei China Silk were flat.

### Rice Digestion Turns Dull, Oil Market Declines Across the Board

Yesterday, the northern and southern markets together received more than 10,500 shih of rice. The weather was clear, and the market turned cold and sluggish, falling back into a weary state. WhiteÁ≤≥ and earlyËñÑÁ®ª both fell by 3-40,000 yuan, while intermediate and inferiorÁßàÁ±≥ also fell by 2-30,000 yuan. WhiteÂÖÉ saw a low of 1-20,000 yuan. Flour sales turned dull, falling back by more than 10,000 yuan. The market changed from rising to falling. Bran supply exceeded demand, with actual sales being clear and straightforward, and falling by 3-4,000 yuan.

Soybean cake transactions were active in Shantou, first flat and then firm, rising slightly by 2-3,000 yuan. There was movement of yellow soybeans in Fujian, but local oil factories had a light appetite, continuing to fall by 1-20,000 yuan. Soybean sales to the north were very slow and slumped. Red beans showed little spirit and fell back by 3-40,000 yuan. Soybean retail sales were also scarce, continuing to fall by 1-20,000 yuan. Cowpea transactions were normal, with a flat trend.

Red sorghum sales were sparse, falling back slightly by 10,000 yuan. Northern corn remained sluggish, continuing to fall by 2-30,000 yuan, with few buyers. Sesame supply and demand were both low, with a clear price but hidden weakness. Local merchants and merchants from Guangzhou had little appetite for raw peanuts, leading to a continuous sharp fall of more than 100,000 yuan. Wheat also followed the downward trend.

The oil market declined across the board. Soybean oil fell back by 3-40,000 yuan, clarified oil fell sharply by 100,000 yuan, crude oil plummeted by more than 100,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and sesame oil successively fell by 7-80,000 yuan. The rest all fell slightly, reaching a decline of half a percent or so. Forward delivery stocks also saw a slight decline. Unlisted stocks outside the market, such as the Bank of China, Chung Hwa Book Company, and Pudong Electricity, all fell by half a percent, showing considerable fear and fatigue.

The current forward arbitrage buying and selling, yesterday, first high and then low, those who joined in with a combined interest price premium could earn 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen. Banks are relatively spacious. In terms of the premium, Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened at 39 yuan, retreated from 41 yuan to 34 yuan, and closed at 35 yuan. Hsin Ho dropped from 20 yuan to 17 yuan, and closed at 17 yuan. American Asiatic retreated from 75 yuan to 58 yuan. New Kwong dropped from 5 yuan 4 jiao to 5 yuan. Hua Feng had few transactions, around 20 yuan.

### Securities Exchange Brokers Request Exemption from Increasing Margin

By Using the Increased Value of Bonds Pledged as Collateral

[Our Report] Representatives Yu Mingshi, Lin Zongjing, and Shi Jiucai of the Securities Exchange Brokers Association visited the Securities Exchange authorities at 10:00 AM yesterday. They were received by Yang Yinpu, assistant manager of the Securities Exchange, and Hua Wenyu, chief secretary. The representatives offered two points of view: 1. Regarding the increased margin requirement, they requested that the previously pledged US dollar Treasury bonds of 30 million yuan be offset by their current market value. 2. Regarding the increased capital requirement, as the capacity of brokers varies, they hoped that there would be no rigid requirement to increase capital to 500 million yuan across the board. Later, they submitted a written petition. The Securities Exchange authorities agreed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and Economics for flexible handling.

[Also News] The Ministry of Finance and Economics' instructions on the method of transferring listed company stocks, with six measures, were issued to the Securities Exchange yesterday. The Securities Exchange immediately instructed 32 listed companies to take note. However, in item 3 of the reported measures yesterday, after the characters "one, two, four," the words "If the application documents are not provided by the deadline, listing should be temporarily suspended" were omitted.

### Yarn and Cloth for Coal Issue is Ripe

[Our Report] In order to solve the coal shortage problem, the China Textile Construction Company is currently negotiating with India, the Philippines, and other places to exchange yarn and cloth for coal. It has now reached a mature stage. Once the shipping procedures with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are settled, a formal contract can be signed with India and the Philippines. It is heard that the first batch is scheduled to exchange for 20,000 tons of Indian coal and Philippine coal each. The price of yarn and cloth exported by the Textile Construction Company will be based on the US dollar pricing of the Textile Export Commission. The US dollar price of Indian and Philippine coal will also be determined, and then the barter ratio will be mutually agreed upon.

### Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association General Meeting Discusses Response to Control Measures, Elects Representatives to State Opinions to Director Yuan

[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a temporary general meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Regarding matters of concern for the survival of the industry, many members attended. Tang Xinghai presided over the meeting. The topic of discussion was the implementation details of the Yarn Management Committee. Since industry members had not been given the opportunity to participate in the research and contribute opinions, and the announcement had been made hastily, there were many difficult and impossible aspects. The members were very anxious. The members were quite critical of the Board of Directors for failing to pay attention to and neglecting the interests of the industry in the past. After a discussion of four small groups, the following resolutions were made:

*   Agency spinning and weaving should be carried out through contracts. Any measures that exceed the scope of agency spinning and weaving are difficult to accept.

*   Wu Shuying, Zhu Shangyi, Han Zhiming, Wang Zhuyi, and Tang Huanru were elected to form a declaration drafting committee to issue a declaration outlining the current situation and crisis of the industry.

*   Rong Hongyuan, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, and Wang Zhuyi were elected as six representatives to state their opinions to Director Yuan, requesting that: 1. The registration of cotton yarn be temporarily suspended until each factory has received cotton for agency spinning. 2. The six points previously proposed by the association should be implemented. 3. There is no need to establish resident factory personnel to avoid wasting national funds and creating abuses. 4. All implementation details should be postponed until the association has had the opportunity to research and contribute opinions.

*   If the representatives are unable to obtain satisfactory results from Director Yuan, all members will petition in Beijing.

*   The mills are running low on raw cotton supplies and need to replenish them urgently. If the Yarn Management Committee cannot supply them in time, leading to forced shutdowns, the Yarn Management Committee should be fully responsible for the serious consequences.

*   Send a letter to the National Yarn Factory Federation to convene a meeting and advocate for a unified position.

*   Yuan Guoliang, Zhu Fuju, Rong Guangliang, Xue Zuheng, Zhang Wenkui, Nuo Shangyi, Han Zhiming, Wang Weiyin, Zhang Wenqian, Wu Kunsheng, Liu Piji, Tang Huanru, Shao Baohu, and Tang Junyuan were elected as fourteen representatives to present the serious situation of the industry to the Municipal Government, Garrison Headquarters, and Social Affairs Bureau, requesting attention. They will also appeal to the Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and relevant parties.

*   Finally, as a temporary motion, it was requested that the association notify its member factories to await the handling of negotiations between Muzeng and the Yarn Management Committee regarding all measures, in order to achieve consistency.

Responsible Person of the Yarn Management Committee Discusses the Meaning of Cotton Yarn Registration

[Our Report] After the announcement and implementation of the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee's cotton yarn registration measures, it is heard that yarn factories believe that this registration is tantamount to freezing cotton yarn, and the factories will inevitably feel difficulties in their capital turnover during the upcoming Lunar New Year.

According to the responsible person of the committee, cotton yarn registration is an important preliminary measure for managing cotton yarn. It can prevent hoarding, smuggling, and speculative trading of cotton yarn. Cotton yarn produced by yarn factories cannot leave the factory without a permit. Replication industries that are allocated cotton yarn cannot resell it for profit. Cloth merchants and dyeing factories that are allocated grey cloth cannot use it to loop back and acquire yarn. However, once the cotton yarn registration certificate is obtained, it can be transported and sold with the certificate. Previous transportation and sales restrictions, such as the southern transportation restriction, have already been lifted. Not only is it not frozen, but legitimate manufacturers will only find it more convenient than before. The claims from outside are actually misunderstandings.

Furthermore, the function of the cotton yarn registration certificate is just like a citizen's identity card. It would be ridiculous to say that issuing identity cards to citizens freezes them. In the past, it was difficult to define how cotton yarn constituted hoarding, and inspection and handling were difficult. In the future, a clear definition will be obtained. Any cotton yarn without a certificate or with an expired registration certificate will be considered hoarding. Once discovered, it can be dealt with. Legitimate manufacturers can thus obtain legal protection for their existing cotton yarn.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### A Casual Discussion of Rheumatism and its Treatments

‚Äî Liang Junqing

The occurrence and progression of rheumatism are indeed very complex and cannot be fully described in this article. What this article discusses is the significant impact of rheumatism on life and its latest treatments.

In recent years, medical scientists from various countries around the world have exhausted their efforts to study the causes and treatments of various diseases that harm the human body. For example, for tuberculosis, cancer, leprosy, poliomyelitis, and other diseases, large sums of money have been raised to establish various research institutes, and specialized personnel have been hired to conduct research. However, rheumatism seems to be forgotten and not paid attention to. In fact, rheumatism is a very harmful disease to humans and should not be ignored. According to the report of A.E. Luckhardt of the Third Hospital of the University of Chicago, traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis have been found in the skeletons of reptiles from six million years ago. This has been fully proven by exhibits in the Chicago Museum of Antiquities for verification. Also, there are traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis in the skeletons of ape-men who lived two million years ago. Moreover, the skeletons of the Java man, Peking man, and mummies buried in Egyptian pyramids from 500,000 to 8,000 years ago also have traces of chronic rheumatic arthritis. It can be seen that rheumatism is a powerful and deeply penetrating disease. In fact, if we statistically analyze disabled patients, the number of rheumatic patients among them is also not small. According to the estimate of the aforementioned Luckhardt, there are a total of ten million rheumatic patients in the United States. This number exceeds the combined total number of patients with tuberculosis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease nationwide. Among these ten million rheumatic patients, seven million suffer from articular rheumatism, of which 150,000 are completely disabled and unable to work, and another one million are unable to work for five months out of the year. It can be seen the wide range of rheumatisms' attack and its impact on life. Our country's new medical undertakings are not yet developed, and medical authorities are currently too busy to take care of it, which is truly regrettable.

Regarding the treatment of rheumatism, of course, a correct diagnosis is the prerequisite. However, a correct diagnosis of rheumatism is often not easy to obtain, because there are many similar diseases, and if one is slightly negligent, there is no way to avoid being misdiagnosed. For example, uric acid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, post-traumatic joint synovitis, tendinitis, articular fibrous tissue inflammation, joint mucous bursitis, joint reversal joint dislocation, etc., can be easily misdiagnosed as chronic rheumatic arthritis if not carefully examined. Also, suppurative arthritis, tuberculous arthritis, syphilitic arthritis, and pneumococcal arthritis, etc., are also very easy to misdiagnose as rheumatic arthritis. In addition, diseases such as periostitis arthritis, cancerous diseases, neuritis diseases, spinal cord wasting diseases, inflammatory syringomyelia, histiocytosis, and hemophilic arthritis all have similar symptoms and must be carefully differentiated to avoid errors in diagnosis. If our doctors and patients encounter bone and joint pain, severe muscle therapy, etc., without thinking, they believe that they are suffering from rheumatism and take rheumatism drugs, and the result will certainly not be cured, leading to suspicion that the drugs are ineffective. In fact, what is the harm of drugs that are not prescribed correctly?

Regarding the various theoretical issues in treatment (for example, women with rheumatism can suddenly recover during pregnancy. Also, patients with rheumatism can suddenly recover due to suffering from jaundice, etc.) I will temporarily omit them due to space limitations. There are many treatments for rheumatism that we currently know, such as hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, physical therapy, and drug therapy, etc. In drug therapy, salicylic acid preparations, amino acid agents, gold preparations, vitamin preparations, endocrine preparations, and protein preparations, etc., were previously popular. However, none of them are satisfactory. In recent years, the United States has used large amounts of gold preparations and vitamin preparations, but the results after testing were not good. Also, bee venom therapy has long been advocated, but its effects are also not good. According to the report of Luckhardt, since the past eighteen years, he has been using the Cutivaccih Paul method advocated by Dr. Gustav Paul, former director of the Vienna National Serum Laboratory, in 1927. This method is very good and reliable in efficacy. Luckhardt himself also suffered from rheumatic arthritis, tried all methods, and was not cured for a long time. Later, he was advised by Prof. Dr. E. Pribram, professor of bacteriology at the University of Chicago, to try the aforementioned method, and it was immediately effective after one try. According to the experience of the past eighteen years, it can be proven that this method is absolutely reliable. This type of subcutaneous injection of Paul's serum is a serum extracted from a bacterium called Saprophyten (ËÖêÂåñËèå), with a corresponding amount of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein metabolite (Tubermucin) added, plus a one-to-one thousandth portion of filtered and sterilized smallpox bacterial serum, and infiltrated with a small amount of old Tuberculin (that is, the previously advocated tuberculosis bacterial serum). It has miraculous effects on chronic articular rheumatism, chronic muscular rheumatism, sciatica, and other neuralgia and muscle pain, etc. It is specially written to introduce it.

### Gonorrhea

‚Äî Translated by Hua Xiren

Gonorrhea is a disease that many people have contracted. It is a disease of pleasure, and also a disease easily caught (Clap. Gleet). It is a highly infectious disease caused by a very small diplococcus called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is contracted through unclean sexual intercourse; it is as prevalent as a cold. Gonorrhea and syphilis are two different diseases; however, they can be transmitted to the same person in the same place. Gonorrhea cannot turn into syphilis, and similarly, syphilis does not easily turn into gonorrhea. After a first infection is completely cured, one can be infected again.

Gonorrhea in Men

After unclean sexual intercourse, gonorrheal bacteria invade the urethra in the genital area, attach to and multiply on the inner wall of the urethra, and then reach the sexual organs. Commonly, gonococci can also pass into our blood vessels, and then be carried by the blood circulation to other parts of the body. They can invade the heart, joints, and form rheumatism and arthritis.

The first symptom Sign of gonorrhea is a stinging and burning sensation when urinating. The pathological changes in the urethra are mostly redness and irritation. Such symptoms often appear one to three days after sexual intercourse. Purulent discharge then flows out of the penile opening, with small patches of pus blocking the urethra. The initial pus is white, but later it becomes a thick, yellowish pus. Each drop of pus contains thousands of bacteria, which are easily transmitted through contact. If a small drop of pus enters the eye, it can easily cause blindness. In the groin, the lymph nodes in the inguinal region begin to swell and ache, and the patient's body temperature then increases. Doctors can easily find gonococci under a microscope by applying a smear specimen to a glass slide, which is a very scientific diagnosis. At this time, if appropriate treatment is given, gonorrhea may stop from penetrating further. Conversely, if left untreated, the gonococci will advance directly into the prostate and testicles. If the testicles become inflamed, gonorrhea treatment becomes more difficult. This situation is likely to cause you to be infertile and lead to the consequence of having no descendants.

Gonorrhea in Women

The first symptom of gonorrhea in women is also a stinging sensation when urinating, with redness and swelling in the urethra and vaginal area. Subsequently, a large amount of whitish-yellow pus is discharged. As long as there is fluid flowing from the vagina, whether it is white or yellow, it suggests that you have contracted gonorrhea and should see a doctor immediately; because gonococci have the potential to run into the uterus through the vagina. When it invades the fallopian tubes and ovaries, gonorrhea can persist until the end of her life. Gonorrhea is the best reason to prove why you will never have children.

How to Treat Gonorrhea

When you find signs of gonorrhea, go to a doctor for advice as soon as possible, and follow and trust the doctor's guidance. Remember that early treatment is essential. Self-treatment is dangerous.

Do not consult quacks or shopkeepers. In particular, do not self-medicate with over-the-counter drugs. This will harm both your finances and your health. Because gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat, only qualified scientific doctors understand the treatment methods, so you must trust them.

Avoid sexual arousal and abstain from sexual intercourse, especially during treatment, which must be absolutely stopped; otherwise, it will be detrimental to you and easily transmit the disease to others.

Avoid drinking alcohol: because any kind of alcohol can increase secretion and discharge, and at the same time, aggravate inflammation. It is best to drink plenty of water.

Gentle exercises can be done, and bowel movements should be smooth.

Do not change the dressing to cover the penis or vagina. Because this makes it difficult for the pus to be discharged, and the inflammation gradually worsens.

After touching the genital area, you must wash your hands with soap and water to prevent the spread of gonococci to others, including your own children. Sometimes, gonococci can be transmitted to the eyes by hand, so all towels, cups, bowls, and other personal items must be disinfected and rinsed. Enema equipment must never be reused by others, otherwise the chance of infection will be even greater.

If the testicles are swollen, all treatment must be suspended, and you should rest quietly in bed, applying an ice pack or a warm water bag to the swollen area.

Disinfectant washes are more effective for female gonorrhea, but they must be done under the guidance of a doctor.

There is hope for a full recovery, especially with penicillin and sulfonamide chemicals like Sulfadiazine. However, although these drugs are valuable, they are also very dangerous. If taken improperly, they can also lose their effectiveness. So you don't have to take them yourself, you must accept the guidance of a qualified doctor, only they know the changes in gonorrhea.

Signs of a Full Recovery

Do not assume that gonorrhea is cured just because there is no pus discharge. Pus discharge may also stop when treatment is delayed or improperly done. But the question to consider is whether the gonococci have penetrated deep into the body? If the gonococci have shifted their line of attack, then the inflammation has not stopped. Doctors can use many ways to test and confirm whether you are completely cured. Doctors can use the following methods to examine you: A. Examine the urine, B. Use a microscope to look for gonococci, C. Massage the prostate to determine if there is pus now, D. Carefully examine the vagina.

After the above examination procedures, if it is proven that no gonococci are found, then we can say that it is cured. We can also guarantee that it is cured. However, as a precaution, the patient, for the sake of protecting their spouse, should still abstain from sexual intercourse for several months after recovery. (Translated from a booklet published by the U.S. Public Health Service, titled Gororrttea the crippler)

### Defense Against Pulmonary Tuberculosis (3)

‚Äî Yu Zhengxing

The Relationship Between Pulmonary Tuberculosis Incidence and Residence: The greater the population density, the easier it is to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. For example, it is easier to contract pulmonary tuberculosis in urban schools. A statistical study of the relationship between tuberculosis mortality and residence in Edinburgh, England, from 1910 to 1912:

It can be seen that the larger the living area, the better the conditions such as light, air, and temperature, and the factors that cause disease can be reduced. Therefore, Rnbunt advocates that each person should have twenty cubic meters of air. Houses with poor lighting and ventilation are very susceptible to disease.

The Relationship Between Pulmonary Tuberculosis Incidence and War: During foreign operations, life is turbulent, prices are high, and nutrition is poor. In addition, the spirit suffers severe blows, so at the end of the war, the tuberculosis incidence tends to increase. In Germany, before the First World War, the mortality rate from pulmonary tuberculosis was 1.36 percent, and during the war it was 2.3 percent. It can be seen that war can cause a sharp increase in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Three Diabetes: Diabetes has been recognized as a factor in promoting the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis. In Root's report of autopsies on 1121 diabetic cadavers, the expected two or three cases were found. Diabetes was found to occur in young people aged fifteen to twenty in a high school in Massachusetts, while pulmonary tuberculosis developed at the age of sixteen. In fact, the onset of tuberculosis follows the occurrence of diabetes.

Four Pregnancy: It is generally believed that pregnancy reduces resistance to tuberculosis, and only attention is paid to the protection of maternal abortion. Recent studies have shown that postpartum care and family care should be given special attention to latent tuberculosis. In fact, pregnant women are satisfied with prenatal care and there are fewer hindrances to pregnancy, but they are more likely to feel at risk during postpartum care. Because it is not anticipated that resistance to tuberculosis will be reduced after childbirth, tuberculosis is most likely to develop and cause great harm during this time.

Five Immunity: Humans have no innate immunity, and everyone can contract tuberculosis. In our country, almost everyone has had tuberculosis. Ninety percent of children who contract tubercle bacilli develop miliary tuberculosis and die. Some also develop local (pulmonary lymph) tuberculosis. In the local aspect, some die due to weakened physical resistance, and some surround the tuberculosis lesions due to increased resistance. If there are still living tubercle bacilli in the lesions, the result of the surrounding is twofold: one is that resistance decreases and nutrition is poor, so it can recur. The other is that resistance increases and eventually calcifies. This can be said to be a complete cure for tuberculosis. If a person has not contracted tuberculosis in childhood, they are also prone to infection when they reach adulthood. This is mostly systemic miliary tuberculosis. It can be seen from this that immunity can only occur when there are living tubercle bacilli in the body, that is, the body has special resistance only when the living tubercle bacilli are surrounded. Therefore, there is immunity only through infection. Therefore, tuberculosis is an infectious immunity. After infection immunity, there is considerable resistance to the invasion of tubercle bacilli. However, we know very little about the immunological principles of tuberculosis, and what we understand is that rich nutrition, adequate rest, fresh air, and other good sanitary environments are sufficient to increase our resistance to prevent infection.

The source of tubercle bacilli invading the human body is mostly the human-type tubercle bacilli excreted from the bodies of tuberculosis patients. There are also bovine-type tubercle bacilli that cause disease in the body. The modes and routes of transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis can be listed as follows:

Foodborne Transmission: This is mostly transmitted through the digestive tract and is more common in children. It is often transmitted due to drinking milk containing tubercle bacilli, or infected by human milk or artificial milk. Also, sharing food utensils with patients can bring tubercle bacilli into the intestines. According to experimental evidence, tubercle bacilli can penetrate the intestinal membrane of healthy animals and enter the lymph and blood, reaching the lungs directly. Due to the filtration effect of capillaries in the lungs, they attach to the alveoli. Furthermore, because the lungs are particularly susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis is produced. Other diseases such as lymph tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis are also mostly discovered in this way.

Contact Transmission: The sputum, pus, etc. of pulmonary tuberculosis patients can cause tuberculosis in healthy people. For example, children playing on the ground are very susceptible to infection if they encounter sputum with tubercle bacilli. Therefore, it is inappropriate for children to crawl on the ground. Common living habits, such as sleeping in the same room, kissing, etc., if one of them is a pulmonary tuberculosis patient, then the other people are very likely to contract pulmonary tuberculosis. Other excrement such as feces, urine, and pus left by pulmonary tuberculosis patients, as well as contaminated equipment, drinking water, food, etc., can also cause transmission, leading to intestinal tuberculosis, urinary and reproductive system tuberculosis, and skin tuberculosis, etc. (To be continued)

### A Sanitary Discussion on Keeping Warm and Cold

‚Äî Baiding

In the past two days, the cold wave from Siberia visited Shanghai, turning the city into a situation where water drips into ice and the north wind is piercingly cold. When people meet, they either say, "How can it be so cold!" or "It's really unbearable these days!"

Therefore, "keeping warm and resisting the cold" has imperceptibly become an important task for every citizen.

Now, let's take the opportunity to talk about the sanitary methods of "keeping warm and resisting the cold".

Keeping warm and resisting the cold is a multi-faceted thing: using electric stoves, fireplaces, radiators (recently, there are also American-made electric radiators on the market) to increase the temperature of the indoor environment, which is a passive method; wearing more clothes, which is also a passive method; eating more warming foods, such as fatty foods, which is an active method; engaging in full-force exercise, such as running and playing ball, or doing various freehand exercises indoors, which is also an active method of keeping the body warm. Secondly, bathing is also a sanitary activity that warms and resists the cold.

Electric stoves, fireplaces, radiators, and electric radiators are indeed passive methods of resisting the cold, but they require economic conditions and are not suitable for the public. Among the four million Shanghai citizens, I think most people do not have these economic conditions and therefore do not have the privilege of enjoying these superior cold-resistant equipment. Coal stoves‚Äîcoal stoves without chimneys‚Äîseem to be more suitable for the general public in terms of economic conditions, but in terms of hygiene, they are the most unhygienic heating method. Every winter, batches of people are poisoned by coal gas and die, which is reported in the newspapers and seen by readers. Therefore, this kind of coal stove without a chimney is the most unhygienic and life-threatening warming tool and should never be used.

However, recently, due to the soaring price of coal briquettes, even coal stoves without chimneys are unaffordable for the average commoner due to economic reasons.

If economics is not a problem, then electric stoves, fireplaces, or radiators are all fine, as you please. However, please note: take off your clothes when entering the room and put on your clothes when leaving the room, so as to keep your body temperature constant; otherwise, catching a cold and coughing will create business for doctors and pharmacies again.

As for wearing clothes, apart from the poor and miserable children who have no economic means to wear warm clothes, and the "modern ladies" who have the economic means but are unwilling to wear warm clothes, ordinary people all know that wearing more clothes when the weather is cold can achieve the purpose of keeping warm and resisting the cold. One thing that should be noted is: do not wear too much to the point of hindering the body's movement; because movement can generate heat, and its cold-resistant effect is no less than that of clothing to keep warm.

The reason why eating more fat can generate heat is also very simple; why are big fat people less afraid of the cold? It's because their body has several pounds more fat than others. But this also has economic conditions; if even the third or fourth-class coarse indica rice cannot fill the empty stomach of a poor friend, how can we talk about eating oil today and chewing meat tomorrow? However, some fortunate friends are happy to eat more of these fatty foods. At the same time, it should also be noted: it is also not advisable to force yourself to eat too much, otherwise, you will upset your stomach and cause indigestion, and I will not be responsible!

Everyone knows that exercise is beneficial to human health. In winter, it can not only exercise the body and benefit health, but also warm the body and increase warmth, which is truly the most active and effective method of resisting the cold. If you don't have time to play ball or the opportunity to kick a ball, there is always an opportunity to run on the road. This is not only more economical than taking a motorcycle card or a rickshaw, but also more hygienic and more beneficial to health.

The working class often uses their all-day labor to compensate for the shortcomings of their single clothes and coarse food in keeping warm and resisting the cold.

In addition to the function of cleaning the skin, bathing also has the function of promoting the metabolism of the skin. Precisely because it has the function of promoting the metabolism of the skin, it also has the effect of warming and resisting the cold.

### A Miracle

‚Äî Jingwen

According to recent news from the New York Times, Mr. Varga, who has consistently held the position of authority in Soviet economics for twenty years, has recently been abandoned by the Soviet authorities. Mr. Varga was the director of the World Political Economy Lecture Series at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. But now, not only has Mr. Varga himself been removed from his post, but the World Political Economy Department he presided over has also been abolished, and more than twenty economists who worked with him have also been expelled by the authorities.

There have been several major cleansing events in Soviet politics, such as the cleansing of the Trotskyists, and later the cleansing of Radek, Bukharin, and others. However, the previous major purges were all caused by political issues, but this time the cleansing of Varga has no direct political connection, but is because Varga insisted on his economic theory.

According to the New York Times report, Varga published an economic work (title unknown) not long ago. Based on the conclusions he reached after studying the current state of the world economy, Varga believed that Western capitalist countries would not experience economic panic in the ten years after the war, the lives of workers in capitalist countries would improve during the war, and many colonial economic plunders have now been abandoned. He further pointed out that the war did not increase the wealth of capitalist countries.

Varga further admitted that his objective economic analysis forced him to reach conclusions that were exactly the opposite of the Soviet Party's position. Because the Soviet Party's economic estimate of the post-war world was that capitalist countries would inevitably experience a major economic panic after the war, and the lives of workers in various countries would inevitably deteriorate, thus creating an "objective situation" "favorable" to the revolution. And now this economic authority of the proletariat has completely overthrown this "estimate"!

I have not studied economics, and I have never had the opportunity to read Varga's works, so I have absolutely no feelings of love or hatred for Varga personally. I have no way of judging which of his past and present theories is correct. However, an economist with a reputation of twenty years like Varga would probably not be completely baseless in this economic analysis he made this time; and he is still living in Moscow, so he would not publicly betray his country.

However, Varga has now finally "fallen out of favor," but it is not due to any personal fault of his, but because he is loyal to his scholarship, loyal to his identity as an economist‚Äîthat is, loyal to the academic truth he pursues.

It is said that after the Soviet authorities discovered the "error" in Varga's theory, they organized a court to try him and asked him to admit his mistake. But Varga only replied that he could slightly modify his theory, and even willing to provide any political explanation, but he refused to change the conclusions he made based on the facts.

How much this shows the martyrdom of a scholar! What is even more commendable is that Varga is not a citizen growing up in the atmosphere of a democratic and free country. He may be a member of the Soviet Union, and may have received the Red Star or Lenin Medal, but all of this did not become an obstacle to his pursuit of truth before he buried himself in academic research, and instead gave him courage.

Of course, Varga's past and present economic theories may not be truth, but his willingness not to echo what others say and his courage to observe facts prove that he is indeed a valuable scholar. We can certainly oppose his economic theories, but we cannot help but admire his arrogance as a scholar.

In today's world, the so-called academic atmosphere has declined to the point where it can no longer decline. Generally speaking, scholars either speak with glasses on or have a so-called background. And those who sell their reputation and fish for fame are everywhere. What is even stranger is that scholars also have factions, and sectarian ideology often replaces truth. Therefore, emotional impulses often replace academic and truth exploration. People like Varga are said to be a minority among minorities, and even more meaningfully, such an event actually occurred in a country behind the "Iron Curtain," which cannot be said to be a remarkable miracle.

### Traveling in Taiwan

‚Äî Tang Naixin

In the past, Huang Gongdu's "Renjinglu Poems" contained "Traveling in Taiwan". When I first read this poem, it was about twenty-five years ago. As a child, I recited poems without seeking profound understanding, only feeling that they were easy to read aloud and recite. During the Anti-Japanese War, I took refuge in Sichuan and taught Chinese at Sichuan Women's High School. I once taught "Traveling in Taiwan", and I vaguely remember that this article was on the Kaiming Loose-Leaf Literary Selections.

Recently, after returning from a trip to Taiwan, I remembered this poem. I searched for a copy of "Renjinglu Poems" in bookstores, both large and small, new and old, but there was no such book. Even the "Kaiming Loose-Leaf Literary Selections" has been out of print. I also failed to find it at the Cold Library. Later, because a friend was in the library of the College of Liberal Arts of National Taiwan University, I wrote to him to find a copy and send it to me. The purpose was to find this "Traveling in Taiwan". Recently, I received a reply stating that the library only had a card and no original book, because it had been lost during the restoration period. However, they had copied it from a private collection of books, etc. Receiving a letter from afar makes it seem even more precious. Reading "Traveling in Taiwan" in today's situation makes it feel even more intimate and meaningful. Therefore, I am recording it to contribute to Free Talk.

"The drums on the city head boom like thunder, Heavens, heavens, tears fall like you, The Japanese have unexpectedly cut Taiwan away. Originally, the territory was included in the celestial palace, Heavenly might reached far to the land of the rising sun, My ancestors, generations ago, Cleared weeds and came to this land, Sugar, frost, tea, snow, trillions of trees, Annual taxes of countless gold coins, Why do you tighten me so, heavens, why the anger, Taking my fat to supply the enemy, Greedy and insatiable, these big rats, What crime have the people committed to suffer this, Who destroyed Qin, three households of Chu, Not to mention millions of households in Fujian and Guangdong. Success or failure, benefit or disadvantage, are not what we see, Everyone swears to die and refuses to surrender, All hearts are one, who dares to insult. A sound of drawing swords and striking pillars, There is nothing else to say today, Those who do not follow, I will kill you with my own hands, The blue flag of the school stands with a yellow tiger, The whole city crowds to watch the empty streets dance, A gold seal as big as a dou is tightly held, Directly calling the president the governor; 'Today's government is for the people, Tainan and Taipei are firmly our territory, Do not cross the forbidden zone by even one step!' In the fifth month, the sea city winds howls, Three hundred golden-winged ships fly in, Chasing giant ships like a tide, The former climbs ashore, a brave tiger, The latter seizes the pass, a flying monkey, The village field's guns, Bizen swords, Fall when they are cut, blood pestles float, Gods burn and ghosts rot, city gates burn, Who can fight and defend, who can escape, A round of red sun is high in the sky. Thousands of white flags flutter in the wind, The elders and gentry invite each other, Kneeling on both sides of the road, bowing deeply, Red-tasseled bamboo caps, brocade ribbons, Blue silk braids hanging like clouds, Kneeling and holding silver plates of tea and cakes, Silk-soaked melons, purple grapes. 'General has come from afar, no doubt tired, Surrendered people respectfully guide the general.' The general said, 'Come, call your people, You and I are yellow-skinned compatriots originally, Extending from Prince Yan, a hero among men, Actually opening this land to divide the thatch, Today, return to me what Heaven has taught, The country is benevolent and wise like Tang Yao, Nurturing you and educating you, different from the Li people, Pacify your families, mother knows.' The general walks slowly, the dust does not stir, Ten thousand horses enter the city, the wind sighs, Alas, the general is not a god, The imperial army's might and virtue encompass all, Our lives are in the general's hands, How dare we not return to the enlightened and holy dynasty, Alas, alas, woe is you, the whole of Taiwan! Yesterday, how loyal and brave, today, how timid, All things reversed with a blink of an eye, Usually unprepared for war and defense, What do you rely on, calling yourselves 'loyal' and 'righteous'?"

### A Word on Helping Students

‚Äî Nian Hong

With the winter vacation just beginning, the biggest problem facing students is how to manage tuition for the next semester.

Studying is the right of the next generation of young people. It is truly shameful and disgraceful for this generation of middle-aged people to allow young people to struggle and appeal for the issue of dropping out of school. Students beg for money from door to door and work part-time in the cold and heat, warming themselves with their own hands. Can such a large society stand by and watch them live and die without providing assistance? "Youth are the pillars of society and the foundation of the country." This sentence has been known since writing weekly reports in elementary school. It is the most overused clich√©, but despite the dry mouths and calloused ears from hearing it, our "pillars" and "foundations" are becoming more and more fragile, unable to withstand ruthless destruction, and have reached the brink of ruin!

Student aid has been around for several years, but it gets more and more difficult each year, and worse each semester. The need becomes more urgent and widespread, while the supply decreases proportionally and becomes more difficult to obtain. The reason is simple: "Too busy to care for oneself, unable to help others." Only eight big words. Under the heavens, everyone is poor. Those with a conscience who are willing to help others have all become paupers. "Good people in the world are generally poor." Adding zero plus zero plus zero, even tens of millions of times, the result is still a zero. This society does not lack enthusiastic people, but unfortunately, enthusiastic people have nothing but a warm heart. They cannot even raise enough money for their own children's tuition, let alone the tuition for other people's children. Perhaps some people will say, "Ask the rich to donate generously! Isn't Shanghai full of rich people?" But this question can be turned around. If they were to donate generously, then they would not become rich. It is easy to ask someone wearing two thin layers of clothing to take off one layer to donate, but difficult to ask someone wrapped in thick furs like a big meat dumpling to take off a scarf. This is by no means an exaggeration, but a firsthand experience! The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, winter relief, each time involve hundreds of billions of dollars. Following that is the massive project of student aid. Before the end of the year when all industries are depressed and the market is sluggish, only God knows how much certainty there is!

Apart from student aid, a closely related issue is whether students have achieved the greatest results after receiving this aid. It is most unworthy to spend money on things that are unclear. If tuition is painstakingly raised, and after half a year, all the student gains is worsened eyesight, with nothing else practical, wouldn't student aid become a huge waste? Everyone knows that tuition is so expensive, but it is not the responsibility of the teachers. However, even if teachers cannot work on an empty stomach, they can still work extra hard to inspire students' wisdom and cultivate their abilities, thereby increasing the efficiency of the hard-earned student aid. Wise teachers will surely understand that this is also another form of student aid!

### Playwriting

‚Äî Yi

A female singer is co-writing a script with a famous playwright. When the news spread, two of her acquaintances began discussing the matter.

"I'm surprised," one said, "how can she write a script?"

"Isn't it easy?" the other replied disdainfully, "She probably writes the 'breaks' between scenes."

Wandering Flowers

### Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (57)

When Madame Zhang saw that he was strongly denying everything, she knew that Yunqing's guess was correct. She did not expose him at the time, but simply nodded and said, "We are relatives, and everything can be discussed. You know Yunqing's feelings, so don't harm her." Zhu Qi vaguely agreed a couple of times, then hastily excused himself, saying that it was time for work and rushed out. This made Madame Zhang angrily tell Yunqing, saying that she would find Zhu Qi's father to tell him about Zhu Qi's reckless behavior outside with the actress. Yunqing hurriedly stopped her, saying, "That would never do. If that happens, Zhu Qi and Qiyun will be forced to run away together and get married. I have another plan, so don't be angry, Mother." After saying this, she quickly washed up and went to Fengsheng's house. She saw that Fengsheng was working as usual, without any signs of depression. She asked if Zhu Qi had come in the past few days. Fengsheng said, "I don't want him to come either. It's useless for him to come. Meeting him only makes me upset. I hope he never comes." Yunqing never expected Fengsheng to say such a decisive thing. She asked, "Does he pay your living expenses on time?" Fengsheng said, "He's very punctual about that, always sending it on time. Last time I needed to use a little more money, I wrote him a note, and he immediately sent 30 million over. I can't even use it all up at once." Yunqing was surprised and said, "He sent you 30 million! How much is his monthly salary? Where did he get so much money?" Fengsheng said, "I don't care about that. It doesn't matter to me if he stole it. I'll just ask him for money when I run out." Yunqing bit her lip, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Things aren't that simple. I got some news today and came to tell you. Now that I hear Zhu Qi is giving you so much money, it further proves Zhu Qi's behavior. Can you guess where he got this money from?" As Yunqing spoke, her pair of decisive eyes looked at Fengsheng's face. Fengsheng replied with a blank expression, "How would I know! It doesn't matter to me where he got it from. It's none of my business." Yunqing shook her head, smiled slightly, and seriously said, "You can't say that. You need to know that recently, Zhu Qi has been very hot and heavy with the actress Xian Qiyun and may marry her." Yunqing thought that Fengsheng would be very affected by these words, but she remained wooden and simply rolled her eyes, saying, "I don't think he has the guts! He wouldn't dare marry an actress, wouldn't he be afraid of angering his father! His father will take care of him, so I don't need to worry." Yunqing said, "You can't look at it that way. What if he gets his father's permission? Then you'll be at a disadvantage!" Fengsheng said, "That will never happen. He doesn't have the guts." Yunqing said, "His divorcing you might be to marry Qiyun. How can you be so muddled! If you don't come out and stop it now, it will be a fait accompli in the future. What will you do then? Your future is too dangerous!"

### Song Jiang Subdues Fang La

‚Äî Zheng Guoyi

The novel claims that Fang La was defeated by Song Jiang. However, the "History of the Song Dynasty" only records that Hou Meng wanted to recruit Song Jiang to suppress Fang La, and nothing more. In fact, it never happened. Moreover, after Song Jiang surrendered to Zhang Shuye, his name no longer appeared in historical records. Fang La was captured by Han Shizhong (see the memorial stele of Prince Han and the biography of Han Shizhong in the "History of the Song Dynasty"), which had nothing to do with Song Jiang. It seems that the novel's claim is unfounded. However, I read in the "Record of Treacherous Officials in the Restoration Era": "In the second year of Xuanhe, Fang La rebelled in Muzhou, capturing the prefectures of Wen, Tai, Wu, Chu, Hang, and Xiu, shaking the southeast. Tong Guan was appointed as the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangzhe, leading Liu Yanqing, Liu Guangshi, Xin Qizong, Song Jiang, and over 200,000 troops to suppress him... When Guan arrived in Zhejiang, he led the generals to capture La and sent him to the capital." Although it does not explicitly state Song Jiang's battle achievements, it is evident that Song Jiang participated in the suppression of Fang La. Moreover, Song Jiang is specifically listed alongside generals such as Liu Yanqing, Liu Guangshi, and Xin Qizong, indicating that Jiang's position at that time was not very low. Therefore, the novel's description has some basis and is not entirely fabricated. However, although Song Jiang once roamed Hebei, the historical records about him are not as detailed as those about Fang La. His rampant behavior was far less than that of Fang La. However, people today talk about Song Jiang and Liangshanbo, but do not mention Fang La and Zhang's influence, which is due to the embellishment and exaggeration of Song Jiang in the novel "Remnants of Xuanhe" and "Water Margin."

### The Burden of a Job

‚Äî Ji Mo

One day, I went to a small restaurant near my office to eat. I saw a young man in his twenties wearing a brand new Western suit. The tailoring of his clothes was not fashionable, and one could tell at a glance that it was made by a Western suit shop in the interior. Later, I met him several times. As time went on, I gradually became acquainted with him. I only knew that he worked as a small clerk in a company engaged in import and export business.

Another day, as the fine snow fell, I came out of the office and aimlessly walked into this small restaurant to sit for a while, because it also sold drinks such as milk and coffee. For convenience of writing, let's call him Mr. K.

I chatted with him for a while, and later Mr. K talked about his simple resume and occupation. It turned out that his ancestral home was in a remote province of China. His father was a big landlord, but he did not have much cash. After graduating from a local university, because he was unwilling to live in a small city, his family sold part of their property to send him to Shanghai to find a job and also to learn more about the world.

His father had many long-time friends in Shanghai, some of whom were influential figures. Therefore, he was soon placed in an import and export company and started his office life.

What he found inconvenient was that he was alone in Shanghai and lived in the home of a family friend. Firstly, because the journey was too far, and secondly, because living with elders inevitably restricted his daily life, so he had to find another hotel near the office. As a result, his monthly expenses were very high. It is said that he had spent about 70 million yuan, including travel expenses and pocket money, from his hometown to Shanghai. Currently, his family still had to send him 15 million yuan per month because, according to his frank admission, his monthly salary was only 3 million yuan, which was not even enough to pay for the hotel rent.

I suggested for him, "Could you find a cheaper hotel?"

He said, "Hotels in Shanghai are very expensive. When I first came to Shanghai, the rent for XX Hotel was 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per day, but now it must be more than 1 million yuan. The hotel I live in is already considered cheap."

I said, "If you come to Shanghai to do a big business and have a monthly income of 100 to 200 million yuan, you might as well stay at XX Hotel, but your income is only 3 million yuan, and staying at a hotel that costs 60,000 to 70,000 yuan and also having to pay for dinner seems a bit inappropriate."

He said, "I don't mind spending more money. I just hope to gain more experience." As he spoke, he smiled at me.

I thought about it for him. If he didn't have this job, he wouldn't need this expense. I used to only know the idiom "the burden of life," but now I found that there is also such a thing as "the burden of a job." So I said to him, "If you are determined to learn, you should work ten hours instead of eight. Only then will your investment not be wasted."

Indeed, in this kaleidoscopic metropolis, with the complexity of personnel and the constant changes in the environment, you are constantly exposed to new things. As long as you have accurate judgment and fully absorb them, you can be like a dried sponge, filled with the water of knowledge. Then, like Mr. K's example, although he may temporarily feel that his job is a burden, he will eventually reap rewards from his job one day.

### Talking about Sable Coats in the Cold Winter

‚Äî Mao Yi

As soon as winter arrives, the most fashionable clothing for women is fur coats, and sable fur is the best among fur coats. Although a coat made of high-quality seal, otter, or Persian lamb fur is more expensive than a second-rate sable coat, many people consider the latter a symbol of "nobility."

The sable is related to the weasel. It is said that the sable is "the most cruel and ferocious of all weasels, full of energy, and has tireless activity." Judging from the worship of sable coats by vain women, one wonders if these characteristics of the sable have been transferred to them?

The soft and delicate quality and the bright and clean fur are the characteristics of excellent sable fur. The color ranges from light brown to dark brown. Coats made from wild sables are sold for a lot of money. In the United States, a good sable coat is priced as high as seven thousand dollars. Even domesticated "domestic sables" are valuable, and a coat made from them can be sold for more than two thousand five hundred dollars.

The most fashionable is the "mutation sable" or silver-blue sable. The value of a coat made from this kind of sable is almost unbelievable. An ordinary fur coat only sells for about two hundred US dollars, but the price of a silver-blue sable coat is between thirteen thousand and sixteen thousand US dollars.

However, "sable coat fanatics" can go to second-hand shops to dig up their objects of worship. There, old sable coats only sell for four hundred to six hundred US dollars, and they look very new.

Sewing a high-quality sable coat requires many processes. An excellent fur merchant has greater talent than a craftsman; he must also be an artist. First, many pieces of fur are put together to compare the colors. Then, the whole piece of fur is cut into small pieces, carefully matched together, and then spread and fastened on a cardboard according to the shape of the coat. The next step is to nail them to the wall with about ten thousand nails and leave them there for two or three days to dry. The difference between an ordinary fur coat and a beautiful fur coat lies in this nailing and cutting technique.

After drying, the parts are sewn together. The next step is sampling, polishing, ironing, combing, and careful inspection. In short, it must be made into a perfect fur coat! That is, the most expensive luxury item.

### President Truman's Ghostwriter

‚Äî Jin Jin

President Truman, as the head of a country, deals with a myriad of affairs every day. In most cases, he naturally cannot spare the time to write leisurely. And Mr. Clark Clifford, who is only in his early forties this year, is President Truman's mouthpiece, typewriter, and ghostwriter.

Mr. Clifford has a square face, dignified appearance, curly hair, and a robust figure. At first glance, he looks quite like the British movie star Robert Montgomery. Most of the documents signed by President Truman and the speeches he delivers are written by him. The tax reduction bill passed by the United States not long ago was also drafted by Mr. Clifford.

In fact, Mr. Clifford is loyal to his duty and conscientious in his work. He handles any unfinished business in the President's hands one by one. He is not only the President's confidant but also an extraordinary confidential secretary, often holding full power to handle matters on his behalf.

According to the White House, the President's residence is constantly ringing with telephones every day, and official documents fly in like snowflakes. Clifford must handle them personally, replying as much as possible, so as to minimize the amount of affairs transferred to the President for handling.

This ghostwriter of the great President once worked under Samuel Rosenman, an aide to President Roosevelt. However, the time was quite short, and the latter was also President Roosevelt's ghostwriter.

When Clifford is assigned to draft a document, he must collect information, select some, and keep some for use. He dictates the first draft, and the secretary records it sentence by sentence. After that, he carefully revises the original manuscript, considering the meaning and weight of each word. Sometimes, it needs to be revised as many as ten times. After he finishes drafting, nineteen out of ten times President Truman only slightly changes the figures. Although the final draft of the speech does not have the sharpness, aggressiveness, or implicit meaning of the texts co-authored by Roosevelt and Rosenman, it is often concise, comprehensive, and easy to read.

Before Clifford stepped into the White House, he studied law in St. Louis in his early years and later became a lawyer in that city, quickly rising to prominence. During World War II, he served in the Navy, showing his talent and rising from lieutenant to captain. He was also supported by his old friend Wunderman, entered the Presidential Palace as a naval counselor, and was deeply appreciated by President Truman. His future is unlimited.

### New "Casting Love"

‚Äî Jia Nan

Gunter Wulff and his beautiful girlfriend Louise took their lives like Romeo and Juliet.

Gunter, nineteen, was a pre-med student at the University of Berlin, and lived with his mother in a small apartment in the French sector of Berlin. His father was a prisoner of war remaining in the Soviet Union. While attending the university, Gunter joined the anti-Communist Social Democratic Party, but he did not give speeches or attend meetings, only helping out at home, doing schoolwork, and often seeing his girlfriend Louise.

Louise's father, an official of the Communist Socialist Unity Party, hated all anti-Communists. When he discovered that Gunter was a member of the Social Democratic Party, he immediately kicked him out and forbade Gunter from entering his house again.

Two weeks ago, he received a call from a friend, and he agreed to visit that friend. So he walked to the Soviet sector of Berlin. As soon as he stepped out of the subway station, he was arrested by several secret police and put in a prison van. Coincidentally, the van overturned on the way, and Gunter escaped.

The next day, he reported his experience to the district branch of the Social Democratic Party. Subsequently, he was sent to the party headquarters, because there was a special department there to solve problems similar to Gunter's. After explaining to the headquarters, Gunter received a threatening letter from the Soviet sector, and then another letter, and another letter. He was afraid, he was depressed, and he ran back to his party headquarters to make a more detailed complaint. The headquarters told him that his situation was dangerous and offered to send him out of Berlin.

At first, he was happy to be able to leave Berlin, but then he thought of Louise‚Äîthought of his future‚Äîthought of the concentration camp. He made up his mind, put the poison in his pocket, and went to meet his forbidden lover. In the twilight hours, in the forest near Spindlersfeld, the police found Gunter and Louise, embracing each other, passing away from the world. (Translated from "Time" magazine)

Reply to "Shen Bao Reader"

As instructed, according to the Ministry of Education, it is claimed that:

Night schools do not have formal student status and are only considered supplementary learning.

The college's registration procedures have not yet been completed, and students' academic status has not been reported to the Ministry for approval.

The Ministry of Education has not yet approved the college's registration, and since students' academic status has not been approved, it is even more difficult for accelerated students to have their academic status recognized by the Ministry.
