### Sun Ke Took Office at the Executive Yuan This Morning; Convened the First Executive Yuan Meeting; Full Cabinet List Officially Released; Dong Xian Guang Denies President Agreed to Resume Peace Talks

[Special Dispatch from United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Director of the Government Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, issued the following statement to United Press on the evening of the 22nd:

"Director of the Government Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, categorically denies the claims that President Chiang has agreed to resume peace talks and decided to step down when a peace agreement is reached. The aforementioned report is absolutely inaccurate." United Press had reported on the 21st, based on absolutely reliable sources, news regarding peace talks. Dong's denial is in response to this.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The full list of Sun Ke's cabinet members, after being approved by the Kuomintang Central Political Committee, was immediately appointed by the President. The new cabinet is scheduled to take office at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and the first Executive Yuan meeting will be held at 10:00 AM. The cabinet, which had been delayed for nearly a month, has finally been formed.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that Sun Ke has decided to appoint Ni Jiong Sheng, the Director of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] After the list of Sun Ke's cabinet was announced on the 22nd, it attracted great attention from all parties. An authoritative figure stated that the biggest changes in Sun Ke's cabinet are twofold: first, many of the selected ministers are new faces; second, the political councilors hold significant weight. Among the heads of ministries and commissions in the Weng cabinet, only Xu Kan, Yu Da Wei, Gu Zheng Gang, Guan Ji Yu, Pang Song Zhou, and Sun Yue Qi are reappointed. Liu Wei Chi has been changed from Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Bai Yun Ti has been promoted from Deputy Chairman to Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In addition, Wu Tie Cheng, Hong Lan You, Xu Yong Chang, Mei Yi Qi, Zhong Tian Xin, Lin Ke Sheng, Mei Ru Ao, Wu Shang Ying, Dai Kui Sheng, and others are all "new faces," and many of them are serving as political officials for the first time. As for the political councilors, in addition to Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhi Zhong, Chen Li Fu, and Weng Wen Hao, who were strongly invited by Sun Ke, former Vice President Zhang Li Sheng and Minister of Education Zhu Jia Hua were also invited to remain in the cabinet as political councilors. Almost all leaders of various factions within the party have been included, creating a cabinet of leading figures representing party unity. The selection of political councilors fully demonstrates that they will be the center of decision-making. It is also learned that Mei Yi Qi's appointment as Minister of Education was a last-minute decision. The list on the evening of the 21st still had Li Zheng. Because Mei arrived in Nanjing on the 21st, he was asked to take the position. However, Mei stated that if the situation in Beiping improved, he would return to Tsinghua University and therefore insisted on declining. However, authoritative figures believe that he may be persuaded to withdraw his resignation.

If elected, he will need a government special plane to pick him up. However, if the members of the Legislative Yuan still support their proposed candidates, Tong Guanxian and Cheng Tianfang, it will scatter the votes and require several elections. It is also learned that the Renovation Club held a detailed discussion on this matter on the 22nd and decided to abide by the party's decision and support the election of Li and Liu.

### Communist Bandits Retreat After Dividing into Groups in the Suburbs of Beiping; The Artillery War Around Tianjin Also Somewhat Eased Yesterday; Fierce Battles Occurred Northwest of Tanggu and Around Xinhe

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Beiping, Afternoon of the 22nd] The suburbs of Beiping are calm and peaceful today. The surrounding communist troops have all retreated. According to intelligence obtained from relevant sources, since last night, one group has moved towards Tianjin, and another group has retreated towards the mountainous areas northwest of Beiping and along the Ping Sui Railway towards Shahe, Qinghe, and Nankou. The communists' intention seems to be to transfer to the Chahar and Suiyuan areas or to move south to intensify the siege of Tianjin. The area between the eastern suburbs of Beiping and Shuangqiao has been brought under the control of the National Army. There is also no fighting within ten li of the western suburbs. The National Army has searched the area within twenty li. The communist bandits in the southwestern and northwestern suburbs have also retreated in separate groups.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Tianjin, 22nd] The artillery war around Tianjin continued, but was somewhat eased compared to the 21st. On the line of Yixingbu and Tianqimiao north of Tianjin, the National Army is still firmly defending, and the communist attacks have been repelled.

The reporter also witnessed a large number of civilians assisting the National Army in building fortifications in the war zone. The buildings outside the city defense have been completely demolished, and the National Army's position has been solidified.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced on the 22nd: The battle around Tianjin continues smoothly in front of the National Army's strong positions. In the area north of Tianjin, a communist force of about 1,000 people attempted to attack Liutan and Dingzigu on the evening of the 21st, and fierce battles broke out with the National Army. After a night of fierce fighting, more than 800 communist troops were killed or wounded, and the fighting subsided on the morning of the 22nd. The communist bandits attacking Dingxingbu and Bridge No. 24 only had sporadic battles on the 22nd due to their disastrous defeat on the 21st.

### New York Times Article Calls for; US to Clarify China Policy; Continued Aid Must Not Allow China to Be Red

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The New York Times published a special article today calling for the immediate clarification of the United States' policy towards China. The newspaper pointed out that the decision to provide $275 million in non-military aid to China was made long before China was plunged into the current crisis. The newspaper continued: The current situation urgently requires more frank words. The United States cannot allow China to be turned red, and the consequences of China's turning red cannot be viewed with indifference. The newspaper insisted that the continuation of US aid is an important factor for the Chinese people.

[Dispatch from United Press, New York, 22nd] A "New York Times" editorial on the 22nd, in view of the military situation in China, called for a revision of the United States' policy towards China. The newspaper said: "The United States has spent much effort and money in preventing the communist conquest of Greece. The crisis of the communist conquest of China is far greater than that of Greece. We cannot be indifferent, nor should we be concerned about the possibility of saving China from communist rule through a united government in which the communists will occupy major positions, as we have very clear experience of the consequences of such a compromise." "On the other hand, we cannot argue that the current Chinese government has or has not met the conditions attached to continued US aid. The decision of China's leaders and government is a matter for China, not the United States, but if continued US aid is an important factor for the Chinese people, then of course, the United States can inform the Chinese people of the United States' views on a government of this union, representing China's liberal organizations, as the best hope for resisting further communist attacks and later recovering lost territory."

### Traffic on the Pukou-Bengbu Section Unobstructed; The Communist Bandits on the Bengbu-Suxian Battlefield are Gasping for Breath and Reorganizing; National Army Sweeping Up the Remaining Bandits on Both Sides of the Hui River

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] It is reported that the situation in the Hongze Lake area has not changed significantly. The 34th Brigade of the communist bandits recently sneaked to the north of Xuyi and has not taken any action. The local communist bandits on both sides of the Pukou-Bengbu section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are under the supervision of the National Army and have no room to肆擾. Minor damage to the railway has occurred in the past few days, but it can be repaired at any time and will not affect traffic.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] Military news: The remaining communist bandits on the Bengbu-Suxian battlefield are resting and reorganizing in their original positions. The rumor that they have fled west is not true. According to current information, the Liu bandit's 26th and 2nd Columns are in the area between the Hui River and the Fei River, west of Baojiaji. The 3rd Column is east of Renqiao, and the 11th Column is to its west. Military officials said that the National Army on the Bengbu front is advancing north along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, using attacks and searches as passive defense against the Huainan area. As for the northern front, the communist bandits' pressure has been greatly reduced, but if the National Army there wants to move closer to Huainan, it will require a battle.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The Suppression Headquarters communiqué: (1) There are no main communist forces near Guzhen. The National Army is sweeping up the remaining local communist bandits on both sides of the Hui River. (2) The communist bandits facing the Du Yuming troops on the northern front are demoralized due to rain and food shortages. The National Army is taking this opportunity to launch a full-scale attack on the bandits.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] Tonight's Suppression Headquarters communiqué stated: According to communist prisoners, Liu bandit was bombed to death by the air force in Taoyuanji (north of Xinxianji and south of Suxian), and his body was transported to Suxian. The communist side is planning to hold a memorial service.

### Editorial How to Obtain Glorious Peace?

The new cabinet that was "summoned a thousand times" finally landed yesterday. Since President Sun was ordered to form a cabinet, it has been almost a month, with many consultations and near abortion, but it was finally able to bring together the giants yesterday to form a list, seemingly becoming a cabinet unanimously supported by the entire Kuomintang. This cannot be said to be Sun's success. Moreover, on the eve of the formation of the new cabinet, President Sun announced to foreign reporters that his cabinet was a fighting cabinet that would continue to fight until glorious peace was achieved. This startling statement gave the new cabinet, which debuted with fanfare, a sense of being "extraordinary." As the saying goes, "A hungry person is easily fed, and a thirsty person is easily given drink." The common people, struggling with hardship, cannot help but place endless hope on hearing the tune of "glorious peace."

However, even though the call for glorious peace has been made, how to obtain glorious peace is something the new cabinet may not have any immediate solutions or confidence in. It's as if the tune is well-chosen, but whether the singer has a beautiful and smooth voice is another matter. Therefore, even though the common people harbor full of expectations, whether what they expect can become a reality is another question.

Let's be honest: Is there anyone in the world who doesn't want to live a happy and peaceful life? Is there anyone among the Chinese people who fought the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan who doesn't want to see the dawn of peace soon? However, if peace can only be obtained at the sacrifice of freedom, then what value does the peace of slaves have? Moreover, "all feasts must come to an end," and there is no war that does not eventually return to peace. Where there is war, there must be peace; and both sides in the war hope for a glorious peace. Therefore, although "glorious peace" is a beautiful term that can win people's hearts without losing face, it is actually superfluous nonsense.

Moreover, the question becomes: What exactly is the connotation of glorious peace? I am afraid that everyone will have a different opinion. As far as the warring parties are concerned, the first party often believes that peace on these terms is glorious, while the second party does not; the second party believes that peace on those terms is glorious, while the first party does not agree. So how can both sides be made to believe that it is a glorious peace? That is the first difficulty. In the past, the government called for the Chinese Communists to be traitors, and suppressing the rebellion was for the sake of defending the country. If it is now truly eager for peace, without waiting for the rebellion to be suppressed before speaking of peace, I really don't know how the honorable gentlemen will explain themselves to the past calls to defend the country? And how will they face the martyrs who shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for the sake of suppressing the rebellion and defending the country under the Nine Springs? That is the second difficulty. Moreover, even though the government has spoken this vague and unclear phrase, the Chinese Communists have yet to respond, while the so-called anti-government faction in Hong Kong, which is the vanguard of the Chinese Communists, has already shouted out that it will never compromise, indicating that it is determined to fight to the final victory. It can be seen that the government wants nothing more than to preserve its "integrity as a tile," while the Chinese Communists are determined to "shatter like jade." That is the third difficulty.

I have heard that when President Sun was firmly inviting the giants to join the cabinet, some giants took the premise that the cabinet must have the power of war and peace as their prerequisite for joining the cabinet. Based on this, the direction of Sun's cabinet may make some efforts in the direction of hoping to obtain glorious peace. However, this also cannot help but make people doubt. There should always be a purpose for doing something, let alone forming a cabinet. What kind of cabinet is Sun's cabinet? A fighting cabinet? A peace talk cabinet? Or a cabinet that is both fighting and peaceful? A cabinet that is neither fighting nor peaceful? Not fighting or peaceful is definitely not a solution. Both fighting and peaceful is also illogical. Therefore, Sun's cabinet, which is ordered in a time of crisis, has only two paths to choose from in the future, either war or peace, either peace or war; one cannot have both fish and bear's paw. Judging from President Sun's remarks, on the one hand, he said "will continue to fight," on the other hand, he said "absolutely will not surrender," on the third hand he said "the repetition of Poland and Czechoslovakia is a lesson to be learned," and on the fourth hand he said "the government has the determination to suppress bandits and will never lightly compromise." Sun's cabinet should be a full-fledged fighting cabinet, but why did he add a superfluous word of glorious peace? It must be known that glorious peace can only be sought through efforts in combat, and there is no other way! If it is said that a path to peace can be explored simply by saying a word of "glorious peace," then that is truly a miracle. In our humble opinion, Sun's cabinet today is to the Chinese Communists as Britain was to the Nazis back then. It must either be a Chamberlain cabinet or a Churchill cabinet, and it cannot be hoped that a good article can be written in the cracks.

In short, who doesn't hope for peace? Who doesn't hope for a glorious peace? However, there is no need to say it today. Just strive to reform politics, strive to reform the military, strive to boost morale on the battlefield, fight victorious battles, strive to suppress the rich and appease popular anger in the rear, then the return of the people's hearts will be like water flowing downwards, and glorious peace will come naturally without being expected. Otherwise, shouting as much as you want, no one will pay attention, peace will not be obtained, and glory will be swept away first, so what is the point? Moreover, fortunately, as wished, the fighting will end early, and together with the Chinese Communists to discuss the Tao and jointly plan governance, then the future trend of China will be nothing more than a continuation of Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Where is the glory then?

### Draft Amendment to the Business Tax Law Approved by the Political Affairs Council The Starting Point for Taxation Will Be Drafted by Provinces and Cities with Reference to Local Conditions

[Our newspaper Nanjing 22nd telegram] The Ministry of Finance believes that the implementation of the business tax law has been long, and now it is no longer applicable due to the currency reform. It has specially drafted an amendment and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. It has been discussed and approved at the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 22nd and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. The main points of the revision are as follows: (1) The starting point for taxation will be drafted by the provincial and municipal governments according to the following four scopes, with reference to local economic conditions, and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation after being approved by the provincial and municipal public opinion organs. A. The monthly business income of merchants residing in a permanent business location is from 500 to 1,000 Gold Yuan. B. The monthly business income of merchants residing in a permanent business location is from 150 to 300 Gold Yuan. C. The amount of income from each business transaction for travelling merchants is from 150 to 300 Gold Yuan. D. The amount of income from each business transaction for travelling merchants is from 50 to 100 Gold Yuan. (2) Business tax for merchants residing in a permanent business location shall be declared monthly and assessed once every three months. Article 8 of the current Business Tax Law stipulates that the business tax for merchants residing in a permanent business location shall be assessed once every three months, that is, the tax amount for March, April, and May shall be assessed at once in June and paid separately in June, July, and August. The tax payment for the current month must be collected two months later. Now that local finances are difficult and business tax is an important local tax revenue, it has been changed to monthly declaration and payment of business tax according to the reported amount, but assessed once every three months, with refunds for overpayments and additional payments for underpayments, to meet the needs. (3) The business tax of travelling merchants shall be withheld and paid by the trade and barter businesses. It is found that most of the travelling merchants have relatively thick capital and do not have stores in the sales location. Most of the sales are introduced by the trade and barter businesses, and it is easy to steal and evade business tax. The draft amendment stipulates that the business tax of travelling merchants shall be withheld and paid by the trade and barter businesses, and a reward of 1% shall be given, following the example of the income tax law. If they do not withhold and pay according to the regulations, in addition to being ordered to pay the taxes within a time limit, they shall also be fined three to six times the amount of the evaded tax, to ensure specialization and prevent concealment. (4) Adjustment of fines. Articles 18 to 26 of the current Business Tax Law are all provisions on fines. Now that the currency system has been changed to the Gold Yuan standard, the fines in legal tender should be amended. This draft stipulates that those who violate the tax law in minor circumstances shall be fined less than 100 Gold Yuan, and those who violate the tax law in serious circumstances shall be fined three to six times the amount of the evaded tax, as originally stipulated. Those who pay taxes overdue shall be subject to a late payment surcharge. (5) Fines shall be collected by the tax authorities. Article 25 of the current Business Tax Law stipulates that business tax fines shall be implemented by court ruling. However, the courts are busy with civil and criminal litigation and other cases, and it is often difficult to make prompt rulings on business tax fines, which makes it difficult to alert businessmen to the psychology of neglecting tax payment and greatly affects tax revenue. It has been repeatedly requested by the provinces to change to administrative agencies to handle it by themselves, which urgently needs to be remedied. It is stipulated that fines, late payment surcharges, and suspension of business shall all be determined and executed by the municipal and county governments, but if the tax arrears are not paid for more than 30 days, it is stipulated that the judicial organs shall recover them. (6) The rules for tax collection shall be formulated by the provinces and cities themselves. Business tax is collected by the local government. In order to adapt to the local environment, this draft stipulates that the provinces and cities may formulate their own tax collection rules within the scope of the tax law and its implementation rules, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation to facilitate collection.

### Letter of Impeachment Against the Young Company from the Supervisory Committee, Continued from Yesterday's First Edition

(丑) Preliminary Handling of the Case by the Competent Authority: Upon receiving a report forwarded by the Lujiawan Sub-Bureau on September 29th, the Shanghai Police Bureau immediately instructed Ji Dechun, the head of the investigation team of the Economic Police Squad, along with team member Mao Xinfu and others, to rush to investigate. Simultaneously, the bureau reported the matter by telephone to the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office. That office stated that the Young Company had already submitted an English inventory list, and instructed them to retrieve it and check against the actual stock. Mao Xinfu and others then, together with Chen Zhenhua, the deputy director of the finance department of the company, Gao Wenhui, the warehouse manager, and others, checked the inventory against the list. However, the units recorded on the English inventory list were sometimes counted by bottle and sometimes by piece, and most of the goods in the warehouse were packed in wooden boxes, making it impossible to verify them without opening each box. Among them, there were over two thousand boxes of Western medicine and no less than one hundred boxes of concentrated cod liver oil, which were still stored in the air-conditioned room. Part of the concentrated cod liver oil had already spoiled, indicating that it had been stored for more than a year. The team members only made a general check, and then affixed seals to the wooden boxes. Secretary Jiang and Deputy Director Chen of the company even claimed: "This case has been closed, and the sealed materials of our company will be unsealed soon, so there is no need to issue a custody receipt." The team members then reported the investigation to Team Leader Cheng Yi Kuan on October 4th, who forwarded it to the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office on October 8th via a telegram from the Shanghai Police Bureau. After arriving in Shanghai, Zai Wei and Yue Guang went to the police bureau and the social bureau to review the case files, and together with the original handlers, rushed to the company's warehouses to conduct an on-site inspection. The next day, they sent a telegram to the Shanghai Police Bureau, stating: "This case should be handled by your bureau in accordance with the regulations for this general material registration and inspection. If there are any violations of the regulations, they should be handled according to law, and we hope to be informed of the handling progress." This is the process of handling the case by the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office from the date of its occurrence to October 20th. (寅) Re-investigation: After arriving in Shanghai, starting from October 12th, they successively visited the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office, the Shanghai Police Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Transportation Control Committee, and the Jianghai Customs Office to inquire about the case. They also accompanied the original handlers to the company's warehouses for on-site inspections, and met with Kong Lingkan, the chairman and general manager of the company. According to him, the company was registered and established in April of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), with a capital of 100 million yuan. In July of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the capital was increased to 1 billion yuan, divided into one million shares, of which Kong Lingkan held 249,000 shares. The company mainly engaged in import and export trade. In order to clarify the exact dates and actual quantities of the company's imported goods, and whether the import exchange settlement was legal and whether there were any improper substitutions, Zai Wei and Yue Guang supervised Xue Dulie, an auditor from the Ministry of Audit, and personnel dispatched by the Shanghai Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit, together with Wang Xiangpu, the team leader of the action team of the Economic Police Squad dispatched by the Shanghai Police Bureau, to request the company to provide the general ledger, subsidiary ledger, and import exchange settlement ledger. The company only submitted a copy of the English inventory list submitted to the Economic Control and Supervision Office with added dates, and a list of foreign exchange already received. It refused to hand over other important account books, making it impossible to verify them. Kong Lingkan also avoided meeting them, and Chen Zhenhua, the deputy director of the finance department, claimed: "The company was established not long ago, the accounts are incomplete, and a comprehensive investigation is quite complicated, so it is inconvenient to hand them over," repeatedly refusing. Zai Wei and Yue Guang sent separate letters to the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Municipal Government, requesting them to immediately investigate and report back according to their authority. By October 30th, the company submitted an English inventory list, customs cargo import tax payment receipts, and a transcribed list of foreign exchange already received (from June 5th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946) to October 5th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948)) to the Municipal Government for review. Mayor Wu sent Counselor Lin to conduct a review item by item together with Xue Dulie, an auditor from the Ministry of Audit, and agreed to open the wooden boxes to inspect the inventory. They also cooperated with Zhang, the deputy director of the police bureau designated by the Municipal Government, to conduct random checks on the materials stored in the wooden boxes. In fact, the company had three to four thousand boxes of inventory, and the types of goods were no less than three to four hundred. After a month had passed, it was inevitable that some goods had been moved. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of this random check. Now, we will briefly summarize the randomly checked goods as follows:

(1) Goods that are prohibited from import and goods that are temporarily suspended from import include: (1) Ninety-three boxes of cosmetics (among which, in addition to the discovery that flour is prohibited from import, the rest are also on the list of suspended imports), (2) 2,848 pieces of glass raincoats, (3) 1,915 pieces of glass headscarves, (4) 55 glass handbags, (5) 2,960 glass toothbrushes, (6) 594 dozens of glass combs, (7) 45 silk summer clothes, (8) 405 boxes of foreign wine, which were said to have been purchased from the Shanghai American Transportation Company in August of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), (9) Five boxes of woolen curtain cloth, (10) Six boxes of woolen goods, (11) 1,293 pairs of rubber shoes, (12) 994 golden safety razors, (13) 26 glass plates, (14) 122 glass baby clothes, (15) 744 silk undergarments, (16) 306 sets of fountain pens, (17) 197 pairs of baby shoes, (18) 53 mirrors, (19) 2,624 glass teacups, (20) 655 glass suspenders, (21) 168 travel bags, (22) Two boxes of woolen odds and ends, (23) 799 glass belts, (24) 22 handbags, (25) 2,957 pairs of glass women's shoes (the above seven types are said to have been taxed before the promulgation of import and export regulations).

(2) Daily necessities include: (1) Approximately 1,900 bags of 95 tons of sugar, (2) 274 boxes, 68 barrels, and 132 cans of kerosene.

(3) Industrial raw materials include: (1) 170 barrels, 205 boxes, 200 bottles, 23 boxes (each box contains 4 dozen and 46 cans) of various pigments, (2) 8 large and 48 small barrels of caustic soda, (3) 32 barrels and 379 pounds of gold powder, (4) 348 sheets of steel plates, (5) Approximately 6,000 kilograms and 30 of steel bars (including 120 kilograms of stainless steel), (6) 64 boxes of galvanized iron sheets, (7) 320 barrels and 66 boxes of varnish, (8) 104 barrels of Vaseline (including 4 barrels of white Vaseline), (9) One box and ten sheets of raw leather and cowhide, three boxes and one hundred and sixty sheets of sheepskin, (10) 380 sheets of glass leather, (11) Seven rolls of cigarette paper, (12) 25 boxes of copper wire, (13) Two boxes of sulfuric acid, (14) Seventeen boxes of lacquer powder, (15) Fourteen barrels of white medicine.

### U.S. Applies Economic Pressure to the Netherlands to Stop Military Action in Indonesia; Orders Suspension of Aid to the Netherlands East Indies; U.S. Accuses Netherlands of Being an Aggressor in the Security Council

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] The United States today suspended aid to the Netherlands East Indies under the Marshall Plan, pending the resolution of the Netherlands' war against the Republic of Indonesia. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman has cabled instructions to the branch office in the Netherlands to comply. It is said that this action was decided after full consultation with the State Department, but it apparently has no impact on aid to the Netherlands itself.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Netherlands representative Van Royen told the United Nations Security Council on the 22nd that the Netherlands government will continue to fight in Indonesia, regardless of the cost and consequences. Van Royen reiterated the Netherlands' position that the Indonesian war is purely an internal affair and the Security Council has no right to interfere. The Security Council held a meeting on the morning of the 22nd to consider the Dutch military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia. Malik returned to Paris from Berlin and attended the Security Council on the 22nd. The United States took a tough stance and strongly accused the Netherlands of being an aggressor. Van Royen pleaded on behalf of the Netherlands, insisting that the sole purpose of the Indonesian war was to "eliminate extremists." He said: "Law and order must prevail. We are facing a catastrophic situation. Negotiations have broken down, so the Netherlands government has taken necessary action." Van Royen also said that the government of the Republic of Indonesia is quite dependent on communist leaders, "so it is greatly influenced by communism. It is well known that the Indonesian Communist Party has close ties with the communist parties of Burma, Malaya, and other Southeast Asian countries. Moreover, they all receive instructions from the same center." After speaking for ninety minutes, Van Royen summarized the goals of the Netherlands government as follows: "We will fight to restore true peace in Indonesia, and then we will establish an independent United States of Indonesia as soon as possible. We will uphold the principles of both the Linggadjati and Renville Agreements and implement them. We will follow this path unswervingly and will not give up halfway." Van Royen accused the Republic of countless violations of the ceasefire order, "According to reliable information, approximately 11,000 Indonesian soldiers have infiltrated in small groups across the demarcation line and are now behind Dutch positions." Van Royen told the Security Council: "Adhering to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has no right to interfere in this matter. Under the Charter, the Security Council can only deal with cases that endanger international peace and security. Everyone knows that the Indonesian events do not endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. The development of Indonesia is not a disruption of international peace, but a disruption of internal peace. Neighboring countries such as Australia, India, and the Philippines are very interested in resolving the Indonesian issue, which I fully understand. However, this does not mean that the Security Council can interfere in the internal affairs of the Netherlands."

[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] The United Nations Indonesia Mediation Committee sent an angry report to the Security Council on the 22nd, denouncing the Netherlands government for not being sincere in resolving the Indonesian dispute peacefully, while pretending to negotiate and preparing for war on the other hand.

### Fierce Battles Around Yogyakarta; Indonesian Leaders Call on the People to Implement a Scorched Earth Policy; The Government of the Republic Still Performing Its Duties in the Capital

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: The Dutch Supreme Command announced that the Dutch army occupied the airport in Bukittinggi, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia on Sumatra, without resistance, and said that the airport was not damaged and could be used immediately. In central Java, the Dutch army occupied the Tegal sugar-producing area between Yogyakarta and Solo.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: Indonesian Republican broadcasting stated that Yogyakarta and its surrounding areas are still engaged in fierce battles, and several cities in Java are burning. Armed uprisings are brewing in Cirebon, Brebes, and Tegal in western Java, and in Malang and Surabaya in eastern Java.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st, Associated Press] According to the news agency of the Republic of Indonesia, Indonesian radio broadcast at 14:30 (Greenwich Mean Time) that the Indonesian government is still performing its duties in the capital. The sender was the Sumatra Committee Office of Indonesia, and the receivers were the representatives of Indonesia in Singapore, New Delhi, and Bangkok. Also, the word "capital" was not explained in the telegram.

[United Press International, Batavia, 22nd] Dutch military operations are shrouded in mystery, and telegrams sent by foreign journalists are subject to censorship, so the truth is difficult to ascertain. However, it has been proven that Madiun, the third largest city in Indonesia, has not fallen. Indonesian resistance leaders called for a scorched earth policy on Madiun radio last night.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] According to the announcement on the 22nd, after Dutch paratroopers captured Yogyakarta, the capital of Indonesia, on the 19th, Dutch armored columns also entered Yogyakarta and joined forces with the paratroopers. Other Dutch troops occupied Solo (the largest city in the Republic of Indonesia) and the major oil refining center of Cepu in northeastern Java. The Dutch headquarters in Semarang announced that Dutch armored columns entered Yogyakarta at 8:00 PM on the 21st and took over the city from the paratroopers. The paratroopers said that their sudden descent from the sky on the 19th was "completely unexpected by the defending forces," and there were still unfinished letters on typewriters in several Indonesian offices. It was also said that the Republican army had withdrawn into the nearby mountains.

### Seven Mediators Safely Fly Back to Batavia

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: The seven members of the United Nations Mediation Committee who were trapped in Kaliurang have flown back to Batavia. All personnel are safe and sound. It is said that they only knew the Dutch army was attacking when the bombs started falling. Belgian representative Herremans said that he went to Kaliurang Airport on Sunday morning to meet the United Nations plane and saw the plane appearing in the sky and starting to drop bombs. According to American Lisle, "We were awakened by a loud explosion on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, the Republican troops left Kaliurang and retreated into the nearby mountains."

### Dulles Returns Home from Paris and Talks About Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations; Disputes Between the Two Sides Will Not Lead to War

[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] Dulles, who has just returned from the UN General Assembly in Paris, believes that the prospects for peace in the United Nations have improved in the past year. Dulles led the US delegation in the latter half of the Paris UN General Assembly talks. The above opinion was expressed at a press conference after he returned to New York by ship from Europe on Monday.

Dulles said, "About a year ago at this time, I had just returned from the London Foreign Ministers Conference. The failure of that conference was the cause of the gloomy atmosphere and predictions of a possible war. We have experienced a year full of tense events, but we have not experienced war. On the contrary, I believe that some progress has been made in laying the foundation for peace. The most fruitful thing in the past year has been the work of the Paris UN General Assembly meeting in the past three months. There are still many dangers and difficulties in the future, but I believe that a constructive foundation has been laid at the Paris meeting, and the remaining difficulties can be overcome by peaceful means." A reporter asked what the above-mentioned foundation refers to, apart from words and resolutions. Dulles replied, "I do not underestimate words and resolutions, because they often lead to coordinated action. I do not believe that any agreement can be reached with the Soviet Union soon, but failure to reach an agreement does not necessarily lead to war. Countries that believe in a free society have shown encouraging solidarity. International understanding is obtained from conferences like the Paris UN General Assembly. The basic views of communist leaders are so different from those of the United States and Western countries that I do not expect an agreement to be reached quickly. However, disagreement should not be expressed in a violent way, and violent methods are currently being used in Berlin, Greece, Korea, and other places."

### Indonesia's Neighboring Countries Will Form an International Legion to Jointly Resist the Dutch Government; Indonesian Envoy to the U.S. Announces in the U.S.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 21st] Indonesian Republic Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States, Soemitro, announced to reporters that the Netherlands, under the pretext of restoring law and order, is actually causing unrest within its territory. Soemitro stated that the Republican government now only has exile as a last resort, and may go to Sumatra to direct the war. When asked by reporters whether the Indonesian Republican government would form an alliance with the Communist Party to resist the Dutch army, Soemitro refused to comment on the position on this issue, only saying that the Republican government had suppressed the Communist Party's uprising two months ago. Soemitro expressed doubt that the Security Council would be able to stop the Dutch aggression, and emphasized that the key to the overall situation lies in Washington. Soemitro believed that Indonesia's neighboring countries may organize an international legion to resist the Dutch army, and hinted that the future relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands would be greatly affected by this incident. Finally, he said, "I firmly believe that the Republic will be able to struggle out of the struggle and become a sovereign and independent country."

### Seven War Criminals Including Tojo Were Executed by Hanging This Morning; Executed Secretly in Sugamo Prison

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 23rd, Broadcast from: Tokyo, the seven war criminals including Tojo were executed in the execution ground in Sugamo Prison. MacArthur Headquarters issued a brief statement saying, "Seven war criminals sentenced to death by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East have been hanged between 0:00 and 0:35 on the morning of December 23, 1948." The original statement was only twenty-seven words, and the life of the imperialists who committed all kinds of evil deeds in the past came to an end. Japanese monk Hanshan once offered last prayers for the seven. According to Hanshan, they were hanged by an American executioner of unknown name. When they were at the height of their power, they did not pay attention to religion at all, but their attitude changed when they were about to die and they were in a "clear state of mind." When the execution was carried out, only a very small number of officers who had sworn to keep the secret were present to monitor it, and the guards in front of Sugamo Prison were extremely strict. This execution took very little time, so people here speculated that it must have been that four people were hanged simultaneously first, and then three people were hanged simultaneously. Reporters from various countries have repeatedly requested to be present to cover the news, but they were rejected. The seven people executed today are Hideki Tojo, Kenji Doihara (65 years old), Koki Hirota (70 years old), Seishiro Itagaki (63 years old), Kimura (59 years old), Iwane Matsui (70 years old), and Muto (56 years old).

### British Attitude Is Apathetic to the Dutch Invasion of Indonesia; Even Advocates for Dutch Victory over Indonesia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The British political circles are still reluctant to comment on the Indonesian incident today. The Foreign Office even refused to confirm or deny rumors that the British Ambassador to the Netherlands had advised the Dutch government not to take military action against the Republic of Indonesia last week. The British government felt quite torn on this issue because of its position in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Southeast Asia. Internally, it must obtain the support of the majority of Parliament to decide on actions against the Netherlands. On the other hand, for the sake of cooperation with the signatories of the Brussels Treaty, it must cooperate more closely with the Netherlands, especially to deal with the communist infiltration in Southeast Asia. India and Australia in the British Commonwealth are strongly opposed to the actions of the Netherlands. All major circles in Britain now hope that the Netherlands and the stable elements of the Republic will resume negotiations as soon as possible, and at the same time hope that the Dutch army can defeat the extremists who are not controlled by the leaders of the Republic.

He also knew nothing about the Republic's application to the U.S. government to cancel economic aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan, and that this plan was specifically for economic recovery and did not include transporting war supplies. When asked by reporters whether the Netherlands could fight in Indonesia without the aid of the Marshall Plan, the Ambassador replied: The Netherlands can definitely use its own resources to wage a long-term war.

### Wreckage of Lost Plane Found in Hong Kong; Bodies of Victims Arrive in Kowloon; China National Aviation Corporation Plane to Fly Families to Hong Kong Today to Handle Aftermath; Senator Shao Yongsheng Also Among the Unfortunate

[Reported by this Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's XT104 Sky Master aircraft, flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, crashed into a mountain on Pisha Island, about thirteen miles from Hong Kong, and burned down at approximately 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. The wreckage of the crashed plane was found that evening on the mountainside of Pisha Island. All 28 passengers and five crew members, including two stewardesses, were confirmed dead. All bodies were transported from the crash site to Kowloon yesterday afternoon for preparation. China National Aviation Corporation will send a special plane this morning to take the families of the deceased passengers to Hong Kong to handle the aftermath.

China National Aviation Corporation released the list of deceased passengers yesterday, which included many well-known individuals. In addition to China National Aviation Corporation Vice President Quentin Roosevelt, former Central Propaganda Department Minister Peng Xuepei (also known as Peng Hao Xu), and National Assembly Representative and Director of the Central News Agency's Shanghai Branch, Feng Youzhen, there was famous film director Fang Peilin, Shanghai Municipal Senator Shao Yongsheng (who used the name Zhang Shou when purchasing the ticket), former Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Luo Liangjian, and famous socialites from Peking and Tientsin, Miss Zhu the Fourth and Miss Zhu the Ninth (also known as Wu Zhu Jinyun and Zhu Hongyun, daughters of General Zhu Jiqing). Peng Xuepei was invited by Feng Youzhen to Guangzhou to plan the publication of the Guangzhou edition of the Central Daily News. Feng had already purchased two tickets for a twin-engine aircraft to Guangzhou, but Peng, for safety reasons, insisted on taking the Sky Master aircraft, so he canceled the tickets to Guangzhou and booked seats to Hong Kong instead. Unexpectedly, he died in the crash, which is truly unfortunate. Municipal Senator Shao Yongsheng was commissioned by Jingfu Shirt and Socks Factory to go to Hong Kong to discuss business matters and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai three days later to participate in the current session of the Municipal Senate. Miss Zhu the Fourth's husband, Wu Jing, was a close friend of China National Aviation Corporation General Manager Liu Jingyi. The couple died together on the same plane. Miss Zhu the Ninth was the daughter-in-law of Northeastern warlord Wu Junsheng and, along with her sister, was well-known in Peking and Tientsin society.

Air Stewardess's Words Become Prophecy

The deceased stewardess Huang Sumei was 23 years old. Her father, Huang Hongjun, is the manager of ABC Underwear Company, and his family is wealthy. According to the China National Aviation Corporation flight crew, Huang was usually very enthusiastic about her work. Before this takeoff, the company sent a car to her home to pick her up to the airport. Huang chatted with the driver in the car, saying that she had been flying continuously recently and felt quite tired, but because she was interested in her work, she did not want to quit, and said, "I would be willing to die on the plane." Unexpectedly, her words became a prophecy. The other stewardess, Zhu Renxian, was 21 years old and the granddaughter of the late master of Chinese classical studies, Zhang Taiyan.

### Complete List of Deceased: 35 Passengers and Crew

The complete list of passengers and crew is recorded as follows: Passengers: Wang Hujinyuan, Wang Wen, Zhao Guohua, Chen Yi (businessman), Han Mingyi, Luo Liangjian, Qu Bing, Qu Man, Fang Peilin, Quentin Roosevelt, Huang Shenfan, Xu Zhenquan, Wu Jing'an, Wu Zhu Jinyun, Wu Zhu Hongyun, Liao Dequan, Chen Dong Shufen, Rong Yiren, Feng Youzhen, Peng Hao Xu (also known as Peng Xuepei), Wang Muzong, Zhang Shou (also known as Shao Yongsheng), Chen Baiqiao, Xin Dafu, Yang Hailin, Lu Tao Wei Chen, Lu younger brother, Luo Xiaofen.

### Flying Low in Heavy Fog Led to Mountain Crash and Fire; Hong Kong Governor Cables British Government; Crashed Plane Disregarded Warnings

The cause of the crash and the aftermath are being investigated by Gao Dajing, a director of China National Aviation Corporation, who was dispatched to Hong Kong yesterday by the company authorities. The Civil Aviation Administration has cabled its Guangzhou station to send personnel to Hong Kong to investigate all circumstances. However, according to a Reuters report from Hong Kong on the 22nd, Hong Kong Governor Grantham cabled the British Colonial Office on the 22nd, stating that the China National Aviation Corporation Sky Master aircraft "disregarded the warnings of the Hong Kong control tower and flew in heavy fog," leading to the crash and fire on Pisha Island. This seems credible, given another report from Hong Kong that the weather was bad on the 21st.

As for the rumor that the plane had been repaired before takeoff and that there might have been engine problems, aviation industry sources in Shanghai said that considering the plane was able to fly smoothly to Hong Kong and crashed suddenly when only a few minutes from the airport, it did not seem to be due to mechanical failure. General speculation is that the cause of the crash may have been a momentary oversight by the pilot. On the same day, China National Aviation Corporation flights 103 and 106, which departed for Hong Kong at the same time as flight 104, all arrived safely. The pilot of the crashed plane, Sunby, was an experienced aviator who had repeatedly flown over the Hump during the War of Resistance. However, it is known that he always liked to fly low. The mountain at the crash site is over 500 feet high, and it is possible that he crashed due to carelessness. Sampey had already been scheduled to leave China with his wife and children on the 29th of this month and this was his last roundtrip flight in China.

Bodies and Luggage Scattered Across the Mountainside

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 22nd] China National Aviation Corporation Sky Master XT-104, flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, crashed and burned on the mountainside of Pisha Island. All 35 people on board died instantly. Fourteen charred bodies were found this morning lying on the mountaintop, and four were found in the ashes of the plane. One of these is thought to be Quentin Roosevelt. All are scheduled to be transported to Hong Kong on the 22nd. Twenty police officers and airline staff spent all morning on the 22nd collecting bodies, luggage, and other debris on the mountainside. The impact was very strong, and most of the passengers died instantly. The victims' remains and plane parts were scattered over an area of half a mile.

Passenger's Arm Severed, Watch Still Running

Two of the four engines were thrown 300 yards away, and no part of the plane was intact. Even the tail had been reduced to a pile of white ash. The watch on the arm of one passenger, which had been severed, was still running. According to pilots who inspected the scene today, the crashed plane was flying at approximately 100 miles per hour. It was flying too low, and its right wing struck a 554-foot-high rock on the edge of the island, causing it to immediately catch fire and burn.

[Reported by this newspaper, Hong Kong, 22nd] Huo Shi Zhou (also known as Ju Sha Island), the crash site of the China National Aviation Corporation plane, is only six minutes from the airport and 500 feet high. The plane crashed into the mountainside. The passengers' remains were escorted back to Hong Kong by police in the afternoon.

### Peng and Feng Die in Line of Duty While Flying South to Start Newspaper

Unfortunately, they encountered an accident and died. When the tragic news arrived, people from all walks of life were deeply shocked and saddened. According to officials in charge of the Central Propaganda Department, after the Guangzhou Zhongshan Daily, Guangzhou Daily, South China Daily, and Heping Daily were merged and reorganized into the Guangdong Daily this spring, there was no directly affiliated party newspaper in Guangzhou, the birthplace of the National Revolution, while the Communist bandits' reactionary propaganda in Hong Kong and Macau was becoming increasingly rampant. In order to strengthen its propaganda power in South China, the department decided to allocate a portion of the Shanghai Central Daily News's equipment to Guangzhou to establish the Guangzhou Central Daily News and sent Feng to prepare for it. Feng invited Peng to be the chairman of the board of directors of the newspaper, as he was familiar with the situation in Guangdong. They were planning to work together when they unfortunately died in the same plane crash. Peng and Feng had devoted themselves to the National Revolution and the newspaper industry for decades, and their unexpected deaths are a great loss to the country and especially to the newspaper industry.

Hu recognized that Zhang was a friend and knew that Zhang had died on the Jiangya, so he immediately suspected the checks. While the bank teller was examining them, Hu confidentially informed the teller, who in turn reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau, which sent officers to the bank to take Chen into custody. Chen stated that the checks belonged to Li Chen A'e, who lived on Linsen East Road. Li Chen A'e was then summoned and testified that her son, Li Sanli, had picked them up outside. Her son was then summoned and stated that he had found them in the clothing of a corpse from the Jiangya disaster at the Siming Gongsuo.

### Post Office Cracks Down on Solicitation of Year-End Tips; Hopes Public Will Pay Attention to Two Points

[Reported by this newspaper] News from the Shanghai Postal Administration: As the Gregorian New Year is approaching, the bureau has received reports from the outside world that some people are extorting year-end tips in the name of post office messengers. After sending personnel to investigate in detail, it was discovered that there were indeed criminals extorting money. In order to prevent this, in addition to publishing announcements in various newspapers, the bureau is continuing to ask for public cooperation and has also written to the police bureau for assistance in strictly arresting these individuals. On the one hand, it is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention to two points: (1) If someone comes to solicit year-end tips while delivering letters, it can be proved that he is indeed a post office messenger. All sectors of society can secretly record the number worn on the messenger's collar or the messenger number on the envelope and immediately notify the post office. The bureau will deal with it severely and reward the informant a considerable reward in accordance with military regulations. (2) If someone is not wearing a number or is wearing plain clothes or is not the usual messenger delivering letters and comes to solicit year-end tips, it is clear that he is fraudulently extorting money in the name of the post office. It is hoped that he will be immediately turned over to the police bureau for handling.

### Look at the Power of Gold! Crowds Flood Streets During Curfew; Running in the Rain, All Become Soaked Chickens; Military and Police Agencies Dispatch Large Numbers to Disperse, a Miserable Sight

[Reported by this newspaper] This city's "gold rush" has reached a state of madness. Today is the day the Central Bank announced the distribution of the second batch of application forms. Starting yesterday evening, citizens vying to exchange for gold began to gather from all directions in the Bund area. At night, the bank and bureau doors handling gold deposit and exchange, such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Postal Remittance Bureau, and Central Cooperative Treasury, were already lined with dense and layered queues, and more and more people were arriving later. By the time the curfew began at 11 p.m., the areas near the Bund, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, and Henan Road were simply packed with people. Pushing, shouting, and making a noise, it was a mess. There were all kinds of people among them, but most were commoners from the working class, and there were even many elderly and weak women who were crowded into the crowd. The piercing cold wind on the riverbank, and the small citizens, who estimated tens of thousands in numbers, were willing to stand and wait all night to gain the profit that one or two taels of gold could bring.

After learning of this situation, the security authorities, considering that it was a time of martial law, not only violating curfew laws but also hindering public safety, urgently dispatched a large number of security police and mounted patrol units from the police bureau to try to disperse the crowd. However, the crowd, obsessed with gold, was unwilling to disperse. The police on the mounted patrol units waved their whips and the security police put bayonets on their rifles. The crowd dispersed here and gathered there, clamoring and shouting, and were never willing to leave. The two sides were at a standstill for a long time, and the situation was very tense for a time. Afterwards, the police were reinforced, and the garrison command's military police also arrived. However, due to a lack of unified command and a clear dispersal plan, they first forced the crowd on the Bund away from the bank buildings and concentrated them along the river. Then they drove them north, then into Nanjing Road, and turned north to Sichuan Road, and then drove most of them north of Suzhou Creek. By this time, it was already past midnight. Then the mounted patrol units drove the crowd in the Jiujiang Road and Henan Road area west. Suddenly, a heavy rain poured down, and the poor crowd were all soaked chickens. In the escape, some women, children, and the elderly were trampled and injured. Their screams were unbearable to see. However, many people still took the opportunity to hide in the alleys along the road, and more rushed into the back door of the Central Bank to take refuge, hoping to continue to be the first to exchange gold after the curfew was lifted at dawn. As of 2 a.m., when this reporter finished writing, this countless crowd had still not been cleared, and it is expected that today's gold exchange line will intensify, and the chaos in order can be predicted. If the gold exchange methods are not improved, the consequences are truly unimaginable.

[Another report] Last night, the police arrested several scalpers in the gold exchange crowd and also discovered that the drivers of several private cars were deliberately parking their cars nearby, providing lodging for scalpers for a fee. All have been arrested and sent to the bureau for handling according to the law.

The Lawyers Association's Public Legal Aid Association assigned twelve lawyers, including Qu Yue, to appear in court to defend them. The trial lasted from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. The court ordered that the verdict be announced on the 29th of this month. Because the defendants had been detained for a long time, all requested to be released on bail pending judgment. The court approved the bail application. Because it was late and there was no time to complete the bail procedures, the defendants were handed over to their respective defense lawyers and released in court. When the students left the court, they were deeply grateful for the Special Criminal Court's care for young people.

### Real Estate Transactions Plummet; Price Cuts and Distress Sales Still Find Few Buyers; Affects New House Construction Movement

[Our Report] According to real estate industry insiders: Real estate transactions have fallen into a state of stagnation since the overall war situation reversed. Compared with the actual market price before August 19th, the most severe cases saw general real estate prices halved. Recently, due to repeated peace talks and a slightly stabilized situation, general real estate prices have begun to improve slightly, but they are still only 75% to 80% of their previous levels. It is reported that among the voices of sharp drops in real estate prices, the hardest hit are general real estate public bureaus. During the period when these companies were in management, they had already exchanged some of their holdings for gold bills, and they also replenished with more real estate. Although the business of various companies is currently weak, daily expenses still have to be maintained with difficulty. Therefore, even though real estate prices have fallen, they still have to sell at a loss, but there are very few buyers. Moreover, amidst the sharp drops in real estate prices, most of the new house construction movement in this city has fallen into a state of stagnation. This is because the cost of materials for building new houses is still high, and labor costs are particularly expensive compared to before. After completion, it is not easy to sell, and there are even cases of people occupying newly built houses without compensation, causing those who invest in building houses to hesitate.

### Footprint Research; Cracks the Longhua Murder Case; Three Suspects Arrested in Succession; Confess to the Reasons for the Murder

Regarding the case of the unidentified young man in military uniform found dead in a wheat field by a farmer in Tianyao Bridge, Longhua Town, on the 20th of this month, after investigation by officers of the Garrison Headquarters, the case was fully solved the afternoon before yesterday. Of the four murderers, one is still being pursued, while the remaining three have all been arrested and are being interrogated.

The deceased was identified as Fang 堃, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the 5th Company, 634th Regiment, 226th Brigade. Upon hearing the news, He Longqing, Chief of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, immediately ordered Xia Lian, the Captain of the First Brigade of the Garrison卫, to investigate and arrest the murderers. Yan Jinwen, the Captain of the Third Company of the Brigade, upon receiving the order, immediately went to the address to investigate with relevant personnel. After examining the body, they discovered very clear strangulation marks on the deceased's neck and several rubber-soled footprints near the corpse. Based on the above clues, the Captain and others immediately discovered that the rubber shoes worn by Deng Xingqiao, a sergeant platoon leader at the Shanghai Longhua Repair Factory of the Ordnance Bureau, 天鑰橋, were identical to the footprints at the scene. After determining that Deng Xingqiao was the murderer in this case, they arrested him. According to his confession: Guo Qiao, a repairman at the factory, and Lv Xingyi and Luo Shanlin, privates in the factory's security guard team, were also accomplices. However, when officers were dispatched to arrest them, the three suspects had already fled upon hearing the news. Chen Shize, the Captain of the guard team, seemed to bear some responsibility. When the Garrison Headquarters escorted the suspect to the scene of the incident for verification the afternoon before yesterday, they unexpectedly arrested Lv Xingyi and Guo Qiao, two of the above-mentioned three suspects, near 天鑰橋. According to the suspects' confessions, the reason for strangling Fang 堃 was that the deceased had stolen five taels and six m錢 of gold and a camera from them when they were in Qingdao. After they recently came to Shanghai, they demanded them back but were unsuccessful, so they strangled him. Currently, the Garrison Headquarters is continuing to interrogate the suspects rigorously in order to fully clarify the case. As for Luo Shanlin, who is still at large, a strict order is in place for his arrest.

### Defendants Sentenced for Extortion Under False Pretenses

[This Newspaper Report] Wang Linkang, Chen Ruyi, Pan Songlin, and others previously falsely reported to Jin Songzhong and Han Qiang, officers of the Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, that the Xiangyu Customs Brokerage on Shandong Road was hoarding cotton yarn and engaging in private gold speculation. They then conspired with another person, Zhu Fujian, to extort money. On the morning of July 3rd of this year, at 11:00 AM, they went to the customs brokerage together, using the name of the Garrison Brigade, to search under false pretenses. They threatened to bring the case to justice and extorted 2 billion 法幣, which they divided among themselves. On July 26th of the same month, Chen Ruyi, together with Xu Jie and Wang Ruixiang, who is at large, went to Wu Ziwen's residence on the third floor of No. 5 Pingwang Street, falsely claiming to be working at the Garrison Headquarters. They accused Wu of engaging in private gold speculation and extorted 3 billion 法幣. On August 4th, Chen again intended to use the same method to extort money from Zhu Daoxin, the owner of the Xinkang Tobacco Company on Hankou Road. He discussed it with Xu Jie, Wang Lin, Yu Xinfu, and others, and Xu and the other two carried out the extortion. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, they arranged to meet Zhu at the entrance of the Yangzi Hotel. Zhu reported the matter to the Garrison Headquarters, and they were apprehended. After confessing the previous events, they were sent to the District Court. Yesterday, Judge Ye Guiling announced the verdict: Chen Ruyi was found guilty of repeated extortion under false pretenses and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Pan Songlin and Zhu Fujian were found guilty of jointly extorting money under false pretenses and each sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Wang Linkang was found guilty of helping others extort money under false pretenses and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The 5 billion 法幣 obtained through extortion should be returned to the victims separately.

### Patrol Officer Sentenced to Five Years in Bribery Case; Yan Xuezeng

[Our Report] Judge Fang Xianghai of the District Court announced the verdict yesterday in the corruption case of Yan Xuezeng and others, patrol officers of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau: Yan Xuezeng was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for accepting bribes and engaging in behavior contrary to his duty, and parts of the case against Wei Ping and Ling Yunxiao were dismissed. When Yan was on duty from 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM on November 1st of this year, he went to inspect the various posts. When he arrived at the third patrol post on Sichuan Road, police officer Lou Rui reported that at 4:00 AM that morning, there was a matter of loading iron goods at the wharf near Jiangxi North Road on Suzhou North Road. He and another police officer, You Fengchi, intended to go to investigate, but Yan prevented them. Yan went alone and returned more than half an hour later, claiming that they were transporting stolen goods and that he had released them, and gave Lou a bribe of ten yuan and You twenty yuan. Then, Yan went to other patrol posts and, because the stolen goods he had released were being transported in rubber-wheeled vehicles and had to pass through various places, he gave police officer Wei Ping of the fourteenth post twenty yuan and patrol inspector Ling Yunxiao thirty yuan. The next day, Lou and You submitted the赃款 along with a report to the Hongkou Sub-bureau for review. After reporting to the General Bureau, it was determined that Yan, Wei, Ling, and the other three all had corrupt behavior, and they were transferred to the District Court for investigation, and the judgment was made as above.

### Christmas Scenes in Various Countries

Christmas, originally a memorial holiday for Christians and Catholics, was initially only celebrated in Europe and the West. Later, as the number of Christians and Catholics increased, Christmas became increasingly popular and has almost become a global holiday. Every year on Christmas Eve, people around the world celebrate, give Christmas gifts, send Christmas cards, and spend Christmas Eve happily, and the enthusiasm is increasing day by day.

The British almost regard Christmas as a "reunion festival." The whole family sits around a table and has dinner together. Even those who are far away from home and unable to return, their families will definitely pray and bless them at the dinner table. "Christmas pudding" is also a dessert that every Briton must eat that night.

Also, because the British have always been the most particular about etiquette, they are very enthusiastic about giving gifts and sending greeting cards on Christmas. In 1935 alone, more than 200,000 Christmas telegrams were sent in London alone. The number is truly staggering when calculated nationwide.

The British royal family, on every Christmas holiday, always allocates funds to relieve the poor in the slums. Churches everywhere also raise funds to entertain the poor and celebrate Christmas. British children even auction off their toys and donate the proceeds to churches to carry out welfare activities for the poor. On Christmas Day, the compassion of mankind can be said to be fully demonstrated in Britain.

The American people love to enjoy themselves, and Christmas is one of their "carnivals."

Nightclubs everywhere are open all night and are always crowded. Overnight, the city of New York alone consumes about 100,000 barrels of alcohol. Broadway Street was already a prosperous street, and on Christmas night, it is even known as "Liquor Street."

Poland is also a Christian country, but it has a unique ceremony. On Christmas Eve, every family holds a banquet, which is not a family reunion, but actually has a deep and solemn religious meaning.

Every family prepares all the dinner utensils, but cannot start eating until the first star appears in the sky. Therefore, the Polish Christmas dinner is called "Star Meal" or "Evening Watch Dinner."

The dining room is brightly lit with candles. Because they commemorate that the Savior Jesus was born in a manger, they put some grass on the table, cover it with white cloth, and then the whole family sits down. The head of the family picks up a plate containing a large cake, blesses it, and says a short speech, the general meaning of which is that everyone present should be at peace with God and all people. Then, the cake is cut open, and everyone present, including the servants, gets a share. After the cake is divided, everyone eats a little of their own share, and the rest is exchanged with each other to show mutual love.

Then, they bless each other, sing the Christmas song of 彼蘭, and start dinner.

After dinner, the children are led to another room, and an old man comes in, called the "Starlight Old Man." He asks and answers questions with the children one by one. If the child answers incorrectly, he will be reprimanded by the old man. Finally, he gives the prizes brought from the "Star Realm" to the children who answer correctly and have good behavior.

Bethlehem, the holy land where Jesus Christ was born, has a special meaning to spend Christmas there. Believers from nearby areas specially rush to the holy city to spend Christmas, and people from afar often take the opportunity of Christmas to visit the relics of the Savior's birth. Although the stable and manger are gone, the longing will never diminish. Therefore, in Bethlehem, many people from other places arrive a few days before Christmas. People from Europe, such as British and French, people from Eastern Europe, such as 彼蘭 and Hungarians, Egyptians from East Africa, Indians from the East, as well as Turks and Arabs from nearby, and Jews from all over the world, all come to visit the holy land in various forms, as if opening a human race exhibition.

In Bethlehem, you cannot see silvery white snow during Christmas. The streets are paved with white marble, which looks a bit like a silver world from a distance, appearing solemn and serene. On Christmas Eve, the large and small churches are packed full, and although there are many people, there is no noisy sound. The women wear black veils, as if preventing them from talking and laughing. This Mass lasts almost until dawn the next day.

The church building has a small basement that looks dark when you look down. Going down a small ladder and winding around a few turns, you reach this basement. There are fifty-three bright silver lamps lit there, shining very brightly. It symbolizes the manger in which Jesus slept when he was born, and contains the statues of Jesus and the crucifix. When the Mass is about to end, everyone lines up and goes down the small ladder in order, reading the story of Jesus's birth, written in Latin and engraved on a copper plaque.

### SAM’Ｘ

Christmas, in English, is written as Christmas. The meaning of Christ is Christ, and mas is the explanation of birth. Now, many people write X'mas, using X to represent Christ. What exactly is going on?

Regarding X'mas, there are two explanations. One says that the pronunciation of X is similar to Christ, and it is much simpler to write. Another says that the shape of X is somewhat like a cross, which can be used as a symbol of Jesus Christ.

In fact, both explanations are incorrect. The origin of that X is rooted in Greek. In Greek, X is equivalent to Ch in English; Christ is written as Xriitos, and the abbreviation is Xt. In the sixteenth century, the scope of circulation of Greek became increasingly narrow, but in the minds of many people, they thought it was a glory to understand Greek, and Xt was still often used. By extension, Christian was also written as Xtian, and Christmas was also written as X'mas. This habit has continued to this day.

### Reflecting on the Winter Solstice

The Western Christmas holiday is commonly referred to as the foreign Winter Solstice, and all countries hold enthusiastic celebrations. However, the Chinese Winter Solstice is also valued by the Chinese people.

According to custom, on the day before the Winter Solstice, relatives and friends give each other food as gifts, with baskets and boxes filling the streets, which is commonly called the Winter Solstice Plate. The day before the festival is commonly called Winter Solstice Eve, and on this evening, every household hosts a banquet, which is called Festival Wine. Daughters who have married and returned to their parents' home must rush back to their husband's family that evening. Whether rich or poor, people will definitely buy food to offer to the local earth god, and some even hang portraits of ancestors. The rituals are more elaborate than on ordinary holidays, hence the saying "The Winter Solstice is as important as the New Year." The customs of Wu County place great emphasis on the Winter Solstice, so there is also the saying "Fat Winter, Lean New Year."

Chinese farmers believe that they can predict the sunny and rainy weather of the new year from the warm, humid, and ripe weather of the night before the Winter Solstice. There is a saying: "If it is wet before the Winter Solstice, there will be five winds, and peace and happiness until the Grain in Ear." It is commonly believed that if it rains or snows around the Winter Solstice, the New Year's Eve will be sunny; if the Winter Solstice is sunny, the New Year's Eve will be rainy or snowy. Therefore, it is also said: "A clean Winter Solstice, a wet New Year's Eve."

This year's Chinese Winter Solstice falls two days before Christmas. The Chinese Winter Solstice and the foreign Winter Solstice are coming together. After finishing the Winter Solstice Eve dinner and completing the grand Winter Solstice Warm House ceremony, in two days, it will be time for the annual Christmas Carnival.

### Snippets of Christmas: Santa Claus Flies an Airplane

Along the eastern coast of the United States, every Christmas, an airplane always flies through the sky. For poor families, the airplane drops packages tied to parachutes. Inside the packages are pastries, candies, cigarettes, books, and clothes. When people below hear the rattling sound of the airplane, they run out to greet it. In the 20th-century scientific world, this airplane is commissioned by a large merchant in Boston to distribute Christmas gifts once a year.

### Free Shopping

In Dallas City, there is a shrewd and calm old Jewish man who owns a department store called Luther. This Jewish owner is not a stingy person and is very considerate of the poor. Every Christmas, poor people can go to his store to pick out a few daily necessities without paying a penny. This practice has been going on for thirty years, and more than ten thousand people come to collect things every year. On Christmas Day, Luther's store is packed from morning to night, and the staff cannot keep up. People from other stores also come to volunteer their services.

### Three Christmas Islands

There are three islands in the world named "Christmas." One is in the Indian Ocean, two hundred miles south of Java, and was discovered in 1643 by a British merchant ship, the Mary, due to a storm. The second is in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a solitary coral island discovered by Captain Cook in 1777. Both islands were discovered on Christmas Day, hence the name "Christmas Island." There is also a "Christmas Island" on the French coast of the Atlantic Ocean, near Île de Ré. The history of that island is untraceable, but it is speculated that it was also discovered on Christmas Day.

### Christmas Superstitions

If the moon is bright and the stars are sparse on Christmas Eve, there will be a great harvest of melons and fruits next year. If dark clouds cover the moon or it rains heavily, there will be no melons or fruits to eat and no wine to drink next year. If it snows on Christmas, there will be a bumper harvest of crops next year. If it is dark, milk production will be abundant. If there is a strong wind on Christmas dawn, livestock will suffer. If there is thunder and lightning on Christmas, the husband will be unusually cold.

On Christmas Day, the first thing that enters the house should be blue. If a man comes in, he will bring happiness. Even for animals, males are better than females. If Christmas falls on a Wednesday, it is a very bad omen. Next year there will be war, epidemics, volcanic eruptions, natural disasters, and man-made calamities one after another.

### Christmas Tree

The creator of the Christmas tree was named Saint Lorentz, an old man from the Hesselach Forest in Alsace, Germany. He loved children, and children loved him. Two days before Christmas, he wanted to hold a children's party to celebrate Christmas. But he was very poor and could not afford to buy toys.

The day before, it snowed heavily, and the weather was still cold that day, but the sun was very bright. Saint Lorentz woke up in the morning and took a walk in the forest. He accidentally saw a small fir tree covered with white snow, with long and short icicles hanging on its branches. The sunlight reflected off of it, making it extremely beautiful. The old man had a flash of inspiration, dug up the tree, planted it in a pot, and hung it full of fruits, honey, and cross-shaped biscuits made of flour, as well as many small candles.

On Christmas night, he rang a small bell, and the children came. Seeing the tree with its colorful lights and shining candles, they were very happy. So they sang, danced, and caroused until midnight before dispersing contentedly. From then on, every Christmas, families prepared a small fir tree, called a Christmas tree.

In the national park in California, USA, there is a very tall pine tree, the height of which is equivalent to a twenty-story building, and the trunk is seven or eight arm spans thick. In 1925, the United States designated this tall pine tree as the national Christmas tree of the United States. This is considered the largest Christmas tree in the world. Since then, every Christmas, many people come to this Christmas tree to hold Christmas ceremonies, singing Christmas carols on a mountain of crystal clear world.

In Altadena, southern California, there is also a very famous row of Christmas trees, which are neat and beautiful pines and cypresses, stretching for a mile. As early as 1882, a traveler named Walter Raymond traveled to India and climbed the Himalayas, the roof of the world. He found many beautiful pines and cypresses there, which were extremely moving. So he brought the seeds home and planted them himself. Later, his two sons carefully cultivated them, transplanting them one by one, covering the entire garden. This is the famous Christmas tree. Now Walter Raymond has passed away, and the garden is desolate, leaving only this row of pines and cypresses for future generations to admire.

The market sentiment remained firm, and transactions were brisk. Old brand flour, which had risen too high as of yesterday, remained at 147 yuan. Army ship flour also opened at the original price of 139 yuan, with brisk transactions. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 6-7 yuan.

Bran showed a slight increase, with Fuxin large bag at 81 yuan and Zaofeng large bag at 80 yuan.

Grains

Due to reduced arrivals, transactions increased, and market prices rose across the board. Soybeans rose by more than 10 yuan, with Hankou Zhadou at 190 yuan. Red sorghum also showed an increase of 15 yuan. Corn rose slightly by 5 yuan, with Huangdu corn at 167 yuan. Sesame remained stable due to unchanged foreign packaging, with Hankou white sesame at 340 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Prices were firm at first but then declined, with a large difference between opening and closing prices. The market opening was good, and credit was easy, so the opening price of local factory soybean oil was high at 1,080 yuan, with many transactions. However, the market subsequently declined sharply to 1,030 yuan. Qingdao Jiangbei Jitong raw oil opened at 1,150 yuan, and the closing price fell back by 50 yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 1,020 yuan and remained stable at 1,000 yuan, also rising by 10 yuan. Jitong small cart sesame oil opened at 1,020 yuan and closed back at 960 yuan, showing a slight increase of 10 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was 780 yuan, also showing an increase of 60 yuan.

### Insurance Premiums Now Collected in Cash

The Shanghai Insurance Trade Association, through a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolved that, starting from the 22nd, all premiums should be paid in cash on the same day. In the past, there had been cases where premiums were delayed for two or three months, causing significant losses to the industry. It is said that the change to cash payment is intended to help alleviate the situation.

### Overseas Remittance Rates Rose Again Yesterday, Foreign Exchange Certificates Initially Firm but Then Weakened

The Central Bank's overseas remittance rates rose again by 4 yuan yesterday, reaching 64 yuan. Foreign exchange transfer certificates were initially firm but then weakened. The opening price was 56 yuan, with insufficient supply to meet demand. Subsequently, due to purchases by various parties, the price rose further to 59 yuan. As exporters took advantage of the high price to sell, the price began to fall back, with the final buying price at 57 yuan and the selling price at 57 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 1 yuan and 7.5 jiao compared to the previous day.

In addition, credit tightened slightly yesterday, with interbank lending rates at 12 to 15 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 3.6 to 4.5 jiao. Cash remained abundant. Furthermore, because the market's black market interest rates were much higher than the 15 yuan per thousand yuan daily interest rate charged by money shops and similar businesses, banks had previously charged a handling fee. Now, because market interest rates have fallen and are even lower than the interest rates charged by similar businesses, all banks will temporarily stop charging the handling fee starting immediately.

### Exchange Rate of Taiwan Dollar to Gold Yuan Officially Set at 350 to 1

### National Bank Discount and Loan Association Passes 35 Acquisition Cases

The National Bank Discount and Loan Association's Production and Export Loan Review Committee held its third meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st, chaired by Lin Chongyong. The committee reviewed 58 applications for acquisition cases. After excluding those that needed to be supplemented with investigation forms for further review and those that were instructed to be changed to loan applications, to be submitted by banks or native banks, the committee approved 35 acquisition cases, including more than ten types of industries such as machinery, electrical machinery, electrical appliances, acid production, chemical manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, dyeing and weaving, cotton spinning, papermaking, pencils, matches, and soap.

### To Encourage Export Business, Packing Loans Will Be Restored

According to sources in the import and export industry, export packing loans, which have been suspended for a long time, will soon be restored. The Central Bank is preparing to start lending again, as the authorities have recognized that the export industry has been declining recently, and there is little demand for export transfer certificates. Even the items with the highest exports in normal times, such as bristles, tung oil, and casings, have now decreased to one-tenth of their previous levels. If this continues, the export industry will come to a standstill. In order to revitalize exports, packing loans will be restored to provide encouragement. However, according to the export industry, the recent decline in Shanghai exports is actually due to traffic congestion. Export goods purchased from the producing areas cannot be transported to Shanghai, so even if export loans are restored, the outlook for export business is still not optimistic.

### Reorganization of the Import and Export Control Commission Completed, New Organization Established on New Year's Day

Shanghai Office Established to Manage Import and Export Business

The streamlined reorganization of the Import and Export Control Commission will be fully completed by the end of this month. All dismissed personnel have been issued severance pay and dismissed. The newly reorganized Import and Export Control Commission will be officially established on New Year's Day of the 38th year. The former director of the Export Promotion Department of the Commission, Chen Junren, will succeed as the director, and will continue to work in Shanghai, responsible for all administrative matters. In addition, the Import and Export Control Commission Shanghai Office will be established, specifically responsible for managing import and export control business in Shanghai, and for signing and approving import permits. The candidate for the director of the office has also been internally decided and will be announced soon. This office will also be established on January 1st.

It is also learned that the director of the Secretariat of the Commission, Fang Xian, the director of the Quota Allocation Department, Shen Zou Ting, and other directors and deputy directors are reportedly resigning.

### National Bank's Tianjin Region Expands to North China Region

[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank's Tianjin Region Branch has now been renamed the North China Region Branch. The Shandong Province area, originally under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Region Branch, will be included in the North China Region Branch's jurisdiction. The former director of the Tianjin Region Branch, Zheng Daoru, has now been reassigned as the director of the North China Region Branch.

### Tea Market Rises Sharply

Yesterday, although the weather was not good, the domestic and export tea markets were still favored by buyers, so the process was like a fish in water. In terms of prices, holders continued to hoard and sell at high prices, and the upward trend continued to spread. According to industry insiders, recently, the markets in Africa, Morocco, and other places have shown a renewed interest in various low-grade flower types such as Zhenmei and Xiumei teas. Unfortunately, the market inventory is dwindling, so transactions may not be as smooth as desired, but the market sentiment will continue to soar.

### Sugar Market Remains Buoyant

The sugar market continued to be firm and buoyant yesterday. Non-industry funds poured in, and the sugar company reduced its allocations, which immediately improved market sentiment. Moreover, as the end of the year and the holidays approached, demand from various places continued to increase, and the local market was particularly smooth, with the trend continuing to be good. No. 45 white refined sugar opened at 560 yuan in the morning. After opening, the buying interest was strong, and supply suddenly became scarce. Prices were pushed up across the board, with bids reaching a peak of 590 yuan at one point. The market sentiment softened slightly at the close, and buying interest weakened, with the market falling back by 10 yuan, but still up 30 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar was 545 yuan, also up 45 yuan. Other varieties such as Xingbai and red sugar also rose by about 15%.

### Cigarette Exports Decline Daily

Local Sales in This City Only 20,000 Cases Per Month

According to authoritative sources in the cigarette industry, the main reason for the sluggish cigarette market prices is the lack of actual sales. Normal sales routes are: 1. North China, about 30,000 cases; 2. Northwest, more than 10,000 cases; 3. Yangtze River basin and Jinpu Railway, more than 30,000 cases; 4. Huhang Railway and Zhejiang-Fujian, more than 10,000 cases; 5. South China, more than 10,000 cases; local sales in this city are 20,000 cases. Currently, sales to North China have been cut off, and Guangdong is facing dumping of foreign cigarettes, with prices lower than those in Shanghai. The Northwest cannot be transported to, the Yangtze River lacks ships, the Jinpu Railway area is unstable, and sales in Zhejiang and Fujian are also poor. The only reliable market is this city, with just over 20,000 cases per month, but even this is affected by the release of hoarded goods, so demand is not high. General cigarette wholesalers and retailers, due to high interest rates, only seek to quickly sell off their stock and are unwilling to buy more goods and suffer losses, so the cigarette market cannot rise.

### Fine Yarn Rises Across the Board, Cotton Cloth Initially Rises but Then Flattens

Cotton yarn prices rose and fell inconsistently. Sales to other places remained sluggish, and local demand was also not high. As a result, fine yarn rose across the board, while coarse yarn had mixed fortunes.

42-count Blue Diamond was quoted as high as 19,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan at the close, finally rising by 1,000 yuan. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also trended higher. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 100 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 16,000 yuan, fell to a low of 15,700 yuan, and finally closed at 15,800 yuan, falling by 400 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 16,500 yuan, fell to a low of 15,000 yuan, and then slowly recovered to 15,700 yuan at the close, finally falling by 300 yuan. The price for warehouse receipts and next-day delivery was also down 300 yuan each. 20-count Double Horse fell by 400 yuan to close at 13,800 yuan. In addition, Golden Rooster and Tiannv also showed weakness. Prices for grades of 16-count and below were slightly up.

The cloth market rose and then fell back. The leading fine cloth initially opened at a new high of 570 yuan, so buying interest was strong, and prices were quoted higher at one point. However, negative news spread frequently near noon, and market sentiment weakened, leading to a sudden selling trend. Quoted prices gradually fell, and the market finally closed at a low of 540 yuan, resulting in an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous noon closing, but a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the aftermarket quoted prices. After the close, the bulls continued to cut their positions, and it was heard that some people were still selling at 530 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 570 yuan, reached a new high of 580 yuan, and then fell to 525 yuan half an hour before the close, closing at 530 yuan, finally rising by 10 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance and Leifeng Pagoda Biji each rose by about 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight opened at 565 yuan, fell to a low of 545 yuan, and closed at 550 yuan, finally rising by 18 yuan. Although the prices of other cloths were higher than the previous close, the underlying market was very weak.

China Textile Sales

China Textile sold 172 pieces of yarn yesterday, totaling 3,647,600 Gold Yuan. The approved prices were: 20-count Longevity Picture (excluding tax) 9,600 yuan, 14-count Water Moon 8,600 yuan, 15-count Water Moon 9,000 yuan, 32-count Double Strand Harvest 18,800 yuan, 40-count TK Sunlight 24,800 yuan, 42-count Double Strand Red Steed 18,500 yuan, 40-count Triple Strand Red Baoguang 19,400 yuan, 60-count Sunlight 24,800 yuan, and 60-count Double Strand Sunlight 27,000 yuan.

### Silk Market Stable, Silk Fabric Prices Rise

The raw silk market yesterday initially rose and then fell, with the trend fluctuating in the middle. Market sentiment seemed soft, and the closing price showed a slight decline. 120-count Tianqiao opened at a high of 17,000 yuan. After opening, actual sales were stagnant, buyers watched from the sidelines, and individual sellers were eager to sell, so the market sentiment slightly weakened, and quoted prices gradually declined, reaching a low of 16,200 yuan. Subsequently, due to speculative buying, the market rebounded slightly, and the result was 16,600 yuan, up slightly by 100 yuan. Dongyang Jin San Ma and Siniyasishi, etc., generally showed no gains or losses.

The raw silk market trended sideways. The market price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated very little, and market sentiment was not stimulated in any way. Export goods were not traded much yesterday, and the market showed no ups or downs. Domestic sales remained weak, sales were sluggish, and transactions were not active. However, due to the support of the holders, quoted prices were stable, and there was no strength to rise, so the trend was stable. D-grade 78 evenness opened at 19,000 yuan, and premium-grade in small lots was 18,500 yuan. Later, it was heard that yarn and cloth prices had initially risen and then fallen back, and silk mills were not buying much, so the market fell back by 1,000 yuan. The closing price was slightly higher than the previous day's noon closing by several hundred yuan.

The silk fabric market fluctuated greatly yesterday. Market sentiment was initially flat but then firm, and quoted prices were initially high but then softened. Meiya bedspreads initially traded at 11,200 yuan. After the quote, buying interest remained strong, and speculators scrambled to buy, so quoted prices rose steadily, reaching a new peak of 12,500 yuan. Finally, various parties took advantage of the high price to sell, and individual sellers took profits, so the price fell back. The market closed at 12,300 yuan, up 1,500 yuan. Dachen Bizhou, Siwei Ni, and Dawei Ni all rose by about 3.5 yuan.

### Hong Kong Organizes Defense Force: Six Units Provisionally Set at Six Thousand Men

— Special Correspondent Zi Jian for This Newspaper

[Report from Hong Kong, 18th by Airmail] Following Governor Grantham's stern warning speech to the communists, he delivered another important statement in the Hong Kong Legislative Council on the 15th during discussions on the "Hong Kong Defense Force Bill," explaining the necessity of organizing the Hong Kong Defense Force. As a result, the term "Hong Kong Defense Force" immediately became a topic of conversation among the citizens.

This is truly "not a unique occurrence," and it could also be said to be "birds of a feather"—both Hong Kong and Shanghai are simultaneously proceeding with the organization of a civilian self-defense force. Due to the needs of the times, public opinion in both Hong Kong and mainland China has praised this as an "enlightened measure." According to the Governor's announcement, the organization of the Hong Kong Defense Force will be divided into six units: (1) Navy, (2) Army, (3) Air Force, (4) Auxiliary Services, (5) Women's Services, and (6) Headquarters. The organization is flexible and will depend on the needs of the environment. It is expected that six thousand people can be recruited in the fiscal year 1949 to 1950. In other words, in the initial plan, the strength of the Hong Kong Defense Force is provisionally set at six thousand, with a total budget of approximately six to seven million Hong Kong dollars.

The Governor pointed out, "To provide citizens with the opportunity to dedicate themselves to service in wartime or in times of emergency, people of all nationalities may participate. The wording of the oath of enlistment will not infringe upon the original nationality status of non-British subjects, and the headquarters will even have translators. It is evident that the main force of the defense force will be our overseas Chinese compatriots, and even those who do not understand English will not be hindered." This is much more open than the pre-war Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, which was limited to British subjects. Before the war, the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps had about nine hundred army personnel and about four hundred navy personnel. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the establishment was expanded, and the number of personnel increased to three thousand.

In an editorial on "Hong Kong Security" published on the 13th of this month, the Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post pointed out that the Hong Kong government's evasion of responsibility for men and women who served silently in the past has had an adverse impact on public morale. Therefore, the Governor's statement clearly stated that members participating in military operations will be paid according to the salary scale of the British regular army, plus a local cost-of-living allowance. It also stated that those who join the navy, army, or air force may be transferred to serve outside of Hong Kong when necessary, but army personnel who do not wish to leave Hong Kong may declare this upon enlistment. It also said: "Men and women who participate in the Defense Force will sacrifice most of their time, or even their lives, to defend Hong Kong, The slowest. Everyone is issued a ration card that entitles them to purchase a fixed amount of food, including butter, meat, sugar, milk, and so on. In my opinion, they are using 'potatoes' as a substitute for the noodles of northern China and the rice of southern China. Ordinary people have three meals a day, as well as three or four tea breaks, around 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., and perhaps some people even have a 'tea' at 10:00 p.m. and before getting up in the morning. These 'teas' sometimes involve eating snacks. Usually, Saturdays and Sundays afternoons are cold meals. Most working people eat lunch in restaurants. There are several types of restaurants, with varying prices. Ordinary people usually spend about two shillings and three pence per meal.

Housing

This is perhaps one of the material living standards that is much higher than that of China. A family may have a small house, or a "flat" that forms a single unit. (The word "flat" is not easy to translate into Chinese. In reality, the so-called "flat" includes a living room, bedroom, kitchen, toilet, etc.) Before the war, there was a buy-a-house-on-installment plan. The government also built various houses for rent at cost. If we take "housing" as a standard, we cannot compare with England. An ordinary worker lives in a place that even a professor who has been muddling along in China for one or two decades may not have such "good fortune." The biggest reason, I think, is because Britain has a long-term stable situation. Although it has gone through two world wars, no enemy has ever landed on the British Isles.

Transportation

In this regard, I see that most people rely on trains, buses, and subways. The transportation network in this country is naturally very developed. Private cars do not seem to be very common at present. The reason seems to be that it is not easy to purchase a car. British automobile factories are working hard on exports and cannot take care of the domestic market at the same time. Therefore, it is not easy to buy a car. Gasoline is controlled by the government. If we talk about the price of gasoline, it is quite cheap, about two shillings and three pence per gallon. A good small car can travel thirty miles per gallon. Westerners seem to rarely not know how to drive a car, and even less often hire a driver. Therefore, owning a car is not necessarily a luxury. The problem is probably the price of the car and the difficulty of purchasing it. At the same time, the restriction on gasoline is also quite strict.

Family

A common English person, according to my understanding, lives a very regular life. They go out to work in the morning, come back in the afternoon, and may go out for entertainment in the evening, or listen to music or lectures on the radio at home. Here, owners of radios must pay an annual usage fee of one pound. It is said that the broadcasting company collected more than ten million pounds last year. The population of Britain is about fifty million, so on average there is one radio for every four people, which is of great benefit to the British people. In ordinary families, some families have everyone out during the day, either working or going to school. There are also some housewives who do not go out to work. To be honest, most British housewives are very admirable. Labor is very expensive here, so very few families hire "workers." Even if they do, it is often "part-time," either coming for a few hours each day, or a few times each week, to do some of the things that housewives think need help with. It is rare to find a maid who lives with the master's family for twenty-four hours a day, as in China. In principle, housewives here probably bear all the "administration" of a family, such as cleaning the house, buying groceries, cooking, etc. They are indeed very hard working. Of course, one thing that gives them an advantage over Chinese women is that the equipment here is better than that in China, and some tasks are easier to perform.

Stability

The British way of life may not be accustomed to by Easterners in some respects, but from the perspective of those who are accustomed to it, it is generally very enviable. The war has caused some damage to Britain and reduced some of the enjoyment of the British people, but on the other hand, many things are indirect benefits that the war has given to the British people. The government's subsidies for food have provided a lot of assistance to those with lower incomes. The changes in the wartime tax system and the effectiveness of some controls have somewhat shortened the distance between the rich and the poor in Britain. At present, Britain has some economic difficulties, but in general, very few people are unemployed nationwide, and they are living a disciplined life with a standard that is still much higher than that in China. Their people, at least from the perspective of us foreigners, have very few worries. The government is almost responsible for all the problems in the lives of all the people, which is related to the long-term stability of their domestic politics. Every time I pay attention to the lives of the British people, I always worry about the lives of our people. I am aware that improving the living standards of the Chinese people requires one condition, namely, political stability. This may be the goal that every Chinese person should strive for.

Hard Work

Finally, I would like to say that before I came here, I thought that this place must be as luxurious and wasteful as Shanghai, but after I have lived here for some time, I think that what the British people are worth paying attention to is perhaps secondary to their material possessions. Their spirit of hard work, simplicity, practicality, calmness, and lack of exaggeration is worthy of our example.

### Jurong Strengthens Self-Defense Capabilities; Funds and Weapons Raised Locally

[Report from Jurong, 20th] In order to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of various counties in response to emergencies, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered each county to establish local troops for self-defense. In order to understand the situation of this organization, the reporter visited County Magistrate Chen Tianzhi. According to him, the county will soon establish a security regiment. The organization will be based purely on local principles. The province will only be responsible for supervision and command, and the funds and weapons will be raised locally. As for the organization and establishment, the county security battalion will first be reorganized into one battalion, and the standing self-defense teams in each township will be established into one battalion. Once the funds and weapons are secured, another battalion will be expanded. The provincial government has appointed Yuan Deliang, the mayor of Qiaotou Town in this county, to serve as the regiment commander.

All men in the county aged eighteen to forty-five will be organized and trained in two phases. The first phase, which has been strictly supervised and trained by all levels, is about to expire and has been very effective. In order to develop local weapons, each organized civilian is ordered to be equipped with a knife or spear for self-defense.

The Recruitment Office for Intellectual Youth of the Army Training Command recently sent Deputy Director Yang Renxiang to the county to recruit intellectual youth aged eighteen to twenty-five at the County Council Hall to be sent to Taiwan for training. It is reported that since registration began on the 12th of this month and up to today (the 20th), applications have been very enthusiastic, especially among students from Yuzhou Lin Middle School.

### The Life of the British People: Simple, Stable, and Practical

— Ben Geng

[Report from London, 10th via airmail] This report is not a monograph, but some "miscellaneous notes." The reporter hopes that this report will enable domestic readers to understand the lives of the British people after the war and to be vigilant.

Clothing

It is said that the British used to be very particular about "clothing," but now it seems to be just neat and clean. Even on the busiest streets of London, which has a population of nine million, it is not easy to see outlandish or brightly colored clothes. Except for formal banquets, ordinary men often wear a tweed jacket and flannel trousers, which can be worn all year round. As for those who wear a full suit, the material and style are also very ordinary. If there is anything to be particular about, it is only that they pay more attention to the cleanliness of their shirt collars than Chinese people who wear Western clothes. Perhaps due to the climate, in addition to ordinary clothes, a coat that can be used for both sunny and rainy weather seems to be possessed by everyone, and they rarely do not carry or wear it. The summers here do not often make people feel hot. This summer, as far as I can remember, except for a few days in late July when it was very hot, the temperature was usually only around sixty or seventy degrees Fahrenheit, which seems to have a considerable impact on the fact that clothes can be worn all year round. The clothes worn by women also do not make us feel that they are "luxurious." "Simple" is the impression that clothes here give me. This situation may be related to the current clothing control. Last year, everything worn by each person, from head to toe, was almost completely controlled by the government, except for hats. Each person has four "points" of clothing coupons per month, but a suit requires twenty-six points of clothing coupons. The recent control situation has been relaxed relatively. In May, in addition to the four points that everyone should have each month, twelve points were issued to each person. Shoes and ties are no longer controlled. Although some clothes still require "points," the number of points required has begun to decrease. For example, a suit has been reduced from twenty-six points to twenty points. Although Britain is famous for its textile industry, the best materials are probably used for export. What can be bought domestically seems to be very simple. I think the relaxation of clothing control may allow people to have more new clothes, but it may not change the frugal atmosphere here.

Diet

In terms of diet, both quality and quantity are controlled, but recently it has been slightly relaxed. For example, bread and domestically produced jam no longer need to be purchased with coupons. As far as we know, the British government has considerable subsidies for food, so the price of food may be higher than the increase in all prices after the war. the harbor. We must not only ensure that their salaries are sufficient, but also consider various appropriate recreation facilities and sanitary equipment for them so that the members can enjoy physical and mental health and happiness in addition to serving.

Men and women participating in the Auxiliary Services do not need to receive military training. They only undertake civil defense work, but if there is a war, then that is another matter.

The "Hong Kong Defense Force Bill" is divided into six parts, with a total of thirty-seven articles, of which the second part, "The Governor's Power to Declare Mobilization Orders in Times of Emergency," is of utmost importance. It is expected that it will be fully passed between January and February of next year, and Hong Kong's civilian armed force will be formally born, adding a layer of security to society.

Governor Grantham is a far-sighted politician. His recent series of statements and actions have won widespread support and praise from the general public. Cooperation between the Hong Kong government and the good people is the best way to maintain law and order and prevent communist bandits from disrupting.

### News in Brief

Zhengyang

[Report from this newspaper] The usurious rates of high-interest loans are shocking, reaching a daily interest rate of two and a half percent, and the fate of commerce is on the verge of crisis. It is hoped that the local bank will open its vaults to provide relief.

Jurong

[Report from this newspaper] In order to prepare for permanent famine relief, the Grain Storage Management Committee has built fifteen grain storage warehouses on the east side of the People's Education Center in the north of the city, which will be completed within the year. The grain accumulated from land taxes over the past two years (totaling more than 20,000 dan) will be recovered and stored immediately. At the same time, in order to strengthen township telephones, all branch lines have been completed.

Also: The county's highest institution of learning (County Middle School) has built a library building to enrich students' extracurricular reading, which was completed last month.

Changshu

[Report from 21st] The Hengjing Town Office here convened a rent collection meeting on the 20th, gathering the heads of the Baojia system, because the rent-paying atmosphere was stubborn and weary. However, some villagers appealed for a postponement or exemption. Unexpectedly, Xia Daming, who suffered from mental illness, and Shi Xiaoer, a villager from the Second Bao, uttered absurd words, and when stopped, a conflict arose. The self-defense team fired warning shots, but it was difficult to achieve the desired effect. After a standoff all night, the matter was resolved after persuasion by the authorities.

Jiading

[Report from this newspaper] The eighth meeting of the County Council was opened on the morning of the 18th at 9:00 a.m. and closed successfully on the afternoon of the 20th at 4:00 p.m. Twenty-nine proposals were passed, the most important of which were: to effectively implement the 3-7 rent reduction, to reduce the discounted price of grain taxes, and to review the 1938 local revenue and expenditure budget.

Another report: Xu Diansheng, the former mayor of Qianmen Township, secretly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office this spring that Qin Jiefang, the deputy mayor, had murdered his younger brother Qin Yishu on the evening of the middle of the ninth lunar month of the 31st year of the Republic of China, a tragic event that was shocking. The District Prosecutor's Office investigated several times and excavated the remains at the burial site. After examining the external shape and structure, they found that it was different from human bones, so no prosecution was made. At the same time, Qin Jiefang's father, Zanwen, and his son Yishu disappeared at the same time as his brother Yutao in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China, and there has been no news of them since. Now that Xu has accused Jiefang of murdering his younger brother, and no prosecution has been made, he should be held responsible for false accusations. Qin has also filed a public lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office. Xu applied to the High Court for reconsideration, but the District Prosecutor's Office disapproved it on the grounds that the informant was not allowed to apply for reconsideration under the law. The Criminal Court of the District Court opened a trial on the 18th and, considering that there was still a need to investigate the facts of the case, ordered that the trial be postponed to a later date.

Shaoxing

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Maolin, the Bao head of the Seventh Bao of Shuangshan Township in this county, hoarded more than 8,900 catties of grain during the famine in October of this year in the hope of selling it at a high price for profit.

[Report from Xinyang, 18th for this Newspaper] Shi Dakai's poem contains the line: "Five aspirations unfulfilled, people are already suffering; weeping marks are everywhere in Central China." Descending to today, it can be a portrayal of the suffering people of Henan in general.

The war in northern Huai is raging, and the number of casualties among the bandit troops is staggering. According to merchants who recently came here from Zhengzhou, in the vicinity of Bian and Zheng alone, more than 30,000 wounded bandit soldiers have been gathered in the past ten days. In order to urgently replenish their troops, the bandit Central Plains Military Region has recently abandoned the "joining the army" rhetoric in Yu West, Yu North, and Yu East counties and has been rounding up men everywhere. All males between the ages of fourteen and forty-five cannot escape. Yu East and southwestern Lu, bordering Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, have become the bandit army's forward supply bases.

Three Extractions and Five Demands, Transactions Halt

On the land of the nearly 30 counties mentioned above, all the oxcarts, mules, and horses owned by the people have been searched and emptied by the bandits. In various places, grain merchants have completely ceased trading because the food owned by the people has been exhausted under the "three extractions and five demands." Poor farmers starving to death on the roads of Shangqiu and Minquan in Yu East can be seen everywhere. In the area bordering Yu and Lu, because Liu Fei has entered and exited here more than a hundred times, the prices of infants are particularly tragic. A girl weighing ten catties can only be exchanged for seven catties of sweet potatoes or three catties of millet. Old farmers who sell their children cry frequently on the barren land, but when they see female political workers of the bandits arriving for "proclamation and comfort," they force a smile and learn to sing Yangko.

Handling Youth, A Lot of Thought

From the mouths of refugee students and merchants coming from the north, we can see that after the bandits changed their political strategy, they have put a lot of thought into the disposal of youth in the captured areas, and their cunning and vicious methods are also worth noting. About two months before the abandonment of Zheng and Bian, a certain review meeting of Liu Fei's Central Plains Military Region decided on a vicious calculation of "rather kill ninety-nine out of a hundred." After that, wherever the red flag went, captured young students left ninety-nine out of every hundred to attack the city, releasing one to attack hearts and minds. Thus, within the captured areas, one could see thousands upon thousands of young students being tricked into "joining the army," throwing themselves into a sea of blood, and becoming cannon fodder in an instant. And the few young people released under the "kill ninety-nine out of a hundred" calculation, on the way south, under clever arrangements, actually had food and lodging at every stop, with strangers paying their bills, as if they were being sent off. Thus, these few percent, who only ate a few steamed buns and drank a few bowls of boiled water, unknowingly quietly brought similar toxins, free of charge, across the front lines of the National Army, to the rear of the government, and to some relaxed defensive positions. This effect cannot be said to be small. If the education authorities forget about these very hungry and thirsty little mouths and only play "little tricks," then it is not enough to talk about struggle, let alone total war.

Pinghan Railway Line, North and South Present Conditions

The war, which kills people across the fields, is cruel, but behind the cruel reality, if there are some more cruel masks and bad things hidden, the common people will suffer unspeakably. Now, just talking about the quiet Pinghan Railway, north and south: The people in the north, because the bandits constantly force them to contribute guns and food and are terrified of the so-called general liquidation after eight months, are doing everything possible to flee to Xiang and Deng. The common people in the south, living in areas far from both sides of the railway, are also busy fleeing because they cannot bear the demands and frights of a few local troops with poor military discipline. Thus, between Hankou and Xinyang, because of the coal shortage, the ordinary express train, which only runs once a day, is always crowded to the point of being impenetrable, which seems abnormal.

Life and Death Are Difficult, A Calamity

According to a Henan Provincial Councilor, it is really difficult for the Chinese common people to live or die these days. The people living in Suiping, Xiping, and Shangcai, which are no-man's-lands north or east of Zhumadian, often suffer multiple disasters. Today you come, tomorrow he goes, and all are inevitably subjected to a calamity. Merchants selling tobacco and cotton, after paying eight kinds of so-called self-defense and public welfare donations in the north, still have to complete eight paths when they arrive in the south. However, under the government's jurisdiction, the tax rate is lighter. Although the bandit area says it allows a small amount of cotton and Xuchang tobacco to be exported, it taxes them fiercely. Cotton is taxed at more than 40%, and tobacco is taxed at 200%, and additional extortion is demanded. Leaving that aside, let's look again at the lives of the people along the Xinhuang Highway, which is only a hundred kilometers long. Because a few bandits have recently been constantly robbing commercial vehicles and people, the speed of material exchange in various places along the Xinhan line has been greatly reduced, and it also looks haggard. The Xinhuang area is a land of fish and rice in southern Henan, and the people's sense of security is also more sensitive. Their view of Chairman Zhang Zhen is that he is a symbol of stability, so their hopes are also very high.

### Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament: Championship Suddenly Changes, Morning Friends Fails at the Last Hurdle, Crushed by Healthy Joy, Return Strength Fortunately Regains the Opportunity to Compete for the Title

[Our Report] The Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament reached its final stage last night. Morning Friends, with eight wins and no losses, faced Healthy Joy in their final battle to complete their championship ambition. However, things didn't go as planned, and they fell short at the last hurdle. The veterans of Healthy Joy displayed their prowess, defeating Morning Friends with a score of 51 to 30. In the first half, Healthy Joy led by four points with a score of 21 to 17. Although Healthy Joy defeated Morning Friends, they still had no hope of winning the championship, having already lost twice. This indirectly gave Return Strength another opportunity to compete for the title. Morning Friends and Return Strength now each have eight wins and one loss, and they will reschedule a match to determine the champion. The YMCA gymnasium was exceptionally lively last night.

First Half: A Back-and-Forth Battle

At 6:01, the two teams took to the court. Liu Hesheng and Zheng Zhifang were the referees. Morning Friends' lineup included He Zengchuan, Fu Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, Wang Bingfu, and Liang Xiong Biao. Healthy Joy's lineup consisted of Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Xianlun, Fu Jinsheng, and Yan Shilu. Upon contact, Zhang Liangxiong of Healthy Joy committed a foul, and He Zeng made one of his free throws. Wang Rongsheng followed up with another successful shot, giving Morning Friends a 3-0 lead. Yan Shilu of Healthy Joy scored, but Liang Rongbiao immediately retaliated. Zhang Liangxiong of Healthy Joy made a free throw and then followed up with a basket, giving Healthy Joy a 5-4 lead, their first lead of the game. Morning Friends called a timeout. Fu Qixia made his free throw, tying the score at 5-5. Afterwards, the two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with the score tied at 6-6 and 8-8. After tying at 14-14, Morning Friends took the lead again at 16-15. However, this lead was short-lived, as Healthy Joy became active again. At the end of the first half, Healthy Joy led by two baskets with a score of 21-17.

Second Half: Morning Friends' Decline

After the break, both teams maintained their original lineups. Zhang Liangxiong broke through the defense and scored. Healthy Joy's momentum did not diminish. The players of Morning Friends tried to attack, but their luck was not on their side, and their shots repeatedly missed. As a result, they fell further and further behind, with the point difference exceeding ten. After the score reached 39-27, Wang Rongsheng was fouled out after committing his fifth foul, and Shi Jiuquan replaced him. At the same time, they called a timeout to discuss countermeasures. Indeed, they showed some improvement for a while, and Wang Bowen and others scored some points. However, Healthy Joy was unwilling to relax, so the overall situation remained largely unchanged. In the last one or two minutes before the end of the game, Fu Qixia of Morning Friends also retired, and Ji Youkun was substituted off. By this time, the point deficit was large, and it was difficult to revive their offensive. When the final whistle blew, Healthy Joy defeated Morning Friends with a score of 51-30. Morning Friends will have to face Return Strength again to determine the champion. The scores are as follows:

Healthy Joy Throw Free Throw Fouls Points

Fu Jinsheng 3 2 3 8

Zhang Xianlun 8 0 4 16

Wu Chengzhang 2 5 3 9

Zhang Liangxiong 5 4 3 14

Yan Shilu 2 0 2 4

Shi Jiuquan 0 0 0 0

Liang Xiong Biao 1 2 2 4

Ji Youkun 0 0 0 0

Total 10 10 18 30

In the final game, Group A saw another match between Chun Mao and Xin Sheng. The former was more skilled, and Xin Sheng could hardly escape their fate. At the start of the game, Chun Mao took the lead. Xin Sheng did not lose heart and fought hard. The score difference was not too great. At the end of the first half, Chun Mao led 32-21. In the second half, Chun Mao continued to play smoothly, and Xin Sheng could not raise their heads. However, the battle became increasingly fierce. Xin Sheng fought desperately and worked hard. By the end of the game, Xin Sheng lost to Chun Mao with a score of 43-58.

In a Group B match last night, Yong An Yong defeated Shan Lan by one point with a score of 19-18.

### University Basketball: Finals on Saturday, Held at the City Gymnasium

This year's university basketball tournament is scheduled to hold the finals of the university, college, and women's groups at the City Gymnasium on the 25th (Saturday) starting at 2:30 PM. Tickets are two yuan upstairs and five yuan downstairs. The first game is the women's group final between Hujiang and St. John's. Hujiang has famous players such as Wang Shan, but the St. John's women are also not weak, so there will be a fierce battle. The college group final is between Fazheng and Lixin. The former has extraordinary strength, and although Lixin is not to be underestimated, it may be difficult to challenge their strength. The final match of the university group is the overall final between the top team of the "university" division, Jiaotong University, and the champion of the "college" division, St. John's. Both sides have famous players and are evenly matched, so it is uncertain who will win. The schedule is as follows:

Hujiang vs. St. John's (Women's Final) 2:30 PM

Fazheng vs. Lixin (College Final) 3:30 PM

St. John's vs. Jiaotong University (University Final) 4:30 PM

### Winter Relief Football Charity Match: Lineups of Chinese United and Western United Teams Announced

[Our Report] The Winter Relief Football Charity Match initiated by Mayor Wu is scheduled to be held at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 26th of this month (Sunday). The official lineups of the Chinese and Western teams have been announced by the responsible authorities on both sides. Each team will have 15 players. The Chinese United team was selected and arranged by the Football Committee, and the Western United team was selected by the International Sports Association. The lists are as follows:

Chinese United Team

Xu Fusheng (China Aviation)

Yan Shixin (Qingbai) Wu Qixiang (Zhichao)

Xue Peiran (Qingbai) Meng Yiliang (Qingbai) Gao Baozheng (Railway)

Jin Lusheng (Qingbai) Luo Shoufu (Qingbai) Qu Yongfu (Qingbai) Gao Xiuqing (China Aviation) Lin Dianyi (Railway)

New reinforcements: Wang Baoshan (Longtou), Wu Kaimin (Longtou), Fei Chunhua (Qingbai), Chen Qin (Longtou).

Western United Team

Xue Dekefu (Western Red)

Xu Erz (White Eagle) Carlo Liequ (Jewish)

Griffiths (Western Red) Tiefuni (Red Star) A. Oliveira (Portuguese Merchant)

Begeny (Western Red) Gabby (Rowing Club) Robert Stoff (Red Star) R. Korasha (Portuguese Merchant) Pan Lai (British Overseas Chinese)

Reserves: Sandirikoff (White Eagle Goalkeeper), Matthew Heath (Jewish), H. Santos (Western Red), Greenas (Red Star).

The Western United team combines old and new blood. Robert Stoff, Tiefuni, Carlo Liequ, and Xu Erz are all well-known intercity representatives in the football world. Goalkeeper Xue Dekefu is consistently stable, Griffiths is brave and good at fighting, A. Oliveira is a former intercity player and the younger brother of L. Oliveira, with a strong family background. The right wing abandoned Fuen and unusually recruited Pan Lai, a young player from Group B. His speed is amazing. R. Korasha and Gabby are both good at shooting. Begeny's hooking and scoring skills are top-notch. The whole team is well-coordinated and has amazing strength. Most of the foreign players are good at sprinting but weak in control. If the Chinese United team can prescribe the right medicine, avoid their strengths and attack their weaknesses, they may be able to win. Even if they don't, they won't be far off.
