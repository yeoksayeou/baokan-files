### The Range of Price Fluctuations Has Narrowed. Four Banks Discuss Loan Recipients. Statistics of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Redemption in Various Regions Up to the 6th: Valued at US$5,680,000

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] During the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th, the loan policy and scope were discussed. Premier Weng and Finance Minister Qian spoke, both advocating that loans should be tightly controlled. Because the amount of currency to be issued in the future has been determined, each bank and bureau must strictly review loan applications to prevent speculative funds from flooding the market. The council approved two public transportation project loans on the 11th, granting 40,000 Gold Yuan each to the Capital Automobile Company and the Jiangnan Automobile Company.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Four Banks Headquarters held its 371st council meeting on the morning of the 11th. Chairman Weng Wenhao and all council members were present. First, the Secretariat reported on the changes in finance and prices in various regions after the currency reform. Generally speaking, interest rates have decreased, exchange rates are gradually stabilizing, and although various prices still fluctuate slightly, the range has narrowed. Furthermore, as of the 6th of this month, according to the reports received, the total amount of gold redeemed in various regions was over 623,000 taels, silver over 1,367,000 taels, silver dollars over 6,231,000, US dollars 12,870,000, and Hong Kong dollars 33,040,000. The net income from import and export foreign exchange during the same period was US$12,000,000, bringing the total income to US$56,680,000. Subsequently, the council discussed the following proposals:

1. Regarding the revision of loan recipients and methods, it was generally agreed that the selection of recipients should be tightened within the four major categories previously stipulated: (1) daily necessities production enterprises, (2) basic industrial and mining enterprises, (3) public transportation enterprises, and (4) export trade enterprises. Loans should be limited to working capital only. This proposal will be further studied for detailed and clear regulations.

2. The interest calculation methods for loans from various banks and treasuries were approved by the 370th council meeting, with a maximum monthly interest rate of 3% from August 23rd. Recently, the Executive Yuan issued regulations on limiting interest rates for bank and pawnshop deposits and loans, stipulating that both new and old deposits and loans should be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3% from August 23rd, except for the following two items: (1) Industrial and commercial loans that matured before August 22nd but have not yet been repaid are allowed to charge overdue interest according to banking practices. (2) Agricultural loans that have already been issued will continue to be charged at the original interest rate. However, from August 23rd, the portion exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3% should be deposited in separate accounts by the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Bank of China for improving farmers' welfare.

### US$70 Million in Construction Aid Funds to Be Allocated to Our Country Soon. Export-Import Bank Denies That Yan Xishan Contacted Them for Loans

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] Paul G. Hoffman, Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), said that the ECA may allocate funds for the main parts of the overall Chinese construction plan approved by the China Mission in late September. Hoffman declined to comment on other opinions and recommendations from the ECA's China Construction Survey Team. According to Hoffman, Leighton Stuart will go to China within the week, and within 30 days of his arrival in China, the main funds for the US$70 million US aid industrial construction and supplementary plan for China can be allocated. Hoffman praised the work of the Construction Survey Team in China, saying that the team has thoroughly studied a large number of plans that can receive economic assistance from the Economic Cooperation Administration. Regarding China's new currency, Hoffman said that he has not yet received a report from Leighton Stuart, the representative in China, and because China's current situation is difficult, he is unwilling to make any approvals on this matter. Hoffman continued to say that the Economic Cooperation Administration is very willing to see China's economic reform succeed. If this reform is successful, it will greatly stabilize the currency system and accelerate China's recovery. It is reported that Yan Jiagan, a member of the China US Aid Utilization Committee, visited Leighton Stuart again today for talks.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Senior officials of the Export-Import Bank on the 10th denied reports that Yan Xishan, Chairman of Shanxi Province, China, had sent representatives to contact the bank for any loans. According to recent reports, Yan Xishan had requested the Export-Import Bank for loans of US$5 million to US$10 million to strengthen Shanxi's anti-communist position. The Chinese Embassy here has also officially stated that this news is "doubtful."

### Zhang Qun Issues Statement in Japan; Emphasizes Three Points and Early Conclusion of a Peace Treaty. Building Future Sino-Japanese Relations on a New Foundation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Zhang Qun, former President of the Executive Yuan, issued a statement today, emphasizing the following three points: the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the relationship between the Japanese economy and the entire East Asia, and the need for Japan to become a peaceful and democratic country. The statement was broadcast to the Japanese people at 5:15 PM. The original text of the statement is recorded as follows:

This time, I came to inspect post-war Japan in a personal capacity. I am deeply grateful for the sincere assistance from MacArthur and the responsible persons at all levels of the Allied General Headquarters, the frank reports from the leaders of the Japanese government and people, and the direct observations and experiences I gained from my personal visits to various parts of Japan, which gave me a more intimate understanding of the occupation policies of the Allied General Headquarters and their implementation achievements, as well as the various situations in post-war Japan. Now that the inspection has come to an end and I am scheduled to return to my country on the 12th, I would like to briefly express my thoughts and feelings as parting words.

Three years have passed since the end of the war. In these short years, the reborn Japan has already possessed the model of peace and democracy in various systems and regulations, and the general Japanese people can also follow the instructions of the Allied General Headquarters and move forward step by step. It can be said that all of this illustrates the great achievements of MacArthur and his colleagues, as well as the excellent character of the Japanese people in serving the public and abiding by the law, which is worthy of our unanimous praise. However, the true essence of democracy not only lies in the reform and establishment of systems and regulations, but also requires a thorough understanding and firm belief in democratic ideology by the general public and leaders. The difficult and distant road to democratization in Japan is like "Rome was not built in a day." It requires the foresighted and the general public of Japan to have a genuine enthusiasm for autonomy and initiative, and an indomitable spirit of perseverance to work together and move forward hand in hand to achieve success. Originally, the Japanese people, having lived under the oppression of Shinto, feudalism, and militarism for a long time, had long lacked the democratic training to take the initiative. Their original good character had been almost completely destroyed. Awakening from the nightmare of war failure, they have embarked on the great road of democratic rebirth under the leadership of the Allies. However, because the time has been too short, they have not been able to grasp the goal and leap forward bravely. This is also an undeniable fact. Since my arrival in Japan, I have contacted officials of the Allied General Headquarters at all levels and in various regions, as well as representatives of other allied countries. I have also listened to the opinions of a majority of leaders from all walks of life in Japan. I have also personally observed the family lives and social lives of the people in various parts of Japan. I always feel that it is easy to transform tangible systems and regulations, but difficult to transform intangible psychology and ideology. If leaders from all walks of life in Japan and the general public do not make persistent and proactive efforts and enthusiasm in education and culture to thoroughly eliminate the old habits of passivity and create a new spirit of activity and initiative to complement and enrich the existing democratic norms, I am very worried that the realization of a truly peaceful and democratic Japan will still have many difficult thorns. For this reason, I have repeatedly appealed, and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that the Japanese people should thoroughly implement ideological revolution and psychological construction. This ideological revolution and psychological construction is not only a guarantee of a peaceful and democratic Japan, but also a necessary guarantee for Japan to rebuild psychological relationships with other democratic countries. Secondly, regarding Japan's reconstruction, in a short period of time, it has been discovered that the Japanese people are working very hard and are also very anxious about their country's economic recovery. They are especially concerned about the attitude of neighboring countries towards Japan's reconstruction. Regarding this point, I can frankly tell you that the Chinese people, and I believe all countries in the world, are very concerned about the issue of Japan's reconstruction. This is not only because Japan is a country, and not only a matter between China and Japan, but also a matter related to the reconstruction and security of the entire Far East region and even the entire world. Recalling the pre-war period, Japan's economic policy was a highly national defense economy in which warlords and financial cliques colluded with each other. Its essence was monopolistic and exploitative internally, and exclusive and aggressive externally. The main reason for the unfortunate war was this, and the losses and miserable lives suffered by the Japanese people and other countries in the Far East, especially the Chinese people, were caused by this Japanese warlord. Now, the Chinese people, like the Japanese, are working hard to stabilize the lives of the people and revive the national economy. China did not treat the Japanese people as the target of the war during the war, and there is no reason to disregard the Japanese people and let them starve to death after the war. Therefore, the Chinese people also have unlimited sympathy for the same efforts of the Japanese people after the war. However, Chinese public opinion hopes that Japan's reconstruction plan and efforts should learn from the mistakes and failures of the pre-war period. First, just as Japan's politics must be peaceful and democratic, Japan's reconstruction must also start with the peaceful democratization of the Japanese economy. Only by being so firm can we prevent the resurgence of new financial cliques, and the lives of the general Japanese people can be protected by this. Externally, based on the principle of mutual benefit and mutual assistance, we can no longer harm others and benefit ourselves, but instead work in parallel to complement each other. Second, international peace and world security are inseparable, and the economic recovery of each country that peace and security rely on is also inseparable. In fact, Japan's recovery is almost unimaginable without the cooperation and assistance of other countries, especially neighboring China. Therefore, when Japan's recovery was planned, it should not only passively not harm China, but also actively help China, and even the economic recovery of other countries in the Far East. In essence, Japan's recovery plan must simultaneously consider the position of other countries in the Far East. Any plan to assist Japan's recovery must also consider the entire Far East in order to achieve an average and parallel development of the economic recovery and industrialization of various countries in the Far East. Only a prosperous and prosperous Far East regional economy can contribute to the recovery and prosperity of the world's entire economy. The idea of ​​simply making Japan a factory in the Far East is not only unreasonable and impossible, but also unacceptable. Finally, regarding the future relations between China and Japan, I would like to explain it in particular. Before I went abroad and after I arrived in Japan, I found that the people of China and Japan were equally concerned about the future of Sino-Japanese relations. This is of course not only because the two countries have close historical, geographical, cultural, and economic ties, but also because the people of both countries hope to start from a new foundation and establish a long-term plan for the two countries, due to the tragic lessons of this war. Originally, direct and normal state-to-state relations between China and Japan could not be discussed before the peace conference with Japan was held and the peace treaty was signed. However, China's fundamental policy towards Japan was already evident in President Chiang's statement of "not retaliating with resentment" towards Japan at the time of the war's end, and that statement was also a moral expression of the traditional spirit of the Chinese people. As far as recent Chinese public opinion is concerned, just like other United Nations countries, what the Chinese people expect from Japan is nothing more than the democratization of politics and the democratization of the economy that I mentioned above. If Japan can encourage ideological revolution and psychological construction and earnestly achieve the above two points, I am sure that the relationship between China and Japan will be able to embark on a rational and normal path. Countries in the world will also be happy to cooperate with the Japanese people. As for the hope of the Japanese government and people to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, restore their independent and autonomous status, and return to the international community, I express my deep feelings and believe that China will also continue to discuss with the relevant countries and seek ways to promote its early realization, based on its consistent advocacy of convening a new conference as soon as possible.

### Suggestions for the Rural Reconstruction Commission

— Chu Zirun

The Chinese Rural Reconstruction Commission was established based on Section 407 of the American Aid Act, with two commissioners appointed by the President of the United States and three commissioners appointed by the President of China. The commission has now been established. Commissioner Y.C. James Yen recently gave an interview to the Central News Agency, outlining the commission's future direction and approach based on his decades of experience in mass education. This has attracted attention from both Chinese and foreign individuals.

The rural reconstruction movement in China had already been gaining momentum before the war, as seen in the work of Y.C. James Yen in Ding County, Gao Jiansi in Wuxi, Liang Shuming in Zouping, Peng Yuting in Zhenping, Shen Xuanying in Dongxiang, and Tao Xingzhi in Xiaozhuang. Although their advocated rural construction movement, mass or people's education movement, rural self-defense movement, rural cooperative movement, agricultural extension movement went by different names, their goal was to transform and revitalize rural areas.

However, the first government-implemented initiative was the Jiangxi Rural Service District, established in 1933. At that time, Jiangxi was in ruins after the communist suppression and recovery. The National Economic Council invited three experts from the League of Nations, including Mr. Stam, to design a plan. Over one million yuan was allocated from the cotton and wheat loan to subsidize the establishment of rural cooperation, education, and health organizations in Jiangxi. In addition, 350,000 yuan was used to establish ten rural service districts in the four regions of Jiangxi, serving as bases for promoting various undertakings. However, this new aid bill, with 27.5 million US dollars allocated for rural reconstruction, is unparalleled in its financial strength and scale. This truly is an unprecedented undertaking in China. With the combined talents of Chinese and American experts and the full support of the government, those dedicated to rural work are greatly excited. As the author was working at the commission at the time, although the specific details have not yet been determined, I would like to offer a few suggestions:

First, a focus-oriented approach must be adopted. The 27.5 million US dollars of American aid is indeed a considerable sum for rural reconstruction, but given the vastness of rural areas and the depth of war damage, it would be a drop in the bucket if distributed evenly. A focus-oriented approach must be adopted to concentrate resources for easier and more effective results. For example, a cup of sugar water tastes sweet when concentrated, but becomes diluted and tasteless when too much water is added. We should not dilute this rural reconstruction funding and resources, trying to do everything and achieving nothing, resulting in no impact. The focus-oriented approach means selecting several counties within ten provinces for implementation. The effects of this focused implementation will naturally spread throughout the country. Regarding site selection, the primary consideration should be stability, with minimal threat from bandit disturbances. Rural construction work requires time and a stable environment. Otherwise, construction is difficult while destruction is easy, and ten years of effort can be undone in a day. It is better to be cautious and build a solid foundation than to take risks. The second consideration is that the local economy should have a sufficient base, so that the work plan does not deviate too far from the local economic conditions. What can be eaten can be digested, making it easier to take root, thrive, and grow locally. Thirdly, local cadres and leaders at all levels should have a good understanding of and express support for this work, turning resistance into assistance. This is not merely gilding the lily, but rather nurturing what is planted.

Furthermore, the business activities should also adopt a focus-oriented approach, adapting to local conditions and selecting the most urgent needs of farmers and those with the greatest development potential, concentrating resources on their implementation. For example, the mass education in Jiangsu in the past was a jumble, resulting only in increased trouble for farmers and nothing achieved. Critics also considered the mass education association in Ding County to have made this mistake. They were only continuing education and were experimental in nature, so they could disregard success or failure, but this time the American aid for rural reconstruction must succeed and cannot fail. Therefore, we must be careful and focus human and financial resources, be realistic and pragmatic, avoid repeating the past mistakes, and hope to achieve results for every effort made and success for every undertaking. Adopting a focus-oriented approach is a prerequisite for successful rural reconstruction.

Second, existing organizations and institutions must be utilized for implementation. Governance depends on people, and cadres determine everything. The issue of personnel is the key to determining success or failure. Will this rural reconstruction work utilize existing government agencies or will it appoint a new batch of cadres? This is a question worth noting. According to Chinese custom, whenever something is undertaken, a new organization is often established and a new group of people is used, as seen in the distribution of daily necessities to civil servants, the flat-price rice distribution in the five major cities, post-war relief, and material supply. Therefore, there is concern that the same will happen with this American aid for rural reconstruction. Based on Mr. Yan's published theories, it seems that he also has his own team. Judging by his attitude in Ding County, where he "absolutely did not want to mix with government-implemented county construction," he seems to be leaning towards establishing a separate implementing agency. This is worth serious consideration.

Implementing new policies certainly requires new people, but using more people means more expenses, which increases administrative costs and reduces project funding, inevitably repeating the mistakes of the Relief Administration. This is the first concern. Establishing a separate agency inevitably overlaps with existing local agencies, further complicating matters and dividing local authority, only adding to the confusion in rural areas. This is the second concern. For there to be solutions to China's rural problems, politicians, educators, economists, industrialists, and social reformers must all devote themselves to rural areas, but intellectuals going to the countryside ultimately have a certain distance from rural areas. This is the third concern. In the untamed Chinese countryside, it cannot be said that the Ding County model is universally applicable. If it is rigidly implemented, it may not be easily accepted by farmers. If it is not thorough, then it will inevitably be a case of the policy existing as long as the person is there, and the policy dying when the person is gone. After the work is completed, the countryside will still be the same as before. This is the fourth concern. Therefore, I advocate utilizing existing political agencies and all local organizations for implementation, using governing power to guide the situation. Of course, this approach also has its drawbacks, namely the incompetence and corruption of local cadres below the county level, which is worrying. But this can be remedied and avoided. One approach is to eliminate incompetence through legal means and utilize local organizations to select the virtuous and capable. Even in a small village of ten households, there must be someone who is loyal and trustworthy. Drawing talent from the local area, seeking it in the countryside after losing it in the court, is by no means an ideal. Another approach is to strengthen supervision, utilizing experts from all fields to go to the countryside and provide regular technical guidance to compensate for talent deficiencies.

Third, the work process must start with increasing production. The four major problems in rural China are poverty, ignorance, weakness, and selfishness. Mr. Yan advocates using the four types of education—literacy, livelihood, health, and citizenship—to address these issues, which is not without merit, but it must be understood that the root of the four major problems lies in poverty. Because they cannot afford to eat, they cannot receive education, hence ignorance. Because of poverty, they lack nutrition, hence weakness. Because of poverty, their survival is threatened, hence selfishness. Therefore, the implementation process of rural work, no matter what, should advocate becoming wealthy before being educated. Mencius said, "Only when the people are saved from death and fear not dying can they then be taught about ritual and righteousness." In a disrupted and impoverished rural area where saving lives is not possible, education is probably already seen as a luxury! Without developed production, there is no education to speak of; the driving force for rural reconstruction is definitely economics, not education. Therefore, more attention should be paid to improving rural economic life, starting with increasing production. For example, farmland irrigation, afforestation, the establishment of various cooperatives, the application of agricultural machinery, the promotion of superior varieties, the prevention and control of pests and diseases, the improvement of crop, horticulture, and animal husbandry production, and the processing and transportation of agricultural products, etc. Anything that is most suitable for the current situation and most effective will be widely welcomed by the farmers. Therefore, we should conduct a thorough investigation, benefiting the people by benefiting them, and proposing what they can work on and guiding them in doing so. When farmers receive practical benefits, their lives improve, and they feel that there is new hope for the future, they will naturally be more willing to accept being taught literacy, literature, self-governance, and hygiene knowledge. The more developed the production, the more urgent the need for education, which will make it easier to promote the entire social construction of politics, economics, culture, and self-defense, completing the task of rural reconstruction. Just as Mencius said, "It can be made to make a stick to strike the strong armor and sharp weapons of Chu." At that time, the education of force advocated by Mr. Yan can be fully realized. Neglecting the root and focusing on the branches is not what wise people would do.

### South Korean Special Envoy Arrives in Shanghai; Paid Respects to President Jiang Last Night in Nanjing

[Report by this Newspaper] South Korean Special Envoy Dr. Cho Byeong-ok arrived at Longhua Airport in this city at 1:45 PM yesterday on a Pan American flight from Tokyo. Deputy Envoy Chung Il-hyung, Economic Advisor Kim Woo-pyung, and Secretary Kim Joon-koo arrived with him. That evening at 7:30 PM, Cho and others attended a welcoming banquet hosted by Chen Guolian, director of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office. Pan Gongzhan, He Yaozu, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, and Xu Shaochang, our former Consul General in Yangon who has been transferred to Seoul, were also present. After the banquet, Cho and others took an overnight train to Nanjing to pay respects to President Chiang and senior government officials. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 14th, at which time they will be hosted by Mayor Wu Guozhen and introduced to various construction projects in the city. On the 15th, various sectors of Shanghai will hold a meeting to welcome the South Korean guests. Cho and others are scheduled to take a Northwest Airlines flight to Manila on the 16th and then travel to Washington on the 18th for a brief stay in the United States before attending the United Nations General Assembly in Paris.

After arriving in Shanghai, Cho met with visiting reporters at the International Hotel and made the following remarks:

### Remarks by Special Envoy Cho

The main purpose of this visit to China is to pay respects to President Chiang on behalf of President Syngman Rhee and to express sincere gratitude to President Chiang for his assistance in helping Korea achieve independence. When asked about the current situation in Korea, he optimistically replied: Korea is currently very peaceful, and the people are full of confidence. They believe that since the government has declared its establishment, the entire country should work together to achieve the independence and unity of all of Korea with the assistance of China, the United States, the Philippines, and other friendly nations. When asked about the situation in North Korea, he stated firmly: The nine million people of North Korea have already become "prisoners of a communist regime supported by foreign forces." For this reason, the twenty million people of South Korea should work even harder to unite and save their compatriots in North Korea from their plight.

This is Cho's second visit to China, but as he arrived in Shanghai in a hurry, he did not dare to speak of his impressions immediately. However, he expressed: The Korean people have always been concerned about the evolution of the situation in China after the victory of the war against Japan, and the Korean people also believe that China should resolve all of its own problems in the shortest possible time. This will not only maintain peace in the Far East, but also greatly assist in resolving the Korean issue. After all, the relationship between China and Korea has a history of thousands of years, so the problems of China and Korea are truly interdependent. In conclusion, he said: We hope that China will be able to eliminate all reactionary elements, especially the red elements, in the shortest possible time. The red elements are the common enemy of the people of China and Korea, and he is confident that China's work to eliminate the red terror will be successful.

### The Three Western Powers Have the Greatest Determination to Prevent the Westward Expansion of Soviet Influence, Moscow Negotiations Will Reopen Soon, If the Berlin Issue Is Not Resolved, It Can Only Be Referred to the United Nations

[Our newspaper's report] Moscow broadcast on the 11th: British, American, and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union are currently exchanging important letters and telegrams with their home governments to discuss what new steps to take to deal with the four-power talks on the Berlin issue. U.S. Ambassador Smith still got up at 3:00 a.m. to draft a telegram to Washington, but it is feared that the four-power talks will be difficult to hold this weekend.

[Our newspaper's report] London broadcast on the 11th: When Britain, the United States, and France discuss the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union again, they will propose a deadline, demanding that the Soviet Union reply with a specific date for lifting the Berlin blockade within the specified deadline, otherwise the issue can only be transferred to the United Nations for handling.

[Our newspaper's report] New York broadcast on the 11th: According to sources close to the diplomatic community, Britain, the United States, and France do not intend to continue discussing the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union. The three countries have decided to jointly publish a white paper, declaring that the Berlin incident is the fault of the Soviet Union, and stating that they will submit the issue to the United Nations for handling.

[United Press International, London, dispatch on the 11th] It is reported that if the planned new Moscow talks cannot break the deadlock, and the Berlin blockade continues, the Western countries are prepared to bring the Berlin crisis to the United Nations. The Western countries, especially the United States, believe that the Berlin blockade directly violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter (United Nations member states shall settle disputes by peaceful means). The BBC's diplomatic analyst said that Western envoys will try to hold another meeting with Premier Stalin to discuss the situation in Berlin. The Western envoys in Moscow will immediately try to hold another meeting with Soviet officials. They may again consult with Stalin, reporting that the four-power military commanders cannot reach an agreement on all the details based on the principles decided in the previous Moscow talks. At the same time, they will directly urge the highest Soviet authorities to pay attention to the fact that the Soviet officials responsible for Berlin have failed to prevent the current wave of riots.

[United Press International, Washington, dispatch on the 11th] Authoritative sources said today that the United Kingdom and the United States are currently working together to resist the Soviet Union's attempt to seize the power of Western Europe. The reason for this is that the West believes that the Soviet-sponsored riots in Berlin are just a prelude to the Soviet Union's destruction of the Marshall Plan and its seizure of political power in Germany and France. It is said that the strategy of Britain and the United States in dealing with all Soviet actions in political propaganda is "power against power, words against words." Authoritative sources also listed the following new developments as evidence that Britain and the United States have risen up in anger: (1) The U.S. 35th advance force has arrived in Gibraltar and will join the powerful British Mediterranean Fleet. (2) London reports that significant progress has been made in the U.S. military cooperation plan with the Western European Alliance countries. (3) U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal is seeking to allocate $103 million from the Treasury to increase U.S. aircraft production.

### Parliament Endorses Queuille to Take Office as Prime Minister, The New French Cabinet Will Be Formed Soon, Reorganizing Finances Is the Urgent Task of the New Cabinet

[United Press International, Paris, dispatch on the 11th] The new French Prime Minister Queuille (formerly translated as Quiiler) is expected to form a center-right government today to save France from economic collapse. Queuille continued to consult with leaders of various parties at 9:00 a.m., and by noon, the list of cabinet members had been largely completed.

[Our newspaper's report] Paris broadcast on the 11th: After Prime Minister Queuille takes office, his first step will be to rectify the country's financial situation. One is to reduce the budget, and the other is to increase taxes. The list of French cabinet members has not yet been finalized, but René Mayer of the Radical Socialist Party will reassume the position of Minister of Defense. It is expected that Mayer will follow the consistent style of the Radical Party and drastically reduce military spending.

[United Press International, Paris, dispatch on the 11th] The new French Prime Minister Queuille is an experienced veteran of the Radical Socialist Party, with over 20 years of political experience. The National Assembly passed his appointment yesterday with a vote of 351 to 196, with 71 abstentions. Before the vote, Queuille warned members of parliament that France would go bankrupt within a month if U.S. aid stopped. He called on all parties and factions to unite and cooperate to save France, which is facing an unprecedented post-war crisis.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, dispatch on the 11th] Berlin City Council Chairman Suhr, in his speech regarding the events of the 10th, said: "The fact that the police in the eastern district fired live ammunition makes us believe that they were ordered to do so.

### Record of Behind-the-Scenes Discussions Among Major Powers During the Initial Stage of the "January 28th Incident": First Public Release of Files by the U.S. State Department

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The U.S. State Department today released for the first time two volumes of diplomatic files regarding behind-the-scenes discussions among major powers during the initial conflict between China and Japan in Northeast China in 1932, titled "U.S. Diplomatic Relations, 1932." It fully describes matters in the Far East, with thousands of documents, including records of diplomatic conversations and private talks between U.S. diplomatic officials and high-ranking Chinese officials regarding Japan.

The State Department stated that the release of these documents aims to provide a deeper understanding of the causes of World War II, as they detail the various efforts made in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese conflict to prevent Japanese aggression. According to the records, Japan's expansion of military activities in Northeast China and its attack on Shanghai made its aggressive ambitions even more apparent. The records released today largely describe how then-U.S. Secretary of State Henry Stimson worked to gain international support for the principles stipulated in his January 7, 1932, enunciation of the U.S. non-recognition policy. Stimson also worked to uphold treaties supporting China's territorial and administrative integrity. Of particular note is the record of a long-distance telephone conversation between Stimson and then-British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in January 1932, which shows that the U.S. and Britain were greatly concerned about the conflict in Shanghai. However, apart from sending notes to China and Japan, no coordinated action was taken. While the records urged various countries to form a strong diplomatic united front, they did not suggest implementing economic or military sanctions against Japan. Conversations between then-U.S. Minister to China Nelson Johnson and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, T.V. Soong, Wellington Koo, and other high-ranking Chinese officials are also found in the two volumes of files released today. Generally speaking, these two volumes of documents can provide a deep understanding of the situation at the time and a further understanding of China's circumstances at the time.

### Seeds of the U.S.-Japan War Sprouted Early: Grew to Stimson Letter

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew and his staff had already recognized the possibility of war between the U.S. and Japan as early as 1932. The State Department released some documents on the 11th under the titles "U.S. Diplomatic Relations" Volumes 3 and 4, including a letter from Grew to Secretary of State Stimson dated August 26, 1932. It stated: "Although I do not believe that any small incident or lack of patience can currently trigger a U.S.-Japan war, we should be aware that the national mood in Japan is quite dangerous. A war mentality has been created among the Japanese public, similar to what the German militarists did in 1914. The Japanese armed forces were created for war, and they are fearless and welcome the arrival of war. The Japanese military has never failed and possesses unlimited confidence, so we should look ahead to future developments. The Japanese military intends to expand and modernize, so it hopes to use the current crisis to obtain funding. Therefore, it must first find a possible powerful enemy. China has long been an enemy, but it has been weak for a long time. The Soviet Union does not seem to be belligerent, so the Japanese army has set its sights on the United States, regarding it as a potential enemy to achieve its goals. Many officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are subject to the army, so some propaganda is issued by the ministry." Grew's letter included a memorandum from Military Attaché Lieutenant Colonel McKinley, which stated, "Japan's military production is increasing rapidly and is still continuing. Japan may be preparing for friction with the international community, but it seems more likely to confront the Soviet Union. The reason for its intensified activities may not be merely to clear the Northeast and conflict with China; its momentum seems to indicate that Japan has greater ambitions. Because the army is frantically preparing for war, a war must be fought, otherwise its power and prestige will be lost. Recently, there has been considerable anti-American propaganda in Japan, but its original intention may not be directed at the U.S. but at the Soviet Union."

The association also discussed many important cases: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau ordered each factory to open flour supply to the market at the price of 8.19. Since the government's currency reform, each factory affiliated to the association has been able to abide by the power order and supply the market as needed. At present, due to the problem of warehouse receipts, the market is full of floating flour, and the market price is lower than the factory's disk, so few customers open flour to the flour factory, but each factory has prepared to do its best to supply as much as possible at any time. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the government to handle food consumption frugally and ordered 85 pounds of flour to be made from 100 pounds of wheat. It was resolved that the association should sincerely support the government's food saving policy and strictly abide by the saving measures promulgated by the Ministry.

At present, there are a number of supplies at the North Station, knowing that they are urgently needed by other ports, but in order to prevent other planned supplies from escaping from this city, they have to be prohibited from being exported together.

### No Profit: Shortage of Western Medicines: Merchants Plan to Request Price Adjustment

[Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of price limits, the market situation of Western medicines in this city has formed a shortage situation, such as penicillin needles, which are extremely difficult to purchase. According to people in the Western medicine industry, because the price limit is too low, it is not enough to cover the cost. Taking penicillin as an example, the current cost per bottle is 60 cents U.S., and 40% of the "Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation Donation" must be paid, while the price limit is only 2.5 Gold Yuan. In addition, such as saccharin, the cost per hearing, including taxes, is 26.5 yuan, while the price limit is only 25.3 yuan. Under such circumstances, merchants are unwilling to import goods from foreign countries, and smuggled goods have also disappeared recently because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the market only relies on existing stocks for support, and the supply is in great shortage. It is said that Western medicine merchants plan to request the authorities to consider adjusting the price limit.

### Five Hundred Li in Northern Henan

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Ling Songshou

[Our Newspaper Report from Shashi, 3rd Day by Airmail] Since last autumn, when the communist Chen Geng's troops crossed the Yellow River and infiltrated the Funiu Mountain area, northern Henan has maintained a relatively well-off situation for the past year, amidst the raging flames of war burning on all sides.

The several large-scale battles of attack and defense at Tangyin, Anyang, and Xinxiang (six times) have tempered the people of northern Henan to calmly face the direct threat of weaving disputes; however, today the people of northern Henan indirectly bear the heavier burden imposed on them by the war in another respect.

Although the communist army currently in northern Henan has many units, their actual strength is very weak. The core unit is the 14th Column of Xu Xiangqian's troops, but it is only a small part. The remaining units, such as the New 9th Regiment, the New 10th Regiment, and the 46th, 47th, 49th, and 52nd Regiments, are just reorganizations of local teams, with a total number of less than 10,000 people. Recently, apart from the 41st and 42nd Brigades of the 14th Column, which were originally based near Hua County and have gradually moved to the vicinity of Fengqiu, the remaining communist troops are only looting materials, destroying transportation, and carrying out their life of roaming. From the communist perspective, northern Henan is currently not a major battlefield, but an important supply base. After Chen Geng infiltrated the western Henan mountains, they strategically gained an advantage, but the supply problem is their fatal wound. They cannot survive by relying on the mountains. According to recent intelligence, the communists have built a branch road westward from Handan on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, passing through Wu'an and reaching She County, and connecting it with a highway passing through Lucheng, Gaoping, and Jincheng in Shanxi Province and reaching Qinyang in northern Henan, and then southward, passing the Yellow River from Beibaipo (belonging to Meng County) on the north bank and leading to Luoyang. Handan is the military center of the communist Hebei-Henan-Shanxi border area. This road is quite important for the supply of communist arms and ammunition in western Henan, but apart from military supplies, they can only rely on northern Henan for food and clothing—especially materials that are lacking in the communist areas, such as electrical materials, cotton yarn, and Western medicines. Here, the reporter is willing to kindly point out one or two facts to the relevant authorities in northern Henan, which the reporter heard from the people. Of course, we hope that these are not facts.

Xinxiang

This is the heartland of northern Henan. It is said that the market is very chaotic. When I first arrived in Xinxiang and talked to friends, I expressed that Xinxiang's situation of being surrounded by communist bandits on all sides was too unstable. He said, "The Eighth Route Army won't attack Xinxiang!" "Why?" I asked quickly. He casually told me, "If the Eighth Route Army captures Xinxiang, they will lose a market for exchange." We can take the example of Zhang, the former section chief of the Xinxiang County government, who used military supplies to aid the communists.

In western northern Henan, people almost all know that Wu Zhi County is also a place where the communists exchange for the materials they need. The reporter confirmed a rumor from relevant sources: the Wu Zhi County magistrate was ill, and the magistrate's wife personally took charge of collecting "taxes" on materials transported from the communist area. Because of the floods in northern Henan, the reporter did not have the opportunity to visit Wu Zhi to ask whether there were any materials being transported out in addition to the materials being transported in.

Jiaozuo

Is an isolated island. Coal cannot be transported eastward, so it can only be transported northward. Of course, the communist area is less than ten li away from Jiaozuo in the west. In fact, it is always difficult to prevent the communists from using the grain they most need on this isolated island to exchange for coal, because after all, there are people in Jiaozuo, and people must eat. However, the people of Jiaozuo are not unaware that there are many small communist arsenals in the Taihang Mountains.

Before Luoyang fell to the communists, the Bian-Luo-Zheng line lay across the banks of the Yellow River, and the situation still looked presentable. Moreover, the Longhai Railway could sometimes reach Xuzhou. Therefore, at that time, the military authorities did not pay much attention to northern Henan. Every time Bian-Luo-Zheng was in trouble, there was an order to abandon northern Henan. Anyang and Jiaozuo were the first targets to be abandoned. When Chen (Yi) and Liu (Bocheng)'s heavy troops directly attacked Xinzheng this spring after the battle in western Henan, and Zhengzhou was in imminent danger, even Xinxiang was preparing to take necessary measures to retreat and hold the bridgehead on the north bank of the Yellow River. In the midst of all this, General Li Zhenqing, the commander of a certain division of the garrison in northern Henan, was indispensable. In

Northern Henan

His division is the core unit. He repeatedly and earnestly petitioned the highest authorities, explaining the importance of northern Henan, and only then was today's northern Henan preserved. In such a large area in northern Henan, he was able to allocate troops to defend the isolated city of Anyang in the north and the isolated point of Jiaozuo in the west, becoming two tentacles extending outwards from Xinxiang towards the Taihang Mountains, and further shielding Henan. Otherwise, if northern Henan were shrouded in a red atmosphere, today's isolated island of Bian-Zheng would be a different situation. Not only that, although the situation in Bian-Zheng is bad, it is still a valuable fortress in the current Central Plains war situation. However, if northern Henan had been abandoned in the first place, it would be difficult to supply the troops stationed in Henan today. For the past year, what we can control on the Longhai Line are only a few cities and county towns. Military supplies and grain are mostly borne by northern Henan. This is the first heavy burden on the shoulders of the people of northern Henan today.

The northwest of northern Henan is all mountainous, and the grain production on the plains in the southeast is also very limited. Even in peacetime, it cannot be self-sufficient. Moreover, among the 25 county towns in northern Henan, only Yuanwu and Yangwu counties can control the entire county. Eighteen counties can enter the territory to implement government orders (of which four counties cannot even enter the city). The rest, such as Jiyuan, Qinyang, Meng, Wen, She, and Wu'an counties, are all occupied by the communists. What we can control is not very large. In addition, natural disasters almost always plague northern Henan every year, and the communists take advantage of their roaming actions to loot grain everywhere. The countryside is empty, so the grain shortage among the people in northern Henan is already a serious problem, let alone the public grain and military grain that the government wants to collect? However, northern Henan has not let down the government after all. The grain for the troops stationed in northern and southern Henan has been supplied bit by bit in a squeezing state, although the people have long been eating black bread and corn to survive.

Public Grain

Administrative agencies can do without lights (such as the Xiuwu County government) or newspapers (such as the Xinxiang County government), but the expenses of administrative agencies at all levels are always needed. Although the people eat black bread and corn, black bread and corn are also grain! In this situation, northern Henan, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, launched a grain grabbing campaign against the communists. In order to maintain the needs of the people, county governments with strength often lead the people to the countryside to grab the public grain of the communists, such as Xiuwu County Magistrate Xu Wentao, who often guerilla outside, waiting for the communist loopholes, and then leading the people to transport the grain that was originally robbed by the communists.

Here, the reporter should introduce General Li Zhenqing. He is a general supported by countless people in northern Henan. His shadow is engraved in the hearts of every person in northern Henan. He is nicknamed "Li Iron Head."

Under his leadership, he launched two

Grain grabbing campaigns, which alleviated the grain shortage in the Qinpan area this spring. Since Zhengzhou, in Xinxiang, in Xiuwu, in Jiaozuo, in any place in northern Henan that the reporter has visited, the people know General Li. They know: without General Li, northern Henan would have long been the communist world; without General Li, this year's spring famine would never have been overcome! Li Zhenqing's maneuver warfare, aimed at the communist roaming, has a popular song among the communist troops in northern Henan: "I'm not worried about the sky, I'm not worried about the earth, I'm just afraid of meeting Li Iron Head!" Recently, a certain brigade of General Li's troops circled around the plain area in western northern Henan, and fought all the way to Puyang in southern Hebei, capturing a lot of loot. Unfortunately, the reporter only met Li once in Zhengzhou. When the reporter arrived in northern Henan, Li had already flown to Nanjing on official business, otherwise meeting and talking would have added a lot to this manuscript.

In addition, there is another thing about Li that is worth mentioning. He pays special attention to the training, equipment, and use of local teams. All sectors in northern Henan unanimously acknowledge that the ability of the northern Henan teams has been greatly enhanced since Li's reorganization. Li used the repair shop attached to the Zhongfu Coal Mine in Jiaozuo, using existing power, and combined it into a small arsenal. Now this factory can produce 30 light machine guns per month, specifically for equipping the teams.

The people of northern Henan bear heavy burdens on their shoulders, and in addition to the heavy burdens, there are many external obstacles that make the burden even heavier. The reporter chatted with Qian Jingzhong, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth Administrative District of Henan Province stationed in Xinxiang. He said: Since the Anti-Japanese War, he has been acting as a scarificer for the people of northern Henan, but today, telling the people to bleed is no longer a question of whether it hurts, but whether they have any blood left.

### The Huangdu Shen Woman's Violent Death Case: Authorities Order Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment

[Report from Our Qingpu Bureau, 10th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying from Tangwan, Huangdu, who died violently after being illegally detained by the district office, was re-examined by forensic doctor Xuan Fang of the Jiangsu High Court on August 28th. The autopsy report arrived in the county on the 8th, determining the cause of death as "rape leading to death," causing public outrage. Wang Jiyuan, the Chief Trial Judge of the county's judicial office, and Judge Wang Zhengyu stated: "Since the rape aspect of the case has been determined, there is already a clue. The identity of the main culprit is currently under investigation. All aspects of the case will be handled fairly in accordance with the spirit of the judiciary." Luo Zhanyun, the leader of the Third Platoon of the First Militia Company (stationed at the Qinglong District Office), is a major suspect in the case. In mid-August, when the provincial government's supervisory team arrived in Qingpu, they learned of this case and another case of rape involving a rural woman surnamed Fan (in which Luo is also a major suspect). Due to the poor discipline of the troops and the uproar in local public opinion, the provincial security command was telegraphed to dismiss Zeng Guoheng, the company commander. Luo was ordered to be detained by the county government and ordered to conduct a thorough investigation and strict handling within a time limit to rectify discipline and appease public anger. He has now been transferred to the judicial office for detention and investigation. Personnel related to the district office are also under investigation by the judicial office. This public case will soon be clarified.

[Another Report] Regarding the rumor that Liao Bin, the trial judge in the Qingpu Huangdu Shen woman's case, was dismissed and investigated, the Jiangsu High Court ordered a replacement of the trial judge in the county judicial office on August 18th. Wang Jiyuan took over as the new Chief Trial Judge. Liao was not dismissed and investigated. Because the internal inspection officials and clerks of the judicial office suddenly resigned and fled, Liao, as the original trial judge in the case, advocated that the High Court send a forensic doctor for examination. His transfer was due to unqualified experience.

### Tomb of the Fragrant Concubine: The Dome of the Tomb Collapses

### Militarization of Autonomous Personnel: Yongkang County Implements First

[Report from Our Hangzhou Bureau, 11th] The magistrate of Yongkang County, Zhejiang, believes that the township heads and other autonomous personnel in the county are all wealthy gentry who are often coerced by bandits, acting perfunctorily, resulting in the failure of government orders to be implemented and the difficulty in achieving effective bandit suppression. Therefore, he requested permission to use retired army officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel as district chiefs, major or captain as township heads, and lieutenant or second lieutenant as township squad deputies or general affairs officers, with soldiers serving as bao chiefs or bao squad deputies. The provincial government, in addition to the restoration of the district office needing to be submitted for verification, has approved the adjustment of baojia personnel to be handled accordingly.

### Naval and Army Warships in Dinghai: Begin Powerful Search and Seizure Operations

[Report from Our Ningbo Bureau, 11th] In order to thoroughly suppress the bandit gangs of Xu Xiaoyu and Wang Rongxuan who have fled to the islands of Dinghai, Chen Daqing, the Deputy Director of Pacification of the province, specially went to Dinghai yesterday with Mao Sen, the Director of the Provincial Police Security Department, and others to personally supervise the suppression, and transferred four elite regiments of the 75th Division to accompany them.

### Sun Pusheng Case in Jiangyin: Township Head Niu Summoned

[Report from Our Jiangyin Bureau, 10th] Sun Guanyin, from Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen Township, accused Niu Yusheng, the head of Mazhen Township, of falsely accusing his son, Sun Pusheng, of colluding with bandits and killing him while trying to escape. The local court accepted the case of Niu Yusheng abusing his power and killing innocent people. On July 31st, the local prosecutor's office conducted an interrogation and ordered Sun Guanyin to transport his son's coffin to the city for examination within seven days. More than a month has passed, and it is said that the Sun family has been persuaded and no longer wants to pursue the matter, so the coffin has not been transported to the city. On the 9th, the prosecutor's office summoned Township Head Niu to court. He flatly denied killing Sun Pusheng, stating that Sun Pusheng was secretly colluding with bandits and had reports from victims as evidence, and was killed while trying to escape after being arrested. The court stated that the case still needs further investigation and ordered the defendant, Township Head Niu, to post bail and be summoned for further questioning at a later date.

### Legislator Cheng Siyuan: Accused of Seducing and Raping

Zheng Jie Calls for Support for Justice

[Report from Our Nanjing Bureau, 10th] Zheng Jie, who has been publishing advertisements in the Central Daily News in Nanjing for days, claiming that Cheng Siyuan, a legislator from Guangxi, seduced and raped his fiancée, Shi Hong, and appealing to Kuomintang comrades and people from all walks of life, held a press conference on the 10th. Zheng looked haggard, but his thinking and speech were still very calm. In a low, clear tone, he described the twists and turns of his love and engagement with Shi Hong, and Cheng's pursuit of her with improper means and capturing her. He accused Cheng of being immoral and depraved, which is a great irony to China's democratic constitutionalism and reformed politics. He said that Shi Hong's inner remorse and pain have reached the extreme, and his love for Shi is still firm, without any unforgiveness, but he will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to prevent Shi's destruction. Finally, he said: He has filed a lawsuit with the Capital District Court, although he knows that the court and the law cannot provide any protection for Shi or impose sanctions on Cheng, but human society's morality and public opinion have its own fair standards. After Zheng finished his report, a representative of the "Support Association for Zheng Jie's Fiancée Shi Hong's Seduced and Raped by Cheng Siyuan Incident" stepped forward to speak, calling on the news media to uphold justice.

### Regarding the Collection of Space Reservation Fees: If the Family is Poor, Admission is Still Permitted Even if the Fee is Not Paid

[Report from Our Bureau] The Municipal Education Bureau previously allowed schools in the city to collect space reservation fees from students at the end of the term because the mobility of students in the city's schools was quite large during the Luan period, so as to calculate the number of places and facilitate enrollment.

The telegram is currently being drafted and will be sent to the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and other courts today.

Jiaotong University Appeals: Experts Correct

[Another Report] The Professor Association of National Jiaotong University in this city believes that the government's reform of the currency system has still failed to improve the treatment of public education personnel in the slightest, and it is really an excessive disregard for the lives of the people. They specially telegraphed the National Congress Representative Friendship Association, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Ministry of Education in Nanjing for an urgent appeal. They requested timely consideration and prompt correction in order to improve the lives of general public education personnel. They also sent letters to professor associations of national colleges and universities across the country for liaison, hoping to give support. The text of the telegram stated:

Unanimously Support Currency Reform

"This government's reform of the currency system, to save inflation and stabilize the social economy, is an emergency and necessary measure and there is no doubt it should be unanimously supported to overcome difficulties. However, the foundation of the social economy lies in the improvement of general life. In the decade of war, most people have been mired in deep water and misery, especially public education personnel.

Intellectuals are the Backbone

Public education personnel are the grassroots cadres of the national government and are all intellectuals. The state of mind is no different from a pillar in the midst of a raging river. Therefore, whether government affairs can be clarified and whether thought can be corrected depends on this establishment. In recent years, corruption has been rampant and turmoil has not stopped. The reason is based on this. The treatment of public education personnel was sufficient before the Anti-Japanese War. Payment at an 80% discount during the initial stage of the Anti-Japanese War was barely maintainable. Afterwards, inflation increased and treatment decreased. Initially, there were no complaints in silence, but then there was no way to live, and it has become the phenomenon of today. It is regrettable that this currency reform has been too negligent in the treatment of public education personnel. The new currency and silver yuan have already been halved, and now there are discounts of 20% and 10%.

Treatment is Low: Truly Lamentable

Therefore, the low treatment is truly lamentable. Without corrective measures, the failure to improve the efficiency of government affairs, and the failure to completely stabilize society, the government cannot shirk its responsibility. People of similar circumstances could not bear to remain silent. They highly hoped that all measures in the future must extend to the grassroots level. There should be a clear understanding of improving people's livelihood. The unreasonable regulations for the treatment of public education this time should be promptly reconsidered and promptly corrected in order to remedy the situation."

### "Carrying Glory on Oars": Vice President Chen Speaks to the Education Circle: Education and Economy; Citizens and School Teachers Jointly Present a Banner to Pay Respect

[Report from Our Bureau] The Municipal Education Bureau invited Chen Lifu, the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, to give a speech to the principals and teachers of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of Zhendan University. Gu Yuxiu, the President of the Political University, Hu Wenyao, the President of Zhendan University, and hundreds of other principals and teachers of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city attended. First, Li Ximou, the Acting Director of the Education Bureau, gave a speech to introduce him. Then, Vice President Chen talked about his feelings about attending the World Moral Re-Armament Movement conference in the United States. Vice President Chen said: Education and economy are interconnected. Developed education can promote economic development and industrial and commercial prosperity. Conversely, economic development and national wealth can make education flourish. The United States has a large number of university students and complete facilities because the country is stable and wealthy. In contrast, our country's education and economy have failed to cooperate. Eighty percent of the country's population are farmers, and they are not placed at the center of all problems. Only the deformed development of urban commerce is promoted, without regard to the rural areas that produce the most. For example, tea and silk are famous products of our country, but we do not know how to train talents and improve them to export in large quantities and earn foreign exchange, resulting in the gradual loss of our world market position. Vice President Chen's speech lasted for one hour and was full of warnings. After the speech, the Joint Association of Teachers of Public Schools in the city presented Vice President Chen with a banner that reads, "Carrying Glory on Oars," and Vice President Chen accepted it with a smile.

### Public School Teachers

— Jingwen

The term "public school teachers" is probably a product of the post-war era, as it seems that in the past, people rarely connected these two occupations. Back then, civil servants were generally referred to as "those who eat from the government," and a Zhongshan suit and a black briefcase were a special symbol of middle and upper-level civil servants. Especially in small inland cities that had not seen much of the world, the title "eating from the government" seemed to carry a special status, and it sounded quite impressive.

Teachers, although not as "prestigious" as civil servants, had a higher moral standing than "those who eat from the government." Although the lives of these two professions were not particularly affluent at the time, they were still desirable jobs for ordinary people, because even if they weren't rich, they could at least have a stable life. If you had no ambitions and were genuinely interested in the life of a "public servant" or a lonely desk, it was possible for it to become your lifelong career.

I think that if we use occupational distinctions to measure the rise and fall of a country, then the progress and decline of the public school teacher profession should be a suitable measure. Why? Because these two professions represent the stable force of the intellectual backbone of a country. Industrial labor is undoubtedly the ultimate deciding factor in a country's economic strength, but to elevate the results of industrial labor into a country's culture and civilization, we must not only focus on production labor but also further support mental laborers. Ancient slave societies could also produce aristocratic cultures, but this was ultimately abnormal. In a society where physical and mental labor are not developed in a balanced manner, the civilization it displays, no matter how brilliant it may seem, will ultimately be unsustainable.

Since the impact of the Industrial Revolution spread throughout the world, the social structure of various countries has undergone tremendous changes, and the most significant feature is the existence of the so-called intellectual class. Prior to this, intellectuals were limited to a few officials, monks, scholars, and philosophers. Although they had their own special status in ancient societies, they did not have a collective social status. The attainment of social status as an intellectual class by intellectuals will inevitably occupy an important page in the future history of world culture.

The so-called intellectual class, although it cannot be strictly called a class, has become the real stabilizing force in modern society precisely because it does not have a fixed, narrow class nature. In terms of occupational categories, the so-called white-collar class is more than enough to represent the representative layer of the intellectual class in any society. Public school teachers are the most powerful link in this representative layer. Although those who constitute the intellectual class are not limited to public school teachers, in any modern and progressive country, the occupational status and quantity of public school teachers will inevitably be at the forefront of other intellectual occupations. Although the social status of other so-called freelancers outside of public school teachers is also extremely important, a prominent writer or poet does not necessarily represent the universal cultural development of a country. For example, in serfdom-era Russia, great writers emerged one after another, but the general cultural level of Russian society at the time was far behind that of Western European countries. Conversely, in a society where the intellectual class can achieve universal development, even if no great thinkers or poets have yet emerged, the cultural level of that society will inevitably achieve a more balanced development, and the lives of its general population will also be more stable and prosperous. This is the case in the United States today, and the United Nations is also approaching this state.

However, the lives of public school teachers in our country after the war have been devastated and hit hard. Not only have they struggled on the brink of starvation for a long time, but there is also a great tendency for them to be unable to survive. The country's economic strength is perhaps weak, which may be a fact, but looking around the situation, it is appropriate to say that we should worry about inequality rather than scarcity.

Although I have had connections with both of these professions, my motivation for writing this short article is by no means out of selfish thoughts. Poor civil servants and poor teachers have become famous for being poor in recent years, and their living conditions are sometimes inferior to those who work hard with their own hands and feet. The lives of physical laborers should naturally be continuously improved, but the lives of mental laborers cannot be ignored either. The prosperity and development of a country must rely on the balance of life among its social members. Even in countries that advocate class societies, they spare no effort to improve the lives of intellectuals and raise the social status of the white-collar class in order to integrate physical and mental labor. Why are we instead degrading the intellectuals who are the backbone of society?

Perhaps some people say that no public school teachers have been heard of starving to death so far, and no one has gone to the office shirtless. But this is like a lung patient whose internal decay may not immediately be apparent on the outside. In fact, teachers who wear their wives' trousers to class and civil servants who commit suicide due to poverty have already been discovered.

### A Record of Passing Through the Pass

— Shi Shufan

The road is unclear in the stony and barren land,
The number of postal stations is like announcing names.
An old hut sits at the pass,
Is it serving tea or guarding the border?

Wind-blown sand and earth cook yellow rice,
Playing on the hills, the true face is revealed.
Evening clouds of She County, crystal of Changhua,
Who asks the lone traveler about his journey?

Last night, I ate my fill of pumpkin rice,
With a few slices of autumn pear and half a cup of wine.
Heaven fills the traveler with joy,
And a handful of peanuts on the way out of the pass.

Year after year, waking and drunk on the road,
Forgetting my meals, my country, and my home.
Suddenly, a great fury surged in my heart,
And the mountains were covered in white sesame flowers.

A row of bean flowers bright by the stream fence,
As the red sorghum ripens and the grass grows again.
With disheveled hair, wearing blue cloth clothes,
Pity her small feet managing the farm.
Heavily armed, the evening tower is now empty,
The autumn sounds in the alley connect with dreams.
No wonder my beard is half gray,
The light of the journey has also faded from the red of the past.

Autumn reeds on the sandy path, dew turns to smoke,
A few willows stand beside the abandoned city.
The mountain sleeps, the stream is sick, the stars are weak,
Even the deep ridges of the mountains are pitiful in the moonlight.

Travel-worn clothes with scattered spots,
Changing direction, the clear stream sends me back by the moon.
Waking up in the tall building, it's hard to sleep,
The night tide floats the pagoda, the mountains are scattered.

### People Who Can't Get Enough to Eat

— Suo Bei

The Chinese people are very "extreme" when it comes to eating. Among the recipes of all countries in the world, ours is the most astonishing: from grass skins and tree roots to chicken, duck, fish, and shark fins, nothing is omitted.

Today, one-third of the people are eating tree roots, grass skins, and even human flesh, while another fraction of the population indulges in delicacies of every kind. Whether it's a happy occasion or a funeral, a grand feast is a must, not only to be full and drunk but also to have a bloated stomach. Spending half a day on eating is not considered a waste of time, and it should be that way.

Westerners ask "How are you?" when they meet. We ask "Have you eaten?" Allied personnel working in China during the Anti-Japanese War also picked up the habit of treating people to meals. According to them, "In China, anything can be accomplished by eating and drinking."

Therefore, whether before or after victory, in China's major cities (especially Shanghai), people with money could eat whatever they wanted, no less than in a "golden yuan country." World Games athletes who had to bring their own food abroad felt uncomfortable and were immediately liberated upon returning to Shanghai.

Even a small country like England has "eggs for everyone" and eats sparingly, saving the rest to sell abroad in exchange for foreign exchange. The Soviet Union, one of the two major powers, also practices thrift and saves money to build industries. But we have 17th-century production and 20th-century waste, eating crazily and desperately, without any regard for the actual effectiveness of food. The entire meaning of life is entrusted to the tongue. As a result, according to medical experts, the Chinese have larger and more fearful stomachs than Westerners, but the average lifespan is only thirty-two years.

The Chinese people's love of eating and excessive consumption has been evident since ancient times. Traditionally, prisoners on the execution ground must ask for a full meal before death to avoid becoming hungry ghosts. It can be said that even in death, they must eat! Furthermore, the seven necessities of life are all for eating. I don't understand whether we are like this because we have never been full in the past, or because we are eternally unable to get enough to eat.

It is Mid-Autumn Festival again. The rich in Shanghai will invariably push through the ranks of refugees and beggars before rushing into large restaurants to indulge in excessive drinking and eating to celebrate the festival. As for mooncakes with ham and egg yolks at home, they are naturally piled up like mountains.

Therefore, the authorities have another proposal to save peanuts and soybeans to exchange for foreign exchange. The rich will inevitably shake their heads, because they would rather eat the foreign exchange to fatten themselves.

In a peaceful and prosperous age, their eating habits and style are not "national health," let alone today?

### Quitting Smoking

— Tanke

In order to show my determination and perseverance and to "prove myself" to my wife, I decided to quit smoking. I frantically smoked all the remaining five or six cigarettes in my pocket in one go and scrubbed my fingers, which had been yellowed by smoke, with soap and a brush. Although the smoke yellow on my fingers was not completely removed, I finally made up my mind to wash my hands and not smoke. Perhaps the action was a bit too much, as my wife laughed beside me. When I asked her why she was laughing, she didn't answer. Did she think I wouldn't know if she didn't say? It was clearly contemptuous and suspicious, as if saying, "Quit smoking? See if you can!"

Fine! No smoking no matter what. I even "swore by splashing water" in the bath at night. Half a day passed, and of course, nothing happened overnight.

The next morning, I reached into my pocket to pull out a cigarette, and the two words "quit smoking" immediately appeared in my mind. This was a self-warning, as if it were audible. But it didn't feel natural to me, like seeing the "No Smoking" sign in a movie theater. Friends came to chat, and when they saw that I didn't offer them cigarettes, they started inviting me to smoke. Although I declared that I had started quitting, they still diligently urged me to smoke. Watching them blow clouds and spit out mist, I naturally couldn't help but waver a little, but I just wouldn't smoke. That was it.

After my friends left, I looked at books and wrote something alone. Several times I reached into my pocket, and several times I reached out from my pocket to rummage through the drawer, but of course, there were no cigarettes. At this point, I was extremely annoyed. On normal days, I would immediately go buy cigarettes, but I had quit smoking, determination, perseverance, face...

I desperately tried to calm myself down. I tried to pull my attention to the books, but this was like forcing myself to fall asleep, with no effect at all. On the contrary, "smoke, smoke, smoke" kept jumping in my mind.

My wife patted me on the back:

"Smoke!"

She handed me a pack of cigarettes. I looked at the pack of cigarettes and stubbornly said the word "No." My wife had already sensed what was on my mind and whispered in my ear:

"Why are you being stubborn! Smoke! It would be even more embarrassing if you went to buy them yourself later!"

My quitting smoking, at

### False News

— Gongsun Wu

A senior told me that the telegram "The Capital Falls, the Emperor Flees" in the Xinhai Revolution was fabricated by the Tianduo Newspaper in Shanghai. The newspaper issued an extra edition one day, printing these four characters in large font, claiming it was a telegram from Beijing, which caused a frenzy among the people. This fabricated news was immediately spread to various places, especially Hong Kong and Guangzhou, which led to the uprising in Guangdong. The owner of the Tianyi Newspaper, Mr. Li Wenqing from Nanhai, was credited for his contribution to the establishment of the Republic of China. Ten years later, he once served as the magistrate of Maoming, and so on. I believe that those who have contributed to the revolution must have people who love to tell stories to commend them. I regret that I have little knowledge and can only briefly describe what I have heard above. In the Xinhai Revolution, people knew that the Qing Dynasty was bound to perish, but when the revolutionary army was at a disadvantage, how could the capital fall? The masses did not think or ask. A few years ago, I learned that there were so-called "strategic news," which had a good name but were mostly fabricated. This is called spreading rumors. Spreading rumors is a means, and it depends on the purpose. However, during international wars, there are too many and chaotic false news from all sides, and people are gradually losing faith in it. If it is said that running a newspaper must have a special purpose, each newspaper has its own stance. Even if these newspapers do not spread rumors, their handling of news is almost without a single word that is not strategic. Newspapers record events, which are called contemporary history. Our ancestors attached great importance to historical writing. Now that the atmosphere has changed, do journalists still regard themselves as historians? The four elements of historical talent, historical knowledge, historical understanding, and historical morality, as advocated by Liu Zixuan and Zhang Shizhai, must not be regarded as outdated words. The word "report" comes from Japan, and our people compete to use it. I don't understand its meaning, but I only know that it is a verb, not the "way" of judo or tea ceremony.

### Excerpts from Yun Wenti's Orchid Minor Works Continued (Part Two)

— Bai Jiao

Orchid and Chinese Orchid in Harmony

A person from Guangdong said to Yunjiansheng: "Reading your orchids and Chinese orchids is like drinking pure and fragrant wine. How did you achieve this?" Yunjiansheng said: "In the past, Emperor Gaozu of Tang said, 'The arena of fame and fortune is a battlefield of swords and spears!' This flower was originally in the mountains, enduring snow and ice. It was originally trouble-free, emitting fragrance and sending out its beauty. You happened to obtain it!"

Eternal Thoughts of Plum Blossoms

Differences in behavior and inconsistency in language, the fragrance of the nation suffers from war and fire. If you are truly open-minded, can we talk about the end of the year? Running around in the dust, competing for success and speed, alas, alas, there is no such thing in the depths of the clouds, but there is this evil!

Longevity

One is not too few, a hundred is not too many, so that ancient and modern people pay attention, and the future is satisfactory. So I clapped my hands with my clumsy wife and laughed outside the mundane world! Bai Jiao's drunken excitement.

Spring-Welcoming Plum Blossoms

In the past, a Taoist said, "No one can obtain this fortune in black and white, which causes illness." What is good about this Taoist? Fu Weng only entrusts his long-held heart!

Green Cloud Creation

Fu Weng has smoke coming out of his nose, nothing on his mind, beer in front of his eyes, and flowers blooming on paper, so that the monk is happy to praise! Presented to Reverend Hui as an offering.

Chinese Orchid

Zhang Huizi has a clean freak and lives alone in a room, with only a few things such as desks and bookshelves. She exclusively requests Bai Jiao's orchid calligraphy to decorate the wall. This painting is written for her, so that bees and butterflies may not be frivolous.

Wulin Immortal

Spreading fragrance with self-labor, with its own good looks, from summer to autumn, without sparing sweat, it has not changed since victory. This was inspired by drunkenness, flourishing after wine, and has not yet been appreciated. It should be returned!

Mountain Orchid

This orchid, if it goes down the mountain, is called Yemei by Shen Ji, and Baimei by Yunjian. How can it be superior in its natural elegance and far away in its silent depths? One can only sigh here. Like the owner of the Nine Bees Pavilion, longing for apotheosis, how peculiar!

Global Lotus Tripod

The king's body is large, and he laughs at the drawing work like chicken feet. Those who have never seen it will ridicule it.

It has the meaning of mountains and marshes, not the things of the wind and dust. The wise men of the past had this demeanor, but today they have no such spirit.

"Ink and brush are for playing, the matter is truly indestructible, the hand is lazy and the heart is diligent, the paper is high and the eyes are free from debt!" This is a sentence in a poem that this layman gave to a friend in the past. Reaching this realm, the art must be worth seeing. This work is inspired, not owed. Kao Ting said. (The End)
