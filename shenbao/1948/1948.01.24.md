### Issue of Large Denomination Taiwan Dollars: Authorities Considering Carefully

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 23rd] According to various reliable sources, the issue of 500-yuan banknotes by the Bank of Taiwan is only a matter of timing. The Research Office of the Bank of Taiwan convened a symposium of 16 experts to discuss the lending to private enterprises and the issuance of large denomination banknotes. Although there were no definite results, it was generally believed that if loans to private enterprises were to be opened up, it would be necessary to issue large denomination banknotes. The central government has limited the issuance of banknotes by various banks to 17 billion, and it has already reached more than 15 billion. However, the authorities are considering whether the issuance of large denomination banknotes will affect commodity prices or even cause opposition from the provincial people, shaking people's hearts. Therefore, the timing and technology of the issuance will be carefully discussed. It is reliably learned that the issuance of these large denomination banknotes will depend on the success of Mr. Bei Zuyi's fundraising in the United States. If the loan is successful, the appearance of large denomination banknotes will still have to wait.

### Hebei Provincial Government Paralyzed: No End in Sight for the Turnover

They have sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Premier Zhang, and Commander-in-Chief Fu, requesting them to forward telegrams to the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu Xichun, and the heads of various provincial committees and departments to take office in Baoding as soon as possible.

[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] It was announced on the 23rd that General Chu Xichun had telegraphed from Pan Yang that he would soon come to Peiping (Beiping) to take office as Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government.

### US Plots to Occupy Japan Long-Term? Communist Radio Broadcast Denounces MacArthur

[United Press, This City News] It was heard here on the 23rd from the CCP radio station broadcasting from "a certain place in northern Shaanxi" that the Japanese occupation authorities had claimed that a "secret Japanese government" was attempting to undermine the Allied occupation policy. However, in fact, the "secret government" was only a tool of the Supreme Commander MacArthur. The CCP broadcast claimed that MacArthur was conspiring with former military leaders and frustrated diplomats to create an atmosphere of secret conspiracies in order to indefinitely prolong the US occupation of Japan. MacArthur is "Public Enemy Number One." The United States is deliberately launching a movement to abolish the veto power of the four Pacific powers and is supporting an eleven-nation peace conference so that a peace conference with Japan cannot be convened. The red radio station also claimed that "Shanghai commentators have said that the entire plan of US imperialism is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against Eastern countries." The United States is also demanding to obtain naval and air bases in China, Japan, and Korea so that its military power in the Far East can be continued. (A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 23rd said that informed sources in Tokyo believe that the CCP broadcast's accusation that MacArthur was attempting to prolong the occupation period was "completely wrong." MacArthur has repeatedly requested the convening of a peace conference and advocated the early withdrawal of the occupation forces. Reliable sources say that MacArthur has not changed his original intention, and all previous documents are still valid.)

### Shenyang Holds Military Conference: Wei Lihuang Says Cooperation Will Surely Suppress Communist Bandits, Xinlitun Offensive and Defensive Battle Reaches Climax

The bandits, at the cost of heavy casualties, continue to transfer reinforcements from all sides, reaching more than 30,000 people. The battle on the 22nd was particularly fierce. In order to seize Shuangshanzi (east of Xinlitun), the communist bandits launched wave-like assaults under the fierce artillery fire of the national army, once every hour, but were repelled and severely damaged. In the afternoon, after part of the bandits broke through the north and south highlands, they advanced towards Xinlitun. The national army is currently attacking them fiercely.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 22nd] On the afternoon of the 20th, the national army's Jixi sweeping force contacted two regiments of bandits in the area south of Jiangjungou Xiyang (70 li southwest of Jilin). After half a day of fierce fighting, the national army defeated a battalion of the 71st regiment and a company of the 74th regiment of the bandits. The bandits fled in panic to Dagangzi, Xiangshuihe, and Daheishan (15 li southwest of Xiyang).

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department has prepared to close the US Consulate in Changchun because it is almost completely surrounded. Consul Xue Pengshi has been ordered to safely evacuate all American residents from the besieged city. State Department officials believe this is the first step in the final order for Xue Pengshi to close the consulate and withdraw to Shenyang. However, the closure of the US Consulate in Changchun is only a temporary expedient, pending improvement in the situation. The US Embassy in Nanjing has the right to act accordingly in this matter. The closure of the consulate in Changchun will or should be ordered by Ambassador Stuart.

### Outlying Strongholds of Baoding Recovered

### Secretary of State Marshall Announces U.S. Aid to China Bill Ready; Thorp Officially Hosts Our Delegation

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Marshall announced today that a substantive aid to China bill has been drafted by the State Department but is not yet ready to be submitted to Congress for discussion. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, previously sent a letter to Marshall requesting that he immediately submit an aid to China plan. Marshall's reply has been released by Bridges. It states that the aid to China bill still needs to be submitted to the National Advisory Council and the Bureau of the Budget for review. It can be completed within this week, at which time President Truman can submit it to Congress for discussion.

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials say there are indications that the aid to China plan may be submitted to Congress within two weeks. They acknowledged that the figures in the plan could be larger than Marshall's previous estimate of $300 million, but declined to disclose the specific figures, calling it a secret. It is generally believed that even if it exceeds $300 million, the amount will not be too much.

Editorial

### Commercial Implementation Measures of the Economic Program

The implementation measures of the economic reform have been drafted by various ministries and commissions and revised and approved by the National Economic Commission. The full text is well-organized, but lacks focus, resembling a detailed account. At a time when everything is being taken care of, and all wastes are being taken care of, at least during the period when athletes are suppressing chaos and the military comes first, what is the actual possibility seems to be a very big problem.

Secondly, although this implementation method is said to be implemented, in fact, there are still too many ideal and abstract views, and there are still few concrete plans on how to implement it. Therefore, the true implementation method is that a separate proposal must be drawn up on the ground. Thirdly, there are many conflicts between the proposed method and the current actual situation: Whether there is enough space to implement it is still a question. Now, please briefly interpret the draft implementation plan for the commercial part to get a glimpse of the whole picture.

Currently, there are many restrictions on the transportation and sales of many goods, including restrictions on regions and types. In addition, there are restrictions on internal bandits, limited quotas for distribution, and procedures for permits, not to mention various practical difficulties in the monetary system and transportation. Judging from the pain recently expressed by the petition representatives from the north in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, it can be seen that the exchange of domestic goods, in addition to unconditionally facilitating and promoting it, should not be subject to any restrictions. The draft stipulates that "the exchange of materials between economic zones in the country should...formulate a general plan and implement it." We don't know how this general plan for exchange should be formulated? What is its content? What is its purpose? How should the economic zone be interpreted? After adding various "plans", will the exchange of materials actually become the blockage and separation of materials? This can only be left to future facts to prove.

The draft repeatedly mentions loans, such as "For export materials, especially products, a regular linked loan system should be established from production and manufacturing, inland transportation, and entrepot sales." It also says, "The conditions for packing loans, export exchange, and insurance for export materials should be appropriately relaxed by the handling bank or company." These are of course the nectar that export industrialists and merchants are seeking, but unfortunately the drafters do not seem to have noticed the government's current policy of tightening credit and tightening money. Otherwise, how can this series of regular linked loan systems be established?

There are also several items that sound very good, such as: (1) Government agencies and organizations should limit the use of domestic goods for public items; (2) Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit their circulation in the market within a time limit; (3) Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit supporting their development within a time limit, etc. However, the collection of local specialty donations and the prohibition of the export of certain goods, this supreme power is already held by the smallest unit such as the county government, let alone higher-level governments? Isn't it obvious that the central and provincial governments have repeatedly issued orders and five-equal regulations for the free circulation of rice and grain, and as long as the procedures are complete, local governments can clearly tax local specialties?

As for public items, limiting the use of domestic goods, whether this is feasible or not, just a casual visit to any agency or organization will give a clear conclusion. We don't believe that relying on this empty implementation plan can reverse the bad trend of worshiping foreign goods!

According to current laws, luxury goods are originally prohibited from being imported. However, luxury goods are piled up everywhere and flood the market, which is a fact that everyone can see. Although the authorities have declared strict crackdowns on smuggling, and the relevant industries (such as the silk stocking industry, etc.) have shouted loudly, demanding a ban, and although we deeply sympathize with it, it is difficult to say and even more difficult to do. The authorities in various places seem to be at a loss for these smuggled goods, whether they are about to be imported or have already been imported, and can only stand by and watch, ignoring them. Isn't it true that shark fins and sea cucumbers can still be seen and eaten everywhere in big cities and small cities? Even if they are not eaten in bars, they are regarded as treasures in official residences! Aren't other various luxury goods displayed in the counters of various stores in a grand manner?

Substitutes for offsetting imports should be supported as much as possible, which is also a common sentiment. The focus of the problem is whether the import quota of raw materials for manufacturing such substitutes can be relaxed? Can the required power be exempted from restrictions? Can the excessive burden it bears be appropriately reduced? The relevant industries have been running around and appealing for these issues, which have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers, but have government officials been moved by it? For example, two or three paper mills have already ordered new paper-making machines, each of which can produce thirty to fifty tons of paper per day, and have also ordered machines that can make wood pulp, but the application for foreign exchange to purchase the machines has been pending for half a month without any progress. We sincerely hope that due to the implementation of this implementation plan, this problem can be properly resolved.

The draft also advocates that, when necessary, the government should purchase export goods to compete for the international market and designate several important items to promote the joint operation of imports and exports. This is also what everyone is eagerly hoping for. At a time when foreign exchange is exhausted and materials are scarce, there is really no reason to shelve the so-called joint import and export method. At a time when exports are stagnant and cannot be promoted, there is really no reason for the government's export goods purchase policy to continue to watch and not seriously and effectively promote it. Looking at the implementation plan for the commercial part, it is permissible to say that these two plans are the most important. However, the proposed barter plan originally only advocated that it be tried out by the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office to correspond with international cooperative organizations. We believe that it is simpler and easier to expand purchases and implement the import and export chain method.

In terms of developing domestic trade, the draft advocates urging enterprises to re-evaluate fixed assets to absorb new funds, which seems to take this problem too lightly. Why can't existing enterprises expand, and why can't emerging enterprises develop? From a superficial point of view, it should be attributed to the unreasonable factors of currency, interest rates, transportation, and labor. From a long-term perspective, it must be extended to the need for clarification in military, political, and social aspects. Although it is said that dealing with things on a case-by-case basis has its own scope, and should not be uniformly involved in commercial issues, it can be asserted that encouraging investment and rewarding enterprises should not start solely from re-evaluating fixed assets.

In short, generally speaking, the content of the implementation plan for the commercial part is inevitably poor and lacks far-sighted construction. The various suggestions it makes are mostly stale and follow the old ways, and are either still practically unworkable or are trivial and do not contribute to the overall situation. It does not touch on any of the various obstacles currently encountered in commerce, except for empty words that there should be no restrictions on the export of goods and no special donations and taxes should be levied. It seems that the government has not yet fully understood the pain felt by industrialists and merchants, which is particularly disappointing. It seems that this article is called an implementation plan, but its result is nothing more than adding a kind of information for reference to the economic literature!

Ministry of Justice Ensures People's Personal Freedom [This Newspaper Nanjing 23rd Dispatch]
In the past, it was often heard that constitutional police organs arrested and detained criminals beyond the legal time limit. According to the Ministry of Justice, now that the implementation of the constitution has begun, the protection of people's personal freedom should be handled in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 8 of the Constitution. Moreover, the Habeas Corpus Act has been implemented since March of the 35th year of the Republic. According to the provisions of this law, if the court considers the reasons sufficient after receiving the application for habeas corpus, it can apply to the arresting agency for habeas corpus. Since its implementation, the courts have been able to handle it seriously. Now the ministry is giving instructions and supervision at any time to achieve the effectiveness of the full implementation of the habeas corpus system. As for the recent rumor that the Shaanxi High Court has sent prosecutors to police stations to work, this is not related to the implementation of the habeas corpus system. According to the measures for liaison between prosecutors and judicial police organs in the execution of their duties, in order to strengthen the liaison between the police and prosecutors and to facilitate command and control, it is acceptable for the court to send prosecutors to police stations to work, and this liaison measure has now been widely implemented and is universally applicable to all courts.

Western European Alliance Has Begun to Prevent Soviet Control of the European Continent
Bevin Announces British Foreign Policy [United Press London 22nd Dispatch]
Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that British foreign policy advocates that Western European countries unite to deal with the Soviet Union to prevent it from controlling the European continent by cruel means, and the time is ripe to launch this plan.

[Reuters London 22nd Dispatch]
Negotiations to establish a Western European alliance have begun, and the first participating groups will be Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The overseas territories of the participating countries will also become organizational members of the alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin announced the start of the above negotiations when he delivered a long speech reviewing British foreign policy in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 22nd. He said, "We will launch this negotiation with our French allies and Western European countries. I hope to sign treaties with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, so that the treaty we signed with France will become an important core of Western Europe. We will unite other European countries with historical ties, including the new Italy, to participate in this great alliance." Bevin also warned the Soviet Union that playing with fire in international affairs is a dangerous move. But at the same time, he stated, "What the British government is doing now is not aimed at the Soviet Union or any other country, but we have the right to organize the Western kindred spirits, just as they organize the Eastern kindred spirits." He also said, "I believe that the time is ripe to consolidate the land opportunities in Western Europe. We are now formally proposing to France to form a political alliance. We will maintain the closest ties and strive for a closer union between the two countries. The time has now come for us to find ways to develop relations with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Our representatives in Brussels, The Hague, and Luxembourg have been ordered yesterday to consult with French representatives to launch this negotiation. It is no less important for Italy to participate in the Western European alliance than other Western European countries. Western European representatives are cooperating quickly and effectively, which is a good phenomenon. We must do our best to promote the spirit of cooperation. Here, I must point out that this alliance cannot be limited to Europe for geographical reasons. The power of Europe has extended to the whole world, so our eyes must look beyond Western Europe. The first thing that comes into view is Africa, where the great responsibilities are shared by South Africa, France, Belgium, Portugal, and our country. The Soviet Union Actively Seeks Control in Eastern and Western Countries, and Such Attempts Will Continue to Emerge. We must also pay attention to other overseas territories, especially Southeast Asia, where the Netherlands occupies an important position. These European organizations must be supported economically. Therefore, the British Commonwealth and its territories, as well as the overseas territories of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal, should maintain the closest possible cooperation. These lands contain huge resources that can be fully developed, and their raw materials, food, and other resources can provide great benefits to the people of Europe and the world. This plan does not conflict with the United States and the Soviet Union, which also have huge resources. To balance Europe's payments, its resources must be developed and used, and exchanged with each other in a suitable manner. Now, the socio-economic development in the overseas territories responsible by Britain is being actively promoted. Other Western European countries with overseas territories will join Britain in the same task to unite the strength and opportunities of hundreds of millions of people to develop resources from Europe through the Middle East, Africa, and all the way to the Far East, making the world richer and safer. We believe that our friends in the Commonwealth will be willing to cooperate with us." Bevin then mentioned relations with the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet side has revealed its policy of doing its best to enable the Communist Party to gain control in Eastern and Western Europe. I believe that the Communist Party's plan is being actively promoted in every country. We have discovered these tricks in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and recently in Romania. According to the information we have obtained, similar attempts will appear in other places soon. The problem is not in the organization of Finland or other countries, but in the Soviet Union's control of Eastern Europe. The Soviet border has in fact extended to Stettin, Trieste, and the Elbe River, but it is still not satisfied. In Greece, they believe that Britain and the United States will eventually feel tired, and then they can safely recognize the government of the Communist rebels, so that the Greek people will be forced to accept the Communist government, and finally incorporate Greece into the Communist system. The problem in Greece is not about which form of government to elect, but about incorporating Greece into the Soviet sphere of influence at all costs. This is a dangerous situation and a typical great power policy. Special Warning on the Greek Issue The United Nations agency has been mocked by Greece's northern neighbors. I must solemnly warn here that such provocative actions may lead to serious developments. These events should be resolved based on the resolutions of the UN General Assembly, and not by promoting civil war or recognizing the Marcos regime. Since we have accepted other resolutions of the UN General Assembly, we must of course also accept the resolutions on Greece. It should be known that playing with fire in international affairs is an extremely dangerous thing. Conducting psychological warfare against small countries will make it more difficult to reach an agreement. Propaganda is by no means a way to solve international problems. Other key points mentioned by Bevin are as follows: Iraq: I and the Prime Minister of Iraq will never sign any document that disregards the will of the Iraqi nation. I would like to assure my Iraqi friends that we will face common problems, whether they are related to defense or socio-economic development. I sincerely hope that this carefully drafted treaty will serve as a model for the development of defense arrangements in the Middle East. Foreign Treaty: I will discuss the new situation with the Prime Minister of the Foreign Treaty. Foreign Prime Minister Ferzal will come here at the beginning of next month. Egypt: I sincerely hope that the past atmosphere of disagreement with Egypt can be eliminated, but it will still take some time. Bevin also said: These steps in the Middle East and Western Europe are in line with the principles of the United Nations. When the disputes of the Four Powers are resolved and the will of peace is established, the above-mentioned steps can be adapted to the principles of the United Nations.

Churchill Agrees with Bevin's Anti-Soviet Proposition [This Newspaper Report]
London, 23rd Broadcast: Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, supporting the foreign policy announced by Bevin yesterday, urging Western democratic countries to do everything possible to avoid war, and advocating that practical negotiations be conducted with the Soviet Union before it has atomic bombs in order to reach a realistic solution. He believes that the Soviet Union may have atomic weapons within one or two years. Churchill pointed out that the Soviet Iron Curtain is gradually expanding, and the danger is increasing day by day. The Division of Germany is Actually Caused by the Soviet Union Regarding Germany, he said that the British government has always believed that the division of Germany will create a country that lacks the will for peace and has a sense of revenge. The Potsdam Conference has agreed to establish a central agency to establish a new Germany based on a new foundation, but the Soviet government has not attempted to find a common policy and opposes the Western allies' abuse of accusations. He finally said: The idea of European unity is beyond reproach. The question is whether European unity can be achieved without one power ruling Europe. If one power attempts to rule Europe directly or indirectly, the result will be another war. I hope we can all abandon this idea. Britain's policy is to allow small countries to have the opportunity to develop without fear of conflict under the protection of the four powers, but we cannot agree in a period when one of the four powers forces small countries to accept political and economic systems.

The Policy of Four-Power Cooperation Must Be Carried Out Step by Step
When we organize the Western European alliance, the policy of four-power cooperation must be carried out step by step, based on the principle of equality and including the element of freedom. The continued existence of the division of Europe is caused by the will of the Soviet Union. This division is actually contrary to the statements of the Soviet Supreme Authorities and Marshal Stalin.

Soviet Union Signs Trade Agreement with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg [United Press Moscow 22nd Dispatch]
According to news from Belgium, the Soviet Union has signed a trade agreement with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, stipulating the exchange of goods. The agreement is said to be the largest purchase by the Soviet Union from countries outside Eastern Europe since the war. It was concluded after about eight weeks of negotiations in Moscow between Soviet trade officials and representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Will Abandon Neutrality [Reuters Brussels 22nd Dispatch]
Bevin pointed out frankly that the seriousness of the international situation and his proposal to expand the Anglo-French alliance may cause the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to completely overturn the neutral foreign policy jointly adopted by the three countries. Political figures pointed out that the environment that prompted Britain and France to propose expanding the alliance has made it impossible for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to continue to maintain their neutral policy. Until the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers Conference, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg still opposed Western European blocism and supported the regional agreements stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

[Reuters The Hague 22nd Dispatch]
Dutch newspapers commented on Bevin's speech, emphasizing Britain's important position in European politics. The New Mail of Freedom stated that European politics cannot exist without Britain. Europe is under the political fire line of the world. No European country can defend itself alone. The negotiations currently underway are the first step towards European unity. The Catholic newspaper said that the Soviet Union has established a large-scale political and economic alliance in Eastern Europe. The time has now come for Britain to make a decision.

Iraqi Prime Minister Urges Government to Approve New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty [United Press London 22nd Dispatch]
The Iraqi manager held a meeting with Baghdad officials on a long-distance telephone on the 22nd to try to reverse the refusal of the Iraqi Regent to extend the recent Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Iraqi Prime Minister told the British Foreign Office that he could guarantee that the Iraqi Regent's veto of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was due to a "misunderstanding." He expressed confidence that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty could be approved once he returned to the country. It is generally believed that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty is an important offensive in British diplomacy to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the Middle East. The Iraqi Prime Minister also said that during his absence from the country, some saboteurs used innocent students to create an atmosphere of unrest.

French International Bank to Approve Franc Devaluation [United Press Paris 23rd Dispatch]
According to news from the French Ministry of Finance, despite Britain's opposition, the International Bank is expected to approve the devaluation of the French franc on the 23rd. The French cabinet held an emergency meeting today. According to reliable sources, the cabinet's deliberation is roughly the same as what Finance Minister Meill said yesterday, that is, a financial decision must be made before the weekend. Britain's reason for opposing is that France's formation of a free currency market will have an adverse impact on the gold pound.

Washington is Very Satisfied with Bevin's Proposal to Form the Core of Western Europe [This Newspaper Report]
New York, 23rd Broadcast: Washington News, the U.S. government has officially expressed its heartfelt welcome to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement yesterday that Western Europe should form a military alliance to deal with the expansion of the Soviet Union.

[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch]
People here have welcomed Bevin's suggestion to diplomatically unite Western Europe to resist the Soviet Union's tendency to dominate. It is considered a powerful supplement to the Marshall Plan. It is also believed that Bevin's speech indicates a new shift in British foreign policy and is entering the same line as the Truman Doctrine. Moreover, Bevin's words are more straightforward and powerful than the remarks of American politicians when the Truman Doctrine was first announced. Republican foreign policy adviser Dulles said that Bevin's proposal is extremely important and can encourage Congress to take action on the Marshall Plan. Vandenberg called it a surprising remark, and specifically pointed out that Bevin's proposal to establish a connection between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is "the most hopeful voice he has heard from Europe." Hurd, a specialist in foreign relief in the House of Representatives, also expressed his belief that the U.S. aid plan will benefit from the willingness of European countries to cooperate. People here also believe that Bevin's call to establish a core of Western Europe is timely. Recently, U.S. diplomatic authorities Dulles and Baruch have also made similar suggestions, and Baruch's suggestion is even more advanced than Bevin's call, advocating the establishment of a European political, economic, and defense alliance, guaranteed by the United States.

New York Herald Tribune reporter Lippmann opposed the establishment of a Western European Convention, believing that it would promote the division of Western Europe. He pointed out that some countries, such as Norway, Denmark, France, Italy, etc., cannot yet be responsible for defending the other countries of the sixteen European countries, so it is expected that most Western European countries will refuse to participate in the Western European Convention.

[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]
People here believe that Bevin's statement, which was issued twenty-four hours after the State Department released the secret archives on German-Soviet relations, is a joint diplomatic action by Britain and the United States. It is understood that Bevin exchanged views with the U.S. government before his speech. Diplomatic and press circles believe that Bevin's intention is to warn the Soviet Union that Western countries will not allow any power to control Europe until there is a unified effort to maintain the balance.

[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]
The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the afternoon of the 22nd, expressing its full approval of Bevin's announcement in the House of Commons that Britain and France have begun to take action to establish a tacit political alliance.

United States Begins Broadcasting German-Soviet Diplomatic Secrets [Central News Agency New York 23rd Dispatch]
The "Voice of America" radio station here has begun today to use various languages to broadcast brief broadcasts of secret documents under the cooperation between Hitler and Stalin to various parts of the world, thereby launching a counter-offensive propaganda against the Soviet Union. The documents issued by the State Department, together with Britain's plan for a Western European alliance and the British Foreign Minister's accusation of Soviet foreign policy, are the big-character headlines of today's newspapers. Gromyko declined to comment on the publication of the records of Moscow and Berlin's consultations at Success Lake.

[United Press Columbus, Georgia 22nd Dispatch]
Secretary of State Marshall told reporters here today that the State Department originally intended to publish various secret agreements signed by the Soviet Union and the Nazis before the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, but postponed their publication because "we intend to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union."

France is Willing to Reconcile with Viet Minh so that Viet Minh Can Gain Independence Within the French Union Will Sign a Formal Agreement with Bao Dai
[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]
The return of French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pilaar, will bring France's efforts to rebuild peace in Vietnam to a new stage. Although the meeting between Bo and Bao Dai did not achieve the expected quick results, it has laid a new foundation for a mutually satisfactory solution. The anti-war psychology of the people of Tokyo, Annam, and Cochinchina has been increasing, and Ho Chi Minh's hope is not as good as before. The military situation in North Vietnam has turned favorable to the French side, but in Cochinchina, the rice-producing area in the south, the activities of guerrillas have been increasing. The French side is now prepared to allow the Viet Minh to obtain full independence within the French Union. Regarding allowing Cochinchina to form a Viet Minh Republic with Tokyo Annam, the French government may be prepared to satisfy the Kuomintang. However, the French side will insist that the agreement signed by the Vietnamese side must be permanent. The French side feels that Ho Chi Minh only regards the agreement as a temporary tool, which will be used as a springboard for further demands. Therefore, if France can sign a formal agreement with Bao Dai, there will be no such concerns.

[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch]
Officials generally agree with France's plan to have Bao Dai return to Vietnam to rule the autonomous territories of Annam Tokyo and Cochinchina.

Western European Freedom is Threatened, the United States Should Not Protect Itself
Marshall Talks About the European Recovery Program [Reuters Atlanta 22nd Dispatch]
Secretary of State Marshall said in a speech to the National Cotton Council here today that in order for the European Recovery Program to achieve its final success, the sixteen European countries must continue the efforts that began at the Paris Conference last summer to achieve European unity. The Marshall Plan is a cooperative plan to save Western civilization. With the cooperation of 415 million people in Europe and the United States, it is believed that Western civilization will continue to exist and develop. The results of these joint efforts will not only determine the immediate course of European events, but will also affect the future of Americans in the east, south, west, and north. The goals of the Marshall Plan are broad and the effects are far-reaching, so no American can take it lightly. If its goals are not achieved, the effects of its failure will affect every part. The agreements signed by the United States with each recipient country will be aimed at combating inflation, restoring confidence in the national currency, and facilitating the free movement of materials, currency, and labor across borders. These conditions will not hinder European rights and will ensure that resources are used to the best common benefit. If European countries waste the aid that the U.S. economy can provide, they themselves will be the main victims. Today, there are powerful forces that are forcing Western Europe to adopt political systems that abandon their freedom. We cannot assume that we can only maintain their security by protecting the principles of individual freedom and representative government. Although our country is strong, we cannot maintain isolation and strength at the same time. We need friends, especially friends who share our views on social organization. The maintainers of free ownership must cooperate closely, because maintaining liberalism requires not only individual efforts, but also collective efforts.

Hoover's Suggestions on the European Aid Plan [U.S. News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch]
Former President Hoover sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today, suggesting that the U.S. commitment to the European Recovery Program should be limited to the first fifteen months, and that all donations should be limited to surplus consumables. The Republican politician said that the need for major materials and equipment in Europe may be subsidized in part by loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the World Bank. Hoover estimates that the United States may export US$3 billion in consumables to the European Recovery Program in the first fifteen months, as well as exports from the occupation of I in Korea, Germany, and Japan. It is said that Hoover's colleagues indicated that Hoover expects the loan to increase by about US$1 billion, totaling US$4 billion. He feels that this amount should be provided in the first year.

Indonesia and the Netherlands Have Conflicting Interpretations of Political Principles, and the Mediation Committee Needs to Resolve Them Again
[Reuters Batavia 22nd Dispatch]
Well-informed sources said that the six political principles accepted by Indonesia and the Netherlands need to be resolved by the Security Council's Mediation Committee in Jakarta due to different interpretations by both sides. A statement issued in The Hague yesterday pointed out that the Republic of Indonesia only accepted the six principles based on its one-sided interpretation, and that the Dutch government had requested the Mediation Committee to clarify this matter. Before clarification, some group meetings originally scheduled to be held tomorrow have been announced to be postponed. The first of the six principles stipulates that the Netherlands will maintain its sovereignty in Indonesia before Indonesia's sovereignty is transferred to the United States of Indonesia. However, a spokesman for the Republic of Indonesia stated yesterday that according to the records of the meeting between the Republic of Indonesia and the Mediation Committee in Yogyakarta, the status quo will continue to be maintained until both parties agree otherwise. The Republic also stated that they will continue to direct their national defense, finance, and foreign relations.

The Marshall Plan Can Extinguish Future Wars, the Opinion of the Director of Wartime Intelligence
[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch]
General Donovan, who served as the Director of Intelligence during the war, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union is now employing trained spies to wage war against the United States. The Marshall Plan will be used to extinguish the Soviet Union's undeclared war. The danger to the United States is to allow the Soviet Union or other countries to seize bases occupied by U.S. allies, cross U.S. transportation lines, and penetrate the inner defense line with disintegration tactics. By the time the need to go to war is discovered, it will be too late to do anything. If the United States can seize the initiative, it can avoid an actual shooting war. This is the importance of the Marshall Plan, but at the same time, it must not be regarded as an economic Maginot Line. The Marshall Plan must be supplemented by other weapons, and its measures must not be destroyed by the Communist Party or propaganda weapons.

Patterson Opposes Cutting Aid to Europe [U.S. News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch]
Another group of important private citizens attended the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to express their views on U.S. assistance proposed for the European Recovery Program. The vast majority of their arguments supported the enactment of legislation authorizing the allocation of US$6.8 billion for the first fifteen months of the program, as proposed by President Truman. These private citizens included former Secretary of War Patterson, "Atlantic Charter Magazine" editor McGill, and former wartime Director of the Strategic Services Bureau Donovan. At the same time, the House Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear the opinions of important government spokespersons. Patterson strongly advocated that it would be foolish to cut the proposed amount of U.S. aid. He said, "Those who advocate cutting four or five billion dollars clearly fail to recognize the goal. The reduced plan can prevent a large number of people from starving collectively, but it is not enough to make the recovery a reality."

United Nations Begins to Study the Establishment of International Forces in the Holy Land
[United Press Success Lake 22nd Dispatch]
The United Nations Palestine Committee is convinced that it is necessary to establish international troops in the Holy Land, and on the 22nd ordered a thorough study of all proposals related to the establishment of this force. The United Nations Secretariat will provide the council with historical data on the 23rd. According to general indications, the council will eventually submit a special report requesting military assistance. The Palestine Committee, which is responsible for monitoring the division of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, has begun drafting its first monthly report, which will be submitted to the Security Council. The report will describe Britain's opposition to the recommendations of the UN General Assembly and its refusal to open Palestinian ports to allow unlimited immigration of Jews.

[United Press Beirut 23rd Dispatch]
According to eyewitnesses, thousands of Arab troops have infiltrated Palestine from Syria and Lebanon. According to unreliable sources, the Arab troops in Palestine attacked the Jews first. When the British troops went to the rescue, the Arab troops outside the border sneaked into Palestine from the border farther away from the war. They are all well-equipped elite troops. The Standing Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission said that the Soviet Union's atomic control proposal, which is now being studied in detail by the Finance Committee, has no prejudice and requested that representatives from other countries also adopt the same attitude. Today, when the committee continued to discuss the Soviet proposal, Wei participated in the actions of several other representatives and raised several special questions to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko regarding his proposal to control the atom.

U.S. Army Asks for $500 Million for Relief to Japan Halsey Calls Japan a Bulwark Against Aggression
[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch]
The military has requested approximately $500 million in aftercare relief to Japan in the next fiscal year. The procedure has been submitted to the Far East Committee. Among them, the funds proposed by General MacArthur's headquarters for food, clothing, and other educational materials for Japan account for approximately $300 million, and the funds for Japan's industrial reconstruction account for approximately $200 million.

[United Press Philadelphia 23rd Dispatch]
Admiral Halsey, commander of the U.S. Third Fleet during the war, said today in a speech to the alumni association of the Philadelphia Textile College that if the United States wants to revive the economies of Europe and Japan and help guard the world in the future, it must pay a very high price for several years, but this is ultimately better than the Third World War. Not only does Europe need to be revived, but so does Japan. Japan can become a strong fortress between the United States and its future aggressors

Hu Shi Encountered a Strange Person on His Way Home at Night
Claiming to Be Like a Young Lady Looking for a Husband for Security
[Dahua News Agency, Beiping Air Mail] Peking University President Hu Shi, on his way home at 9 o'clock the night before, had just reached his front door when a mentally disordered strange person suddenly chased in. After interrogation, it was found that he was an auditor at Peking University, named Hu Jingming, 27 years old, from Henan, residing at No. 26 Guohui Street. He was carrying a letter, requesting security, and his speech was incoherent. He then collapsed to the ground. This student had applied to be a formal student at Peking University last year, but was not admitted, and later became an auditor at Peking University. Because auditors do not receive diplomas upon graduation, he was depressed all day long, and his mental state gradually deteriorated. At the time, Mr. Hu, fearing an incident, immediately summoned police officers from the First Sub-Bureau to take the student to the police station for questioning. It is reported that this student had repeatedly requested to be changed to a formal student, but had not been approved. The original letter from this student to President Hu is excerpted as follows: "President Hu: I am like an eighteen-year-old young lady, wanting to find a sensible husband to protect me and satisfy my desires. I feel too lonely and insecure, so I am writing this letter to you to ask for security and satisfaction. If you don't like it, please kill me with a kitchen knife, so as not to cause further trouble. Sincerely, your faithful believer, Hu Jingming."
New British Invention: Sound Recording on Paper
[British Information Service, London, 23rd Dispatch] The earliest method of recording human speech was Edison's recording cylinder, which is still used in shorthand dictaphones. Subsequent sound recordings on gramophone records and sound films were significant advancements each time. The latest development is the ability to record sound on thin paper. The London Electrical and Musical Industries Company has now manufactured such a machine, the size of a portable typewriter, equipped with a playback device. After recording, the sound is played back, clear and loud. In public gatherings, the "recording paper" becomes the speaker. The recording process is extremely simple. After completion, the paper can be removed and mailed to any region.
Encourage Middle School Students to Participate in International Communication
[Our Newspaper] In order to promote international communication among students in our country, the Municipal Bureau of Education established the Chinese Student International Communication Committee in June last year, chaired by Zhao Chuanjia, principal of Municipal Xishi Middle School. Twenty-eight public and private middle schools participated, with 119 students.

This year's plan is for responsible persons of member schools to effectively supervise students in engaging in communication, in order to achieve comprehensive promotion. Foreign students will also be asked to introduce good books and newspapers suitable for the middle school level, in order to purchase and exchange them for reading. The implementation methods are: Encourage public and private middle school students in this city to participate as much as possible. Request student names from foreign communication schools and distribute them to member schools. Compile and print a directory of Chinese schools in English and distribute it to foreign schools. The above work is expected to be completed within one year.

As for the departure date and funds for the petition, the students are keeping it secret from each other. They told reporters that although they urgently want alumni to come forward to mediate, they cannot wait for Minister Zhu Jiahua to return to Shanghai, or he may have already gone to Nanjing.
Joint Relief Educational Equipment Jiaotong University Receives the Most Engineering College Also Obtains Twenty Japanese Machines
[Our Newspaper] The educational equipment from the Joint Relief Agency to major colleges and universities across the country has been distributed by the Ministry of Education, with Jiaotong University receiving the most. However, in addition to a small number of components that have already been distributed, the matter has been delayed for a long time due to opinions from the Joint Relief Agency.

Hong Kong Special Silver Shield Competition All Chinese Teams Dominate Western Teams Eliminated Chinese Teams Compete for Championship
[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Air Mail] Fifteen teams from Group A participated in this year's Special Shield Elimination Battle. After the first round of elimination, the semi-quarterfinals were held on the 17th (Saturday) and 18th (Sunday), with eight teams competing for the semi-quarterfinal qualification. As a result, on Saturday: the Bus team eliminated the South China Association, 2-1; the Eastern Association forced out the Hong Kong Association, 3-2; and Kitchee beat the Artillery, 2-0. On Sunday, in the single game, the Star Island defeated the Police, 5-1. This means that the Special Silver Shield is now entirely dominated by Chinese teams.
Bus Veterans Fight Hard to Eliminate South China
Of the three games on Saturday, the most intense was the South China vs. Bus game at the Police stadium. Although Bus had many veterans, South China had vitality, and a fierce battle was inevitable. In a fierce battle, South China was brutally eliminated 1-2 despite having the advantage. In the first half, although South China was at a disadvantage against the wind, it was still able to remain unbeaten. In the second half, it was even able to score first, but it lost due to being unable to sustain its strength in the later stages. South China lost unfairly.
Of course, Bus was able to avoid conceding too many goals under South China's prolonged attacks, of course, there was a reason, and that was Tan Jiangbai's outstanding performance. "Copper Head" guarded the center back, no less majestic than in his prime, forcing South China to have many opportunities to attack, but few opportunities to shoot. As for the two goals conceded by South China, left back Lin Rushun cannot shirk his responsibility, as both goals were leaked in from Rushun's side.
The outcome of the game was determined entirely in the second half. Chen Dehui of South China sent the ball in from afar during a mixed attack, opening the scoring first. Later, Bus's right winger Zhong Jingsheng tricked Lin Rushun and scored, 1-1. Finally, Rushun intercepted Jingsheng again, but Jingsheng broke through again, and Xuan Jie greeted the ball and charged in alone, 2-1, Bus eliminated South China.

Coming from Behind, Eastern Defeats Hong Kong Association
At Happy Valley, the Eastern vs. Hong Kong Association game was also a good show, because both teams adopted a hard-hitting style, making the game particularly interesting to watch. In the first half, Eastern conceded a goal first. Li Deqi saw that the forwards were timid and hesitated to advance, so in the second half, he volunteered to take command, and Qian Chifen retreated. With this adjustment, the momentum was indeed different. Deqi first forced a penalty kick, tying the score 1-1. Not long after, Liang Rongguang took advantage of Luo Weiquan's free kick and headed the ball into the net, 2-1, Eastern came back to win. But five minutes later, the Hong Kong Association also scored through Lie Wen, 2-2. In this situation, Eastern saw that it was either win or lose, so it launched an all-out attack. Ye Baotao snatched the final victory in the chaos, winning the quarterfinal qualification 3-2.

Kitchee Declines, Cleanly Wins 2 Goals Against the Artillery
Kitchee's encounter with the Artillery was originally a sure win, but Kitchee has had many troubles recently, which has affected the team's morale. It seems difficult to find a future. Seeing that it was tied by the Artillery in the first half, it can be seen from their psychology. In the second half, Bingzhao and Huanzhang scored, winning 2-0 against the Artillery.

Reviving its Prestige, Star Island Smashes the Police
On Sunday, there was only one game. Star Island fought the Police at Yuanyuan Qiu. Since reorganizing its lineup, Star Island has regained its past prestige. Based on Star Island's current strength, it is not easy to find an opponent in the football circle. At the start of the war, Star Island's formation was:
[Star Island Association] Yu Yaode, Xu Jingcheng, Hou Rongsheng, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, He Yingfen, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Xie Jinhe
However, the Police did not shy away from the game due to their inferior strength. In the first half, they tied Star Island tightly. After 22 minutes, Jingxiang猛射 hit someone and bounced into the net to win first, but in less than five minutes, the Police equalized, and the first half ended 1-1.
In the second half, Jingxiang changed to lead the central army, and Yongqiang took over as the right assistant, and the situation was very different. Star Island controlled the overall situation. In this section, it was simply watching Star Island perform. First, Jingxiang's wonderful pass Yingfen挑入了, 2-1, Zhaorong　entered a penalty kick, 3-1. Star Island's offensive did not stop slightly. Before the end of the game, Yingfen迎掃 Jingxiang's header, scoring in one fell swoop, 4-1. Song Ji, Songsheng遠射 scored, adding another goal, and the Police were defeated 5-1.

Tonight Basketball League Qingbai vs. Topeka, Donghua vs. Peel
Starting at 5:30 PM today, there will be three more basketball league games for Group A and the women's group at the gymnasium. The main battle is Qingbai vs. the US Navy's Topeka. In another game, Donghua will play Tal, and in the women's group, Qianghua will play the Li team. Tickets are 20,000 for the upper floor, 40,000 for the lower floor, and 70,000 for the numbered seats in the venue, which will be opened at the same time. The order of the stadium will be maintained by the Siwei Boy Scouts who will be on site.
In the women's group, Qianghua plays against the Li team. Although Qianghua has no hope of winning the women's group, it can still win a seat in the third place. Unfortunately, last week it was poisoned by Qingqiu, and it became a tripod with the front line Qingqiu. Today, when it meets the Li team, it should be able to win. The Li team has lost every game, but its sportsmanship is good and worthy of encouragement.
In the second scene of Group A2, Donghua will play against Peel. Donghua has played a few times, and all its soldiers are famous football players with plenty of stamina and a tough style. The opponent Peel has many basketball players from various universities, and at that time, the strength will be equal, and there will be a fierce battle.
In the finale, Qingbai and Topeka from Group A1 will face off. Qingbai has been fighting on the battlefield for a long time and is an old basketball player. At the beginning of the league, due to lack of contact, it suffered many setbacks. Progress has been seen recently, and it showed its skills in the battle against Dagong before last week, but the only drawback is that it lacks stamina and it is difficult to continue in the later stages. Topeka is the leader of the expatriates. At that time, the victory or defeat of the 交綏与 Qingbai is difficult to predict. The order for tonight is as follows: Qianghua—Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM Donghua—Peel (甲二B) 6:30 PM Qingbai—Topeka (甲一組) 7:30 PM (青白)蔡演雄, 張少卿, 鄒耀雅, 徐亨, 王南珍, 唐寳堃, 周達雲, 陳祥龍, 卓國榮, 汪均炳.

Government Decides to Implement Comprehensive Food Rationing from March 1
Pilot Implementation in Five Major Cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Public Educators' Rice Ration Reduced to Three Dou Next Month
The government has decided to implement comprehensive food rationing in five major cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, starting from March 1. Flour will be rationed in Beijing and Tianjin, and rice will be rationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Fifty percent of the rationed food will be relief supplies from the United States, and fifty percent will be raised by the government itself. It is reported that this decision will ration food by household, with each person receiving one 市斗 of rice per month. The ration of flour will be equivalent to 6.25 斤 of flour per 市斗 of rice, with half rations for small households. The rationing price will be adjusted once a month, and the Executive Yuan will decide whether it will be based on market prices or lower than market prices so that it can be followed. In this city, based on a population of 5 million, 75% are large households, which should be 3.75 million, and the rest are small households, which are 1.25 million. Large households receive one 市斗 of rice per month, requiring 375,000 石 of rice. Small households receive five 升, requiring 62,500 石, totaling 437,500 石, which is equivalent to 35,000 tons. The government has prepared four months' worth of food and will first ration it for March, April, May, and June. The government will continue to prepare for continuous rationing for July, August, and September to provide assistance during the lean season. In the past, public educators received eight 斗 per month, and workers and students received two 斗 each. It is generally believed that this was not universal and was unreasonable. After the implementation of comprehensive rationing, it will be abolished to show fairness. However, although public educators will receive new salaries based on the cost of living index, the government has decided to seek a solution to subsidize the purchase of rationed rice within limits. At the State Council meeting on the 23rd, it was decided that the amount of rice rationed to public educators will be reduced to three 斗 per person per month (originally eight 斗) starting from February of this year. The detailed measures will be formulated by the Executive Yuan. According to the person in charge of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, difficulties in this rationing are expected: First, the district 保甲 receive meager compensation, and the manpower is weak, resulting in unclear household registration. Second, the rice shops, cooperatives, and social service centers that are responsible for rationing inevitably have cases of mixing and deducting due to insufficient expenses. Third, the rice price is adjusted once a month, and the interest rate is very high at present. Who is willing to buy first and lose money? If everyone buys at the end of the month, there will be queues and congestion. Efforts are being made to solve this problem to ensure that the district 保甲 can fulfill their responsibilities. The rice shops should also be given a considerable discount to make up for their expenses. In short, the difficulties that may arise in the future will be minimized as much as possible.

As credit conditions eased, it became weaker again. The off-market interest rate opened low at 2 角8.5 分 and 3 角3, rising to 715 yuan and 747 yuan. After a slight fall, the buying sentiment was strong. Zhongfa Underwear, Zhongsi, Yonggong, Xinhua, Quanhsing, Tongyi Enamel, Jingfu, and Xinyi were successively halted. Yongsheng Yarn even rose to a high price of 728 yuan and 765 yuan. Many people took the opportunity to sell, and it fell by 10 yuan near noon, closing at 722 yuan and 759 yuan.

Government Agrees to Consider Partially Opening Industrial Loans
With the Lunar New Year approaching, factories in various places have successively requested the government to partially open industrial loans for assistance. Wu Yun'chu, chairman of the National Industrial Association, took the relevant information to Nanjing on the 11th to report the actual difficulties of the current industrial sector and provide opinions to President Zhang and the responsible leaders of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At that time, President Zhang attached great importance to the various sections reported by Wu and expressed that its principles could be accepted. He also believed that the government should not sit idly by if production businesses really need assistance. President Zhang also allowed the information brought by Wu to be submitted to the Four Joint Offices to quickly formulate measures, and after the research, they will be submitted to the Chairman for approval. It is now known that Wu returned to Shanghai on the 23rd. It is said that the opening date is hoped to be as early as possible, but the key lies in the timing of the measures formulated by the Four Joint Offices. In terms of the amount, the government should have comprehensive planning. Thinking from the perspective of the industrial sector, loans are a last resort. How much is borrowed must take into account how much will be repaid in the future. Although the government has not clearly stipulated the method, it is said that it intends to adopt order loans. However, this method is not fully suitable for the industrial sector'

### Wuxi Suzhou: Rice Prices Rise Again

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 23rd] Due to continuous rain in Wuxi, the supply of grain to the city has been scarce. Influenced by the soaring prices of flour and wheat, public sentiment has been stimulated, leading to large-scale purchases by Shanghai merchants. Holders of goods are unwilling to sell at lower prices, pushing the market upwards, exceeding the limited price. Top-quality white rice is now selling for 1.3 million (currency unit). The market opened at 1,287,000, closed at 1,297,000. Baiyangjian reached 1,307,000, Bujian 1,270,000, Baiyuan 1,407,000, a sharp increase of 60-70,000.

Sample parcels in the market are scarce, and trading is quiet. Prices have risen universally by 20,000. Top grade white rice is trading at 1.27 million per dan (unit of weight), coarse early season rice at 1.11 million. It is rumored that the reason for the renewed price surge is due to the easing of credit conditions.

### Yuehan Railway Passenger Train: Robbed by Bandits

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] The Yuehan Railway passenger train was robbed by bandits on the morning of the 23rd. The incident occurred when the driver was heading towards Nantou, Zhuchao city, at 0:40. He suddenly saw a red light ahead, so he slowed down to investigate.

The remaining bandits, about 50-60 in number, swarmed onto the passenger cars to rob the passengers. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, the driver jumped back onto the locomotive, started it, and sped away.

### UNRRA Far East Regional Committee: Scheduled to Hold Informal Meeting, Termination Issue Expected to be Resolved

[Our Report] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee previously held its 37th meeting to discuss termination matters. Due to differing opinions among the committee members regarding the authority of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, the termination could not be completed as scheduled. It is now learned that the inability to reach a consensus was due to a letter from the Chinese government to the committee, stating that after the termination of UNRRA, the assets left by UNRRA, as well as the funds obtained from the sale of assets, should be transferred to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee for management. Long-term relief and rehabilitation efforts should also be managed by that committee, and be promoted after approval. The Custodian Committee is a subordinate organization of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, and its authority should not exceed that of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee. However, according to the opinions of several foreign members, the Custodian Committee is composed of representatives from China and five foreign countries, while the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee is composed solely of the Chinese government. Since UNRRA's assets and funds were jointly provided by the United Nations, they should be managed by the Custodian Committee, which should also be responsible for its rehabilitation efforts. This case was not resolved at the time. The UNRRA Resident Representative in China, Mr. Cleveland, discussed the matter directly with the Chairman of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, Mr. Wang Yunwu. It is now learned that the two sides' views are quite close and a solution is expected to be reached. The committee is scheduled to hold an informal meeting on the 27th of this month, at which time it can be prepared to announce its termination.
