### Designated Candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan: One Who Made Significant Contributions to Economic Development During the War of Resistance; The President Will Seek Approval from the Legislative Yuan Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Regarding the candidate for the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, because He Yingqin presented himself to the President in the afternoon of the 23rd and expressed his firm resolve not to assume the position, President Chiang has agreed to consider proposing another person. On the evening of the 23rd, the President hosted a dinner at his official residence for Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, He Yingqin, Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, and others, where discussions took place. It is rumored that a candidate has already been internally determined and will likely be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval by noon on the 24th. When reporters inquired of those who attended the meeting as to who would be nominated, all avoided answering directly, only stating that this person would be highly regarded in academic circles and would have made practical contributions to economic development. As for Zhang Qun's firm refusal, according to what our reporters have learned, Chen Bulei was ordered to persuade Zhang five times from May 4th to 18th. Although Zhang once agreed to consider it, he soon expressed that he could not take on the responsibility. On the afternoon of the 18th, he submitted a lengthy letter to the President, firmly declining the offer. On the 19th, Zhang met with the President at the National Government and reiterated his earnest refusal. The main reason for his consistent refusal was that at the beginning of constitutional governance, there were countless matters to be reformed, and it was necessary to refresh personnel and give people a new look to meet the expectations of the nation. On the 21st, he flew to Chongqing to visit his elderly mother. Political circles in Nanjing are saying that Zhang will return to Nanjing to handle the handover after a new candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan is selected.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20-something Dispatch] The Kuomintang has scheduled an extraordinary meeting of the Central Standing Committee for the morning of the 24th to discuss and decide on the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The third meeting of the first session of the first Legislative Yuan is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 24th. It is reported that the new candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan may be nominated on the morning of the 24th, and a plenary committee meeting will be held in the afternoon to discuss whether or not to approve the nomination.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The position of new Premier of the Executive Yuan will likely be filled by a third person other than Zhang Qun and He Yingqin. After He Yingqin held a press conference at 10:30 PM on the 23rd to announce his reasons for not being able to assume the position, this matter has been confirmed. However, who this third person is, is currently being considered by President Chiang. No nomination was made on the evening of the 23rd. Our reporter interviewed a certain authoritative person on the night of the 23rd, who said: The candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan must be in line with government policies. Currently, the government has two major policies that must be implemented immediately, without time for leisurely consideration. One is the rapid advancement of the suppression of the rebellion, with the aim of completing it in the shortest possible time. The other is the use of American aid to stabilize the economy and tighten issuance, with American aid arriving imminently, making its use extremely urgent. Therefore, if the new Premier of the Executive Yuan is a third person other than Zhang and He, this person must be experienced, so that he can immediately implement administrative affairs smoothly in accordance with established policies.

He Yingqin's Public Statement: Announces Declination of Premiership

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] He Yingqin formally announced at 10:30 PM on the 23rd that he had declined the appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan and stated that this matter had been understood by the President. He Yingqin was summoned to the official residence to meet with the President at 8:30 PM and left at 9:30 PM. He then held a press conference at his residence at 10:30 PM, where he issued a written statement saying: "Regarding the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution, the President preferred Mr. Zhang Yuejun and myself. I am also deeply grateful for the recommendations of the majority of Kuomintang legislators. However, I have been engaged in military work for nearly 30 years and have not been able to devote much study to politics. Since being assigned to the United Nations Military Staff Committee in the United States, I have been away from the country for nearly two years and am not very familiar with the domestic political situation. At the beginning of constitutional governance, all administrative matters are awaiting reform, and I am completely unprepared for this, especially lacking experience in economic measures. I truly dare not shoulder this important task, lest I fail the expectations of my comrades and the people of the country. I have presented this situation to the President, requesting him to select someone more capable, and I have been understood by the President."

He has been urged by various parties to assume the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan in recent days, but after careful consideration, his will has remained unwavering. On the morning of the 23rd, He took a short trip to Qingliang Mountain. At 11:00 AM and 3:30 PM, Gu Zhutong was sent twice by the President to persuade He to assume the position. At 10:00 PM, the President summoned He again, with Wang Chonghui, Chen Bulei, Sun Ke, and others present. He immediately presented his difficulties and declined the new appointment. After about an hour of discussion, the President granted his request.

During his press conference at 10:30 PM, He briefly explained the situation of the meetings in recent days. Although he declined the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, he did not express a refusal to take on other important positions. A reporter asked He whether he could still take on other positions besides Premier of the Executive Yuan, so as to make contributions to the country. He replied: "This depends on the nature of the position and whether it is one that I am capable of." Someone asked He whether he had recommended anyone else when he declined the position. He replied: "I have no one to recommend." As for the emergence of a new candidate for Premier, He believes that it can be realized within a day or two.

### Date of Convening of the Control Yuan: Will Be Postponed Until After June 10th

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The date of convening of the Control Yuan under the Constitution will be extended due to the fact that the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan has not yet been decided, possibly to after June 10th. This is because the first Control Yuan must be convened by order of the President, and the President's order must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Preparations for the meeting of the Control Yuan have been largely completed. The day after the convening order is issued, the registration procedures for the Control Committee members can be handled. As for the meeting location, the Preparatory Committee received a notice from the Presidential Palace on the 23rd, approving the temporary loan of the Lishi Society Auditorium for use.

### Zhu Shaozhou Broadcasts Speech: Points Out Gains and Losses of Military and Political Affairs in Shaanxi

Local Government Has Not Done Everything Possible to Suppress Bandits

[Our Newspaper, Sian, 23rd Dispatch] In a broadcast speech entitled "Constitutional Governance and Suppression of Rebellion," Shaanxi Provincial Chairman Zhu Shaozhou again commented on the province's military and political affairs, saying: "The victory in the bandit suppression war in this province, I frankly tell all my fellow provincials today, is purely a military victory. If we examine it from other aspects, it is simply a huge failure! For example, when bandits infiltrated various counties, although some local governments were able to resist with all their might, many were negligent in prevention beforehand and did not make every effort to fight the bandits to the death when the time came. In short, the local governments and the people have not been able to exert their full strength, otherwise the results of the battle would have been even more brilliant." He also said: "The first major event when the bandits arrived in various counties was to open opium dens everywhere, sell drugs, and encourage the people to smoke opium. This is ironclad evidence of the Communist Party harming the people."

[United Press, Sian, 22nd Dispatch] Chairman Zhu Shaozhou told United Press reporters that the Communist bandits will attack Sian again in two or three months. "Unless the bandits are effectively defeated, they will never give up their attempt to occupy Sian." The Sian Pacification Headquarters is confident that the Nationalist army can resist the Communist bandits' attempt to advance west along the Longhai Railway. The Communist bandits have reached Tongguan, about a hundred miles from Sian, which is a fact; but during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Japanese army did not advance a step beyond Tongguan to approach Sian, and neither can the Communist bandits.

[Central News Agency, Sian, 23rd Dispatch] According to statistics from the Provincial Government, the county magistrates who died in Shaanxi Province while suppressing bandits include Wu Xuanhan, Magistrate of Mizhi County; Yan Junben, Magistrate of Xusu County; Xu Jisen, Magistrate of Jingbian County; Jiang Menghan, Magistrate of Yanchuan County; Wang Hongda, Magistrate of Shanyang County; Guo Ruisheng, Magistrate of Baishui County; Zhou Hong, Magistrate of Heyang County; Huang Jialin, Magistrate of Baihe County; Li Tonglian, Magistrate of Yongshou County; and Fang Benyu, Magistrate of Qingjian County, totaling ten officials. In addition to providing preferential treatment, the Provincial Government has also requested commendation from the Central Government.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] General Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Capital Garrison, has repeatedly advised young students who were incited by Communist bandits to create student unrest and riots. In order to maintain social order and stability, he issued another statement as follows: "Since the beginning of constitutional governance, our country is striding forward on the road to democracy. Democratic countries emphasize the rule of law above all else, and young students should especially establish the spirit of abiding by the law to serve as a model for the general public. However, the Communist bandits are using a small number of professional students to infiltrate schools in our rear to conduct espionage activities, create student unrest, and incite illegal actions such as strikes and marches in order to coordinate with their military rebellion. As I am responsible for protecting the capital and ensuring social order and stability, I have repeatedly given earnest admonishments to students who are instigated by the Communist bandits to engage in illegal activities. However, the Communist bandits' professional students remain unrepentant and are stubbornly pursuing their calculated conspiracy. To those who are incorrigible and willingly act as accomplices to the bandits, we can only punish them according to the law. If there are any more illegal gatherings, marches, or petitions, the Interim Measures for Maintaining Social Order will be strictly enforced, and the school authorities are still hoped to properly persuade and stop such actions."

[United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] Spokesmen from both China and Britain have stated this week that both countries hope to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, but U.S. officials remain unenthusiastic. Bevin's words would have caused a strong reaction in the United States a year ago, but today they have fallen like a stone into the sea. According to reliable sources, the United States currently believes that convening a peace conference with Japan in the short term would be futile, as this move would only serve to show that the United States and the Soviet Union cannot agree on fundamental issues. Diplomatic circles here accuse the United States of deliberately delaying the peace conference. They claim that U.S. officials, knowing that other countries oppose the U.S. plan to rebuild the Japanese economy, have decided to postpone the peace conference for the time being. They accuse the United States of attempting to deal with Japan alone and, after the plan is successful, to convene a peace conference and submit the fait accompli to the conference.

### U.S. Officials in Tokyo State: Determined Not to Support Japanese Military; Washington is Very Indifferent to Various Conferences

[United Press Asia Vice President Vaughn, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch] Top U.S. officials in Tokyo told reporters that the purpose of the U.S. plan to rebuild Japan is not only to enable the Japanese to have a satisfactory standard of living, but also to improve the standard of living of all Asians. General Walker has never thought of treating China or other Asian countries unfairly and providing special assistance to Japan. MacArthur and those who draft U.S. policy believe that the revival of Japan should be treated equally with the economic prosperity of all Asian countries. Some Chinese newspapers have claimed that the U.S. aid to Japan will endanger China's economic revival and will eventually lead to the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Senior Americans commented on this, saying: "China has suffered greatly, so it is natural for China to view the U.S. aid plan to Japan with suspicion, but the above-mentioned views of Chinese people are mistaken. The United States has taken all measures to ensure that Japan can never again pursue military, political, or economic aggression." The reporter met with MacArthur and talked many times. MacArthur absolutely felt that China is of great importance not only in the Far East but also in global affairs. MacArthur is absolutely unwilling to treat China or other countries specially and develop Japan. What MacArthur hopes for is a rigorous economic and political plan to promote cooperation among Asian countries and to promote economic cooperation between Asian countries and countries around the world.

Editorial

### The Economic Problem of Blocking the Bandit Areas

The necessary condition for the development of the economy is nothing more than a "通 (free flow/unrestricted)" character. Whether it is finance, trade, production, or transportation, if this condition cannot be met, or if it is met insufficiently, then all economic activities will definitely not show profit. Therefore, finance prioritizes 流通 (circulation), trade is also called 通商 (free trade), material exchanges require circulation, and rapid conversion is essential, all boil down to working on this one "通 (free flow/unrestricted)" character.

Since the Anti-Japanese War, due to various reasons related to military affairs, finance, and currency, all measures have often moved in the opposite direction. Not to mention foreign exchange and international trade, focusing solely on the domestic front, there are restrictions on remittances, currency transfers, loans, the use of bills, and the opening of businesses and banks, etc., restricting the flow of currency to a very limited scope. Furthermore, governments at various levels often impose prohibitions on the free sale of many goods, and some goods, under forms of unified purchase or designated purchase, have long become the possessions of certain groups. Under such extreme forms of control, all activities related to transportation, sales, purchase, production, and storage must be subject to a certain degree of restriction. Therefore, the current economic policy, despite ostensibly promoting circulation, is actually causing headaches due to various artificial restrictions.

Since the communist bandits have been running amok and causing disturbances everywhere, the central government, in order to prevent materials from being used by the bandits and to cut off their economic resources, promulgated measures for the economic blockade of bandit areas in the spring of last year, implementing economic blockades in areas close to the war zones. This was originally a last resort. Furthermore, with Shanghai as an industrial and commercial center, communist bandits have been secretly transporting supplies to provide assistance. The military and police authorities have repeatedly disrupted these activities. Therefore, there have been proposals to implement the blockade measures in Shanghai. During this period of mobilization and unrest, military matters take precedence, and this is certainly a necessary move. To accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion, we must deal a fatal blow to the enemy economically. To strike the enemy economically, we must prevent materials from being used by the enemy, thereby cutting off their economic resources. To accomplish this major task, even if we have to temporarily endure some sacrifices and inconveniences, it is believed that everyone will be happy to endure them.

However, to reduce unnecessary troubles, there are some practical suggestions that need to be raised here, and we ask the authorities to consider them carefully in advance. They are:

(1) The Issue of the Blockade Line: Where should the blockade be implemented? The main purpose of the blockade is to prevent materials from flowing into bandit areas. Therefore, the borders close to bandit areas and where materials can be transported to them are the ideal blockade lines. Other areas that are not close to bandit areas and where materials cannot be directly transported to them should be excluded. Because these areas have no transportation links with bandit areas, what is blocked is naturally not materials being transported to bandit areas, but materials that we use ourselves. If these self-used materials are also subject to embargoes, inspections, or licensing procedures, it will only increase the troubles of merchants and have nothing to do with the original purpose of preventing support for the bandits.

(2) The Issue of Purchasing Certificates: Since the purpose of the blockade is to prevent support for the bandits, then all materials that can support the bandits should be embargoed. If there are special reasons for granting exceptions, then proof should be provided to allow passage. The rescue of materials from bandit areas serves the same purpose as cutting off the economic resources of the bandit areas, and logically should be encouraged. As for purchasing goods in Shanghai and transporting them to non-bandit areas, or purchasing goods in non-bandit areas and transporting them to Shanghai, this has nothing to do with the blockade of bandit areas. We believe that unless otherwise specified by law, no procedures are required.

(3) The Issue of the Types of Goods: According to Article 5 of the regulations issued by the Executive Yuan on the blockade of transportation and economy in bandit areas, the local military and political organs should stipulate the types, names, and quantities of materials and finance restricted from passing through the blockade line. This indicates that not all goods are embargoed. Therefore, what types of goods and what quantities are included in the regulations should be carefully determined according to the actual situation and announced in advance to allow merchants to comply. Otherwise, merchants will be accused of violating the ban at any time and place, and it will only open the door for unscrupulous officials to engage in extortion and exploitation.

In addition to the above three points, how the tasks of the blockade line are implemented and how to prevent the unhealthy tendencies of making things difficult and soliciting bribes are certainly issues of common concern. During the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the party or in the rear, these painful lessons left too deep of an impression on people. We believe that the authorities will have sound plans in this regard.

As mentioned above, there are already too many restrictions in the economy. Economic blockade is related to the great strategy of suppressing the rebellion, so we must make efforts to implement it. However, in the fall when the economic sector is facing extreme difficulties, we hope to minimize all unnecessary obstacles and restrictions to avoid further deterioration. Shanghai is also the only large city in our country, with a population that has increased to five million. Most of the essential daily necessities must be supplied from the interior, and all kinds of goods and raw materials needed by various factories, as well as various manufactured products, must be exchanged with various places to maintain the entire system. Therefore, before implementing this blockade measure, how to coordinate and take into account all aspects, and carefully plan to maintain the life of industry and commerce while achieving the maximum effect of the blockade is indeed a major issue worthy of serious discussion. Otherwise, the bandit area will not be truly blocked, while our own industry and commerce will suffer the pain of strangulation, and our own people's livelihood will suffer serious oppression.

There are often many policies whose initial intentions are laudable, but the results are often counterproductive, merely opening up avenues for those who implement the policies to make a fortune. This is why we do not hesitate to use so many words to call on the government and society to pay attention to this issue of blocking the economy of bandit areas.

### Handling Surrendered Communists According to Emergency Punishment Regulations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] After the Executive Yuan promulgated the measures for handling the Communist Party in the rear on September 5 of last year, the Ministry of Interior issued a notice to all provincial and municipal governments to jointly announce a period for the Communist Party members in the rear to register their withdrawal from the party, and stipulated that the deadline for municipalities and provincial capitals, as well as cities and counties where provincial capitals are located, was November 5, 1947, and November 15, 1947, for other counties and cities.

### Flying Across Half of China: A Journey of More Than 7,000 Miles: An Adventure After the Exploration of Mount Jishi

— Our Newspaper Reporter Hong Xucai

Is it luck? Is it a coincidence? Or is it an unattainable opportunity? As a reporter, I had the opportunity to travel across half of China because of my participation in the Mount Jishi Exploration Team of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), enjoying the scenery of Central, Western, Southern, and Northwestern China. The provinces traversed include Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Xinjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Taiwan, as well as Hong Kong and Hainan Island.

I arrived in Lanzhou on April 15th aboard the CNAC exploration plane. After the aerial exploration of Mount Jishi on the 16th, it was originally planned to fly to Chengdu the next day and transfer to Chongqing to take a flight back to Shanghai. As for the exploration plane, it was used by senior officials of CNAC to inspect business at various branch offices. I was fortunate enough to be squeezed into the "inspection" team and flew around. In ten days, I had been to Hankou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Liuzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Hainan Island, Shantou, Xiamen, Tainan, Taipei, and Fuzhou, totaling forty hours of flying time and more than 7,000 miles.

Looking back, this is truly an incredible miracle. It is impossible to complete such a long journey in just ten days. If you try to calculate the travel expenses, with air tickets being so expensive nowadays, the amount would probably be in the hundreds of millions. Moreover, with crowded passengers and limited routes, it is really not easy to travel to so many places at ordinary times, and it is unknown how much time it would take. This CNAC inspection plane was personally piloted by Deputy Manager Chen Wenkuan, so it could take off and land anytime and anywhere for business needs. Apart from the weather, it was not subject to any restrictions. This is naturally the main reason why it was able to fly such a long distance in a short period of time.

I have tried to calculate the cost of CNAC's inspection of business in various places this time. Just in terms of the special plane, it is already considerable. Leaving aside the daily production value that the special plane should have, the gasoline for this trip alone is already staggering. According to the average fuel consumption of the plane, which is 100 gallons per hour, 4,000 gallons of gasoline were consumed in forty hours. Calculated at the price of 260,000 yuan per gallon in Shanghai, the total gasoline price for the entire trip is more than one billion. What's more, the gasoline price in the mainland is twice as expensive as in Shanghai, and freight and other expenses are not included. No wonder Mr. Jin Chao, the engineer of CNAC, who is in his seventies, said to me: "We have worked in the company for twenty years, and we have only waited for such a generous opportunity, but you have encountered it, you are really lucky!

The people who accompanied the plane this time were Deng Gaozhang and Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Managers of CNAC, Chief Engineers Hang Xiaozu and Wen Liandong, Jin Chao, Deputy Pilot Zheng Jiechi, Communicator Xue Yingnian, Xiao Likun, Director of the Business Department of the Civil Aviation Administration, and nine people, including me. Our itinerary was like this: On April 15th, we took off from Longhua Airport in Shanghai, landed in Hankou and Xi'an to refuel, and arrived in Lanzhou that night, staying at the Northwest Reception Hall. The next afternoon at 1:00 PM, we flew to Mount Jishi for exploration and returned to Lanzhou at 8:00 PM, where we were specially invited to a dinner with Generals Zhang Zhizhong and Guo Jiqiao. On the tenth day morning, the exploration plane carried the reporter to Chengdu and transferred to Chongqing to take a flight back to Shanghai, so the reporters from various newspapers who participated in the Mount Jishi exploration safely returned to Shanghai on the 17th. The CNAC special plane for business inspection that I accompanied flew to Liuzhou on the 17th, stayed for only one meal, and then flew to Guangzhou. That night, Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju hosted a dinner, and we stayed at the International Hotel Ai Qun. The next day, we flew directly to Hong Kong and landed at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. Hong Kong is indeed a good place. Once people from other provinces arrive there, they immediately fall in love with it. On the other hand, it was also because Deputy Manager Deng was too busy with business, so we stayed in Hong Kong for the longest time, a total of two days and four nights. On the 22nd, the special plane flew to Hainan Island for a half-day tour. We first tasted Cantonese cuisine at Datong Restaurant in Haikou, which was endless. This island full of tropical flavor provided the reporter with a lot of fresh writing materials, which will be reported one by one. Returning from Hainan Island, we spent the last night in Hong Kong at the Lido Nightclub. On the morning of the 23rd, we flew directly to Shantou and visited Shantou Mayor Li Guojun, who accompanied the reporter to visit Zhongshan Park. In the afternoon of the same day, we flew to Xiamen and stayed at the Daxin Hotel facing Gulangyu Island. On the morning of the 24th, we flew directly to Tainan and transferred to Taipei. After lunch, we transferred to Fuzhou and returned to Shanghai. In Fuzhou, Lin Xianming and his wife, the director of the CNAC station, specially prepared a sumptuous Fuzhou local dish, and I was able to taste the famous coastal dishes. The special plane landed at Longhua Airport at around 10:00 PM that night.

During this trip, I went from the loess belt bordering the deserts of Mongolia and Tibet to the adventurer's paradise with the cleanest asphalt roads—Hong Kong; geographically speaking, it was from Lanzhou, the most central part of the motherland, across Vietnam to the southernmost peninsula on the map; in terms of climate, it was from an altitude of 12 degrees below zero to a subtropical zone above the boiling point. As for the differences in local customs, they are even more significant. From the simplicity, monotony, honesty, and poverty of the Northwest to the exoticism and joy of Qingdao, and then to the oriental colors of Taiwan under the sunlight, although there is a lot to see and hear along the way, it is inevitable that it is superficial and not in-depth because the stay in each place is short and cursory. But it is also because of this that there is no sense of numbness that comes from staying in one place for a long time. I came and went in a hurry, and my impressions of various places were very敏捷. It is easier to associate and produce strong comparisons with the living standards, social order, security situation, and customs of each place. It is my duty to gradually organize and publish them for the benefit of readers.

Here are excerpts of the route, distance, and time of this flight for reference:

Route Flight Time

Shanghai—Hankou 434 miles 2 hours and 40 minutes

Hankou—Xi'an 412 miles 2 hours and 35 minutes

### Soviet Union Refutes U.S. Statement: Accuses U.S. of Aiding Japan to Rebuild Military Power, Blames U.S. for Failure to Reach Disarmament Agreement

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Official sources here stated today that the Soviet Union's peace offensive will not affect U.S. foreign policy. The Soviet Union may take two actions in the future: make concessions on some major issues in the United Nations to show its intention to find a solution, and intensify comprehensive propaganda to show that Premier Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov hope to negotiate and end the Cold War, while President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall are obstructing this attempt. TASS's recent statement criticizing the current U.S. government's opportunistic policy shows that the Soviet Union may follow the second path.

[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet Union yesterday again blamed the United States for the stalemate in the United Nations and foreign ministers' meetings on the issues of preparing for atomic energy, the German-Japanese peace treaty, and the delayed independence of Korea. Moscow Radio broadcast TASS's statement in the morning, expressing the aforementioned opinions, which are the opinions of Soviet leaders, intended to respond to the U.S. State Department's statement on Marshal Stalin's reply to Wallace's open letter. TASS's statement pointed out that the failure of the foreign ministers' meeting and the United Nations to reach an agreement on the aforementioned issues was due to the United States' firm opposition to various Soviet proposals. TASS specifically pointed out that the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that the German-Japanese peace treaty should be prepared by the foreign ministers' meeting, and accused the United States of supporting Japan's aggressive system and rebuilding Japan's economic power to undermine peace. Regarding the issue of foreign troops stationed in China, TASS pointed out that Soviet troops had withdrawn from China, while U.S. troops had not, and the expansion of the Chinese civil war was obviously due to the U.S. troops staying in China. Regarding the Korean issue, TASS stated that due to the United States' adoption of anti-democratic policies and support for reactionary and pro-Japanese groups, the United States and the Soviet Union could not reach an agreement on the independence of Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 22nd] TASS issued a communiqué in response to the U.S. State Department's statement of May 19 on U.S.-Soviet relations, accusing the U.S. government of constantly undermining various international agreements, including Yalta, Tehran, and Potsdam. The United States has also violated the UN General Assembly's resolutions and implemented an arms race policy. The Soviet Union has put forward various proposals on the control of atomic armaments, but they have all been rejected by the State Department. The communiqué continued to mention various issues that hinder Soviet-U.S. relations, such as the German-Japanese peace treaty, the withdrawal of foreign troops from China and Korea, respect for national sovereignty, U.S. interference in the Italian elections, and the establishment of military bases by the U.S. in the territory of UN member states. TASS pointed out that the United States' maintenance of these bases increases international anxiety. Regarding foreign trade and European recovery, TASS stated that the Soviet Union had proposed carrying out European recovery work within the UN framework, but it was also rejected by the U.S. government. The United States has also spread pro-fascist ideas in Greece and other countries. TASS concluded that, based on the above, it is self-evident who is responsible for the current situation. The United States has now abandoned Roosevelt's policy and constantly undermines various international agreements, not only betraying the UN Charter, but also ignoring the UN organization. This attitude will never improve international relations.

### Wallace Broadcasts Another Speech: Challenges U.S. Foreign Policy Leaders: Demands a Debate on Current Policies

[United Press, Spokane, Washington, 22nd] Wallace today challenged Senators Vandenberg, Marshall, or Connally in a broadcast, hoping to hold a series of debates to discuss United Nations foreign policy. Wallace claimed to challenge the foreign policy leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties in his capacity as a third-party presidential candidate.

He said, "In the past two weeks, the Soviet government has twice responded to the United States' proposal, believing that the time has come to end the Cold War. However, politicians from the government and the Democratic and Republican parties have poured cold water on the people's hopes for ending the Cold War. The government claims, "We have negotiated many times for this purpose, and we are tired of negotiating again."

But the people say, "We have fought for this goal before, and we are tired of fighting. What we need is peace."

[Reuters, Seattle, 22nd] U.S. presidential candidate Wallace said today that he felt the United States should, in a fair manner, invite the Soviet Union in open meetings to stop the spread of communism in other countries. But he also announced that methods of undermining the effects of the Communist Party were illegal, which was the first step in any joint action by the United States and the Soviet Union. When asked on a radio broadcast how he would seek an agreement with the Soviet Union if elected president, he replied that he believed the entire issue should be handled by a meeting of the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union. When asked whether the Communist Party supported his presidential campaign, he replied that he would resolutely refuse to support anyone who advocated the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.

### On-site Investigation of Former Italian Colonies Completed

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] The Four Power Committee, which investigated the former Italian colonies, has completed its mission after conducting a six-month on-site investigation in various colonies. The committee members are currently in Rome, visiting various refugee camps and listening to the opinions of Italians returning from Africa. British representative Stafford will return to London on Sunday, and other committee members will also return to London soon to jointly draft a report to be submitted to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference by the end of June.

### Victoria Day Commemoration

[United Press, London, 23rd] Tomorrow is the anniversary of Queen Victoria's birth. In addition to the United Kingdom itself, which will only celebrate by hanging flags, government agencies and schools throughout the rest of the British Commonwealth will be closed for one day, and troops will be reviewed and speeches will be delivered. Since the war, Britain has undergone major political changes. India has been divided into two autonomous territories, and Burma and Ceylon have successively become independent. Cyprus and Malaya have also formulated new constitutions and obtained greater autonomy. In addition, the Palestine issue has made it impossible for Britain to dominate the world. The economy is exhausted and prosperity has disappeared. Recently, joining the Western European Alliance has caused fear among some politicians, who believe that Britain's strength may be sacrificed as a result. According to Foreign Minister Bevin, a meeting of the prime ministers of various autonomous territories will be convened soon to discuss major issues.

### Dewey Wins U.S. Republican Primary

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] According to the nearly complete vote count, New York Governor Dewey has won twelve delegates to the Republican National Convention in the primary in Oregon, which can be described as a major victory. His opponent, Stassen, has conceded defeat and, as usual, congratulated Dewey. Dewey's chances of obtaining the Republican nomination have become increasingly clear.

### Security Council Passes Resolution Ordering Armistice Between Arabs and Jews Today; US-Soviet Demand to Intervene in Holy Land War Rejected

[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council last night failed to accept the US-Soviet proposal to authorize the UN to take strong action to halt the Palestine war. It only issued a second ceasefire order to both the Arab and Jewish sides.

The time limit is set for 5:00 PM on the 24th (2:00 AM on the 25th, Shanghai time). The final resolution passed by a vote of eight to zero, with Syria, the Soviet Union, and Ukraine abstaining. Before the final vote, US representative Austin stated that if the 36-hour ceasefire order is not obeyed, the United States will demand action.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] The replies of both the Arab and Jewish sides to the Security Council's written inquiries have been submitted to the Security Council.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 22nd] Malik is about to replace Gromyko as the Soviet representative to the United Nations. He attended the Security Council's discussion on the Palestine issue for the first time this afternoon. This new Soviet statesman sat at the same table as the Soviet delegation headed by Gromyko. It is generally believed that Gromyko will not immediately relinquish his post but will remain in office for several weeks to allow Malik the opportunity to familiarize himself with his duties.

### China Absolutely Sympathizes with the Jews' Enthusiasm for Nation-Building

Gu Weijun's Telegram Reply to Kline

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Brigadier General Kline, National Commander of the American Jewish War Veterans, released a telegram from Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun on the 22nd. Seeing Kline's concern over why China did not align with the United States in recognizing Israel, Gu replied in the telegram, "I hereby assure you that China absolutely sympathizes with the Jewish people's enthusiasm for nation-building and hopes that the Jewish people can achieve their goals through peaceful means of cooperation and mutual concession."

### Egypt Officially Announces Accidental Attack on British Airfield

And Admits Loss of Five Aircraft

[United Press, Cairo, 22nd] The Egyptian Gazette acknowledged on the 22nd the loss of five aircraft. It also stated that the air raid on Haifa was a mistake. The Gazette claimed that the Egyptian planes originally intended to bomb the Mahsido Jewish airfield, but because the British airfield was adjacent to the Jewish airfield and due to "adverse weather conditions," the error occurred.

### US Consul General in Jerusalem Dies from Severe Injuries Yesterday

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] The State Department announced today that, according to a report from Deputy Consul Butait in Jerusalem, Consul General Wasson was wounded by gunfire while returning from a meeting of the Armistice Commission at the French Consulate yesterday. He was sent to the British Church Hospital for treatment but died from his injuries this morning at 6:00 AM (11:00 AM, Shanghai time), at the age of 52. This is the first major incident of an American official dying as a result of the Jerusalem war. US Navy Communications Officer Waller was also injured at the same time.

### Israel Considering Applying for Loans from the United States

White House Prepares to Receive Weizmann

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Authoritative sources say that the provisional government of Israel is considering applying for a substantial loan from the US Export-Import Bank to develop the Jewish domestic industry. It is understood that this request has not yet been formally submitted.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Israeli President Weizmann is scheduled to arrive here on Monday to meet with President Truman and will be Truman's guest. He will stay at Blair House, the White House guest house, and both the US flag and the Israeli flag will be flown from the roof of the building.

### Allied Nations May Form Another International Tribunal to Try Japanese Class A War Criminals; The Top 20 Include Kodama, Nishio, and Others

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] This reporter from the Central News Agency learned today that the Allied nations may soon organize another international tribunal to try the top 20 Class A Japanese war crime suspects currently detained in Sugamo Prison. This reporter visited Chinese prosecutor Xiang Zhexun yesterday, who predicted that the Allied nations may soon organize another international military tribunal to try the 20 major war criminals who have been detained for over two years without a verdict. The 20 war criminals currently detained in Sugamo Prison awaiting trial include many notorious Japanese military and political leaders who participated in conspiracies to rule China. Among them are those most hated by our compatriots, such as Kishi Nobusuke, one of the five Japanese leaders who ruled Manchuria and served as Minister of Commerce in the Tojo cabinet; Ando Kisaburo, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in South China; Nishio Shozo, former supreme commander of the Japanese army in China; Tada Shun, former vice chief of staff of the Japanese army; and Kodama Yoshio, former head of the "Kodama Agency," a Japanese naval special operations unit in Shanghai. This agency once ran rampant in central and southern China.

### British Official Officially Denies the Allegation of Using US Aid to Support Arabs; Bevin Hopes for Consistency in British and American Views on the Middle East

[United Press, London, 23rd] Reliable sources said on the 23rd that British Foreign Secretary Bevin told US Ambassador to the UK Douglas that he hopes the British and American views on Palestine and the Middle East can be consistent. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Douglas visited Bevin at the latter's invitation to discuss the Palestine issue. It is understood that Bevin pointed out that he does not want to see British and American opinions on the Palestine issue drifting further apart. During the meeting between Douglas and Bevin, they discussed the US Congress's plan to investigate whether Britain is using US aid to support Arab countries. However, officials emphasized that Bevin's main concern is the general sentiment surrounding the Holy Land issue. British officials declined to comment on the US Congress's investigation, but solemnly declared that the funds loaned to Britain by the United States have absolutely no connection with Britain's obligations to Middle Eastern countries. Although Britain hopes for Anglo-American coordination, London still believes that Truman's recognition of Israel was too rash.

### Egyptian Rapid Deployment Force Enters Bethlehem; Has Joined Forces with Foreign Legion; Arabs to Reject Jewish Offer of Truce in Jerusalem

[Reuters, Cairo, 23rd] The Egyptian Ministry of Defense officially announced that the Egyptian Army's rapid deployment force entered Bethlehem at dawn on the 23rd, only five miles from the Arab Legion besieging Jerusalem.

[United Press International, Qatra Arab Foreign Legion Headquarters, Jerusalem District, 23rd] After one of the Egyptian armies captured Bethlehem, it joined forces with the Foreign Legion forces near Jerusalem on the 23rd, but this union is not expected to immediately trigger a large-scale battle for the Holy City.

[Reuters, Amman, 23rd] Amman Radio broadcast a message to the soldiers from King Abdullah of Transjordan, declaring that the 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem are on the verge of total collapse, having been cut off from water and food for days and about to surrender at any moment.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] Israeli aircraft bombed Arab forces in the Jerusalem area twice on the 23rd, dropping a total of ten bombs.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The Jewish authorities, through Abba Eban, the Jewish Agency's representative to Lake Success, stated in the Security Council that they were prepared to accept an unconditional truce in Jerusalem, but the Arab side stated that they had repeatedly given the Jewish forces the opportunity to surrender, and now that the war is nearing its end, they would reject their surrender at this time.

### Jewish People Burned Down Factory on the South Coast of the Dead Sea

[Reuters, Southern Shore of the Dead Sea Frontline, 22nd] The potash factory on the southern shore of the Dead Sea, which the Jewish people were proud of, has been abandoned by the Jewish people. The factory is worth over one million pounds. The Transjordanian Legion ordered the Jewish people there to surrender a few days ago, but unexpectedly, the Jewish people quietly boarded boats after setting the fire and fled from the Dead Sea. Some of the factory's buildings are still intact, but the company's offices and some parts of the team have been destroyed. Some valuable machinery has been removed by the Jewish people by plane. It is unlikely that the factory will be restored to its original state for some time.

### Philippine Hukbalahap Leader Blood Poisoning

The Reason for Not Yet Surrendering to the Government

[United Press International, Manila, 22nd] News tonight: Philippine Hukbalahap leader Taruc is suffering from blood poisoning and his life is in danger. The reason why Taruc has been delaying his surrender to the government is probably due to this.

### Gandhi's Assassin to be Tried This Week

[United Press International, New Delhi, 22nd] The trial of Gandhi's assassin, Godse, and eight accomplices will begin here next week. The exact date remains a secret, as the government fears it may incite riots. The police have implemented strict security measures to prevent bandits from robbing the assassin or silencing him with gunfire. The fortress walls surrounding the courthouse will be guarded by police at all times, and only reporters and others will be allowed to attend the trial, but they will be subject to inspection, and photography will be prohibited. Women will also not be allowed to carry purses. On the first day, the court will hear the prosecutor read the indictment and then adjourn for two weeks before hearing the testimony of 250 witnesses. The entire trial may be delayed until the hot summer before it can be concluded.

### Ruhr Issue Unresolved; Six-Nation Conference Stalls; France Still Emphasizes National Security

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] After returning to Paris on the weekend, the two French chief representatives to the six-nation conference in London to discuss the German issue, Deputy Foreign Minister Miotville and External Economic Minister Alphand, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry revealed that the six-nation conference has stalled due to the issue of international co-management of the Ruhr industrial region. No agreement has been reached on this matter throughout the week because the US Special Representative for the European Recovery Program Hoffman has the decision-making power to increase the allocation of Ruhr coal and steel, while the representatives of France, the Netherlands, and Belgium believe that this will hinder the previous agreement guaranteeing Western Europe a fixed percentage of Ruhr coal production. France and others believe that such agreements are necessary for their economic and security. Authoritative sources also revealed that France, the Netherlands, and Belgium have made substantial concessions on the US views regarding the future political structure of Germany, so they hope that the US can make concessions to France and others in the economic field. Although officials here expect an agreement to be reached eventually, they expect that other Allied nations will not allow Hoffman to have the power to veto the decisions made by the Allied nations on the Ruhr. French public opinion has become impatient with the repeated disregard for French security issues in the German issue talks.

### International Silk Conference; China Sends Three Participants

Japan Sends Twelve Representatives

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The International Silk Conference will be held in Lyon from June 14th to 18th, with 165 foreign representatives participating. There will be 184 French representatives and one German observer. Japan has sent 12 representatives to the conference, and China will send three. The conference will seek to develop international silk trade.

### War Potential of the US and USSR

— Translated by Weng Shaoqiu

The Soviet Union is currently striving to control the entire European continent. The United States has twice waged war to prevent enemy countries from controlling Europe. It is currently preparing to restrain the Soviet Union from further expansion, and will not hesitate to go to war if necessary.

The traditional policy of the United States is to prevent any country from single-handedly dominating Europe, because after dominating the European continent, it will gain the convenience of shipbuilding and obtain a base from which to challenge the US mainland and Western countries. Therefore, if the Soviet Union directly controls the countries of Western Europe, or it seems that the communist parties of various countries control Western Europe, it will cause the United States to fear that the Soviet air force may use Western Europe as a base.

Based on the above background, if the Soviet Union's plan to control the entire European continent is successful, then a US-Soviet war will be inevitable.

The war potential of the US and USSR is as follows:

Manpower is the most important condition at the start of a war. The Soviet Union will overwhelm the United States. The total number of industrial workers in the Soviet Union and Europe will reach 45.93 million, while the United States will only have 23.15 million. Even including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, it is not as many as the Soviet Union.

Steel: The Soviet Union and Europe can produce 54 million tons of steel annually, while the United States can produce several million tons annually, but not all of it can be immediately used for war purposes. Therefore, the amount that the Soviet Union lacks is not as large as the number indicates.

Coal: If Europe and the Soviet Union cooperate in production, they can produce 580 million tons of coal annually, while the United States produces 683 million tons of coal annually.

Nitrogen: Nitrogen is needed during wartime for explosives and food production. The Soviet Union and Europe can manufacture 1.3 million tons annually, which is about the same as the US production.

Machine tools: The Soviet Union will have 27.5 million machine tools, and the United States will only have 30 million, but the United States is better equipped.

If the Soviet Union controls all of Europe, its industrial strength will double its current level, but the Soviet Union will be unable to solve the problems involved in full-scale wartime industry. Even at full production, the production efficiency of the Soviet Union and Europe is still lower than that of the United States.

Moscow's real problem is how to make full use of European industry and manpower after it is seized.

Petroleum: Petroleum is the most important factor in modern warfare. This is where the Soviet Union faces difficulties. The transportation network in Western Europe requires a large amount of petroleum, but the Soviet Union and Europe are unable to supply it. The Soviet Union and Europe can produce at most 267 million barrels of petroleum annually, while the United States can produce 1.92 billion barrels annually.

If the Soviet Union controls all of Europe, it will need to purchase large amounts of petroleum from South America, the Caribbean Sea, the Middle East, and the Dutch East Indies, but the US Air Force can quickly cut off the sources of petroleum listed above. It is of little benefit for the Soviet Union to seize Middle Eastern oil fields, because it will be unable to transport the oil. Middle Eastern petroleum must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, but the British and American navies will control the Mediterranean Sea.

On the other hand, the Soviet Union has neither the air force nor the naval power to cut off US petroleum supplies.

After the outbreak of war, the United States will be able to obtain the main raw materials for the war from all over the world, but the Soviet Union will only be able to obtain raw materials from the areas it controls. Other sources of raw materials will be cut off by the US Air Force and Navy.

The main war materials that the Soviet Union lacks are as follows:

Aluminum: Aluminum is the raw material for manufacturing aircraft bombs and combat fleets. The amount of aluminum produced by the United States far exceeds what the Soviet Union and Europe can manufacture. The European continent can only produce 380,000 tons of aluminum annually, but the United States can produce 1.23 million tons annually. Adding the 500,000 tons produced by Canada, the US-Soviet aluminum production ratio is five to one.

Copper: Copper is the main raw material for manufacturing any military equipment. The United States also has more abundant copper production than the Soviet region. The Soviet Union and Europe can produce 305,000 tons of copper annually, while the United States produces three times that amount.

The lack of technical talent and industrial management talent is also the Soviet Union's fatal weakness. If European industry can obtain raw materials, it is doubtful whether the Soviet Union's industrial output will be close to the amount produced by Hitler. Because Hitler had a group of industrial management and technical talents, the Soviet Union lacks such experts, and at the same time, Western Europe will not be willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union after it is occupied.

Lack of transportation is another obstacle for the Soviet Union. Once a war breaks out, this obstacle will soon become apparent. There are only three main railway lines running through Eastern and Western Europe. Since the second railway in eastern Germany has been removed, the three transportation lines have been weakened.

The US Air Force can take off from the United Kingdom, the Middle East, and North Africa to bomb the entire transportation network of the European continent.

The Danube River is the only waterway on the European continent, running through Western Europe and the Soviet Union, with an annual transportation volume of 2 million tons, but the mines dropped by the US Air Force will severely damage this transportation line. If the Soviet Union wants to supply France and Italy, it must pass through the Mediterranean Sea, but the US Navy and Air Force will definitely block it.

Lack of food and clothing is even more difficult for the Soviet Union at the start of the war, and it weakens European power, making it impossible to prolong the war.

During the war, the source of food transported by the Soviet Union and Europe from the Americas and North Africa will definitely be cut off, and the Soviet Union and its vassal states will not be able to make up for the loss of food. At the same time, due to transportation disturbances, if there is food, it is impossible to transport it. As a result, it will inevitably affect industry, because workers do not have enough food, and work efficiency will drop sharply.

The situation with clothing will be even more serious than with food. If the source of clothing is cut off, the civilians of Europe and the Soviet Union will almost not be able to obtain any textiles. On the contrary, the United States has an inexhaustible source of food and clothing.

In conclusion, based on the facts above, after the Soviet Union controls Europe, the designers must immediately develop the economy of Western Europe. The increase in industrial power when the Soviet Union controls Europe may be greater than the industrial power when Hitler launched World War II, but it is still weaker than the United States. Just like playing a game of cards, if the Soviet Union's struggle against the United States is prolonged, the cards that are unfavorable to him will definitely pile up.

### Rebuilding the Western District of Zhabei; The Executive Yuan Approves the Reconstruction Plan; The First Phase of Funding is Set at 500 Billion

The western district of Zhabei in this city was designated as a blockade zone during the enemy and puppet regime. Since the victory, the area has been devastated due to air raids and other destructions, and has become a shantytown for refugees. Recently, the Land Administration Bureau, together with various relevant agencies, drafted a plan for reorganizing the Zhabei area and submitted it to the municipal government for approval by the Executive Yuan, which has been approved for implementation recently. It is understood that the western district of Zhabei has approximately 1,900 mu of land, of which private farmland owned by citizens accounts for approximately four-fifths, and government public places account for only one-fifth. Now that the Executive Yuan has approved it, the government has decided to build on one-half of the land, and the remaining one-half will be returned to the original landowners. The Public Works Bureau attaches great importance to this construction project. In addition to designing the streets according to the plan and drawing up plans, it also invited Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Wang Ziyang, a member of the Public Works Committee, and others to hold a meeting to discuss the construction project and economic fundraising in detail, and has decided: (1) The building construction will adopt a joint-style construction. According to this style, the zoning map will be revised and sent to the Land Administration Bureau as the basis for household land division. (2) Roads and ditches should be built and completed as soon as possible. (3) The cost of the first phase of construction is estimated at 500 billion yuan, which will be invested by various banks. (4) Negotiate with the China Bank and Farmers Bank to invest in municipal improvements. (5) Request the Central Trust of China to invest in building houses for sale at low prices. (6) Issue a second house charity lottery.

Mayor Wu, who is also the chairman, will preside. Deputy Chairmen Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jiqi, Secretary Zhao Zukang, and other committee members will attend to review the flood prevention project plan for the second half of this year and discuss fundraising for flood prevention. According to the person in charge of the Drainage Engineering Office of the Public Works Bureau: The area of ​​water accumulation in the city is extremely large. After the efforts to launch flood prevention work last year, the situation of water accumulation has not been as serious as before. The most obvious examples are: (1) Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road were originally famous areas of water accumulation. Now, because the household ditch project has been completed, water no longer accumulates. (2) The area near the 13-story building in the Old Concession area used to accumulate water over Teng every time there was a tide or heavy rain. After a pumping station was placed in the Rihui Port, the problem of water accumulation has been resolved. The flood prevention project from June to December of this year is also an important task. The main projects are in two locations, one near Risheng Building on Nanjing Road and the other in the Fanhuangdu Road-Jiangsu Road area. The above two locations are the most serious water accumulation areas, and the budget is estimated at 130 billion yuan. As for this project plan, the Risheng Building part plans to lay a 30-inch diameter relief ditch starting from Tianjin Road, passing through Zhejiang Road, Ningbo Road, and Liuhe Road, and directly connecting to Tibet Road. The western Shanghai part plans to open up two new roads, Jiangsu North Road and Wuning Road, and install 54-inch ditch pipes. The opening of the two new roads will be carried out according to the urban planning routes. When building the roads, efforts will be made to accommodate the existing ground buildings.

### Is Stockpiling Rayon a Crime? Police Bureau Inquires About Legal Basis

The Municipal Police Bureau previously cracked two cases of stockpiling rayon in Nos. 7 Taozhuli, Shijian Road, Hou Mingde, Wang Shunchang, and No. 5 Taihefang, Shandong Road, Li Zhixiang. After being transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, they decided not to prosecute because rayon was not a controlled daily necessity. The bureau believes that it is necessary to clarify the legal provisions on whether stockpiling rayon is a crime, and also believes that the reasons for not prosecuting the two cases still need to be inquired. It has now sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the legal basis in order to avoid difficulties in future enforcement.

### Repairing Alleyway Lights; Disputes Often Arise Due to Fees

Violations Can Be Reported to the Bureau Immediately

The French Concession Electricity Company in this city has always been responsible for the repair costs of alleyway lines within the transmission area, which has often caused disputes over the collection of these costs in the past. The company has even used power outages as a means of retaliation. According to a reporter's interview with the department in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, the bureau has strictly ordered the company not to arbitrarily cut off the power to alleyway lines due to the issue of collecting repair costs in order to protect the interests of users. Even if it is necessary, it should first be submitted for approval and handled by the bureau. Other power outages caused by wind and rain damage to the lines must be repaired within three days. If the project is major and cannot be repaired within three days, it must also be submitted for approval and filed. The labor and material costs for repairing alleyway lines must be jointly assessed by the Public Utilities Bureau, and no overcharges are allowed. The bureau also stated that if the company does not follow the above steps or has other circumstances that increase the burden on users, users can report it as much as possible, and it will be handled quickly.

### Embezzlement Case in Zhabei District Rice Distribution; District Head Additionally Accused

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Eighth Bao Chief of Zhabei District, Chuan Daosheng, Deputy Bao Chief He Chaoliang, Bao Clerk Chen Zuosan, and District People's Representative Ni Luolin, etc., are accused of embezzlement in the distribution of rice for the extremely poor. The case is currently under investigation by the District Procuratorate. The plaintiffs, citizens Zhang Yiming and Zheng Chaozhen of the Bao, have accused the Zhabei District Head, Wang Zhiping, of colluding with the defendants in the embezzlement. They recently submitted a statement to the District Procuratorate, adding Wang Zhiping as a defendant. The reasons are approximately two points: (1) In the August 1947 distribution of rice for the extremely poor, there was no statistical register of the extremely poor population beforehand or afterward. The register was compiled and falsified after the incident. This shows that the upper and lower levels colluded to instigate corruption. (2) In the January 1948 distribution of rice for the poor, the People's Survey Committee originally stipulated one dou per large mouth and five sheng per small mouth. However, Wang changed the regulations and handled it arbitrarily, issuing only four sheng of rice per mouth. The excess amount was not publicly announced, which is another ironclad proof of embezzlement. The District Procuratorate will summon the relevant people for interrogation in the coming days.

### German Youth's False Report of Theft Exposed

[Our Newspaper's Report] A German youth named Crick, 27 years old, residing in room 331 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, is engaged in the business of buying and selling jewelry on behalf of customers. The day before yesterday, Crick suddenly went to the Old Zha Police Precinct to report that at noon on the same day, while riding the No. 22 French Concession public bus near Middle Zhongzheng Road, he was robbed of a platinum diamond brooch weighing more than six carats, with a market value of 1.8 billion Legal Tender. In addition, 900,000 Legal Tender and four US dollars were also lost at the same time, requesting investigation.

Subsequently, according to the testimony of another German colleague residing at Crick's residence, there were obvious discrepancies with Crick's report. It was determined that there must be another hidden situation in the case. Crick was brought to the station for detailed questioning, and it was finally determined that the case was actually a false report of theft by Crick, attempting to embezzle the valuable ornament. At the same time, the police also recovered the original stolen goods at the residence of Crick's friend, Bai Laman (residing at No. 77, Lane 343, Huade Road). According to Bai's confession, the item was deposited by Crick. Crick was detained and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate today on charges of false reporting and embezzlement.

### Identity of Female Corpse in Wuzhou Hotel Murder Case Determined; Murderer is the Deceased's Husband; Committed the Crime Under Nervous Derangement

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Wuzhou Hotel at No. 517 Guangdong Road, on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, a tragic case occurred in which a young female guest was murdered and her body was hidden under the bed. The situation of the corpse's discovery was reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Old Zha Police Precinct in charge of the case has been investigating the matter since the incident and has traveled by boat with hotel waiter Deng Qibao to various places in Haimen to track down the murderer, but has not yet arrested him. It is reported that the murderer, Yu Xingbai, is 23 years old and lives at No. 13, Block 8, Section 1, Wenwu Township, Haimen. His father, Yu Shixin, co-owns the Futai Hardware and Sundries Store at No. 111 Ximen Avenue. Shixin has five sons, and the murderer Yu Xingbai is the eldest son. He graduated from Haimen High School and was later admitted to the Qianghua Vocational School, but was expelled from school for misconduct after less than a month. He was unemployed at home and had an affair with Shen Zhufeng, the daughter of Shen Zhang, a neighbor. He asked his father to marry Shen as his wife, but Yu Shixin strongly opposed because he disliked Shen's family for being poor. Xingbai was deeply stimulated mentally, and once fled with the woman. She was found by Shen's mother, who questioned Yu's family aggressively. Later, Yu's uncle came forward to mediate, and the lovers were finally married. This year, during Qingming, Yu Xingbai planned to come to Shanghai to do business. He borrowed a piece of cotton yarn from his father, sold it for more than 100 million yuan, and used it as capital. He came to Shanghai with Shen and lived together in the Wuzhou Hotel. Unexpectedly, the tragedy occurred on the 9th of this month. The police investigation concluded that the murderer may have committed the crime in a moment of nervous derangement. On the 13th of this month, the bureau received a report that a young man had committed suicide on wasteland of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Jiangwan. His age and appearance were very similar to the murderer. The bureau sent personnel to detain the corpse coffin and transferred it to the Changde Road Morgue for examination. The result of the autopsy confirmed that it was not Yu Xingbai. The bureau is still continuing its pursuit.

Subsequently, people in uniform arrived at the theater one after another and sat upstairs and downstairs. At 1:05, seeing that the performance had not yet started, they caused a disturbance, and several people even tried to rush into the backstage.

### Sun Tianchang Case; New Evidence to be Discovered; A Large Number of Bayonets Buried Underground in the Motley Factory; Two Criminals to be Sent to Beijing for Trial Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Tianchang, a traitor who was previously reported for the suspicion of providing military supplies to the enemy and was acquitted by the military court, was recently secretly reported to the Ministry of National Defense for concealing military supplies. The Ministry of National Defense sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation with the Ninth Regiment of Military Police. Copper coins were found in 57 boxes in the interlayer of the wall of the former British Motley Piano Store on Huimin Road, and dozens of artillery observation instruments were found in a warehouse on North Shaanxi Road. Sun Tianchang is currently being held by the Ninth Regiment of Military Police. It is reported that the secret informant in this case is a staff member and worker under Sun's command when he was the factory director of Motley. In addition to the above-mentioned copper coins and military observation instruments in the secret report, there are still a large number of bayonets, which are said to have been hidden by Sun Tianchang underground at the Motley factory site. Initially, eleven underground caves were dug for burial, and the ground was completely covered with cement. The personnel of the Ministry of National Defense, who are responsible for investigating this case, are quite troubled by the excavation of these bayonets, because the ground has long been paved with cement, and the exact location of the eleven underground caves where the bayonets are buried is difficult to determine. Moreover, the site of the Motley Piano Store is now the property of the US Consulate, making it difficult to excavate the entire factory site. The responsible personnel will return to Beijing for instructions in the coming days. Sun Tianchang and his assistant Yin Zhongbi, who was arrested at the same time, will be sent to Beijing for trial today. In addition, regarding the copper coins and observation instruments that were seized, the informant also mentioned them when the military court tried Sun Tianchang. Later, because the military court failed to find these items, it acquitted him on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Now that the physical evidence has been found, the old case may be reopened, and those who were previously responsible for the prosecution and trial may be involved. It is reported that the personnel of the Ministry of National Defense have reviewed all the case files of Sun Tianchang's previous trials in the High Court and military court.

### Clothing Burial Held for Martyr Zhang Xiaotong; Widow Was So Grieved at the Graveside that She Wanted to Commit Suicide; Memorial Service Held by Various Circles at Fazang Temple

Martyr Zhang Xiaotong, a former member of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, was ordered to stay in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War to engage in underground work. He was resented by the enemy and puppets and was finally lured and arrested by Su Nichengde, the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Director (who was executed last autumn in Shanghai Tilanqiao). He was brutally murdered by the enemy in the Dashugen area of Nanjing. His remains were not found after the victory. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., his family held a clothing burial for Martyr Zhang at the Hongqiao Cemetery. A complete set of clothing and a foot-square wooden box containing Martyr Zhang's birth dates, covered with the Party emblem, were placed in the tomb. At 3:00 p.m., the tomb lid was lowered and mourning music was played. At that time, Martyr Zhang's widow, Ms. Chen Shaoqing, was overwhelmed with emotion and grief. She wanted to throw herself into the tomb to commit suicide. Relatives and friends who were attending the funeral were shocked and rushed forward to pull her back and support her to sit down on the ground. Mrs. Zhang continued to weep. During the public memorial service, Mrs. Zhang stepped forward to kneel and kowtow her forehead heavily on the tomb lid several times, almost fainting. Relatives and friends, fearing an incident, helped her into a car to return home to rest when the funeral was over.

In addition, at the memorial service for Martyr Zhang at Fazang Temple on Ji'an Road yesterday morning, there were more than 200 people who came to pay their respects, including Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Director Wu Kaixian, Director Zhao Zukang, and colleagues from Shen Bao, which was extremely solemn.

### UNRRA Supplied Agricultural Equipment; Original Plan to Establish Factories Changed

[Our Newspaper's Report] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplied China with more than 60,000 tons of equipment to manufacture agricultural implements, valued at US$8 million, which has now arrived. According to the original UNRRA plan, in addition to establishing a general factory in Shanghai, 18 branch factories and 3,000 iron workshops would be opened in various places. Due to the limitations of domestic repair conditions and various difficulties encountered during implementation, the plan has been revised by the Post-War Enterprise Management Committee and the China Agricultural Machinery Company. Equipment and machinery will be sold at low prices to farmers, the 18 branch factories will be reduced to eight, and the original equipment will be used to equip the Shanghai General Factory. The rest will be sold to the China Agricultural Machinery Company. The existing Wusong General Factory will be expanded to engage in industrial production in addition to manufacturing agricultural implements, meeting the needs of the local industrial community. The Qiujiangqiao Factory of the company will continue to handle the establishment, management, and training of personnel for the branch factories in various districts. National undertakings will be entrusted by the Management Committee to the company for implementation with allocated funds. In addition, the construction of the four branch factories in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, and Changsha will be completed within one year. The equipment for the Changsha branch factory will be shipped to various branch factories by mid-August at the latest, and industrial production will be undertaken to meet local needs. The above new plan is based on the current domestic situation, striving to be practical and to enable all UNRRA equipment to quickly exert its maximum effect. The estimated cost is approximately US$4 million.

### The Fisheries Administration's Two Rounds of Exports: A Fishing Demonstration at Duck Nest Sand

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Fuxing Island rose to prominence during the gold hiding case. Although time has passed, when our reporter traverses this fertile land, there is still a strange feeling. Gold, of course, was not found, but materials of even greater value than gold are piled up everywhere. However, no one knows the underlying reason why these materials are not being exploited. Many are quietly lamenting!

The Fisheries Administration has mounds of foreign pine, canvas, hemp ropes, and equipment piled up like mountains. It is said that the Post-War Fisheries Rehabilitation Materials Management Committee will convene a meeting of coastal provincial and municipal governments and fisheries representatives next month, after which the timber will be distributed to build ships, and all equipment will be allocated. But the timing seems too late. Haven't we seen two hundred pairs of Japanese fishing boats already overstepping their bounds in our offshore waters? Such things are often discovered. When Japanese ships see our fishing boats, they even throw away their nets and flee. But fleeing is just temporary; intimidation is not as thorough as resistance based on real strength.

One Net Pulled Up Empty

To clearly demonstrate fishing operations, the Fisheries Administration specially dispatched two of the ten large American fishing boats, the "Wisconsin" and the "Virginia," to take reporters outside the Wusongkou. The captain said: Normally, motorboats must sail four hours outside the Wusongkou to find schools of fish in the seabed. Because time was limited, the two boats stopped at Duck Nest Sand as a "demonstration." At this time, there were no winds or waves. At precisely 3:40 PM, the fishing net was unloaded from the deck of the "Virginia" into the muddy river water, gradually drifting away and sinking. Finally, planks were lowered on both sides of the ship to open the mouth of the net. Everyone was waiting for a joyous moment, but in less than fifteen minutes, the winch began to raise the net. The crew, dressed like firefighters, hauled up the dripping wet fishing net in three sections. As a result, the "cod end" (the end for holding the fish) was completely empty. When the same message came from the other boat via wireless telephone, everyone was disappointed. The captain explained further: They fish in the deep sea, and it takes at least two or three hours to pull up one net. Besides, the fish in Duck Nest Sand have long been scared away by the constant traffic of ships.

Drifting on the Ocean, Experiencing Hardships

Their description of actual fishing work is quite moving. When the wind and rain are dark, and the waves tower into the sky, a small boat drifting on the boundless ocean is truly terrifying. Especially in violent storms, it is common to have teeth knocked out or hands and feet broken when raising the net. As for those who are swept into the sea, there are quite a few. It is said that once, an engine failed offshore, and they were unable to drop anchor due to the wind and waves. So, a foreign crew member and a Chinese crew member rowed a sampan to take the anchor out, but the foreign crew member never returned. Few people understand these hardships. They say that each trip to sea lasts about ten days, and they work twenty-four hours a day, fighting the wind and waves with their lives. But when people pick up a chopstick of "sweet and sour yellow croaker," who knows that every fish on the plate represents hardship?

Yellow Croaker Passing By with a Terrifying Roar

Speaking of yellow croaker, the two months after Qingming Festival each year are a peak season. It is common to catch tens of thousands of catties in one net, and sometimes so many that they cannot be hauled onto the boat, so they have to "release" some. The male yellow croakers chase the females, swimming through the sea with a terrifying roar. But it is said that this year, the focal point of this group has not been found. The Fisheries Administration caught 3.2 million catties in March and April this year, worth 87.6 billion yuan, but compared to previous years, the difference is too great.

### Exquisite Kitchen, Soft Simmons Mattress

It is necessary to introduce these two fishing boats. Like other American fishing boats, they have highly superior performance, averaging around 120 tons with 250 horsepower. They can travel nine nautical miles per hour. The fish capacity of one boat can reach up to 100 tons. The equipment inside includes a wireless telephone for communicating with other boats at any time, and all kinds of first aid medicines. There is also an exquisite kitchen and a soft Simmons mattress.

As the person in charge of the Fisheries Administration said, from the mouth of the Yalu River to the southernmost Tokyo Bay, such a long coastline, equipped with only 126 motorized fishing boats (60 American ships and 66 Australian ships from post-war materials), is truly pitifully small. This can only be said to be the beginning of motorized fishing in China. What is hoped is that this fragile lineup can establish a permanently unshakeable foundation for the fishing industry.

Crew Recalls Past Events, Full of Terror. They Exchange Their Lives Battling with the Stormy Waves.

### Rising Commodity Prices: Authorities Frequently Exert Pressure, the Tide of Price Increases Slightly Subdued

The trend of commodity prices this year, after a surge in the second week of March, maintained a relatively stable state, advancing gradually, until April. This process lasted about seven weeks.

From the first half of May, that is, the first two weeks before last week, a cyclical wave of price increases started again. According to the commodity price index compiled by this publication and classified by purpose, the total index rose by 9.21% in the first week of May and 27.82% in the second week. The authorities immediately paid close attention and frequently exerted pressure in an attempt to curb it.

Following this trend last week, with the government selling off materials on one hand and tightening credit on the other, the tide of price increases in general has gradually slowed. Although there were mixed increases and decreases, gains and losses were seen, but the amplitude was narrower. The total index rose by only 1.20%.

Credit was quite tight last week. The exchange at the national bank was in deficit by more than one trillion on Wednesday and Thursday. The black market interest rate was also quite chaotic, ranging from 30% to over 40%. The exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar has been gradually decreasing since the beginning of the week. The relevant price factors last week are roughly analyzed as follows:

First, the government continued to implement its policy of selling off materials, which began during the surge of the previous week. On Monday, in addition to the usual sale of cotton yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, it also sold twelve types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the cotton yarn market, selling 568 pieces in total. It also sold 35 types of cotton cloth and three types of bedsheets, selling 20,380 bolts of cotton cloth and 60 bedsheets in total. At the meeting of the Food Sugar Group of the Price Review Committee on Monday, it was decided that the allocation price of the 21st phase of Taiwan sugar would remain unchanged.

On Tuesday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell thirteen types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee in the market, selling 821 pieces in total.

On Wednesday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell four types of cotton, selling a total of 8,600 market dan, and fifteen types of cotton yarn, selling 1,182 pieces in total. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee allocated a total of 2,380 shi of second-grade white japonica rice and hsien rice, with an allocation price of 5.4 million yuan per shi for white japonica rice and 5.2 million yuan per shi for hsien rice.

On Thursday, the China Textile Construction Company sold four types of cotton, totaling 7,990 market dan, and thirteen types of cotton yarn, totaling 869 pieces. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee sold a total of 3,760 shi of white japonica rice and hsien rice, with the allocation price of white japonica rice raised to 5.5 million yuan per shi and the allocation price of hsien rice raised to 5.3 million yuan per shi.

On Friday, the China Textile Construction Company sold three types of cotton, totaling 5,545 dan, and eleven types of cotton yarn, totaling 904 pieces.

On Saturday, the China Textile Construction Company continued to sell three types of cotton, totaling 1,800 dan, and thirteen types of cotton yarn, totaling 1,176 pieces. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee sold a total of 2,743 shi of various types of rice.

Second, in order to suppress commodity prices, in addition to selling off materials, the authorities also massively tightened credit. It is said that effective measures have been taken since the 14th, and until recently, the total deficit of national banks has exceeded six trillion. However, remittances from North China, Northwest China, and Central China have flooded in, and large amounts of cash have been transported, so the effect of tightening credit has not been fully realized.

Third, strengthened control. Since the National Bank tightened credit in the previous week, the number of returned checks has increased, reaching a staggering 1.4 trillion at the end of the previous week, setting an unprecedented record. The Gold Management Bureau immediately conducted a thorough investigation. For banks and firms, their names will be announced and they will be severely punished. Customers will be transferred to the court for investigation. In addition, the President and Vice President are scheduled to be inaugurated on the 20th, so speculators are inevitably wary.

Fourth, the exchange rate benchmark of the Stabilization Committee, which had been stable for more than a month after being adjusted on April 6, suddenly saw an adjustment on Monday. Various exchange rates rose by an average of 46%. The US dollar rose from 324,000 yuan to 474,000 yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan; the British pound rose from 972,000 yuan to 1,422,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan; other Hong Kong dollar and Indian rupee exchange rates also increased proportionally.

According to past adjustments to the exchange rate benchmark price, the market was always stimulated, and commodity prices rose, causing an uproar. Although the market price fluctuated slightly this time, the impact was far less than in the past. This is because the listed price before this adjustment was less than one-third of the black market exchange rate and had long been detached from reality, so it had little stimulating effect on general commodity prices.

In addition, the measures related to commodity prices last week that can be mentioned are:

(1) The National Bank issued two types of short-term treasury bills, one due at the end of May and the other due in mid-June. It is said that this measure is to facilitate the financing of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors so that they can settle accounts upon maturity. The issuance discount is still determined daily.

(2) The source of funds for general business loans from national banks was previously stipulated by the Four-Bank Joint Office to be self-absorbed deposits. The deposit interest rate has recently been approved by the Four-Bank Joint Office to be increased from 8% per annum to 4% per annum, and the lending rate has been increased to 1.8% per month. This is also an example of national banks gradually breaking away from the past low-interest policy.

(3) According to the United Credit Investigation Institute, the new Sino-Hong Kong agreement is being negotiated between the Chinese and Hong Kong governments and will be finalized soon. The final decision can be made after the establishment of the new government.

It is learned that the content of the new agreement is based on controlling the Hong Kong market. The implementation steps will eliminate the free trading in the Hong Kong market. The Hong Kong government will prohibit the establishment of speculative commercial and financial institutions. If this can be achieved, it will be able to stop the activities of the gold and cash black market, which will be of great benefit to stabilizing our finances. This matter is being negotiated by representatives of the Central Bank, and it is heard that the Hong Kong government has expressed its willingness to assist.

The market trend of commodity prices last week, under the two major pressures of government selling off materials and tightening credit, was in a state of wanting to rise but stopping. Unfortunately, the influx of funds from other ports meant that the effect of tightening credit was not fully apparent.

The Chinese and foreign stock markets have always been hovering stably, with relatively narrow fluctuations. The details will be described in the stock market section below.

In terms of yarn and cloth, due to the authorities tightening credit and the Yarn Management Committee selling off large quantities, the trend is also stable. 42-count Blue Phoenix has always been fixed between 290 million and 300 million. Coarse yarn rose slightly. For example, 21-count Double Horse rose from 192.2 million on Monday to 230 million at the weekend. The trend of leading fine cloth and group yarn is similar, with the weekend rising by more than 10% compared to the beginning of the week.

In terms of rice and grain, due to rare arrivals caused by rainy weather, the production price was reported to be rising. The quantity sold off by the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee could not meet the needs of the market, making it a commodity with a more rapid price increase in the middle of the week. For example, in the Taipei market, white japonica rice rose from 5.45 million per shi at the beginning of the week to 5.9 million on Thursday. The off-market asking price once broke the 6 million mark. By Friday, the weather turned fine, and more goods arrived from other ports, and the price began to fall slightly from the peak. At the weekend, the price of Wuxi rice was reported to be rising, and the price moved towards the peak again. Both the northern and southern markets broke the 6 million mark.

Miscellaneous grains, wheat, and oil, etc., were stable and in demand. Flour was in strong demand in the north, and the market price rose. For example, No. 1 Bingchuan flour rose from 1.78 million at the beginning of the week to 2.16 million at the weekend.

Daily necessities such as soap and matches showed slight increases and decreases, and the trend was relatively stable.

As for chemicals, metals, etc., although there were some rises and falls, because the original price has already been high, there has been no new price emergence.

The wholesale price index by purpose last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index by degree of processing last week is as follows:

Industrial and Commercial Trends

### Worries for the Import and Export Trade!

Although the exchange rate benchmark was raised again by the authorities last week (the 17th), whether the situation for the export industry has improved is still not optimistic.

On the 15th of this month, the pig bristle export industry went to the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee to petition, requesting a temporary suspension of foreign exchange settlement, due to the excessive difference between the exchange rate and the cost. On the 18th, the industry went to the Pissai Hotel on Central Road to hold an emergency meeting and decided to immediately dispatch representatives to the government to state the difficulties and request a change in the export settlement method.

On the 18th, the Import and Export Association of this city also held a general meeting of export group members. The conclusion was that the only way to improve the current export situation is to unconditionally open up foreign exchange and implement a trade chain system.

However, according to the persons in charge of the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee, they are constantly trying to promote assistance to the export industry. They also said that opening up foreign exchange is not yet the time, because there are too many constraints. If a fundamental solution is not sought, it will only cause adverse consequences. Therefore, the government has not considered this at present.

In this case, the authorities at present can only continue to adopt a "flexible exchange rate policy," and there is no talk of "opening up foreign exchange." However, if the "flexible exchange market price" is too far from the black market price, it will inevitably affect exports and reduce the government's foreign exchange income. Since the government's foreign exchange income is reduced, it can only be planned on "unnecessary" imported materials, that is, reducing the import of materials that the government deems "unnecessary." The "Circular No. 131" issued by the Central Bank and the Export Management Committee recently is proof of reducing the import of ordinary goods. The "Circular" stipulates that importers must deposit 50% of the foreign exchange amount of the license with the Central Bank at the market price of the day, converted into national currency, until the imported goods arrive.

This regulation is of course a major blow to the import industry. The Import and Export Association of this city received letters and telegrams from the Import and Export Associations of Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and other ports last Thursday, stating that this method of the authorities is sufficient to increase the cost of imported raw materials and greatly affect industrial production, so they unanimously expressed their opposition.

However, in the current situation, opposition is one thing, and whether opposition can take effect is another. A Tianjin dispatch published in a major newspaper in this city said it well, "After the announcement of the new import settlement method, everyone lost confidence in the government, as if the government had automatically declared the exhaustion of foreign exchange and the great devaluation of the legal tender, so most funds turned to gold and banknotes to preserve the value of the currency." Thus, following the southward relocation of textile factories, recently some larger import and export firms have also been relocating to the south, most of which are relocating to Hong Kong. The impact cannot be said to be small.

According to the Export Management Committee's news, the foreign exchange settlement of exports in the first half of this month is less than half of the settlement of exports last month. The southward relocation of import and export firms is all related to foreign exchange. If this matter is not properly resolved, it may form a large-scale southward flight of funds.

Following the "Crisis of National Industry and Commerce" discussed in the previous issue, we must again express our fear for the future of China's import and export trade!

### Currency and Finance

(1) Credit and Black Market Interest Rates

Although the credit situation in this city last week continued the tight trend since the previous week, it finally eased due to the arrival of funds from the north and the interior. Although national banks often showed a huge deficit due to the sale of materials and tax revenues, the credit situation in the market did not appear as tight as in the previous week because the banks often exchanged bills with commercial banks through interbank deposits or transfers. The fact that the exchange volume of the interbank direct exchange group has decreased is also related to this.

Generally speaking, the position within the industry is looser than outside the industry. Although interbank lending among banks and firms is still common, it is not hindered by the abundant supply. The cash supply is also loose due to the large number of arrivals from various places. The cash that banks and firms delivered to the Central Bank at night has been over 1.5 trillion in the past week.

According to financial circles, this round of credit tightening seems to have come to an end. After this week, a looser situation may emerge.

From Monday to Friday last week, the total deficit of national banks was 446.442 billion. If the fixed deposits of commercial banks in the Central Bank during the same period, totaling 251 billion, are excluded, the actual deficit of national banks was as large as 195.442 billion, an increase of more than 200 billion compared to the deficit in the same period last week.

As for the exchange results of banks and firms after the 60th, the total deficit in five days was more than 3.2 trillion, which is similar to the deficit in the same period last week, but the daily deficit seems to be decreasing.

The total deficit of foreign banks from Monday to Friday was 923.8 billion, a decrease of about 410 billion compared to the same period last week.

The black market interest rate last week was generally 33%, and those above 36% were not commonly seen, while those with 31.5% were quite common. The trend of the black market interest rate was from high to low, which is the opposite of the trend from low to high in the previous week. From this, it can also be seen that the tight credit situation has eased slightly. As for the off-exchange interest rate for securities, the highest on Wednesday and Thursday was 44 yuan for the buyers (equivalent to about 50%), and 40 yuan for the sellers (equivalent to 45%). On Friday, both sides dropped by 4 yuan, returning to the original level of Tuesday.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The domestic exchange rate last week, the Guangzhou exchange rate was 80 yuan on Monday, and then decreased to 50 yuan from Tuesday to Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate also decreased to 50 yuan by Tuesday, but continued to rise after Wednesday, and rose to 180 yuan by Friday.

The Chongqing exchange rate remained flat in the five days. The Wuhan exchange rate was 60 yuan on Monday, and decreased to 20 yuan by Wednesday. It rebounded to 50 yuan on Thursday and Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate was 70 yuan on Monday, and increased to 140 yuan on Friday.

Generally, the exchange rate last week took the middle of the week as a turning point. The exchange rate trend decreased at the beginning of the week, indicating that more funds flowed into this city from various places. After the middle of the week, the reverse flow of funds decreased because the credit situation in this city had gradually eased. However, the successive increases in the Tianjin exchange rate are sufficient to prove that the southward flow of funds from the north is still surging, which may be affected by the war.

The foreign exchange benchmark rate last week saw an increase after a long period of stability. The US dollar was increased to 474,000, an increase of 46%. The US-British exchange rate remained unchanged. The British pound was equivalent to 1,422,000 national currency per pound.

The Hong Kong exchange rate was only reported in the newspapers the next day, because the authorities feared stimulating public sentiment. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender was equivalent to 41 cents in Hong Kong dollars. The exchange rate was mixed on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, it was 46 cents. The market price of the Hong Kong dollar was 5.23 Hong Kong dollars on Monday, and then continued to rise to 5.38 Hong Kong dollars on Thursday.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, the credit situation was tight, and the opening was low. Yongsheng yarn was only 2,570 yuan. Then, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had been raised by about 40%, it suddenly rose to 2,715 yuan. Other stocks were stable, and the fluctuations throughout the day were narrow.

The next day, cash from the interior continued to arrive, the credit situation eased, and the external situation turned quiet. All stocks became firm and stable. Yongsheng yarn reached 2,720 yuan. Xinho was 960 yuan. Xinguang closed at 39.5 yuan. Jingfu was 20.5 yuan.

On Wednesday, the credit situation had eased, and the external situation was quiet. All stocks were hovering upwards. Yongsheng yarn approached the 3,000 yuan mark. Jingfu and Xinguang each rose by 30 cents and 80 cents. Tongyi and Xinho also rose by 30 to 40 yuan.

On Thursday, the national banks collected payments for yarn and sugar, and the deficit reached 1.5 trillion. The credit situation suddenly tightened. Yongsheng yarn declined in a roundabout way and barely stood at 2,800 yuan at closing. All stocks declined.

On Friday, funds from the north flooded in, and the credit tightening was coming to an end. People's minds were at peace. All stocks tended to be bullish. Yongsheng yarn exceeded the 2,900 mark before closing. Xinho was approaching the 1,000 yuan mark. Xinguang was 39.5 yuan. Jingfu was 20.20 yuan. The weekend continued this trend, and most stocks rose slowly.

Foreign stocks entered the market on Monday. Due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, people inevitably looked optimistic. After the opening, Yisha was 4.72 million yuan. Later, under the pressure of tight credit, the selling intentions were strong, and it finally declined, closing at 4.45 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.05 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 9.8 million yuan.

The trend on Tuesday was stable. Because the Hong Kong exchange rate did not fluctuate much and the credit situation was not so loose, the market did not break away from the consolidation. Yisha and Yinglian, etc., fluctuated very little.

The foreign stock market on Wednesday rose, because the Hong Kong exchange rate fluctuated again, the black market became firm again, the credit situation had eased, people's minds were bullish, and it rose sharply. Yisha soared to 5.17 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.75 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was approaching the 12 million yuan mark, all rising strongly.

On Thursday, it was said that the Hong Kong exchange rate had risen, and the credit situation tightened again, so there were many sales, and the market declined in a roundabout way. Yisha returned to 4.98 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.5 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 10.2 million yuan.

On Friday, the Hong Kong exchange rate decreased, and the price of financial items in the black market rose again. All stocks advanced uniformly. Yisha rose to 5.16 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.6 million yuan. Jardine Matheson was 11 million yuan.

At the weekend, the credit situation eased, and all stocks rose again. In particular, Yisha rose by more than 50% and was the most popular, with a total of 5.41 million yuan.

### The Ministry of Finance Comprehensively Studies Ways to Improve Overseas Remittances. Completely Inaccurate that Overseas Remittances are Decreasing Monthly.

[Report from our Nanjing correspondent on the 23rd] The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to attracting overseas remittances. At present, overseas remittance income is inevitably affected because the foreign exchange market price differs greatly from the black market exchange price. The most effective way to remedy this situation is to have the exchange price follow the black market price. However, doing so will cause the black market exchange price to continue to rise, which will drastically stimulate commodity prices and affect the lives of all citizens. Therefore, we have not dared to implement this hastily. The Ministry of Finance is currently doing its best to provide convenience to overseas Chinese and their families in terms of procedures and is urging the handling banks to improve as much as possible. For example, increasing the number of overseas remittance agencies in areas with many overseas Chinese, simplifying the procedures for remittances and withdrawals, pre-storing funds for paying overseas remittances in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places in the country, and delivering remittances to addresses have all achieved good results. As for how to increase overseas remittance income, protect the interests of overseas Chinese, increase the country's foreign exchange sources, and improve overseas remittance methods while also taking into account the principle of domestic price stability and economic stability, the Ministry of Finance is conducting a comprehensive study. The accurate statistics for overseas remittances in March and April of this year have not yet been finalized because the reports from the handling banks have not yet been submitted. The statement in the report that overseas remittance income has been decreasing monthly is completely inaccurate.

### Cherishing Others' Hunger and Drowning, Treasuring Every Minute and Second: Hunan University Faculty Council Urges Students to Return to Classes, Listing Four Points of Advantages and Disadvantages

[Our newspaper, Changsha, 23rd dispatch] After some students at Hunan University opposed the strike, a majority of students had returned to classes by the 22nd. The Faculty Council issued a public notice to all students, strongly urging them to prioritize their studies and return to classes immediately, stating: (1) For self-funded and partially-funded students, the university has advanced over 300 million yuan for the second half of May's food expenses amidst great difficulties, and efforts can also be made regarding scholarships. There is currently no risk of starvation, so there is no need to strike. (2) There is even less concern about starvation for publicly-funded students. If the reason for striking is to fight for discounted rice, the reality is the opposite, because after obtaining discounted rice, funds will only be distributed based on the discounted price, which would be counterproductive. (3) Many people are currently under pressure from the cost of living. Students should cherish others' hunger and drowning, treasure every minute and second, and concentrate on their studies. (4) If the marches and demonstrations across the river are exploited by malicious individuals, leading to accidents, regret will be futile, which is not something wise people would want."

(4) Number of graduates: 4,687,411 (3,544,567 boys, 342,844 girls), including 1,528,399 from central national schools, 2,592,669 from national schools, 51,228 from primary schools, and 54,225 from kindergartens.

(5) Number of teachers and staff: 880,555, including 277,124 in central national schools, 508,4414 in national schools, 92,485 in primary schools, and 2,502 in kindergartens.

(Explanation) (1) These statistics are based on the national education reports for the 35th academic year submitted by the provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Kang, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Ning, Xinjiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and Qing. Hubei and Sui were compiled based on materials from the 34th academic year due to non-reporting. Songjiang, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, Xing'an, Dalian, and Harbin were not included due to incomplete takeover. National primary schools are based on the 46 primary schools and attached early childhood classes in Xikang Yuejun. Overseas Chinese primary schools are based on materials from 353 schools, including the Danang Overseas Chinese Public Shuren Primary School, submitted by consulates in Vietnam, Burma, Siam, Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Perak, Selangor, Java, Sumatra, North Borneo, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, India, the United States, Canada, Cuba, the Beian Islands, Tahiti, Mauritius, South Africa, and the Northeast. (2) The reason for the decrease in numbers compared to the 34th academic year is that schools in northern Jiangsu were frequently closed due to the roaming of communist bandits. In Jiangxi, some schools were closed due to the reorganization of rural security and protection. Sichuan lacked materials from Chengdu and other county-level cities, as well as county and municipal normal school-affiliated primary schools. Shanxi only had materials from 13 counties and cities, including Taiyuan and Yuci. Rehe only had materials from 7 counties, including Chengde and Pingquan. Guizhou misunderstood the method of reorganizing national schools, and some schools were closed, thus reducing various figures.

### Shanghai Branch of the Education Society Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Current Educational Issues; Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ouyuan Huai, Liao Shicheng, and Others Attended

[Our newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Society held its first members' meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the editorial department of the Zhonghua Book Company on Macau Road to discuss current educational issues. Over sixty members attended, including Zhang Yi, Zhu Jingnong, Ouyuan Huai, Shu Xincheng, Liao Shicheng, Du Zuozhou, Li Ximou, Shen Yizhen, Chuantongxian, Xie Xunchu, Wang Yukai, Dong Renjian, Tai Shuangqiu, Yuan Zhe, Mo Zhongyi, Sun Daoyuan, Lu Cunhe, and Huang Jingsi. Shu Xincheng and Liao Shicheng co-chaired the meeting, reporting on the significance of the meeting and the society's affairs. The revised charter was then passed. Subsequently, discussions began on three major current educational issues: (1) The mutual influence of education and society; (2) The educational policies urgently needed in China; and (3) The self-cultivation of educators. Zhang Yi, Tai Shuangqiu, and others then elaborated on the original discussion outline.

Zhang You-san's Proposal

Mr. Zhang's proposed topic for discussion was the outline of the mutual influence of education and society, divided into theoretical and practical parts. The former explained the relative significance of society and education and broadly discussed the mutual influence of society and education in China since the implementation of the new school system. The latter provided detailed explanations on: (1) the changing Chinese society, (2) a cross-section of the current stage of Chinese society, (3) hovering on the edge of progress, (4) the impact on education, and (5) the contribution of education. In particular, the section on "the contribution of education" was very detailed in listing the bright and dark sides resulting from the implementation of the new education system. Members then engaged in a lively discussion, generally believing that the mismatch between current society and education is a remnant phenomenon of the scholar-official and education system. If no efforts are made to stop and improve this situation, the harm will intensify over time. A consensus emerged that it is necessary to increase production education and vocational education. It is especially hoped that the education administrative authorities will open up educational avenues and that education workers should form public opinion to urge the authorities to pay attention. Tai Shuangqiu discussed the new education policy in detail from six aspects: consolidating the foundation, broadening learning, practical application, public funding, salaries, and talent cultivation, as a good way for the government to win people's hearts, stabilize society, improve people's livelihoods, and consolidate constitutional governance.

Du Zuozhou's Suggestions

Finally, Du Zuozhou provided specific educational policies: (1) Central and local education administration should adopt a system of equal rights in the future; (2) Implement the provisions of Articles 159, 160, and 264 of the Constitution; (3) Political parties should withdraw from schools; (4) Respect teachers' rights and promote professor-led university governance; (5) Education administrative personnel should strive for professionalism and prevent politicians and bureaucrats from participating in education administration. The implementation methods are: (A) Educational legislative bodies, such as educational councils, should be established in educational administrative institutions at all levels; (B) Basic education should focus on civic training and production training; (C) Secondary schools should adopt a differentiated approach, focusing on various vocational training, and ordinary high schools should be divided into arts and sciences groups; University education halls should focus on the principle of selecting the best and improving standards. Excellent students from poor families should receive full public funding. As the time was too late, the issues could not be discussed in detail. The meeting decided to convene another meeting to discuss each topic specifically, so that a conclusion could be reached and submitted to the government for reference and adoption. After visiting the Zhonghua Book Company's library and editorial department, and screening children's educational films, the meeting adjourned at nearly 7:00 PM.

### Adopting a Self-Study System to Broaden the Path to Education

Tai Shuangqiu's Suggestions to the Government

[Our newspaper] Educator Tai Shuangqiu recently listed six points regarding the educational policies urgently needed in China, providing them to the new government after its establishment as a reference for governance. Among them, the policy of broadening learning is to open up avenues for education. He stated: "Affirm the principle that 'receiving education does not necessarily mean attending school.' Outside of the existing school system, establish a 'self-study system' to broaden the path to education so that the children of farmers, workers, and merchants do not have to leave their economic activities, and young people in employment do not have to leave their jobs, but can still study and graduate under the supervision and assessment of government offices." He also stipulated the following key points for the implementation of the "self-study system":

(1) Students register with the local government office or school, reporting the major they are studying or the stage of education they wish to complete. (2) The government or school establishes a guidance department to guide students in self-study. (3) The guidance department of the government office or school should guide students on what curriculum to follow, and procure the necessary books and stationery on their behalf. (4) Libraries, science museums, and other institutions in all public and private schools and educational organizations should be open to the public, and large cities should establish science museums, libraries, and other institutions. (5) Establish more radio broadcasting stations and widely set up receiving stations. University professors give lectures, experts broadcast publicly, and aerial teaching is conducted regularly. (6) Establish mobile education teams, utilizing surplus teachers to provide mobile teaching. (7) Establish "educational guidance stations," hire experts or utilize surplus teachers, set a specific time, and hold public lectures and science demonstrations in fixed locations, allowing people to attend and observe without charge. (8) Regularly hold examinations for a certain title or several types of academic programs, and grant credits to those who pass. (9) If the work students are engaged in is of the same nature as the major they are studying (such as a current primary school principal studying education), the performance of the work shall be assessed and credits awarded accordingly. (10) If a student is pursuing a certain academic degree and part of the practical work requires research in school, the government office or school may stipulate in the curriculum that research in school is required upon reaching a certain level, the length of the research period depending on the nature of the major. (11) Diplomas will be awarded when the academic program and credits earned meet the requirements, and there is no need to limit the number of years of study. (12) Students with excellent self-study results may be awarded scholarships or assisted with further education after graduation. (13) Current school students who must suspend their studies due to economic difficulties or other reasons may complete their studies in accordance with these implementation measures.

### The Post-War Soviet Chemical Industry

— Xie Tianbiao

Introduction

The Soviet Union's fourth five-year plan, from 1946 to 1950, is now entering its third year. It stipulates that after the completion of this five-year plan, the general industrial level should be increased by 50% compared to pre-war levels, and the chemical industry is, of course, no exception.

The objectives of the fourth five-year plan in the chemical industry mainly include two aspects: (1) to increase the production of general chemical products to cooperate with the progress of other industries; and (2) to achieve military self-sufficiency and national defense security.

Since 1946, in addition to actively repairing and expanding the old chemical plants that suffered from war damage, the Soviet government has also newly established many basic chemical plants, such as factories for acids, alkalis, and fertilizers. It is hoped that after the completion of these new factories, the manufacturing and self-sufficiency of consumer goods for people's livelihood will gradually expand. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not import machinery, raw materials, and consumer goods from the United States due to political differences. This is precisely because the finished products of these items are lacking in the Soviet Union, and the abnormal shortage of manpower, fuel, electricity, and building materials after the war makes the progress of the fourth five-year plan difficult. In order to overcome the difficulties, the Soviet government uses the inherent advantages of the industry in the occupied areas of Central Europe to supplement the lack of its domestic nutrition.

During the war, the Soviet government made every effort to promote the increased production of various chemicals such as synthetic ammonia, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphate fertilizer, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, calcium carbide, calcium phosphide, paint, and plastics. After the war, in addition to continuing to increase the production of the above-mentioned basic chemicals, the Soviet Union also plans to increase the production of synthetic gasoline, rubber, plastics, wine, oil refining by-products from coal tar, and natural gas. In addition, aniline dyes and medical drugs are also manufactured in large quantities.

Chemical Fertilizers

Increasing fertilizer production is one of the main goals of this five-year plan. It is estimated that in 1950, phosphate fertilizer production should be one time of the pre-war output, nitrogen fertilizer should be 0.8 times, and potassium fertilizer should be 0.3 times. In total, the planned total output of these three fertilizers in 1950 should be 5.4 million tons, of which phosphate fertilizer accounts for 4 million tons. The investment in fertilizer manufacturing in this five-year plan accounts for half of the total investment in the chemical industry, which shows its importance.

During this war, the Soviet Union's domestic industry suffered enormous losses from the war. According to estimates, the machinery for manufacturing light products lost nearly 50%, sulfuric acid equipment lost 77%, soda ash lost 83%, and pigments lost 88%. However, the Soviet government had already tried its best to move the near-western chemical equipment to the Ural and Moscow regions during the war so that the finished products were close to the market. The reason for this at the time was to use the manufactured fertilizers to apply to the agricultural areas in the region so that agricultural products such as cotton, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and oak trees can increase production. As a result of the application of fertilizers, agricultural products in 1946 had increased by 52% compared to 1945, and the production of agricultural products in 1947 can be expected to be even better than the previous year.

Synthetic Gasoline and Synthetic Rubber

This five-year plan intends to increase the production of synthetic gasoline, with a planned annual output of 900,000 tons. The reason is that although the Soviet Union is the second-largest oil producer in the world, due to the war, the oil fields in Maikop and Grozny have been frequently destroyed, and the Baku oil field, which is said to supply 70% of the country, was also automatically destroyed. The production of oil fields in the Volga and Ural regions has not been ideal, so increasing the production of synthetic gasoline is still necessary.

In view of the fact that there is existing equipment, talent, raw materials, and bituminous coal in the occupied areas, and the scarcity of coal in the country, and the difficulty of moving synthetic machinery, it was decided to resume work and production on the spot. In addition, the Donets coal and iron production area, which was severely damaged during the war, was restored (the Donets Basin is not only the only coal production center in the Soviet Union, but also has about 50% to 60% of the country's iron ore, about 20% of the country's pig iron and aluminum, and 25% of the country's electricity and other resources, so the restoration of this area is closely related to the chemical industry's revival in the entire Soviet Union).

The planned increase in the production of synthetic rubber in the Soviet Union will be one time of the previous plan, which is 38% of the total output of synthetic rubber in the world. The production of synthetic rubber in the Soviet Union began in 1928. At that time, due to the sharp increase in demand during the war, in addition to converting potatoes into alcohol as raw material for synthetic rubber, the production was actively expanded, and raw materials were also extracted from natural rubber trees.

In 1931, the Soviet government had established four synthetic rubber factories. After the completion of the second five-year plan, another four factories were built. During the implementation of the third five-year plan, there were already 18 synthetic rubber factories in operation and under construction when the war broke out. In 1938, it was estimated that more than 100,000 tons of synthetic rubber were produced annually by the polymerization of butadiene with metallic sodium. This method is based on the improved method of Lebedev. Butadiene is first produced from alcohol. In 1939, it was estimated that 2.8 tons of alcohol were needed to produce one ton of butadiene, which is twice as much as the amount required to produce butadiene from alcohol in 1928!

In view of the fact that the production of alcohol from food grains affects food supplies, the Soviet Union has now switched to using acetylene, natural gas, and petroleum as raw materials. After this, the per capita consumption of rubber by the Soviet people is only 0.37 pounds, which is far from the 9.9 pounds consumed by each person in the United States at the same time. It can be seen that the Soviet Union still needs to work harder to increase rubber production compared to the United States!

Artificial Fiber

In the previous five-year plans of the Soviet Union before the war, emphasis was placed on the production of natural fibers. The artificial fiber industry is a new emerging industry after the war. It is estimated that the planned output in 1950 will be four to five times that of the pre-war fiber industry. With 600 million acres of forests in the Soviet Union, there is no need to worry about the raw materials for artificial fiber manufacturing. In addition, bark and branches can also be used as raw materials for alcohol, acetone, sulfuric acid derivatives, rosin, and turpentine.

Natural Gas

There are more than 200 known natural gas reserves in the Soviet Union. Due to the urgent need for fuel during the war, exploration was accelerated. In 1944, two lines of natural gas pipelines, 105 miles long, from Buguruslan to the Karpachev factory were completed. Recently, the completion of the pipeline from the Saratov gas field to Moscow is also 530 miles long. Others under design include a 300-mile gas pipeline from Dahava in western Ukraine to Kyiv, and a 136-mile gas pipeline from Estonia to Leningrad, which is urgently awaiting burial. If it can be completed, it will also be a major construction project.

Most of the natural gas in the Soviet Union is obtained from the coal in the coal tar fields. This method of producing natural gas can save the cost of coal transportation and ash accumulation. The method is to mix hot air with oxygen and press it into the tunnels to obtain natural gas.

Plastics and Oils

The Soviet Union's plastics industry received special attention during the war. In 1947, there were already 18 plastic factories in Ukraine alone. In 1950, the production of dyes and plastics could increase by 30% compared to pre-war levels, with an output of 43,000 tons.

The Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the oil industry. There are often improvements and reports from agricultural experiment fields in various places on the planting and production of sesame and sunflowers, and there has been significant progress. Most of the oil refined from sunflowers is hardened and used to make margarine and soap. In 1950, it could reach an annual production of 870,000 tons of soap. Compared to 1940, the annual production of soap was only 800,000 tons, which is an improvement. (To be continued)

### The Art of Alchemy

— Bao Zhongqi

At the Federal Atomic Energy Research Institute in Oak Ridge (Tennessee), the dream of ancient alchemists has recently been realized - artificial gold has been made. Atomic piles are used as the Philosopher's Stone. After a series of reactions, 24-karat pure gold is produced (note: karat does not indicate weight but purity).

However, the strangest characteristic of artificial gold is that no matter how well it is preserved, it will transform into other elements in less than a week. Because of this, "radioactive gold" has increased its value because it has made a great contribution to medicine, and sixty-one patients have been fortunate enough to be cured by it.

However, making artificial gold is not a shortcut to getting rich, because the raw material is even more precious platinum. However, its significance is vast, showing the omnipotence of science, and also establishing the important position of isotopes.

Although there are only ninety-six elements in the periodic table today, the discovery of isotopes has exceeded seven hundred. The same elements have the same chemical properties but different physical properties. Its development has contributed to the invention of the atomic bomb and has also helped the success of artificial gold. We can safely handle uranium 238, but uranium 235 can explode. It can be seen that some isotopes are stable, while others change in an instant, even the iron or sulfur we are most familiar with.

If seven or eight hundred isotopes are arranged in a table, it will look very complicated, but if we study it carefully, we can see that these ever-changing elements are actually only related to two factors: one is the positively charged proton (or positron) discovered in 1886; and the other is the completely electrically neutral neutron, whose properties were not fully discovered until 1932. The entire universe is composed of these two "particles."

As a result, the artificial isotope has also been successful, because the number of protons affects the position of the element in the periodic table and its properties (chemical and physical properties). For example, hydrogen is one proton, helium has two protons, and so on up to the most recently discovered element 96 - curium. Not only that, but the sum of the number of protons and neutrons determines the type of isotope.

To prove this principle, we can do a simple demonstration: Suppose you have a silver coin hidden in your pocket and work next to a cyclotron. After a while, a small amount of cadmium will be found in the silver coin, which is a metal that was not added to the silver coin in the mint. The fact is this: The silver in the coin is Ag107 - including forty-seven protons and sixty neutrons; after receiving a neutron released by the cyclotron, it becomes the isotope Ag108, which is a radioactive element that emits an electron (Beta ray), turning a neutron in the element into a proton, thus producing one - Ag108, which has one more proton than Ag107.

The progress of science lies only in being able to control the speed of radioactivity and not let it increase and decrease on its own over tens of thousands of years. Although radioactivity remains the same, the atomic impact device shortens the experiment time, allowing scientists to realize facts that they thought were impossible to study.

By applying these principles, new elements have been embodied, and artificial gold has also been successful. The question only lies in how scientists today will use existing achievements to make some practical contributions?

### You Can Learn While You Sleep

— Tong Gao

Learning some things is painful, like languages, multiplication tables, Morse code, etc. Now there is hope that this pain can be relieved. There is a machine that can teach you while you sleep. It was invented by Max Sherover, President of the Lingua-Phone Institute of America.

This machine is not absurd. In fact, after two years of testing at the University of North Carolina, psychologists there declared that this sleep-learning program was successful.

Sherover's machine is actually a combination of a phonograph, a record player, and a pillow microphone. Psychologist Charles R. Elliott selected fifteen unrelated words and recorded their sounds on a disc.

The fifteen words were: boy, egg, speak, run, art, not, Mr., foot, bag, row, ice, out, age, box, eat. Professor Elliott selected forty students with normal hearing and began his sleep teaching.

In each test, twenty students were allowed to sleep undisturbed, while the other twenty students had a microphone placed under their pillow after falling asleep. The microphone was then connected to the record player, which played the above words at regular intervals, repeating them thirty times in total. The professor used an electroencephalograph to prove that they were indeed asleep. The electroencephalograph is an instrument that records brain waves. The brain waves of a sleeping person are different from those of an awake person.

After three hours of sound sleep, all forty students were awakened, and a list of these words was given to them to read for a while. Then, they were asked to silently recite the fifteen words as much as possible. As a result, the twenty students who had received Sherover's sleep teaching quickly recited the words. As for the twenty students who slept undisturbed, they showed very poor performance.

### Islands of the Pacific

— Jun Mei

The islands of the Pacific Ocean are numerous, and their distribution is extremely wide. Some of the smaller ones are merely dots on the map, identified only by a name, while the majority are largely unnamed islands with only a small number of inhabitants. Even in the Philippines, there are more than seven thousand islands. Many other areas are similar. Thus, it is no exaggeration to say that the Pacific contains "countless" islands. Most of these islands are small and difficult to find. However, there are also quite a few large islands, even continental in size. For example, New Guinea is the second largest island in the world after Greenland, with an area of 330,000 square miles, approximately 25 times the size of Taiwan and 23 times the size of Hainan Island.

It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of islands in the Pacific Ocean, as a single atoll is often composed of more than a dozen small islands. According to recent expert surveys, there are 2,650 major islands in the Pacific, with countless minor islands. The Tuamotu Group is an example of such a group of small islands. The local language meaning is "A Cloud of Islands," which vividly describes their abundance. The larger islands number about eighty, while the smaller ones are too numerous to count. The total area of all the islands, however, is only 330 square miles. There is no satisfactory way to classify the island groups of the Pacific. Regardless of the principle used, such as political divisions, climatic differences, distribution of flora and fauna, or geological structure, there are always drawbacks. The current general groupings are quite勉强 (forced). A reasonable classification should be based on geological history and animal life, and such research would be very interesting.

However, the most common method of grouping is based on the distribution of indigenous peoples since historical times. The many islands located east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea are inhabited by short, dark-skinned people and are collectively known as Micronesia. The islands inhabited by black people are known as Melanesia, including New Guinea and extending east to the Fiji Islands. In the central Pacific, where there are the most islands and the widest distribution, it is called Polynesia. The inhabitants have yellow-brown skin and beautiful features and are renowned navigators. Their distribution stretches from New Zealand in the south to the Hawaiian Islands in the north, and east to Easter Island, covering the widest area.

In addition, in the western Pacific, along the Asian continent, there are also many islands, including Hainan Island and Taiwan Island of China, the Ryukyu Islands, and further north to the Japanese archipelago, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. In the northeastern Pacific, the most important islands are the Aleutian Islands, which connect to the Alaskan Peninsula. Furthermore, far away in the eastern Pacific, straddling the equator north and south, are the Galapagos Islands, about 500 miles from Ecuador (also known as the Equatorial Nation).

In the southwestern Pacific, there are several large islands, namely Borneo in the southern Philippines, and further south, Java and Sumatra, along with many islands belonging to the Dutch East Indies. These islands have all had a glorious history in the development of the Pacific.

Finally, Oceania refers to the ocean area and the islands of the southwestern Pacific, including Australia, the largest island or the smallest continent in the world.

### On Sucking Boils

— Ji Yong

Although the doctrines of the Legalists are cruel and ungracious, they are somewhat in accordance with the facts. The Chinese call a penetrating and incisive statement cruel because it is too unforgiving. The "Preparation Within" chapter says:

"A good doctor sucks the wounds of others and drinks their blood, not out of kinship, but for profit; therefore, a cartwright hopes for the wealth and nobility of others, and a coffin maker hopes for the early death of others. It is not that the cartwright is benevolent and the coffin maker is a thief; but if people are not noble, carts will not sell; if people do not die, coffins will not be bought: the feelings are not hatred of people, but the profit lies in the death of people."

Isn't this a penetrating statement? Mozi also said: "Are arrow makers not more benevolent than armor makers? Arrow makers only fear not hurting people, while armor makers only fear hurting people, so the art must not be carefully chosen." The meaning is similar, and the responsibility is attributed to the choice of art, but in fact, this statement does not hold. If everyone chooses to be an armor maker and not an arrow maker, does it mean that no one will care when people die? By this reasoning, pharmacies, doctors, and even sanitation facilities are all unnecessary. Therefore, Han Fei's statement is more reasonable.

If so, it is in great conflict with Kropotkin's Mutual Aid. Kropotkin believes that the progress and existence of society depend on human mutual aid; there is no view of utility in it; however, if we think carefully, we also know that the purpose of mutual aid is mutual benefit, which is also what Mozi called universal love. Ants and aphids, one fulfilling the responsibility of protection, and the other fulfilling the responsibility of providing nectar for others to suck, isn't that the case? Therefore, mutual benefit is not to be criticized. If you want everyone to devote themselves to feeding hungry tigers and fulfilling the great vow of a Bodhisattva, that is the highest ideal of saviors and sages, but to seek it from ordinary people is simply to see that it cannot be done.

A society where everyone benefits each other and achieves equilibrium is a world of peace. I think the character for peace, "平," can be interpreted in this way by its literal meaning. When things are not balanced, they make a sound, which has been the case since ancient times, and even more so today. Therefore, Western political philosophy is Give and Take, and the most taboo is killing the chicken to get the egg. This is something that everyone easily understands, but unfortunately, they know it but do not do it, which makes the world forever in turmoil. Whether humanity is foolish or wise, it is difficult to understand.

I think the reason is nothing more than planning for oneself, and forgetting that planning for others is planning for oneself. The Confucian tradition is to respect the ruler and maintain the existing social order, which is also a kind of selfishness because only in this way can one have a stable life and rise to prominence. Maintaining the entire social order is certainly not bad, but 耐其末流 (in the end) they only remember their own rise to prominence and forget society. Moreover, the gentry are the true owners of Chinese sovereignty, and their realistic position makes them shortsighted, thinking that "in today's world, who but me can do it!" Thus, enjoying and exploiting are taken for granted, and bestowing benefits on the people is seen as a sacrifice and compassion. We see that the gentry in the late Ming Dynasty were all "tigers wearing hats" as described in the Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Dong Qichang was a learned and sensible man, and even became a Grand Secretary of the Inner Cabinet, yet he dared to kidnap men and seize women, arousing popular resistance, and even destroying houses and burning homes. His offense to public anger can be seen. Notes record that Fang Bao, a master of the Tongcheng School in the Qing Dynasty, was also somewhat like this. It seems that writing is one thing, and behavior is another, which cannot but make people deeply sigh.

Originally, Confucius also aimed to gain the ruler's position, intending to realize his ideals, so he did not hesitate to run into walls in various countries. Unexpectedly, what followed was a cheap Confucian who "straightened his clothes and straightened his face," and whose development must be "preserving his whole body and protecting his wife and children." If he goes further, he will be a donkey-like barking dog. Choosing means without regard to the end has already become the tradition of scholars. Try to count the rulers of each dynasty, either combined with relatives of the emperor or colluded with eunuchs. As far as the disaster of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the pure current of the scholar-gentlemen, the final dependent on the 賽憲 (bestowing power), was not it the relative of the emperor? Recent studies by Chen Yinque show that the factional struggles in the Tang Dynasty were the struggles of the eunuch factions. Even virtuous people like Li Wenrao could not avoid this; as for Li Hongzhang and Yuan Shikai in the Qing Dynasty, and the 鬧然 (rambunctious) in the Ming Dynasty, they need not be discussed; sometimes, outside of relatives and eunuchs, they even collude with enemies and foreign races, or they are veterans of five dynasties, shameless. Which one is not the achievement of the Confucian elders? From this point of view, the shamelessness of officials is the shame of the country, and it is true at all times and in all places.

If ritual is lost, seek it in the countryside. In fact, Chinese farmers are not bad, and even if they are bad, they are forced by the scholar-officials and gentry. As the saying goes, officials force the people to rebel, which is still sought from the迹象 (signs). Officials and gentry are the models of the people, that is, the life purpose of most people. Those above like something, those below will like it even more. Bad role models have long been established in the atmosphere, so how can we blame the villagers for stealing chickens and scolding dogs, adultery, evil, and theft? Recently, I heard someone say that China should not run mass education. All those who do bad things are literate. Although the words are extreme, there is a reason! If the scholars do not change their style of sucking boils and licking hemorrhoids, or if mass education is run for a few more decades, it is not known whether the nation will eventually fall.

### Three Dishes to Accompany Wine

— Chen Yixian

Oil-fried shrimp is a good dish to accompany wine. It is available in all seasons, but this thing also has its season. In early summer—around May—when eating fried shrimp, there is a bit of red in the head, about the size of a red bean, peeking out of the shell. This is shrimp fat, which is the most delicious, with the beautiful name of Zhuzhu Cherry. It is now in season, and old foodies must know it.

When the peach blossoms bloom in spring, a kind of crow flies here, and it leaves in a few days. It is also one of the seasonal birds. It has a long beak, colorful feathers, and a short tail, and is called the Peach Blossom Chicken, also known as the Wheat Pecker. Its head is very good. It is fried crispy in heavy oil, cooked with sugar and vinegar, and is extremely delicious with wine. Or use ten birds with half a catty of good leg meat, stewed with old wine, soy sauce, and spices, and simmered in a 　crock, then you don't have to ask for anything else for days of drinking.

Crab is the most delicious thing. I think drunken crab is best eaten 　with wine. The method is to place peppercorns and salt in the navel of the crab, use the best old wine and vinegar, add a little sugar, tie the crab tightly, place it in a jar, and store it in a dark place. It can be opened and eaten soon. Each time you eat it, you must not use a light, as the crab will become sandy if you use a light. This has been tested and is always effective. There is a song about making drunken crabs, which I have recorded below:

Twenty round navel crabs, no pointy ones, half a catty of good vinegar, half a catty of salt, four taels of sugar, 　a catty and a half of wine, eat until the second month of next year.

All delicious foods have their season. For example, 　pomfret and yellow fresh fish are in early summer, hairtail is in early spring, chicken and duck are available all year round, but chicken is best in spring and duck is best in autumn, the so-called spring chicken and August duck (eighth month of the lunar calendar).

### The Poet Yang Yunshi

— Qian Dacheng

The poet Yang Yunshi participated in General Wu Peifu's military staff as a famous son of an official, serving as secretary general, and became famous throughout the country. He claimed to be Yang Qi of Jiangdong, Yunshi was his courtesy name, with the alternative name Yewang and the formal name Chaoqing. He was from Changshu, a successful candidate in the Nanyuan examination of the Qing Guangxu Renyin year, and an official in the Ministry of Posts and Communications, as well as the Consul-General in Singapore. His father was Yang Chongyi, the Left Censor-in-Chief.

Yunshi first married a granddaughter of Li Hongzhang, and then married a Ms. Xu, known as Mrs. Xiake. Xu then died, and Yunshi was about to follow 　General on an expedition. The day after Xu's funeral, he abandoned his family and followed, hence the line "Pitifully, on the thirteenth night of September, the first night of death and separation," which was widely recited for a time. In his later years, he was attached to Di Meinan, adding fragrance to his writing with a beauty by his side, not lonely at all. His "Collection of Poems from the Jiangshan Wanli Tower" has many songs in the style of Changqing, and the five-character poems must imitate Du Shaoling, with overflowing talent, unable to stop writing. During the Dingchou Incident (1937), he fled to Hong Kong. His tragic songs were generous, and people called them poetic history. He was once summoned to Sichuan because rumors were circulating that General Wu would come out of seclusion. Yunshi strongly stated that General Wu would never recognize the traitors as his fathers. When General Wu was forced to commit suicide, Yunshi composed poems to mourn him, with words of blood and tears, and later died in Hong Kong. Yunshi served General Wu with utmost sincerity and integrity. I once saw Yunshi in a teahouse talking about Wu, always referring to him as "Lord" instead of by name, and his attitude was sincere and solemn, as if referring to a monarch and father. Wu looked at him with favor, and the two were as happy as fish and water in their lives.

Yunshi once climbed the Liaodong city in heavy snow after drinking wine, composing twelve poems, with weighty words, tragic and dripping, still his remaining matter. Here are four of them: "The horses are circling, the bows are bent, the alfalfa is fat, the golden soup is great for starting a war; the snowflakes are as white as the elm leaves on the mountain, not shining on the golden cup but shining on the iron armor." "The Central Plains are being chased, and the whole country is empty, the border soldiers are exhausted and re-bending their bows. How many yellow-faced white bones are there? All are in the setting sun of Yingzhou." "The affair of the nine princes gathering is in vain, and the three points can still calm the flames of war; the river does not limit the competition of the south wind, and the cuckoo cries outside the Jin Bridge." 　"Layered 　beautiful wine, drink a thousand cups, the sun sets, and clear songs want to shake the chest, drunk, not forgetting the atmosphere of the customs, the jade person helps to see Lulong." The last hero and heroine are both there, just like Gong Ding'an's poem, "For fear that Liu Lang's heroic spirit will 　, roll up the curtains and wash your face to the Yellow River."

In his days in the countryside, Yunshi first lived in Xuyuan Garden, and then lived in Jiuwanwei. Plum blossoms were planted all over the hall, with no other trees. On New Year's Day, the hall was always hung with a large "福" (fortune) character written by Empress Dowager Cixi, for offering at the incense table,盛陳設 (grandly arranged), even after the Republic of China, which was inevitable with the habits of a remnant of the Qing Dynasty. However, his person was particularly emotional, truly the true color of a poet. His son, Qianqing, was also known in the art world for his refinement and elegance. Thus, Yunshi was truly the son of a famous father and the father of a famous son.

### For Three Months, He Did Not Know the Taste of Meat

— Yushan

"Confucius heard the Shao music, and for three months he did not know the taste of meat." Confucius heard the famous music and would forget the taste of pork for three months, which is really amazing! I don't think it should be explained like this. A New Account of Tales of the World says, "Silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat." What is the reason? His answer is, "It is getting closer to nature." In theory, the qin and zither are not as good as the xiao and flute, and the xiao and flute are not as good as singing; because singing is the most natural. So Mei Lanfang's singing is the best. Shao music is silk and bamboo, and in theory, it is not as good as the beauty of singing, but as an exception, it is better than all the songs sung, the so-called "meat sound." After Confucius heard it, he did not want to listen to people's songs. The so-called three months means a long time. The Analects says that Yan Hui did not violate benevolence for three months, which is an example. The ancients referred to three years and three months, etc., mostly as a majority or a long period of time. It can be seen that after Confucius heard the Shao music, he was reluctant to listen to people's songs for a long time. Saying that he forgot about the cold pork that was cut square and square, I'm afraid it's not necessarily true? Otherwise, the butcher shop owner and the music teacher would be at odds, and "passing by the butcher's door and eating heartily" would not be necessary. Just go listen to music.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A knowing bitter smile often contains more of a knowing than a knowing smile.

If there is still oil in the lamp, the extinguished fire will still light up again.

There is only one person in the world who will never leave you: your own shadow.

Although a trackless tram does not have tracks, it still has its route.

### 

I have also heard that when the capital city authorities hosted the female representatives, they delivered a novel speech on the spot, saying: "The world situation has been made so bad by men that it must be changed. Women should take the place of men, and we can hope for improvement." I also heard that a certain dean also gave a sympathetic resonance at a banquet, condemning men and praising women. This seems to be a tactful and pleasant remark on a social occasion, but it actually contains a considerable amount of understanding. In all countries around the world, national affairs have always been led by men. Even in Europe and America, where women's rights are open, although they are more free than the old slave-like women in Asia, and women are engaged in society, not limited to the family kitchen, their participation in politics is still a guest position, and military affairs and diplomacy are more like the exclusive rights of men. In general, the male monopoly of "national affairs" and the monopoly of "great power" is indeed a common lament in all directions, which has been the case since ancient times. The results of the monopoly, the distant and trivial ones are not worth listing, only the two world wars in the last thirty years, the mountains of corpses and the seas of blood, the rain of bullets and the smoke of gunpowder, destroying humanity and destroying the universe, are truly "exhausting the bamboo of Nanshan Mountain, writing endless crimes; raising the waves of the East Sea, and not exhausting the flow of evil." A history of human sin can be directly asserted as caused by men, and Womankind has nothing to do with it, does not bear the responsibility, but suffers the most. Therefore, regardless of whether "women replacing men" can be realized, and even more unnecessary to predict the achievements of women replacing men, there is no doubt that men should step down and cede power. (Editor's note: Hilaire Belloc, a famous British writer, also once advocated that wives should organize the cabinet and govern the country.)

### Collected Jottings on Painting Orchids by Yun Jian (Part 2)

— Bai Jiao

Green Clouds

Someone asked, "What makes a good orchid painting?" Yun Jian said, "Don't worry about making it good at first." The person said, "If one is capable, where should one start with the ancient masters?" Yun Jian said, "Who did the ancients learn from?" The person said, "How does one achieve spirit?" Yun Jian said, "By doing what comes naturally."

Four-Stroke Orchid

One day, Yun Jian was in a state of wooden stillness, deeply savoring the pleasure of wine. A Chong cleaned the inkstone and asked for fine ink. A Yi also came and grabbed my arm, so I smiled and got up to paint this great work.

One stroke more is too much, one stroke less is too little. Only when you use all your strength can you see its spirit.

Wind Orchid

In calligraphy, from the clerical script onwards, there is no finger technique. In dividing strokes, pausing, and flicking, finger technique gradually becomes apparent beyond wrist strength. In the way of orchids, finger technique is often seen, which is appropriate for their posture. This is slightly different from calligraphy.

Side-by-Side Orchids

Two sons, two daughters, one husband, one wife. Xiang Ping's wish is fulfilled, traveling east and west.

Orchid

The Yue maiden discussed swordsmanship with Goujian, saying, "I did not learn it from anyone, but suddenly possessed it." This word "suddenly" is wonderful! If one can understand "suddenly" when painting orchids, it is precisely not "suddenly."

Inscribing on Spoon Mustard Greens

Yun asked the layman to finish painting this, and after pondering, I wrote two lines: "I lie slightly drunk, the white sun slanting, for how many years have I watched dragons and snakes on the rivers and seas?" My wife laughed and glared, saying, "That's just a drunkard's talk, what does it have to do with this?" The layman continued to write: "Who pities a petal of spoon mustard greens, originally from the home of a recluse in Jiangdong." She said, "Always the demeanor of a poor scholar." The layman said, "This is precisely what's good, no need to labor over white hair!" Ha ha.

Orchid

In the lonely spring lamplight, I hold the brush to paint the weeping, wind-like appearance of Xiang flowers, wanting to send them to someone, but I feel it is better not to send them.

Mountain Orchid

Not yet time to leave the mountain, not yet time to leave the mountain, definitely not leaving the mountain.

Potted Orchid

My youngest daughter, A Yi, who is eight years old, came back from reading and watched me paint orchids. She suddenly said, "Father's paintings are always bad." I said, "They will be good in the future." A Yi said, "Worse and worse!" I said, "Bad is good." A Yi ran away, saying, "Fool!"

Years ago, A Chong said I "didn't resemble" (orchids), and this year A Yi said I was "not good." They are truly a good pair of sisters. When they get married in the future, they must not ask their paralyzed father for paintings.

Orchid and Rock

A guest saw that Yun Jian's inscriptions on his orchid paintings were often self-praising. He unrolled this scroll and said, "Who can compare?" Yun Jian said, "Below Shan Tao, above Wei Shu." The guest did not understand what he meant, and after the guest left, he wrote it down.

Fragrant Orchid and Iris in Bloom

An ancient person said, "Orchids are beauties, Dong (Zhongshu) is a famous scholar." Now that I make them grow together among moss and rocks, sharing the same place, I am like Cao Qiu.

A Clump of Orchids

For a thousand years of excellence, virtue alone is important. I imagine Yu Chi's jade chest is free of old things, and should be as bright and clear as this.

Orchid

In the past, when I painted orchid masterpieces at Chen Dongqiao's place, they were highly praised. Looking at them today, they are at best high-ranking in the second tier of those who crossed the river (after the fall of the Jin Dynasty). Yun Jian has this fortune, claiming to be like Wang A Gua's calligraphy in the Sanxi Hall.

Valley Orchid

Traces hidden, name known. Who destroys, who praises? Originally in the mountains, deep in the white clouds. Orchid

One wrong move, the whole game is lost. This one move is not the first move. A failed stroke in painting orchids ruins the entire paper, but this one stroke is precisely the first stroke. Learning the calligraphy of Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi is also like this. One failed stroke jumps out from the paper and stabs directly into the eye. Liu Lingyan said he did not understand Zhang Maoxian (Zhang Hua), truly, I also cannot understand myself.

Orchid

Intentional or unintentional, resembling orchids or not, forgetting emotions and skill, the joy lies beyond the rules.

Orchid

No one cares about my state, nor whether I intend to help or not. Bai Jiao's orchid paintings are just so-so. Mountain Orchid

Mr. Bai Jiao's smell of alcohol is very bad, his orchid paintings are very good.

Mountain Orchid

Since there are no orchid growers in the world, I still plant them in the mountains of Jiangnan.

Orchid

Hold the wrist high, the palm flexible, the fingers alive, the brush has lightness and heaviness, the strength is even!

In the clear morning, grinding a spoonful of ink, spreading the paper and stretching the hair (of the brush), there is naturally the momentum of light troops pursuing and returning.
