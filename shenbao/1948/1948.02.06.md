### The Legislative Yuan Decides to Return the First Half-Year's General Budget Bill for Review; Postal and Telecommunications Price Increase Approved with Supplementary Procedures

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget bill at its regular meeting on the 5th and decided to return it to the joint committee of five committees for review, with specific suggestions, for discussion at the general meeting on the 12th. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan discussed the Executive Yuan's proposal to supplement the legislative procedure for the postal and telecommunications price increase. The members agreed that the Executive Yuan's illegal conduct should be corrected and resolved to approve the measure, but with a statement that future postal and telecommunications price increases must be handled according to procedures and not be arbitrarily changed. Finally, the proposal submitted by Liu Zhiping (see separate article) was amended and passed.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan held its first regular meeting after resuming sessions this year on the morning of the 5th to discuss the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year. President Sun Ke presided, with Xu Kan, Director of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun in attendance. First, Liu Ke, Chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, reported on the results of the joint committee review on the 4th, stating roughly: "The preparation of the general budget should originally be based on the policy direction. However, because constitutional government is imminent, and the current transitional government cannot formulate the policy direction for this year, the budget for the first half of the year is based on and supplemented by the budget of the previous year. The preliminary budget is 337,148 billion yuan for revenue and 369,438 billion yuan for expenditure. However, due to the need for mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the increase in national defense expenses, and the adjustment of salaries for civil and military personnel, the items in the previous year's budget are no longer suitable. Moreover, because the figures are too large to be included, the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics divides the general budget for the first half of this year into ordinary and special departments. The revenue of the ordinary department comes from regular taxes, and the expenditure is also regular expenditure. The budget for this department can be balanced. The special department is mostly for extraordinary expenditure and the needs of suppressing the rebellion, such as national defense expenses, which are listed as two-thirds, while the other one-third is listed in the ordinary expenditure department.

The ordinary revenue and expenditure are both 234,551,439,700,000 yuan. For the special budget revenue, the Ministry of Finance is confident of 148,775 billion yuan, and the expenditure is 660,712,615,200,000 yuan. The shortfall is listed as debt income in the revenue department before a method of compensation is found.

The total expenditure of the ordinary and special departments is 902,264,005,490,000 yuan, and the revenue is 383,326,439,700,000 yuan. The shortfall between revenue and expenditure reaches 518,937,615,200,000 yuan, which has been listed as debt income in the special department. The shortfall accounts for about 60 percent. After review by the State Council and special committees, the revenue side added one-year stamp duty, customs duties, direct taxes, commodity taxes, mine taxes, surplus materials from the U.S. military, received enemy and puppet materials, state-owned business profits, the sale price of Japanese reparations materials, and the sale of state-owned enterprises, totaling an increase of 200,082.53 billion yuan. The Ministry of Finance declared that the increased amount could be achieved if there were no unexpected changes, and the original listed revenue was 583,408.969,700,000 yuan. On the expenditure side, 20 billion yuan was added under the living allowance reserve item, 40 billion yuan was added under the Ministry of National Defense's management item, and other items were also slightly adjusted.

The adjusted result is the figures listed in the document finally compiled by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review as follows: Ordinary budget: 16 revenue items, 29 expenditure items, each amounting to 266,151.188,900,000 yuan. Special budget: 9 revenue items, amounting to 317,257.780,800,000 yuan, debt income amounting to 379,357.034,400,000 yuan, and 11 expenditure items, amounting to 696,614.815,200,000 yuan.

The total expenditure of the ordinary and special departments is 962,766,000,041,000 yuan, and the revenue is 583,408.969,700,000 yuan, accounting for about 61 percent of the total expenditure.

As a result of the discussion of the above case, it was decided to return it for review after the administrative authorities provided a policy explanation."

### Zhang Qun Attends Legislative Yuan Meeting to Explain Three Major Expenditures in the First Half-Year's General Budget

After Mr. Liu's report, Premier Zhang explained that since constitutional government was imminent, the State Council had decided that the current government was transitional and could not formulate a policy direction on behalf of the government after the implementation of the constitution. It would still use the old ones from last year, so the budget also adopted a method of extension, with slight corrections compared to the previous year. There are three major expenditures in the general budget:

Military Expenses: The budget of last year saw troop reductions of 3 million people after May, and after the order to mobilize to suppress the rebellion, military expenses stopped shrinking and returned to the original budget. Enriching the 20th Army Group increased expenditures greatly, and it also accounts for a considerable amount in this year's budget.

Living Allowances: This is to seek equality in the treatment of civil and military personnel and to adjust salaries according to the cost of living index. This expenditure accounts for more than 630 billion yuan in the general budget.

Educational Expenses: According to the constitution, educational expenses should account for 15 percent of the central budget. The budget for this transitional period should not deviate too far from the constitutional provisions, so it is included at about 13 percent, making it easier to adjust in the future. Due to the increase in these three budget items, the expenditure is so large today, and the difference is quite large. Other items have to be tightened, and most are only enough to maintain the status quo. This is certainly not what the government wants, but it is also inevitable. Last year, the Ministry of Finance's revenue was about 70 billion yuan. The budget for the first half of this year lists more than 580 billion yuan, an increase of more than tenfold. The burden on the people has also increased greatly. The 39 percent shortfall in the expenditure portion still needs to be resolved through tax revenue and borrowing. To avoid being affected by prices, most budget items have been relaxed. However, based on past experience, even so, it may still be difficult to achieve the expected monthly targets during implementation.

### To Reform the Monetary System, It is First Necessary to Stabilize the Monetary Base

At this point, Zhang spoke about the monetary system issue. He said: When the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government submitted the budget to the State Council, it attached a major recommendation, that is, to reform the monetary system, strictly control materials, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Only then can financial revenue be truly and accurately determined. The National Political Council has also urged the government to reform the monetary system as soon as possible, and public opinion is also advocating this. However, analyzing the current situation, on the one hand, the suppression of the rebellion is underway, military needs are huge, and expenditures cannot be reduced. On the other hand, the Communists are destroying and plundering everywhere, production is shrinking, transportation is blocked, prices are soaring, and inflation is rampant. Under these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to raise the 580 billion yuan under the revenue item. It is impossible to determine financial revenue. Therefore, the basic problem is how to establish a foundation that makes the currency tend to stabilize, and then we can engage in sorting out or reforming the monetary system to complete it smoothly, and we must ensure its continued stability to ensure the people's livelihood. The main key to this basic problem lies in balancing the budget or reducing the expenditure gap, and at least ensuring that revenue does not decrease. For this reason, at the end of last month, there were ten measures to reform finance, economy, and finance. The fifth item of the measures clearly lists the goal of stabilizing currency value. The first three items can be implemented when executing the budget. Others have already been implemented or are being implemented to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. (The questioning of the Legislative Yuan members is published in the special column on the left corner.)

### The Executive Yuan Approves Partial Amendments to the Water Conservancy Portion of the Economic Program Implementation Measures at the Regular Meeting of the National Economic Commission

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The National Economic Commission held its 33rd regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 5th, presided over by Premier Zhang. First, Deputy Secretary-General Yu Quan reported on Shanghai's price situation and the price situation in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan in the past week. He also explained the positive effects that the establishment of the local financial administration has had on the financial market. Yu claimed that Tianjin's prices only rose by 5 percent in January, and the prices in Wuhan and Shanghai also rose very little. Then, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian reported on the economic situation in Wuhan after inspecting the area. He also explained that Wuhan's prices are now relatively stable, but the local business community believes that Hankou's position is no less important than other regions, and that the amount of loans received in the past has been extremely small, so they requested reasonable treatment. Then, the discussion began: The Water Conservancy portion of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures was amended and approved (this is the implementation measure rewritten by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and submitted to the meeting for discussion). The original plan for the transportation portion of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures, Article 4, the implementation measures for port management, etc., were also amended and approved. The financial and fiscal departments of the Economic Reform Program Implementation Measures have been partially discussed and will be left for the next meeting to discuss. It is understood that the implementation measures for the Economic Reform Program can be fully discussed at the next meeting.

### The Special Relief Donation Steering Committee is Officially Established in the Capital: The Goal is 10 Trillion, Success Only, No Failure

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Executive Yuan's Special Relief Donation Steering Committee was officially established on the 5th. The first meeting was held at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM, chaired by Wang Yunwu. During the meeting, based on the 10 trillion yuan collection target proposed by Chairman Chiang, the outline of the promotion and the work schedule were discussed, and the decision was made to "only allow success, no failure," so that every wealthy household can take out money. It was also decided to start work immediately. The fundraising committees in ten regions, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou, were given a deadline to establish themselves by the 15th of this month and to carry out their work.

### The Relief Materials Handling Committee Will Hold a Meeting with U.S. Representatives Today to Discuss the Distribution of Materials and Other Matters

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Executive Yuan's U.S. Relief Materials Handling Committee is scheduled to hold a joint meeting with U.S. representatives Gilpatrick, Moody, and Hurd at 3:00 PM on the 6th to discuss the distribution of relief materials, the food rationing method, and other related matters.

### Great Harvest in the Eastern Guangdong Suppression Campaign: Notorious Bandit Wu Dong Surrenders and Has Been Incorporated; Huang Jingyi, a Pseudo-Central Committee Member, is Captured and Escorted to Humen

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 5th] The bandit suppression work in the coastal areas of Guangdong Province has achieved great results since the cooperation between the army and navy in the campaign. Wu Dong, a notorious bandit who roamed Dongguan and Boluo, has surrendered with his troops and has been incorporated. Previously, Li Jishen and others, who were hiding in Hong Kong and claimed to be the "Nationalist Party Revolutionary Committee," believed that the bandit had a strong influence and sent "Central Executive Committee" member Huang Jingyi to contact Wu and appoint Wu as "Commander of the East Boluo Column of the Democratic Allied Army." After Wu surrendered, he captured the "Central Executive Committee" member and escorted him to the Humen Fortress Command for interrogation. This is the biggest harvest since the bandit suppression campaign. In addition, the suppression of bandits in Kaiping, Heshan, and other places has also yielded repeated victories, with more than 300 bandits killed or captured. Furthermore, Deng Wenli, a bandit leader in Nanxiong, northern Guangdong, also led his troops to surrender to Ye, the commander of the suppression campaign in that area.

[Central News Agency, Haikou, 5th] Our suppression troops recently used clever offensives to destroy the so-called "Democratic Base" of Nankun, a long-standing nest of bandits.

### The Currency Figures are Not Intended to be Announced; Efforts are Gradually Being Made to Balance the Budget Deficit: Premier Zhang and Minister Yu Answer Questions from Legislative Yuan Members

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] After Premier Zhang Qun explained the situation of the general budget for the first half of this year at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th, the members of the Legislative Yuan raised questions or suggestions one after another.

Liu Zhiping said: The revenue department of the budget only sees collections from ordinary people and does not consider the wealthy, and requested an explanation of the adjustment of the cost of living index for public education personnel in March.

A Legislative Yuan member from the Youth Party said, "How can we cope with the issuance of more than 70 trillion currency?"

Zhong Tianxin said: "Not only is the revenue department of the budget a burden on the common people, but if the expenditure department relies on issuance to balance the deficit, the result will be rising prices, which is also a burden on the common people." He also pointed out that the transitional government and the constitutional government cannot be separated. The lack of a policy direction is a mistake. Strictly speaking, two-thirds of the entire budget is to prevent civil and military public education personnel from starving to death, and one-third is to prevent the government from closing down. There is no constructive nature. He suggested that the government's plans include too much and should focus its efforts on doing a few things. Reforming the monetary system, attracting remittances from overseas Chinese, and increasing the burden on the wealthy are the most urgent tasks. We should make great determination and courage to do them.

Sun Jiulu pointed out that the tax revenue should be reorganized to equalize the burden of the poor and the rich, simplify the institutions, and pay attention to the parallel between tax revenue and prices at all times. On the expenditure side, the military expenses are the largest. The principle of elite troops should be adopted. The treatment of public education personnel should be stabilized so that they can maintain their integrity.

Wang asked whether the establishment of Hainan Island was included in the budget, or whether the original proposal had been canceled because Song Ziwen was in charge of Guangdong.

Jian Guansan was concerned about the problem of making up for the budget deficit of more than 40 trillion, saying that relying on the issuance of currency is too dangerous. As for relying solely on foreign debt to balance the budget, it is not reliable and cannot be taught. If the issuance of public bonds is not compulsory subscription, it is feared that there will be little efficiency. Premier Zhang and Minister Yu successively answered, and the key points are recorded as follows: The revenue portion of the budget is entirely based on national taxes and tariffs. The tariff rates set in the 23rd year are no longer entirely reasonable. In addition, salt taxes, direct taxes, etc., have been adjusted. As for the special relief donation, the Ministry of Finance should study effective implementation measures. The treatment of public education personnel, according to the original proposal of the Legislative Yuan, would require 2,756 billion yuan annually, which the government cannot afford. After several studies, the current decision was made. Adjusting the cost of living index once in March is indeed unreasonable, but in fact, due to the limited facts, it is not easy to solve the technical and burden problems if adjustments are made every month. Even so, the government is willing to study a more appropriate method in detail to maintain the lives of public education personnel. The government does not intend to announce the number of currency issued last year. However, it is said that the issuance has reached more than 70 trillion, which is absolutely not the case. Even half of the said 70 trillion has not been reached. As of the end of the previous year, the currency issuance was only more than 2 trillion. Last year, the revenue was about 15 trillion and the expenditure was about 40 trillion. Public bonds, relief materials, enemy and puppet industries, etc., all have supplementary income. Based on this, the actual amount of currency issued is self-evident. Recently, the Communists have been spreading rumors that the amount issued last year was more than 100 trillion, which is absurd. The establishment of Hainan Island has not been canceled, but it is still too early to establish a province. At present, the security of Hainan Island is still maintained by the Guangdong Provincial Security Team. The establishment of a special zone will have to wait a little longer. The budget deficit must be gradually balanced, which cannot be achieved overnight. The Ministry of Finance should study the measures in detail. Relying solely on the issuance of currency is like drinking poison to quench thirst. At the end, Mr. Zhang expressed his deep appreciation for the attention of the members, not focusing on the increase or decrease of a certain number, but on the discussion of the overall problem. He also said that he is determined to implement the ten financial, economic, and financial reform measures he personally drafted to gradually achieve the goal of stabilizing currency value and ensuring people's livelihoods.

### Developing the Aluminum Industry in Taiwan Province: Implementation Awaits Approval from the Executive Yuan; Reynolds Returns to the United States to Report to Headquarters

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] A qualified person from the National Resources Commission here has confirmed the cooperation between Reynolds Metals Company and the National Resources Commission in the development of Taiwan's aluminum industry, and said that preliminary results have indeed been discussed. There are two ways of cooperation: one is investment, and the other is the participation of American technicians in the work. As for whether to establish a Sino-U.S. mining company or a similar institution, it has not yet been determined. Reynolds has returned to the United States after coming to Beijing to discuss with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission and will report the results of the negotiations in China to the company. The National Resources Commission will also submit a plan to the Executive Yuan for cooperation with the company, which will be implemented after approval. It is also learned that what is still being discussed is how to ensure the excellent results of this cooperation.

### Minister Yu Reports in the Legislative Yuan that the Mobilization of Overseas Deposits Has Achieved Results

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun gave a detailed report at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 5th on the handling of the mobilization of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens. He said that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have repeatedly negotiated with the United Kingdom and the United States on this matter, but the two countries are still unwilling to change their attitude. In the United States, the U.S. administrative power cannot order banks to disclose the secrets of private depositors, and the laws of each state are also different. In addition, there is a traditional protection of private property. Other countries, such as France, have also had similar negotiations with us, but to no avail. The United States still insists that the depositor's home government should order the depositor to temporarily hand over the money to the state for use, leaving no room for maneuver. As for the United Kingdom, the British government simply refuses to open the list of depositors. As for encouraging depositors to declare and allow overseas wealth to flow inward, although the measures have been drafted and approved by the Political Affairs Conference, they must wait for substantial diplomatic results before they can be smoothly implemented to solve this long-pending problem.

### Joint Defense of Sichuan and Shaanxi to be Implemented Next Month

[Our Chengdu Correspondent, 5th] Lin Shu, Secretary-General of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, came to Chengdu yesterday and met with Chairman Deng to discuss the joint defense of Sichuan and Shaanxi and made an important decision on the joint defense and suppression of bandits. The joint defense plan will be implemented next month.

### Minister Bai Reports on the War Situation

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 5th] Minister Bai summoned special reporters on the 5th to report on the war situation.

[Our Military Qing Correspondent, 5th] Executive Headquarters News: A group of Luo bandits recently fled west from Xiaojia Weir to Maliangping.

### The United States' $500 Million Aid to China Report is Not Denied by Various U.S. Agencies

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The U.S. State Department did not deny reports of the State Department's recommendation of a $510 million aid plan for China, but at the same time did not acknowledge it. For weeks, the State Department has remained silent on the issue of aid to China.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Secretary of State Marshall is preparing to ask Congress again today to approve approximately $1 billion in foreign aid. According to Senator George, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, this money will be used to assist China and pay for the occupation costs of Japan, Korea, and Germany. George did not elaborate, but he knew that this was listed outside of Marshall's European Recovery Program. Marshall himself also stated that the State Department is considering providing military aid to Greece and Turkey.

[United Press, Manila, 5th] Manila Evening News reports: Diplomatic sources from the Far Eastern Commission said that the peace conference with Japan may be held in March. Although the location of the conference has not been fully decided, many people advocate holding it in Pearl Harbor.

### Strange Guest in Kowloon City: Claims to be a Buddhist Disciple and Wants to be a Resident Representative

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 5th] The aftermath of Kowloon City is not over. It is reported that recently, two strange guests, claiming to be Buddhist disciples, asked the residents to be resident representatives for the two arrested people and made absurd remarks. Everyone knew that they were sent by a certain party to instigate discord among the residents and ignored them. The Guangdong Provincial Government attaches great importance to this and sent a special commissioner to investigate the truth, instructing the residents not to believe rumors and to wait for the government to resolve the matter. At the moment, the residents have tidied up Kowloon City and built a new road and a reception room for guests, with no intention of leaving.

### The Salaries of Civil and Military Personnel are Adjusted Monthly According to the Index: The Legislative Yuan Passes a Temporary Motion to be Immediately Submitted to the Government

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] The Legislative Yuan amended and passed the temporary motion of Legislative Yuan member Liu Zhiping at its regular meeting on the 5th: "It is proposed to suggest that the government adjust the salaries of civil and military personnel monthly according to the cost of living index; restore the rationing of food; increase the salaries of technicians and laborers in various agencies; and specify the post-layoff resettlement measures." The five attached measures are as follows: "The salaries of civil and military personnel throughout the country shall be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index. The food rationing method shall be restored. If the government's subsidies are too large, the selling price may be slightly increased every six months or a year. The salaries of technicians and laborers should be adjusted according to the proportion of public education personnel, that is, they must also be increased by more than 100 percent compared to the old standards to be fair. At the beginning of layoffs, the government should first formulate detailed measures and absolutely prohibit various agencies from laying off employees on the one hand and adding people on the other. The government should conduct a general registration for those who have been laid off and those who are qualified to serve as civil servants. At the same time, the government should also establish production institutions to enable this part of the personnel to engage in production undertakings or transfer them to work in remote provinces. In the future, if various agencies have too many vacancies and have to add people, they should also ask the government to select and dispatch personnel from its registered personnel through examinations. When starting layoffs, reasonable and objective standards should be set, and those who hold multiple positions and salaries should be laid off first. To improve the treatment of civil and military personnel, it must not increase the burden on the common people, but instead open up new sources of income and reduce expenditures. The best way to open up new sources of income is to requisition the domestic properties and deposits of large and small corrupt officials throughout the country. This matter has been repeatedly suggested to the government by all parties, and it is time to resolutely implement it. The most important thing to reduce expenditures is to severely punish corrupt officials who transfer the people's wealth into their own pockets. If these two things are carried out at the same time, the national treasury can be absolutely abundant, the treatment of civil and military personnel will definitely not be left unsettled, and the work efficiency of various agencies can also be increased."

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 5th] Provincial-level agencies in Jiangsu Province will definitely not lay off employees in February, but salaries will be paid at 95% of the original amount. At present, the provincial government is trying to reduce the original vacancies as much as possible to comply with central regulations. As for how to handle it starting next month, it is still under consideration.

### Chen Cheng Arrives in Beijing from Shenyang by Plane; Visits Chairman and Talks for Two Hours That Evening. Chu Xichun Arrives in Beiping on the Same Plane to Take Office

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] Chen Cheng, accompanied by Chu Xichun, left Shenyang for Beiping at 10:00 AM on the 5th aboard the Jian Guo Hao special plane. Wei Lihuang, Zheng Dongguo, and Wang Tiehan all went to the airport to see them off. Before his departure, Chu told reporters: "Hebei is my hometown. After taking office as Chairman of Hebei, I will serve my fellow villagers under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Fu." When asked about Hebei's policies, he replied: "Closely coordinate with the bandit suppression military." Chu did not use a firm tone when saying that the Northeast and North China are equally important.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Chu Xichun arrived in Beiping on the 5th on the same plane as Chen Cheng and will formally assume his duties soon. Chen stayed in Beiping for one hour, visited Director Li Zongren in the city, and then flew back to Nanjing on the same plane. After seeing Chen off to Beijing, Chu went to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the new urban area and had a long talk with Fu Zuoyi. At 8:00 PM, Fu hosted a banquet for Hebei party, group, and public opinion figures at the Beijing Club and introduced them to Chu, exchanging views on Hebei's provincial affairs during the dinner. Furthermore, Wu Qihwei, Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and Xiao Yishan, Secretary-General, who had gone to Shenyang on official business, also returned to Beiping on the same plane as Chen Cheng.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] Chen Cheng arrived in Nanjing from Shenyang at 6:30 PM on the 5th. The special plane landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Qin Dechun, Acting Minister of National Defense, and Lin Wei, Acting Chief of Staff, as well as Fang Tian, Liu Fei, Deputy Chiefs of Staff, and many others went to the airport to welcome him. After Chen got off the plane and rested briefly, he went to the official residence to pay his respects to the Chairman at 9:00 PM and did not leave until 11:00 PM. Chen had a two-hour long talk with the Chairman. Apart from the Chairman asking a few questions, most of it was Chen's report on the situation in the Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 5th] Chu Xichun, commander of the Shenyang Defense Zone, has gone to Beiping to take up his new position as Chairman of Hebei. His vacancy has been filled by Wang Tiehan, the Deputy Commander, who has been promoted. Wang's vacancy will be concurrently held by Luo Youlun, the commander of the Shenyang City Defense.

### Fierce Battle for Liaoyang; National Army Tenaciously Defends

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 5th] The focus of the Northeast war recently has been on the ancient city of Liaoyang in southern Shenyang. According to military authorities, the defending troops are holding firm, the lines of communication are unbroken, and the fighting is extremely fierce.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] The battle in Liaoyang has entered an intense stage. On the evening of the 2nd, more than 20,000 bandits launched a fierce attack on the surrounding suburbs under the cover of darkness, reaching more than ten times. Our defending troops calmly responded and repeatedly defeated the stubborn bandits. At the chemical factory alone, more than 4,000 bandits were killed. The two sides fought particularly fiercely for the Taizi River position in Northeast. It was once broken into by bandits on the morning of the 2nd, but after a fierce counterattack by our army, the bridgehead position west of the area was recovered, and the remnants of the bandits are currently being wiped out. (Also, 5th Dispatch) The battle of Liaoyang reached its climax on the evening of the 4th. The bandits showered our side with dense artillery fire and tricked innocent civilians, calling them "human bombs", into launching fierce attacks on the surrounding suburbs. The defending troops waited at leisure and killed countless bandits. There have also been local skirmishes in the areas near Anshan and Yingkou in recent days.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] According to Chu Xichun: "I received a telegram from the Liaoyang garrison this morning at 8:00 AM, stating that the attacking Communist bandits had been defeated four times and were fleeing in disarray. The claim that Liaoyang has fallen is not accurate."

Editorial

### The Beginning of Another Aggression Plan!

According to a London dispatch from the United Press on the 4th, the Soviet Union's first five-year plan after the war stipulates the construction of 2,800 miles of railways, including as many as five railways leading to the border of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia. Three of these lead to Northeast China, one is connected to the China Changchun Railway, and the other two are connected to the Siberian Railway. As for the Soviet Union's railway construction plan on the border of Outer Mongolia, its purpose is to cooperate with the highway transportation construction plan of Outer Mongolia. This piece of news released by the United Press is based on a booklet published by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Soviet Republic, and of course, it is a true and irrefutable fact. Let's put aside what kind of ambitions the Soviet Union harbors for Outer Mongolia and our Northeast. Just from this point alone, we can at least see what kind of actions the Soviet Union intends to take in the Far East.

First, the Soviet Union suffered Nazi aggression in this war, and most of its territory in Europe was occupied by the German army. Whether it was production or transportation routes, they were all destroyed by the German army, and the severity of the losses can hardly be expressed in numbers. The Soviet Union is currently engaged in reconstruction work after the war and is about to implement its first five-year plan to lay a solid foundation for a socialist country. In theory, the focus of its construction should be in Europe, especially railway transportation, which is like the main artery of our human body and is of great benefit to the country's recovery and construction. However, the focus of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan for railway construction is not in Europe but in the Far East, which makes people unable to understand and makes them suspect that the Soviet Union attaches special importance to the Far East for other purposes. At the same time, let's take a look at the situation in the Far East. Although the Soviet Union also fought against Japan, the flames of war did not spread to Siberia. All industrial equipment and transportation routes in Siberia were able to maintain their pre-war state. Therefore, the degree to which it needs to build railways at present is far less than its territory in Europe, which is very obvious. But why does the Soviet Union want to shift the focus of railway construction from Europe to the Far East? Apart from the Soviet Union having other plans for our Northeast, it is impossible to find other reasons.

Second, the Soviet Union's behavior towards China after the war, such as moving away industrial equipment from the Northeast, supplying the Chinese Communists with weapons and equipment obtained from disarming the Japanese army to create chaos and rebellion, covering Outer Mongolia and northern Korea with an "Iron Curtain," and refusing to hand over Lushun and Dalian to China, etc., all make the Chinese people suspicious of their ideal that "the Soviet Union loves peace." Recently, Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, published a letter to President Zhou Gengsheng, also bluntly pointing out that "the Soviet Union has become a terrifying aggressive force." After reading Hu's public letter, we are all worried that the Soviet Union will take the place of Japan; today, we see the United Press report that the Soviet Union's first five-year plan is to build five railways directly to our Northeast and Outer Mongolia, which makes us feel even more convinced. The Soviet Union's ambition to encircle our northern border with railways has been exposed, so how can we continue to indulge in the dream that "the Soviet Union loves peace?"

Third, the Soviet Union's railway construction plan has not yet started, so it does not immediately constitute a serious threat, but the Soviet Union is scheming and first encircles our northern border with railways. The consequences that can be created in the future are worthy of our high alert. As the saying goes, "Treading on frost leads to hard ice," and "One leaf falls and autumn is known." We must "prepare for a rainy day" and plan early, and we must not "nip it in the bud." What's more, our country has suffered aggression from strong neighbors and is still in shock, and is full of painful experiences and bloody lessons? The Japanese plan to invade our country also started like this. As Tanaka once stated, "If you want to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia;" and to conquer "Manchuria and Mongolia," you must first start with railway construction. The reason why they hated Zhang Zuolin was because Zhang built a parallel line to the "South Manchuria" Railway in the Northeast. By analogy, the Soviet Union's attempt to encircle our northern border with railways cannot but be regarded as the beginning of another new aggression plan, and this new plan of aggression will be even worse than what the Japanese did on September 18th and July 7th!

Fourth, the crisis in the Northeast is enough to constitute a source of world chaos. Our newspaper's editorial has repeatedly called on the attention of the Chinese people and political diplomats of all countries in the world. Recently, American Flying Tiger General Chennault wrote an article published in American newspapers, also saying that "the gunpowder keg of the Third World War is now burning in Northeast China; the United States wants to eliminate this threat and needs China's assistance." This is not an alarmist statement, and the situation in the Northeast is indeed extremely dangerous. From an economic point of view, after the Soviet Union moved away all the industrial equipment in the Northeast, only a shell remained, and it may not be possible to restore its old appearance without five or ten years of construction. Leaving aside economics and talking about military affairs, the Communist bandits, relying on the support of international accomplices, occupied almost the entire Northeast in the past year. In order to capture Shenyang, they launched seven offensives, although they were all repelled by government troops. At present, there are no traces of bandits around the Jichang Road; but the bandit army in western Liaoning is still using guerrilla warfare to harass Liaoyang, Xinmin, Heishan, Dahushan, and other places, attempting to cut off the traffic on the Pingjin Road. Why do the Communist bandits want to capture the Northeast at any cost? This is because "ensuring the Northeast and consolidating North China" has always been the Communists' consistent military strategy, and their poisonous scheme to collude with foreign tribes to achieve the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race is obvious. At the same time, on the other hand, the Soviet Union refuses to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and hand over Lushun and Dalian to China, and its intentions are also clear at a glance. In recent days, our country's military authorities have been closely monitoring the movements on the Bohai Sea and have strictly prohibited foreign ships from sailing to Dalian. The development of this situation is enough to show that the flames of war in the Northeast are spreading, and its meaning is not only China's internal strife, but it can indeed be regarded as an international outpost war. After hearing the United Press report and looking at the situation in the Northeast, can the United States still turn a blind eye to the future of the Far East?

In short, the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Far East have been exposed. Its attempt to encircle our Northeast and Outer Mongolia with railways is only the prelude to the Soviet Union's actions in the Far East; how can we sit and wait for death and let it encircle us? Furthermore, observing the effect of the Soviet Union's move, it is not only aimed at China alone, but also harbors other long-term plans. Even if the United States does not think about the peace of the Far East, it should also consider its own interests. How can it continue to stand by and watch the increasingly serious situation in the Far East deteriorate? We still remember that during the September 18th Incident, we pointed out that the Japanese ambition was to dominate the Far East, but the Americans did not pay much attention; today, the Soviet Union is watching fiercely, and the Communist bandits are acting as internal support in China. Can the American allies and the Chinese people still regard the Communist bandits' rebellion as China's civil war?

### U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, Discusses Sino-U.S. Relations, Clarifying U.S. Policy Toward China

[U.S. Information Service, this city] U.S. Consul General Cabot gave a speech at the Rotary Club today, expressing regret over the many misunderstandings in China regarding U.S. policy. Mr. Cabot's speech is as follows:

"Among the many deep impressions I have gained since I arrived here, most are pleasing and fascinating, but we regret to say that one impression in particular fills me with dismay. Given the decades of friendship and understanding that have existed between China and the United States, and given the high regard in which your public opinion organs are held, this impression surprises me even more. What I am referring to is the various misunderstandings about the United States and its policies that seem to exist here.

"Within China, a belief seems to be widespread that the United States is, on the one hand, neglecting China, and on the other hand, is fostering Japan, making it a pillar of the East to prevent the spread of communism. Surely, the Chinese people will not forget that we have donated more than one billion U.S. dollars in money and goods to relieve the Chinese people and restore their economy, and our relief supplies continue to flow into China. Given the ten years of destruction and suffering that China has suffered and the war against Japan, China is our ally, heroic, persevering, and our important politicians have made it clear that our purpose is to continue to provide aid to the Chinese people, the only question is how to make it effectively realized.

"So look at what has happened in Japan. We have deprived Japan of its fleet, disbanded its army, dismantled its armaments industry and military bases, and taken over many widely dispersed islands, the island network that the Japanese used to attack Pearl Harbor in bad faith. We hope that the Japanese will join the peace-loving countries of the world and strive to promote peace and improve living conditions throughout the world, but we will never be so foolish as to return weapons to them at an early date, knowing that we went through long and costly years of war to knock the weapons out of the hands of the Japanese.

"The second most popular misunderstanding I find is that we give aid to other countries for selfish purposes – that we do this to maintain our own prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, no country can become wealthy by giving its materials and the products of its labor to others. The prosperity of the United States does not depend on these contributions. On the contrary, the aid we give to other countries means sacrifices made by every family in the United States. Because we ship wheat, oil, steel, and many other products abroad to help countries that are not as fortunate as we are, there is a shortage of these products in the United States, and in a free economic system like ours, a shortage means higher prices.

"I think it is important for our Chinese friends to understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. At home, our aid to China program is also under attack. Many people in the United States want to forget what is happening in other countries and focus our efforts on domestic issues. Given the unfortunate situation that still exists in so many parts of the world and the progress that is being made to correct this situation is so slow and disappointing, it takes great determination from the American people to continue this sacrifice to help other countries – all the more so for our relative security and for our traditional neglect of foreign affairs. Those Americans who recognize the seriousness of the world's problems and are striving to make the United States fully involved in solving them will be disappointed to hear unfair criticisms in friendly countries, because such criticisms only serve to make our work at home more difficult.

"The third misunderstanding that seems to be very common in this country is that U.S. policy is motivated by material or imperialistic motives. Let us again review the record: we have disbanded our triumphant army, dismantled most of our fleet or put it in reserve, destroyed a large part of our aircraft, restored our war factories and converted them to peaceful uses, and withdrawn our combat troops from virtually every post stationed abroad. If we were planning military adventures, would we do that? Those who regard us as imperialists should note, for example, our recent actions in Panama.

"We have given hundreds of millions of dollars through the United Nations to aid certain countries, and these countries now say that we are threatening them. Regardless of whether we are called economic imperialists, we have spent billions of dollars to restore the economic productivity of the countries most affected by the war. We are now considering a plan drafted by European countries, not ourselves, that asks us to spend billions more dollars to accomplish the same goal.

"Some suspect that the United States has designs on Taiwan. I think this is a contradictory observation, especially in light of our granting freedom to the Philippines, this observation is indeed absurd, and there is not much criticism here of another foreign imperialism, which actually occupies a part of China's territory, despises your government, and extends its tyranny to China through those who attack what it considers the legitimate government of China, and boasts of its success.

"One more point: some criticize the United States for the agreement on China that President Roosevelt reluctantly signed at the Yalta Conference. Strangely enough, the United States is criticized for succumbing to pressure and agreeing to certain concessions that were detrimental to China, but the powerful country that exerted pressure on the United States at that time and enjoys these concessions today has not been criticized much. Moreover, if the Yalta Agreement had been supported with respect, and the Chinese government could restore its national sovereignty throughout the country, would the situation not be better than it is today?

"When I first heard these absurd misunderstandings, I did not understand how this could happen. We are loyal to our old friendship, have helped China a lot, and have never done any harm. The basic facts displayed here are fully understood. However, two days after I arrived in Shanghai, thousands of students held anti-American demonstrations over an accident (which did not involve the United States) and painted anti-American slogans on buildings. The students' thinking is aimed at being trained for the truth, how could they go astray?

"Then I thought of the distorted views of China that are popular in the United States. I thought of the small things that are made into big things and the big things that prove the small things wrong and are easily overlooked. I thought of many decent people who believe in the distorted facts about China and sincerely spread them. We have discovered a small group in the United States, a group of people who are disloyal to the country, who frantically try to overthrow our country and system. They can repeatedly deceive many sincere and sensible people to spread their harmful toxins, and no one even suspects its source. These foreign lackeys of tyranny certainly want to destroy the old friendship between China and the United States. Perhaps a group of favorites of this tyrannical country are also busy in China. All who believe in cooperation between free countries for the common good must always be wary of such slanderous rumors. These rumors seek to replace international friendship with misunderstanding for malicious purposes.

"The United States hopes that one day in the future it will be able to shift the thoughts and spirit that are devoted to solving foreign problems today to solving its own domestic problems. We also hope that one day our people at home will have better food, better clothing, and better housing. We believe that with our energy and ability, we will be able to achieve our goals, but we know that freedom is more precious to us than material happiness, and we believe that the people in other parts of the world share the same belief. It is precisely for this reason that we are helping others to resist the infiltration of an unprecedented tyranny. Our policy is to support peace and freedom, so that every country, large or small, can freely determine its national destiny according to its national ability."

### Soviet-Romanian Military Alliance Signed, Jointly Defending Against Aggression for Twenty Years, U.S. Accuses Romania of Violating Treaty and Depriving People of Basic Freedoms

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here today that the Soviet and Romanian delegations, after three days of negotiations in Moscow, have signed a Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance with a term of twenty years, signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Romanian Prime Minister Groza on the 4th on behalf of the two countries at the Kremlin. Marshal Stalin personally participated in the negotiations and was present at the signing.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] Molotov said after the signing of the treaty, "It is of special significance to conclude this treaty at a time when instigators of a new war in the imperialist camp are attempting to organize political and military blocs against democratic countries (referring to communist countries)." Prime Minister Groza said, "This treaty is sufficient to show our emphasis on permanent cooperation."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] A Moscow telegram broadcasted by Associated Press today said that the Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Mutual Assistance signed yesterday will be implemented quickly and will be ratified in the shortest possible time. There are six articles in the new treaty. In the first article, the two contracting countries agree to take joint steps to prevent future attacks by Germany or other countries that directly or indirectly ally with Germany, and express their willingness to participate in any "international action to maintain peace and security." The second article stipulates that if one of the contracting countries is attacked by Germany or another country, the other country must immediately provide all military force to help resist the aggression. The third article states that the two contracting countries guarantee that they will not participate in any international agreement that may endanger the other party. The fourth article stipulates that in the event of "any important international issue concerning both parties," the two countries must consult on countermeasures. The fifth article states that the two countries are determined to reach a good relationship in the spirit of mutual understanding and will not interfere in the problems of other countries. The sixth article states that the treaty will be effective for twenty years from the date of signing, unless one of the contracting countries notifies one year before the expiration that it will not continue, otherwise it will be automatically extended for five years.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The U.S. government has ordered its minister to Romania, Schoenfeld, to present a note to the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing Romania of violating the provisions of the Romanian Peace Treaty and accusing the current Romanian regime of attempting to eliminate the last remaining democratic opposition forces in the country. Britain also submitted a similar note to the Romanian government last weekend. The U.S. note stated that during the Romanian elections of 1946, the Romanian government used or agreed to use all fraudulent and oppressive methods to reduce the legitimate political activities of the opposition. The note further pointed out that after the Romanian government signed the Peace Treaty in February of last year, its police department intensified its planned activities to eliminate all political opposition forces. Mass arrests occurred throughout the country, with thousands of people imprisoned in the enclosures, suffering from hunger and disease in prison, and forced to confess, which would be used as the basis for trials.

### Soviets Build Five New Railways, Connecting Borders of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia

[Associated Press, London, 4th] According to a pamphlet published by the Soviet Ministry of Education received here, the Soviet Union is currently building five railways to the borders of Northeast China and Outer Mongolia. Three of the five new railways, which lead to the Northeast, are part of the 2,800-mile railway line stipulated in the post-war five-year plan. The pamphlet stated that a 500-mile railway line will connect Ulan-Ude, east of Lake Baikal, with Nosikhin on the border of Outer Mongolia. The second railway line will run from Borzya in northern Northeast China to Suyuikiske on the Mongolian border. The Soviet railway construction plan on the Mongolian border is coordinated with the highway transportation construction in Outer Mongolia, and the highway construction in Outer Mongolia is also based on the new five-year plan of Outer Mongolia, which was first adopted by the Mongolian People's Republic. According to a dispatch from Ulan Bator (Kulun) from the official Soviet TASS News Agency, the five-year plan will increase the number of automobiles in Mongolia by 250 percent. Automobiles will be transported to the Soviet Union through the new railway from the border of Outer Mongolia in the plan. On the other hand, Mongolia will transport a large number of livestock to the Soviet Union. Under the five-year plan, Outer Mongolia will increase livestock production to 31.1 million heads. As for the three railway lines built on the Chinese border, one is connected to the China Changchun Railway, and the other two are connected to the Siberian Railway. The Soviet pamphlet also stated that a branch line will be built westward from Karannor, leading to Duojiekui on the Ergun River on the Chinese border. The second branch line will connect the Birobidzhan Mountain area with Leninskoye on the left bank of the Heilongjiang River. This route is called the lifeline of the Soviet Union and the Jewish Autonomous Region of Birobidzhan Province, and can be regarded as a construction to encourage Jewish colonization. The first branch line is about 80 miles long, almost entirely parallel to the Pacific coast, running from Baranov in Vladivostok to Posyet, an important Pacific port on the border between China, Korea, and the Soviet Union.

### British Foreign Office Spokesman Clarifies Meaning of Western European Alliance

[Reuters, London, 4th] A British Foreign Office spokesman commenting on Swedish Foreign Minister Unden's statement that Sweden will strictly adhere to neutrality and will not participate in the Western European alliance system recently proposed by Foreign Minister Bevin said that Unden apparently misunderstood Bevin's views on the matter. Bevin's purpose is for Western European countries to organize their affairs both individually and collectively, so that Western values do not disappear under the pressure of poverty and internal strife. Among Western European countries, Britain and France hope to have treaty arrangements with the Netherlands and Luxembourg because Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg all face common problems in Germany. Later, Bevin also stated that he would further go beyond the scope of neighboring countries to promote the idea of a Western European alliance, but he also stated that the formal relationship between Britain and various countries might not be exactly the same. The spokesman continued that Sweden's participation in the Marshall Plan is deeply welcome, and each country should decide on its own how to contribute to helping Western Europe restore economic prosperity.

### Western European Sixteen Nations' Trade Unions to Convene Congress in Brussels Next Month

Leading figures of the AFL expect that after this congress, another World Federation of Trade Unions organization will be formed. The British Trades Union Congress has guaranteed its support for the Brussels meeting, and the anti-communist trade unions of France will also send representatives to attend. Wool also said that the current World Federation of Trade Unions Association is the Kremlin's fifth column, controlled by the communists, and is an enemy of democracy.

### Korean Independence Issue to be Returned to Small United Nations General Assembly for Handling

[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] A spokesman for the United Nations Korea Election Observation Committee said today that most committee members seemed to agree to hand over the Korean independence issue to the small General Assembly for handling, and a formal vote is scheduled for the 6th.

### Western European Five-Nation Talks to Conduct Detailed Review of "Bevin Plan"

[Reuters, Brussels, 4th] After arriving here today, British Minister of State McNeil is scheduled to meet with Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak tomorrow. Dutch Foreign Minister Botzelaar and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Beck will also participate in the talks, and the French delegation currently attending the European Customs Union Research Conference in Brussels will also attend the talks.

Therefore, representatives of the five Western European countries included in the "Bevin Plan" can gather together to conduct a detailed review of the Western Union plan. It is expected that the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will ask McNeil to provide a more detailed explanation of the "Bevin Plan," and they will also present their opinions on German demands to Britain and France.

[Reuters, Brussels, 4th] The European Customs Union Research Association held a meeting here today and decided to establish an economic committee to study the repercussions that a unified customs system among various countries will have on the economic committees of each country. In addition, the Research Association also decided to establish a permanent committee of customs experts in Brussels and to invite the Allied Commander-in-Chief in Germany to appoint representatives to attend the full-member conference of the Research Association to be held in April as observers. The Research Association will continue to meet tomorrow.

### Marshall Announces to Reporters That Aid to Europe is Becoming More Urgent Because Temporary Supplies Received by Europe are About to Run Out

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] When discussing the possibility of delaying the Marshall Plan at a press conference today, Secretary of State Marshall emphasized that the supplies of temporary aid to some European countries, which was reduced by Congress in December of last year, will soon run out. Therefore, the deadline originally scheduled for April 1 to implement the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe has become more urgent. Secretary Marshall also stated that the need for the European Recovery Program has not been met, and there are currently no plans to propose other temporary aid plans. When answering a reporter's question, Secretary Marshall said that there are currently no signs of a change in the Soviet Union's firm attitude.

### Suppressing Rising U.S. Prices Requires Preventing Inflation, Truman Hopes Congress Will Pass Bill

[Our Newspaper Report] New York 5th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman held a press conference today, claiming that unless Congress passes a bill to prevent inflation, prices will continue to rise, eventually leading to an economic crisis. He said that increasing production is not a way to prevent inflation. Facts show that when prices are controlled, production is abundant, and once controls are lifted, prices rise.

### Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union to Return Home for Vacation

[Our Newspaper Report] London 5th Broadcast: Istanbul News, Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Aktug may return home for vacation, but will likely return to his post. Foreign Ministry Secretary Karim denied rumors that Turkey intends to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

### British Police in Palestine Begin Retreat

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 4th] Today, Britain began its withdrawal from Palestine. Three hundred British police officers have been ordered to proceed to Egypt to await transport back to England. It is reported that the withdrawal of British military police will increase daily from now on. The Jewish Haganah organization issued a "press release" stating that Arab forces again attempted to infiltrate the Holy Land across the Palestinian-Syrian border, resulting in the deaths of twelve Arabs and the capture of eight.

### Italy Will Ban Political Militias According to the Constitution, Aiming to Deal with Communist Underground Elements

[Reuters, Rome, 4th] Amid rumors that guerrilla militias led by the Communist Party are about to appear in uniform, it is generally expected that the Italian cabinet will decide to take action in the cabinet meeting within five days to prevent political parties from organizing uniformed military forces. However, it is anticipated that Prime Minister De Gasperi and the cabinet do not currently possess sufficient power to disband the Garibaldi Brigades of guerrillas. At most, they will issue a declaration stating their determination to enforce Article 18 of the Constitution, which prohibits military groups with political objectives.

Although this declaration applies to other groups such as armed neo-fascists, its primary purpose is to deal with communist underground elements.

Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Cabinet's "Committee for the Defense of the Republican System" Bazziardi will propose punishments for political militias at the cabinet meeting within four days. Those who organize such militias will be sentenced to two to ten years in prison, while participants will be sentenced to up to three years.

[Associated Press, Rome, 4th] The cabinet will formally set April 18th as the date for the first parliamentary election of the new republic at tomorrow's meeting. The government has been concerned that left-wing paramilitary groups will influence the vote or overthrow the results afterward. It is an open secret that the Communist Party maintains its own military force for self-defense. This private army has paraded in major cities across the country, trained in the wilderness, and been heavily publicized in party newspapers.

### Italian Scientific Community Discovers New Atomic Energy Element

[Associated Press, Turin, Italy, 4th] It was learned today that 28-year-old scientist Sattei has discovered a source of atomic energy that is cheaper and more powerful than both uranium and thorium. Military authorities are currently studying it. According to Sattei, the radioactive particle is named "Mini CP" and comes from ordinary matter, but the specific type of ordinary matter was not specified.

### Poland Implements Compulsory Military Training to Completely Sovietize

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 5th] Poland's newly promulgated conscription law will affect up to 4.5 million young men and women. All men aged thirteen to twenty-one must undergo compulsory military training in their towns, and women must also receive vocational and rigorous training. Men under the age of thirty who have not served in the military must participate in military training.

[Associated Press, Beijing, 4th] Bulgaria has effectively become a one-party dictatorship under the iron fist of Communist Prime Minister Dimitrov tonight. Around 200,000 party members led the change, marching past a reviewing stand where Dimitrov stood, with a Soviet general at his side, as the marchers shouted cheers for Dimitrov. This transition was completed by the reorganization of the "Fatherland Front."

[Associated Press, Beijing, 4th] The Fatherland Front Congress, after two days of meetings, passed the following program, aiming to completely Sovietize life in Bulgaria: 1. Control private religious schools and transfer all public education to state control. 2. Socialize industry and establish state-run cooperative farms. 3. Strive to revise the onerous terms of the peace treaty and enable Bulgaria to join the United Nations. 4. Base foreign policy on maintaining an unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union. 5. Build the Fatherland Front as the sole public political organization of the Bulgarian people.

[Reuters, Sofia, 4th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, at the second congress of the Fatherland Front party, acknowledged that Pravda's criticism of his proposal to establish a Balkan federation was a timely warning. He said that Pravda's criticism of his proposal to establish a Balkan-Danubian federation and customs union was a timely and useful warning to prevent hindering the zeal for people's democracy. The Balkan-Danubian countries do not need artificial federations or customs alliances, but rather need to protect and consolidate their independence and sovereignty, and mobilize and organize their people's democratic forces, as the Cominform declaration indicates.

### General Clay Re-discusses Administrative Reform in West Germany

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] At a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris today, General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, said that the administrative reform of the Anglo-American zone in Germany is not a prototype for any future central government in any part of Germany, but merely an economic necessity. The consistent policy of the United States in Germany is to develop a sense of German responsibility in its jurisdiction before obtaining the agreement of the major powers to establish a central government. We are well aware that the power of the central administrative institutions must be strengthened to guide France out of economic disarray. We are most concerned about two points: first, that Germany's economy, in a divided state, can only evoke the German national concept, making it difficult for the rest of Europe to reach an agreement; second, that West Germany's accommodation of people expelled from East Germany will necessitate the use of all resources. The goal of the British and Americans for the merged zone is to establish a government capable of dealing with economic disarray, but its powers will be limited. These powers will ultimately be vested in the German states. Clay then solemnly declared that we have no basis to give Germans priority rights from any perspective. Germany's production level is only 42 percent of pre-war levels, while the average for the rest of Europe is only 85 percent of pre-war levels, so Germany is still far behind any country. Clay finally replied to reporters present that Germany's occupied status would have to last until the countries of the world were prepared to accept Germany's participation in international organizations, which could take only ten years or as long as twenty-five years.

### India Arrests Eighty Extremists, Bans All Anti-Muslim Organizations

[United Press International, New Delhi, 5th] Reliable sources reported on the 5th that the Indian government is cracking down on Hindu extremists, with plans to arrest as many as 100 people. Eighty of them have already been captured by New Delhi police. Police teams are swiftly executing the government's order to ban political groups (especially the Mahasabha) "private armies," and are searching for the leaders of Hindu extremists in various locations. However, twenty people have escaped the police net, and the police have sealed the Mahasabha's headquarters in New Delhi. The Mahasabha has been accused of orchestrating Gandhi's assassination, and the government formally disbanded the Mahasabha on the evening of the 4th, denouncing it as "worshipers of violence" and holding it responsible for Gandhi's assassination.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 4th] Prime Minister Nehru stated that all private armies and groups that oppose Muslims with violence and hatred must be banned.

### US Aids Greece in Expanding Air Force

[Reuters, Athens, 4th] Major General Lee, head of the U.S. aid mission to Greece, revealed that the first batch of U.S. training aircraft, available for reconnaissance and combat, has already been handed over to the Greek Air Force. The aircraft were flown to Greece by American pilots, and more aircraft are on the way to Greece. Greek aviation personnel will soon go to the United States for training. Previously, the Greek Air Force had been trained and equipped by Britain.

### Supreme Soviet Meeting Approves Budget

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] The fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union declared its closure today after unanimously passing the 1948 national budget. In this budget for the third year of the new Five-Year Plan, revenues total 428 billion rubles, and total expenditures are 387.9 billion rubles. The Soviet Council of Ministers, at the request of the budget review committee, approved an increase in tax revenue of 171.1 million rubles. Before closing, the Supreme Soviet also ratified all resolutions passed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1947, including the prohibition of communication between Soviet citizens and foreign people, the abolition of the death penalty, and the appointment of Bulganin as Minister of Defense and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Kaganovich and Malenkov as Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers.

### Nazi War Criminal Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building

### Japanese Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse; Supplementary Budget Vigorously Opposed by the Left; Government Decides to Withdraw in Order to Compromise

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese cabinet decided at a special meeting today to withdraw the current supplementary budget bill in order to revise it. The bill has pushed the Katayama cabinet to the brink of collapse due to the strong opposition of the left-wing members of the Socialist Party. The government's withdrawal of the bill is clearly aimed at compromising with the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party and preventing the continuous crisis now facing the cabinet.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th] After the split between the left and right wings of the Social Democratic Party, the collapse of the Katayama cabinet is imminent. After a meeting yesterday afternoon, left-wing party members decided to withdraw their support for the Social Democratic coalition cabinet. At the same time, the Democratic Party, the second-largest party in the cabinet which tends toward the center, has recently threatened to take the same position as the opposition Liberal Party (conservatives). Therefore, the resignation of the Katayama cabinet is almost inevitable. An editorial in today's Asahi Shimbun believes that the conflict between the government and the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party over the budget for allowances to civil servants may lead to the dissolution of parliament or the resignation of the Katayama cabinet.

### Hull Memoirs, Copyrighted by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by the Staff of this Newspaper, The Collapse of the Grand Peace Conference in the White House

On October 5, 1937, President Roosevelt delivered his famous "quarantine speech" in Chicago. Since taking office, Mr. Roosevelt has been struggling to restore normalcy at home, and as a result, he has sometimes been unable to pay sufficient attention to our foreign affairs. For me, I was increasingly concerned about the growing isolationist sentiment in the United States, which could be seen in the activities, letters, petitions, and opinion polls of many peace organizations. I was also very worried about the possible impact of these facts on foreign countries. In September, I learned that the President intended to make an early trip across the continent to the Pacific. So I discussed it with Davis and expressed my firm opinion that the President should deliver a speech on international cooperation during his trip, especially in a city where isolationism was deeply rooted. So I took Davis to visit the President, and we presented him with this idea. He immediately agreed. He said that if we prepared the necessary materials for the speech in advance, he would deliver it during the trip.

We returned to the State Department and prepared the speech in draft form. The famous "quarantine" phrase was not in our draft. The President himself was responsible for inserting this phrase, because he made final revisions before delivering the speech. I did not know that there was such a phrase until after he spoke.

The President said, "The peace, freedom, and security of ninety percent of the world's population are being jeopardized by the remaining ten percent, who are threatening to destroy international order and law. Surely, the ninety percent of the people who hope to live under the law in accordance with the moral standards that have been almost universally accepted for centuries can and must find a way to carry out their will…

"The spread of lawless anarchy in the world is unfortunate, but it seems to be accurate. When an epidemic begins to spread in the human body, civil society approves and will agree to isolate the patient in order to protect the health of the entire society and prevent the spread of the disease."

The reaction to the idea of quarantine was swift and intense. In my view, it had the effect of setting back at least six months the continuous education movement we were conducting to cultivate and enhance public opinion toward international cooperation. Those of us responsible for promoting this movement through speeches, statements, and actions in any possible situation worked hard and did our best, but we were always careful not to go too far, lest the violent attacks of the isolationists would push us back beyond our original position. If we proceed gradually and do not provoke unnecessary opposition, then our words and actions, although not as powerful or far-reaching as we would like, can have a greater effect on the world. Conversely, if we make startling statements or take drastic actions, the intense opposition we provoke will reveal to the world a scene of domestic division.

Six major peace organizations issued a statement declaring that the President "is leading the American people down the road to world war." The American Federation of Labor passed a resolution declaring that "American labor does not want to be involved in wars far away in Europe or Asia." Congressmen Fish and Hamilton threatened to impeach the President. The "Inquiry" newspaper telegraphed Congress to seek opinions, and the results showed that more than two-thirds were opposed to the United States taking joint action with the League of Nations on the Far East issue. A civilian movement was also launched to collect 25 million signatures on a petition to "prevent the United States from being drawn into war."

All these reactions, of course, were pleasing to Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese warlords. This undoubtedly made the aggressor nations bolder and made the European democracies doubt whether we were standing with them in anything other than words. More audacious actions by Japan followed, culminating in the Japanese aircraft sinking the American gunboat "Panay."

In October 1937, Undersecretary of State Welles came up with the idea of a world peace plan. He drafted a very long memorandum and personally took it across the street to the President. He wanted the President to convene a grand meeting of all the diplomatic representatives in Washington at the White House on November 11, Armistice Day. There, the President would deliver a dramatic appeal, asking all countries to sit down together at the conference table and draft the basis for peace. The President would propose an outline for these foundations. One was to reach an agreement on the principles of international behavior; another was to reduce armaments; and the third was economic stabilization. He would conclude that unless peaceful policies were adopted, peace could not last long.

Almost before I knew it, I found that the President had completely agreed to this plan. Staging such a colorful program at the White House was very meaningful to him. For years, he had wanted to invite the heads of state to hold a meeting with him at sea. Around a round table on a battleship or cruiser, he would work with them to draft a lasting peace plan. He had not reached the point of making a formal proposal, but he had sounded out several people. Talk of this idea of his spread, but the reaction was not very good. Ambassador to Rome Phillips wrote to me on October 9, 1936, after his first audience with Mussolini, saying, "Apparently, Rosso (the Italian ambassador to the US) had told him (Mussolini) that the President wanted to meet with the heads of European countries. He smiled slightly when he talked about this, made no affirmative expression, grinned at me, and shrugged his shoulders."

Personally, I felt that a meeting like the one the President envisioned would result in nothing but loss. It was impossible to persuade governments to agree on complicated solutions by sitting around the table and talking to each other for a day or two. For this reason, foreign governments were not enthusiastic about this idea. They knew that the President could not enter into secret agreements, and secret agreements might be the only kind of agreements that could result from such a conference in the Atlantic.

Something similar to what Welles envisioned had been proposed by Schacht, president of the Reichsbank, to Ambassador Davis on January 20, 1937, when Davis was passing through Berlin on his way to Moscow. Davis telegraphed me that Schacht had told him that he had been authorized by Hitler to make proposals to France and England to guarantee European peace, fix existing borders, reduce armaments, create a new form of the League of Nations that could function effectively, eliminate sanctions, and obtain colonies for Germany. He said that France had expressed its approval, but England had not.

Schacht then said that he hoped the President could convene an international conference in Washington. When Davis indicated that the President might not be willing to get involved in such a situation unless there were some guarantees of success, Schacht replied that the conference should not be convened unless an agreement had been reached in advance. The conference should not be called an "economic conference" but a "peace conference."

When I found out that the President was determined to hold an Armistice Day conference at the White House, I earnestly opposed the plan, believing it to be illogical and impossible. I outlined the situation as I saw it to the President. In late 1937, Germany, Japan, and Italy had increased their armaments to such an extent that their actions were undoubtedly aimed at aggression, not defense, and at conquest, not peace. At a time when democratic countries should be arming themselves to the greatest extent possible for self-defense, it was extremely dangerous to allow them to indulge in a feeling of complacency with a peace conference. I had seen the danger of military aggression for several years, and now it seemed even closer. Therefore, it seemed completely impractical for the peace-loving countries to launch a new movement to further reduce armaments among themselves while the Axis powers continued to arm themselves madly. Anyone with any information knew that for five years, every effort had been made to persuade the Axis powers to participate in an armaments reduction agreement, but they deliberately refused and instead launched a large-scale rearmament program. The Axis powers would laugh at the peace-loving countries' belated demand for disarmament.

Even if an agreement was reached, what would be its value? All three Axis powers had repeatedly shown their disregard for their promises and their contempt for treaties. The word "treaty" had become something worthless and a laughingstock for Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese. The President was aware of how the Axis powers would react to his appeal. Mussolini had replied that after mobilizing a million people and spending twenty billion lira, he must invade Abyssinia, otherwise his prestige would be swept away and he would incur the contempt of other countries. He was indeed reflecting the sentiment of his Axis partners. They had also mobilized millions of people and spent billions of marks and yen, and they were going to take what they could get.

Welles's somewhat flashy plan was to be unveiled on Armistice Day without consulting or sounding out other countries. At a minimum, it seemed unwise and unfair not to consult Britain and France first. At that time, they were conducting delicate negotiations with Germany and Italy; they were trying to keep the Spanish Non-Intervention Committee in existence and functioning. Therefore, suddenly presenting them with such a flamboyant plan without any prior warning could put them in a very difficult position.

In June 1937, Davis, who was then in London, sounded out the possibility of Prime Minister Chamberlain visiting Washington to meet with the President. Mr. Roosevelt was willing to send an invitation, but thought that Chamberlain should come after Congress recessed in September, and that careful diplomatic preparations should be made before the visit.

Chamberlain wrote to Davis on July 8, and Davis forwarded the letter to the President and me, in which he said that he must decline the idea of holding a meeting with the President in the fall. He said that he did not think the time was ripe. If a meeting that was bound to attract a great deal of attention could not produce perfect results, the impact would be very serious. At present, he did not think we could achieve the desired goal.

In the East, Japan had made it clear that it did not want the West to mediate Sino-Japanese relations. The possibility of it attending a peace conference to reach any major agreement was very small.

In the several conversations I had with the President on this subject, he did not accept the views I expressed. Eventually, the plan was abandoned, and we continued our efforts to rebuild our armaments and to make public opinion understand the serious danger of the impending world conflagration.

### Review and Return of Requisitioned Land; Two Cases of Full Return; 700 Acres in Jiangwan District Requisitioned by the Joint Logistics Department

[Report from this newspaper] The first group of the Central Government Agencies in Shanghai Using Enemy and Puppet-Occupied Land Review Committee of the Executive Yuan held its first review meeting at the Land Administration Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday, reviewing twelve cases of military, official, and transportation agencies in Shanghai using private land. Representatives from the Naval Base Command, Ministry of Transportation, Real Estate Trade Association, Municipal Government, Ministry of National Defense, Port Command, Central Trust Bureau, Air Force Supply Command, and Bar Association attended. The meeting was presided over by the group convener Ma Shaoji and Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping. The review principle was generally that land in urban areas has high use value and should be returned as much as possible. Except for the land actually needed by each agency, which can be requisitioned in accordance with the law, the rest should be returned to the original landowners as much as possible. If the nature of the agency is indeed important, then all procedures for requisition should be carried out in accordance with the law. As a result of the review of the twelve cases, partial return was ordered in five cases, full return in two cases, cases of significant importance were submitted to the general assembly for discussion in four cases, and full requisition was ordered in one case.

The two cases of full return are: 1. The Sixth Arsenal of the Ordnance Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately ten acres of private land in the Fahua District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. 2. The First Supply Depot of the Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately five acres of private land in the Zhabei District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. The one case of full requisition is that the First Automotive Equipment Manufacturing Plant of the Joint Logistics Headquarters used approximately 700 acres of private land in the Jiangwan District that had been occupied by enemies and puppets. This plant is the largest automotive equipment manufacturing plant in the country and is in fact already in the process of handling requisition procedures.

### Two Airline Companies to Raise Prices Starting Tomorrow; Fares to Increase by Approximately 30 to 40 Percent

[Report from Our Newspaper] The air passenger fares for China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications and approved, with a price increase scheduled to take effect on the 7th. The increase will vary from 35 to 40 percent depending on the route. The Shanghai-Hong Kong and Kunming-Hong Kong routes will increase by 40 percent due to foreign exchange expenses, while the Peiping-Shenyang route will only increase by 30 percent to enhance transportation for Northeastern passengers. Most other routes will increase by 35 percent. CNAC General Manager Liu Jingxuan told reporters yesterday that since the beginning of this year, the price of aviation gasoline has increased three times, totaling 47 percent, costing about 60 US cents per gallon. In contrast, the gasoline used by domestic airlines in the United States costs only 29 cents per gallon. The foreign exchange rate has also been raised twice in the past month or so, totaling 34 percent, which has increased the company's foreign exchange expenses. In addition, the recently released cost of living index has also risen by 40 percent compared to last month, which has significantly increased the company's salary expenses for its employees. Under these circumstances, airfares could not be adjusted in time each time, resulting in significant losses. Furthermore, CNAC was recently ordered to open routes to Ningxia and other remote areas. The carrying capacity in these remote areas is poor, and gasoline is transported by special planes, while the fares are the same as those in the interior, which is particularly unfavorable to the company's finances. Therefore, the two companies recently sent special representatives to the capital with relevant data to explain the situation in detail to the Ministry of Communications, and only then were they granted permission to raise prices.

### Two Tobacco Companies Hoarding Silver; Expected to Be Fully Returned

Geng Taihan, owner of Shunli Tobacco Company on Hankou Road, and Liu Yusan, owner of Zhengyu Tobacco Company on Sichuan Road, purchased and hoarded tens of thousands of taels of silver coins and silver ingots during the occupation of this city. In November of last year, the police received a tip and dispatched officers to seize all of the silver and report it to the Central Bank, which forcibly converted it into legal tender at an exchange rate of one yuan of silver coin (or seven fen and three li of silver ingot) for one yuan of legal tender. The parties involved, Geng Taihan and Liu Yusan, were dissatisfied with this confiscation-like treatment and engaged lawyer Zhou Yizhi to file appeals with the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the municipal government, based on the Ministry of Finance's regulation that "people who hoard silver without engaging in trading activities will not be subject to forced conversion." It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has transferred the case to the Shanghai Financial Administration for full handling. If it is determined that the silver held by the parties involved was indeed not used for trading and profiteering, it may be fully returned. The lawyer engaged by the parties involved has recently sought to obtain supporting documents from the City Council to facilitate the application for return. It is noted that Speaker Shen of the City Council specially raised this case at the New Year's celebration this year, considering it a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. The Ministry of Finance's above-mentioned action can be described as a victory for public opinion.

### Hunchback and Limp Fellow Sufferers, Iron Shop Owner Slightly Induces Into Prison

[From Our Own Correspondent] Hunchback Tang Genda was accused of raping and abducting a young girl, and was sentenced to imprisonment by the court yesterday. Tang is the owner of an iron shop in Dongsheng Lane, Yangjiadu. Yan Wenzhen, the daughter of the cotton shop owner Yan Liansheng across the street, is only seventeen years old and suffers from a lame foot. Tang and Yan are both disabled, fellow sufferers, and love grows over time. On November 18th of last year, Tang lured Yan to the Datong Hotel and raped her in a room. Later, he took her to Wuxi and continued to rape her for several days. When he returned to Shanghai, Yan Yunsheng caught a glimpse of her, and he sent her to the police station. The police station transferred her to the court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda announced: "Tang Genda, intending to rape and abduct a woman under the age of twenty to leave her family, is sentenced to eight months of imprisonment."

### The Terror in the Northeast

[From Our Own Correspondent, Guanyang, 3rd by Air Mail] Wang Haojun served as the chief of the joint security during the recovery of Andong. He lived in the bandit area for two years. Recently, he escaped from the bandit area in Andong and arrived in Qian. He narrated to the reporter what he saw and heard in the bandit area. From a corner of Andong, we can see that the bandits in the Northeast are like floods and ferocious beasts, and the harm is increasing day by day. However, their tricks of coercing and following, gathering crowds to make trouble, and all the brutal acts, are not tolerated by the people in the Northeast, and they are doomed to self-destruction. We can know the autumn by looking at a leaf.

Bandit Military Activities

The actions of the bandit army are sudden and unpredictable. They wander around to disrupt and cause chaos. They gather and disperse irregularly. Therefore, it is impossible to capture the number of their troops and where their main force is located. Wherever the bandits go, they mingle with the local people. The people endure their tyranny, daring to be angry but not daring to speak. The bandit army expands its troops everywhere, and the methods are extremely vicious. Every time it reaches a village, it forces the village cadres and political workers to organize a basic team. Villages have basic teams, districts have district brigades, and counties have county brigades. Those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five must serve. It is called "joining the army" in name. After training on the spot, they rush to the front line.

The bandit army's food and clothing are all taken from the people. In the bandit area, they search every household for food very thoroughly. Each person must pay 70 catties or 100 catties of grain. There is no fixed number of times. They demand it according to the household registration. Those who violate will be executed. The bandits have five civilian clothing factories in Andong, which are forcibly formed by private garment bureaus. They also use cotton cloth and rubber produced by the puppet Dongyang Textile Factory and the East Asia Rubber Factory, but raw materials are very scarce. Many bandit army soldiers wear army shoes in winter. The bandit army

Weapons Are Extremely Scarce

New recruits are only given a few grenades, and each rifle has no more than 60 bullets. What Wang Jun saw on his way to escape, there are more bandits in Xiama Tang and Tongyuan Fort on the Anbian line, only equipped with six cannons and more than ten mountain cannons.

The bandit's training is mainly political, and spiritual talks are important subjects. They fabricate all kinds of rumors, slander the government, and slander the national army, saying that no officials in the central government are not corrupt, and no officials are not corrupt. Civil officials collect people's wealth, and military officers drink soldiers' blood. They also say that the Kuomintang is the base camp of feudal forces. To overthrow feudal forces, we must first overthrow the Kuomintang. Overthrowing the Kuomintang is to overthrow bureaucratic capital, wealthy people, and landlords. Self-cultivating farmers are all remnants of feudalism and should be overthrown. He also told the bandit army soldiers to wear masks to please the people. He said: The people pay money to support the army, the people are the father, and the Eighth Route Army is the son of the people.

Political Activities

The bandits also have administrative organizations. The province has a chairman, vice-chairman, and political commissar. The county has a county magistrate, vice-county magistrate, and political commissar. The district has a district chief, deputy district chief, and instructor. The village has a village chief, deputy village chief, chief of the neighborhood, chief of the large group, and chief of the small group. Ten households are a neighborhood, three neighborhoods are a large group, and five families are a small group. The small group is used as a unit to implement the welcome sitting method. The bandit army uses all kinds of organizations in cities and rural areas as a means of controlling the people. There are trade unions and farmers' associations in the cities, which are all composed of poor people; in the rural areas, there are children's groups and women's associations, which are used as tools for transmitting military and political intelligence.

The bandits are active in rural areas, and their atrocities are the most obvious. Their purpose is nothing more than to cause the rural economy to go bankrupt, the rich to become poor, and the poor to become bandits, expanding the source of chaos. A few examples of their atrocities can be seen in general:

Liquidation and Struggle

Actively carry out, that is, overthrow the rich, the poor turn over, creating bloody terror, causing the rich to die, and making the poor useful. The liquidation method is quite interesting. First, the poor report someone, and then instruct the district and village cadres and the chiefs of large and small groups to convene a mass meeting. For example, if someone reports that a ten-year-old son of a landlord killed a poor man's chicken on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year, the crime of killing a chicken, from this chicken, how many eggs can be laid in a year, how many eggs in a year, how many chickens can be hatched, how many chickens can lay eggs, so calculated, after ten or twenty years, the landlord's land will be cleared in an instant. After signing and stamping, he will be driven out of the village. A slight hesitation will inevitably be beaten to death with sticks.

Pursuing Floats and Digging Roots

This kind of ruthless method is to eliminate landlords to prevent them from fighting back. After dividing their fields and houses, they force them to pursue floats and dig roots, forcing the landlord to give up all his clothes, kisses, utensils, and dig roots, forcing him to give up his private possessions, so that he will be exhausted. Then hang a landlord or evil landlord sign on his head, so that he has no way to beg for food and starve to death alive.

Insult and Hostility

For those who work in central agencies or the families of officers and soldiers serving in the national army, hang a long white cloth lantern at the door with the words "Bandit Family" written on it, and draw a row of coffins below.

Supporting the Front and Protecting the Fields

The poor people who are given land must support the army, support the war, and protect the fields. Once the national army enters, it will be regarded as insufficient support. Not only the fields will not be protected, but their lives will not be guaranteed. The bandits are cruel, and the rich and poor are unavoidable.

Cut Off the Tail

The people who join the bandit group have to work during the day and "confess" at night. If someone speaks differently from the poor, it means that their brains have not been opened. The lighter ones will be confined, and the heavier ones will be beaten violently (called helping). He must reflect, and after many confessions, he is willing to "cut off the tail" (abandon all worries) and willing to "let go of the burden" (donate everything) to be spared from disaster and allowed to join the bandit.

Servant Team

Old men over the age of forty-five and young children of landlords are organized into a farming team to cultivate the land divided by the poor people who join the army, without receiving remuneration, called the "Servant Team." (Reporter Zhao Zhan)

[From Our Own Correspondent, Fuzhou, 5th] With the end of the year approaching, petty thieves in Rong City are very active. One night, the three signboards of "Nationalization of the Army", "Political Democratization", and "Economic Socialization" at the Gao Yan Bridge surface of Nantai Bridge Head were tampered with by gangsters overnight. Their stealing skills are truly shocking. Two speedboats from Rong to Minqing (Pingliao) were seized, and more than a dozen bandits were found to be intercepting and robbing ships. At the same time, stealing in the streets and robbing in dark alleys are also common in the urban area. The relevant authorities have ordered that winter prevention be stepped up from today until the Spring Festival.

### He Yushu Talks About Jiangsu's Grain Policy

[From Our Own Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Grain requisition is a major political task in the era of suppressing chaos. How is Jiangsu's grain administration situation? He Yushu, director of the Provincial Land and Grain Department, took office in September of last year, and started the grain requisition work for the 36th year from October 15th. This arduous task, on the day he took office, he told reporters, I must do my best to follow the central government's intention of coordinating the army's precision and the people's food.

To this day, Jiangsu's grain requisition work has been going on for nearly four months. The overall collection in the north and south of the Yangtze River has been more than 60%. Now the department is sending a large number of people to the counties to urge collection, and must collect enough on time as scheduled.

A Glimpse of Conscription in Kind and Money

A total of 29 counties requisition in kind, including Jiangning, Jurong, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Gaochun, Jintan, Liyang, Yixing, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Songjiang, Yangzhong, Taixian, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Liuhe, Jiangpu, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Shiying, and Huaian. The counties that requisition in money are Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Shanghai, Fengxian, Qidong, Chongming, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Dongtai. According to Jiangsu, there are a total of 63 counties and cities. In addition to the above 44 counties requisitioning in money and in kind, the rest are exempt from requisition due to severe floods and bandit disasters. According to Director He's words to reporters, the central government's stipulated requisition rate last year was one requisition and one borrowing, according to the original tax amount of 4 dou and 4 sheng of real grain per yuan to collect 30% of public grain, totaling 9 dou and 2 sheng. Later, because Jiangsu was the earliest to fall, and the people suffered the most, it was reduced to 40% of the original tax, which is 3 dou of real grain per yuan, 1 dou for borrowing, and 9 sheng for public grain, totaling 4 dou and 9 sheng. This year, after the suggestion of the Provincial Assembly and the central government's consideration, the real tax is 1 dou and 2 sheng, the borrowing is 6 sheng, and 40% of the public grain is collected, which is 4 sheng and 8 ge, totaling 2 dou and 2 sheng and 8 ge of real tax per yuan, plus 1 sheng and 2 ge of accumulated grain, totaling 2 dou and 4 sheng. The total amount of real tax in the province in the 36th year is 5,955,577 shi and 9 dou.

A Lot of Hard Work to Reorganize

Jiangsu has been occupied for the longest time, so most of the old tax registers have been lost. It was decided to mobilize the grassroots to work, ask questions household by household and armor by armor, and recompile the land tax registers to have a basis. Follow the natural terrain, divide into sections, ask the owners according to the land, and then compile the total household register. I heard that there are surcharges for grain requisition in various counties. Is it legal? According to Director He, according to central laws and regulations, it is not allowed to use land as a source of taxes. Later, the provincial government felt that the county finances of various counties were facing difficulties, so it formulated a flexible method and obtained the approval of the Provincial Assembly to temporarily allow surcharges, but the income from the surcharges must be used for (1) national education for a hundred years, (2) strengthening local self-defense work to prevent bandits, (3) local autonomy after eliminating apportionment.

Crushing the Three Demands Policy

Purchasing county-level taxes and county-level finance are based on taxes and grain. In the past few months, because the central government could not purchase at market prices, it led to financial difficulties and could not be resolved. Now, after the suggestions of the county assemblies, the central government is also deeply aware of the financial difficulties of the local governments, so it has decided to purchase at market prices in the future, and also purchase grain at market prices. This is the greatest principle of the central government to cultivate the people's food and military grain, and it can also make it possible to purchase and transport food close to the bandit area to safe areas, crushing the communist bandits' dream of seeking food, one of the three demands policies.

Military Grain is Conscripted and Allocated on Schedule

According to the central government's regulations, from October of the 36th year to August of the 37th year, a total of 1,258,000 large bags of military grain should be conscripted and allocated. To date, four months have been allocated, totaling 430,000 large bags. The central government praised that the province's military grain can be conscripted and allocated on schedule and sent a commendation order.

Launch a Grain Sweeping Campaign

The Land and Grain Department has ordered various counties to urge the collection and sweeping of the 36th year's land and grain in order to collect all taxes and sweep all collections before the end of the year (July of the 7th year). However, since the launch of the conscription work, various counties have shifted their focus and neglected the situation of grain requisition. The provincial government has now issued a notice to various counties that grain requisition and conscription should be carried out together as two major political tasks for mobilizing in the war. They should be planned together and carried out together. Vice Director Hong of the Provincial Land and Grain Department will巡回各縣舉行掃糧運動, 按保逐甲挨戶騐串，限期售征淸楚.(本報記者和香林) also tour various counties to conduct a grain sweeping campaign, check household by household and armor by armor, and set a deadline for selling and collecting clearly.

### Ji'an Cotton Reclamation Field: Cotton, Wheat, and Rice Production Achieve Considerable Success

[Our Newspaper, Poyang, 1st Day] After the enemy's iron hooves stepped into the gateway of Jiangxi during the war, the counties with the highest cotton production in the province, such as Hukou, Pengze, Jiujiang, Ruichang, and Yongxiu, were successively abandoned. At this time, the Yongxiu Cotton Field, which was responsible for improving cotton production, also stopped working. The Academy of Agriculture, recognizing that cotton production was related to the clothing and food of soldiers and civilians, deemed it necessary to actively increase production. In mid-August of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), it established the Ji'an Cotton and Wheat Field. After half a year of surveying land, acquiring it, and organizing it, it was finally established. At the beginning of its operation, the field had 15 staff members and 70-80 farmers, with an annual operating expense of only more than 17,000 yuan. In the 30th year of the Republic (1941), Director Yu of the field requested an increase in funding and the expansion of the field by more than 700 mu.

The wheat sown in the field was mostly high-quality seeds taken from Nansuzhou, Anhui, and distributed to Nancheng, Shangrao, Yiyang, Yongxin, Wan'an, Ganxian, Linchuan, and other counties for trial cultivation. As a result of cultivation, the yield per mu increased by two dou two sheng to five sheng. The cotton seeds were taken from Guilin American cotton, Changde Tiezhi cotton, and the field's own domesticated Tuozi cotton, and specially contracted with agricultural fields in Shangrao and Guixi counties to propagate improved seeds. Recently, Yunnan Kaiyuan kapok and Fujian Longyan kapok have also been trialed, all with considerable success.

Cotton trials occupy the most land in the field, followed by paddy fields, and there is also a special experimental plot for special crops. Because the soil in all the newly developed fields has not yet been thoroughly cultivated, although the cotton plants are difficult to fully develop, they still produce many cotton bolls. The paddy fields are mostly planted with "Poyang Early Rice," which bears abundant fruit and yields a very rich harvest. In addition, special crops such as tobacco leaves, pyrethrum, mint, and castor beans all grow particularly lush.

Currently, cotton cultivation occupies 160-170 mu, with more than 20 experimental projects, divided into pure-line breeding and cultivation experiments. Wheat cultivation has been successful after variety testing and yield analysis. There are more than 30 varieties of early rice, and other crops such as castor beans, corn, soybeans, millet, and sorghum are cultivated in separate areas. The field's facilities are designed to be garden-like, with mechanized agricultural tools and technical management, in order to become a standard agricultural field in the province and serve as a demonstration.

### Guaranteeing that Every Student is Not Threatened by Losing Their Education: Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau Stated Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau has not yet decided on the tuition standards for the next semester. According to Director Li Ximou yesterday, in the current situation of drastic price fluctuations, it is difficult to set a uniform tuition standard, as the facilities of each school, the composition of the student body, and the financial capacity of the parents are different. What the Education Bureau is currently striving for is to guarantee that every student is not threatened by losing their education, while at the same time improving the situation of schools and teachers who have long been in financial difficulty, increasing equipment, engaging in further studies, and improving teachers' qualifications. Therefore, the collection of tuition fees for the next semester will, in principle, make parents with the ability to pay bear a slightly heavier burden, while strictly implementing the 25% quota of free places stipulated by the Municipal Council. General schools can only raise the number of free places above the stipulated number and cannot go below 25%. No school may refuse to admit students due to tuition fees. If a school cannot afford to pay due to the number of free students exceeding the limit, the school can provide a list, and the Municipal Education Bureau will allocate funds from scholarships and other items to subsidize it. After the above measures are thoroughly implemented, the number of free students in primary and secondary schools throughout the city can reach 80,000 to 90,000, accounting for one-fifth of the total. Even if tuition fees increase, any poor student can still avoid the threat of losing their education.

### Municipal Secondary School Principals Discuss Tuition Issues for the Next Semester

According to the principals of the municipal secondary schools yesterday, the claim that the tuition fees for the next semester are as high as more than 2.8 million yuan is absolutely untrue.

### Impoverished College Students Host Reporters Yesterday, Hoping to Expand Scholarship Quotas

[Our Newspaper] Impoverished college students from major colleges and universities in this city jointly hosted reporters at the Poor Students Association at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. They stated that with rising prices, tuition fees for the next semester are increasing sharply. Although the government authorities have established a unified scholarship system, the quota is limited, which can only solve part of the crisis of students losing their education. They earnestly requested the government authorities to expand the scholarship quota. Based on their current incomplete investigation, they estimate that 60 middle schools need scholarships to help 5,285 students. At 4 million yuan per student, 21.2 billion yuan is needed. Seventeen universities and colleges need scholarships to help 4,859 students. At 5 million yuan per student, 24.3 billion yuan is needed, totaling 45.5 billion yuan. If the price of rice rises in the future, it will be more than this figure, which is a far cry from the 15 billion yuan that the city's Unified Scholarship Review Committee plans to raise. They also stated that the scholarships originally established by the various schools have now ceased activities, and it is difficult for students to raise funds on their own, and even if they are forced, it will be of no avail. Therefore, their only hope for the authorities is to expand the scholarship quota.

### Football Association Compromises and Restores Qualifications of Yan and Li; Victory Finally Achieved on Appeal; Believes Management Neglected Duties

The Football Committee of the Sports Association, because Shi Shixin and Li Yichen were absent from the practice of the pre-selected team for the World Games, decided to cancel the qualifications of Li to represent the World Games selected team and the inter-port team. Yan and Li did not agree, and the Qingbai Sports Association also expressed dissatisfaction, so they appealed to the Football Committee's Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee issued a meeting yesterday, and the resolution on the appeal case of the two players, Yan Shixin and Li Yichen, was announced as follows after deliberation:

The players Yan Shixin and Li Yichen stated that the Football Committee canceled their qualifications to represent the inter-port team and did not allow them to participate in the World Games selection competition because they did not appear in the match on February 1st, and expressed their disagreement, requesting a judgment.

Resolution: Yan Shixin stated that he had left Shanghai on leave due to business last week, and had notified the manager Xu Wenkui before leaving. Because the plane was delayed that day, he could not appear in the match (and provided proof). According to Li Yichen, he did not receive a notice from the manager, so he did not appear in the match. Manager Xu Wenkui confirmed the matter, but did not formally report it to the Football Committee. Observing the facts, the fault lies with the manager. Yan Shixin and Li Yichen should be restored to their qualifications to represent the inter-port team and allowed to participate in the World Games selection competition. The Football Committee should handle the negligence of duty on the part of the manager Xu Wenkui.

The Qunli team applied for a judgment on the Football Committee's punishment of the team's players.

Resolution: According to the Football Committee's precedent for punishing fouls, the punishment for the team seems too severe. Yu Zhenyue should be suspended from two consecutive matches for his violent actions that led to him getting sent off. Captain Chen Yuanji was given a warning, and the team's warning remains the original sentence.

### Modern Basketball Speed Too High, Some in America Advocate Revision, Restoring Center Circle Jump Ball Can Slow Things Down, World Games Selection Tournament America Uses Old Rules

[United Press, New York, 4th] The World Games basketball elimination selection tournament is about to be held in New York, and fans are paying special attention to the selection tournament because of its two-fold appeal: first, the selection tournament can determine the champion team of the World Games; second, the center circle jump ball, which has been absent for a long time, will reappear in the selection tournament.

If a country can defeat the American basketball team in the World Games, it would be an unprecedented upset in basketball history. Therefore, the American team selected on the evening of March 31st at Madison Square Garden in New York should also be the world championship team.

World Games This Year Adopts Old Rules

Because of the war, the development of basketball in other countries has been greatly affected. This year's World Games still adopts the old rules of 1935, which is advantageous for European countries. Shortly before the outbreak of the war, the United States had already revised the old rules, abolishing the center circle jump ball and stipulating that the attacking team is not allowed to delay in the backcourt for more than ten seconds, and any player is not allowed to stand in the free throw lane in front of the basket for more than three seconds. These rules will not be adopted in this year's World Games.

The current American tactic is only offense, not defense. Long Island University coach Pickley therefore advocates restoring the center circle jump ball so that the game can be played at a slower pace. The effectiveness of his advocacy remains to be seen in this World Games selection tournament. There is more than just Gule who is dissatisfied with the drawbacks of American basketball. They are dissatisfied with many things, such as the score of each game often being 85 to 70, the speed being so high that one's neck would break, and the special emphasis on players who are six feet five to seven feet tall. Renowned referee and John Marshall University coach Begovich, University of Kansas's Dr. Allen, radio sports broadcaster Brown Toe, and once-popular player Wah Chad have all advocated revising the rules.

Giant Center Too Advantageous Under the Basket

Begovich and Brown Toe proposed that only one point should be counted for a shot made under the basket to prevent giant-like centers from scoring too many points. Begovich also supports having a jump ball in the center circle after each score, and that at least out-of-bounds balls must pass through the referee's hands before being thrown into the game. He also proposed a "delayed whistle" method: if a player breaks through into the opponent's zone and is deliberately fouled, but the ball still goes into the basket, it should count as a score. If the shot is missed, then the whistle should be blown to announce the foul.

Allen is preparing to stipulate that shooting a basket should be considered a dead ball, to prevent others from following up and tapping it in, and he also advocates restoring the jump ball in the center circle, with five people taking turns jumping. Wah Chad advocates that the distance between the hoop and the backboard should be twenty inches, and it should also be five inches higher than it is now, so that the chance of tapping in is reduced, and also to encourage accurate shooting.

The score of American basketball games is getting higher year by year, and the players are also getting taller year by year. Now, major university basketball teams have at least one player who is six feet seven inches or taller, so the above theories are constantly being discussed.

However, the 1948 World Games selection tournament and the old-style games are the first tests of the slow-paced game, so the coaches and players all say in unison that using this method to eliminate basketball teams to attend the World Games is extremely important.

### Acquiring Finished Products from Manufacturers in Four Steps

According to sources, state banks and bureaus are actively proceeding with the acquisition of finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government, and the handling procedures are striving to be simplified, so that manufacturers can obtain convenience in the turnover of funds. The handling procedure can be divided into four steps: The manufacturer fills out an application form for the acquisition of finished products to the state bank and bureau warehouse. After the various bank and bureau warehouses preliminarily review the application and send personnel to inspect the manufacturer's finished products and determine that they can be acquired, they report to the Four-Bank Branch for review. After the branch receives the application transferred from the various bank and bureau warehouses, it sends personnel to re-inspect the various factories to decide whether to acquire them. When the Four-Bank Branch believes that the products can be acquired, it submits them to the regular meeting held the next day for final decision. After the management meeting approves the acquisition, it notifies the National Bank to allocate funds and reports to the Four-Bank Head Office. From the application to the allocation of funds, the procedure can be completed in two days.

### Rice Supply Not Smooth, Sales Price Continues to Rise

As a result, the ten-pack Da Ying Lao Dao cigarettes rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and the 50-pack canned cigarettes also rebounded.

### Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products, Transportation Control Committee Announces Implementation Today, Raw Materials Allowed to be Imported Can be Divided into Two Categories

[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Management Committee announced today the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products." The person in charge of the Export Promotion Office, who is responsible for these measures, gave the following statement:

My country's handicraft products and light industrial products, such as straw hats, embroidery, enamelware, and thermos bottles, have had quite a good export performance in the past. In addition, my country's emerging industrial products, such as yarn tubes and electrical equipment, also have great export prospects. However, the manufacturing of these products mostly requires foreign raw materials. In recent years, due to the limited import of raw materials, the products of various industries have only been sufficient for domestic needs, and exports have been greatly affected. In order to assist manufacturers in obtaining more raw materials outside of the regular quotas and to encourage the export of these manufactured products, so as to achieve the effect of competing for markets and enriching foreign exchange, the committee has formulated the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products." These measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. According to these measures, the raw materials allowed to be imported can be divided into two categories. After the first category of raw materials is imported, the manufactured goods should be exported in their entirety. The purpose is to support export industries whose foundations have already been consolidated, such as the gold thread and ramie used for hat making, which is one example. After these raw materials are allowed to be imported, they can assist manufacturers in promoting exports, earning foreign exchange, and encouraging the development of certain rural handicraft side businesses without affecting the domestic supply of materials. According to the regulations of these measures, the foreign exchange sold from the export of products made from these raw materials must be at least two and a half times the foreign exchange required to import the raw materials. In addition, the quantity of raw materials imported is limited to what is directly needed to manufacture a certain quantity of export products. The purpose of importing the second category of raw materials is twofold: one is to expand export markets, and the other is to assist factories in increasing production. In other words, to enable factories to obtain raw materials outside of the quota, so as to increase their production, and to export a part of the increased production to earn foreign exchange to pay for the foreign exchange required for raw material imports. The other part will be retained for the needs of the domestic market, so as to achieve the effect of enriching materials. However, there are many types of products made from these raw materials, and the ratio between the import value of each type of raw material and the foreign exchange value that should be sold after it is made into a finished product is currently being discussed.

When manufacturers apply to import raw materials using these measures, there are two ways to handle the exchange settlement issue. First, if a manufacturer has inventory, they can apply to the committee for the raw materials they need before the goods are exported. When the goods are exported, a part of the foreign exchange earned from the export will be used to offset the foreign exchange required for the raw materials imported later. However, the ratio between the foreign exchange purchased for import and the foreign exchange sold from export should still be handled in accordance with the regulations of these measures. Second, if a manufacturer has no inventory, but the finished products made from its raw materials definitely have sales abroad, they can sell the same amount of forward export foreign exchange to the designated bank when purchasing the import foreign exchange for raw materials. As for the difference, it can be sold successively according to the provisions of Article 3 of these measures when the goods are loaded for export.

[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Export Promotion Office, according to the regulations of Articles 3 and 4 of Chapter 1 of the "Measures for Importing Manufacturing Raw Materials for Export Products," the types of raw materials in categories A, B, and C, and the ratio between the foreign exchange earned from the export of products made from raw materials in category B and the amount of foreign exchange required for raw materials, should be published by the committee after consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In order to widely solicit information on the actual situation of various industries, anyone exporting light industrial or handicraft products can come to the committee to apply in accordance with the regulations of these measures. After the application is made, the office will consult with the Ministry of Economic Affairs at any time to make regulations, so as to avoid problems afterward.

Second, Article 7 of Chapter 1 of these measures stipulates that applicants should also register with the Export Promotion Office. There is currently no registration deadline set, that is, registration will be processed at the same time when applicants come to the committee for the first time, in order to facilitate matters. However, it is still hoped that relevant industry associations will prepare detailed and concrete plans for the export of manufactured products and the import of raw materials immediately after the publication of these measures and send them to the office. After various plans have been agreed upon in principle, the various manufacturers will submit their applications separately, so as to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth trips and facilitate progress.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### On the Reasons for Death by Acupuncture and Medicine

— Liang Junqing

I previously wrote thousands of words in a certain newspaper, extensively discussing the reasons for death by acupuncture and medicine and methods to prevent it. Sadly, that newspaper had very poor circulation and didn't attract attention. Now, rumors of death by acupuncture and medicine (?) are again very prevalent, which is truly regrettable. Given the practical need, I am writing another short article on the subject.

The German pharmacology expert, Mr. Gutterup, once said, "No drug in the world is absolutely harmless. Any drug can become a deadly weapon within the human body." How profound these words are! If we can carefully savor his words and extrapolate from them, we can understand more than half of the reasons for so-called death by drugs and death by acupuncture and medicine.

Originally, the reason for using injections instead of oral administration of drugs is simply that the patient's stomach and intestines are already in a diseased state, and their absorption capacity is naturally greatly reduced. Therefore, injections are used to achieve a rapid effect of the medicine (such as all emergency medicines). Moreover, some drugs can be very irritating to the stomach and intestines when taken orally, causing vomiting or gastric paralysis. By using injections, the irritation is minimal (for example, oral Euphyllpn is very harmful to the stomach and intestines, but if injected into the muscles, there is only a slight stinging sensation, with no other pain). Therefore, such drugs must be made into injectable forms before they can be used. As for when the gastrointestinal tract has suffered trauma, cancerous tumors, or other inflammatory diseases that prevent the intake of food and water, it is even more necessary to rely on acupuncture and medicine to maintain the patient's life and preserve their nutrition (such as physiological saline and glucose solutions). This, of course, requires no further explanation from me.

However, if drugs enter the body and are handled improperly, they can become poisons and cause great harm, as mentioned above. What about injectable drugs with rapid effects? Therefore, all injectable drugs, regardless of the size of their toxicity or the amount, must undergo detailed chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological experiments before being made into injections. After being made into injections, they must undergo strict sterilization procedures before being sold on the market. All pharmaceutical manufacturers should clearly understand this, so there is no need for me to dwell on it. However, due to the lack of capital, inadequate equipment, and a shortage of talent among Western medicine manufacturers in our country, there are inevitably some who roughly manufacture substandard products. If such immature drugs are used for injection, I do not believe that problems will not occur.

Furthermore, I have another point to make. Containers for drugs are generally made of glass. The raw materials for glass are silicates and substances like potassium, sodium, and calcium, among which boric acid and baking soda are used most often. If the mixing is not proper, the resulting glass may have too much acid or too much alkali. Subsequently, if acidic drugs are stored in ampules made of glass with too much alkali, the acidic drugs inside will change due to the alkali contained in the glass. Over time, they will become harmful drugs. Conversely, if alkaline drugs are stored in acidic glass tubes, their medicinal properties will also deteriorate. Therefore, imported drugs can be stored for a long time without spoiling because the glass containers can maintain their neutrality. Nowadays, not only are injectable drugs sold on the market crudely made and substandard, but the glass ampules used to hold them are so thin that they cannot withstand a single flick of the finger. If a doctor does not carefully check the origin of the drug, whether the drug has changed color, whether the solution has precipitated or is cloudy, or whether there are small cracks in the glass tube before injecting the drug into a patient, and instead injects it rashly, I do not believe that problems will not occur. (The lyricist Mr. Xie Tihong once wrote about the fact that after injecting glucose calcium and vitamin BC more than ten times, he suddenly had a reaction and almost died. Also, Mr. Yan Duhuo of the Xinwen Bao had a similar situation with his son. I believe that if a drug is not suitable for injection, a reaction will occur immediately after one injection. Why wait until after more than ten injections before it happens? It is clear that there must have been cracks in the glass tube, causing the drug to deteriorate. The doctor did not examine it carefully and injected it rashly.)

As mentioned earlier, drugs that are not suitable for a person can become poisons once they enter the body. Therefore, when doctors treat patients, they must not only carefully consider the condition at all times before prescribing medication, but also pay close attention to the various reactions that may occur after the drug enters the body. For example, we know that patients with heart disease must take or inject heart-strengthening drugs. However, among heart-strengthening drugs, why can some be injected while others cannot, and why can some be injected today but absolutely not tomorrow? All these mysteries can only be known by those who are familiar with physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and other disciplines, and who also have many years of experience. Nowadays, the world is in chaos, and everything is out of order. Those who are cunning and deceitful often abandon the right path and obtain a certificate through dishonest means, and then use it to practice medicine. When they cure a few patients with readily available medicines, they become complacent, as if they have joined the medical community, and speak shamelessly. It is impossible for them not to cause trouble.

Xunzi said, "Be cautious and conscientious, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading on thin ice." We practice medicine in Shanghai, diagnosing patients, and we are always conscientious and self-disciplined. We know that medicine has no limits, and diseases change frequently. If we are not careful and thorough, unfortunate events can occur in an instant. Nowadays, doctors are not respected, and people often threaten to sue them in court. Therefore, doctors must be especially careful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, the selection of drugs, and the pre-injection inspection and post-injection observation of injectable substances, in order to avoid trouble. Otherwise, even if the doctor feels that they have done nothing wrong, the words of the public can be overwhelming, and all sorts of troubles will arise. Shouldn't we be careful?

A friend asked me about the reported death from intramuscular injection of vitamin B a few days ago. I replied that it is not yet definitively determined whether vitamin B itself can kill. Although I have seen several reports in the literature from various countries about reactions after injection of vitamin B, there is no sufficient proof in theory. There are many factors that could cause death, and it may not be directly caused by this. Furthermore, I do not know whether the substance injected into the patient was vitamin B or other drugs, so I cannot make a judgment. As for the claim that the patient's face changed drastically immediately after the needle was withdrawn after the vitamin B injection, I believe that this was caused by "shock." The patient's body was already weak, and they also had heart problems. Therefore, after the injection, the sensation of pain triggered a reflex action of the vagus nerve, causing the heart to stop suddenly, leading to death. Several years ago, I injected a vaccination into Miss Xie Jiahua in Shanghai. As soon as the needle was inserted, she fainted. Her mother was beside her, extremely anxious. I told her, "This is shock, there is no need to worry." Then I injected her with a camphor solution, and in less than half an hour, she returned to her original state. I do not believe that this was due to the effect of the heart-strengthening drug. Her heart was healthy, and after a certain period of time, even if there was a reflex action of the vagus nerve inhibiting the heartbeat, it would automatically return to normal. However, if Miss Xie's heart had already had a disease, I would have been in trouble. Just a laugh!

### Treatment of Scabies and Sulfur Poisoning

— Wang Juerong

Scabies—a highly contagious and very uncomfortable skin disease—is very prevalent in the inland areas. The greatest suffering for patients is the intense itching in the affected areas when the bed gets warm in the middle of the night. Because of the itching, they have to scratch, but the more they scratch, the more it itches, and the more it itches, the more they scratch, often leading to sleepless nights. Although it is not a very serious skin disease, it affects sleep and causes patients to suffer greatly in terms of mental state, so they are all eager for treatment!

Is there a specific medicine for scabies? "Yes"! That is the "sulfur preparation" that everyone knows, especially the famous "Miejie" (oil or ointment).

Can "Miejie" truly eradicate scabies? Yes! It certainly can! However, because some patients use too much, or a few patients have a special "sensitivity" to sulfur, "Miejie" is used, but scabies is not eradicated, and "sulfur poisoning" unfortunately befalls the patient!

I am not a "dermatologist," but three years ago, my second young daughter unfortunately contracted scabies from a neighbor's child. I used a very small amount of Miejie oil to rub on the affected areas every night. After two nights of rubbing, and washing her every morning, more than a dozen papules appeared on the insides of her elbows and legs on the third day, causing very severe itching. I thought that the scabies had not been cured, so I continued to rub "Miejie oil" on the third night (because I had told her to rub it for three consecutive days). On the fourth day, something was wrong! The child's face and limbs were swollen, her urine output decreased, and the itching worsened!

When I went back that night and saw this phenomenon, I knew it must be "drug poisoning"! But looking at the bottle of "Miejie oil", I had truly used only a little bit! It shouldn't have been an overdose. It was probably that this child had an "allergy" to "sulfur preparations"! (In the past, she only needed to inject a very small amount of Xiaozhilong, and red rashes would appear all over her body within half an hour. I will have another special article to describe this point next time.)

In addition to immediately stopping the use of "Miejie," because I found a lot of protein in her urine, I tried every means to detoxify her and urgently treat the "acute nephritis" caused by drug poisoning. After two weeks of treatment, the symptoms of poisoning gradually disappeared, but the nephritis turned into a chronic condition. After another three months of drug and dietary treatment, her illness was truly completely cured! This was the first time I discovered a patient's sensitivity to sulfur ointment!

A few months later, during the New Year holidays, I went to Jintan for something. Because of the recent victory, the public bridges from Danyang to Jintan were destroyed, and long-distance buses were suspended. So I returned to the transportation tools of ancient times and set off by wheelbarrow. When I got on the car, the driver, in order to attract business, guaranteed that I would arrive in Jintan by 5:00 PM! (It was only 10:00 AM when I got on the car). Who knew that by 4:30 PM, I had only traveled half the distance. When I got to Yeling Town, the driver told the truth, saying that the sky would be dark and he could not go forward. I had no choice but to spend the night in Yeling! This town also had a population of 20,000, but there were no hostels. After negotiating for an hour, I finally got the permission of the owner of the sesame cake shop to let us stay in the loft above his shop. The small building was only three feet high. We (also with a Mr. Wu) held the spirit of "a great man can bend and stretch," and stayed in the high building. The upstairs was not "empty," except for a few monthly calendars pasted on the wall, rice buckets, vinegar jars, oil bottles, sauce jars, chamber pots, and urine pots were all around! The shopkeeper kindly offered bedding (we didn't bring luggage), but I looked at the scabies marks on his hands and really dared not accept it. That day was January 2nd, and the weather was cold, no less than today (the day I wrote this manuscript, January 27th). I covered myself with my coat and barely dozed on the straw mattress. Because of the fatigue of the journey, I actually fell asleep. Mr. Wu was not able to "deeply understand my heart," and kindly covered me with "brocade quilt." When I returned from my dream and saw it, this urgency was extraordinary, but the friendship was warm and the kindness was touching, so how could I blame him! The next day, when I arrived at Jintan, I hurriedly took a bath and changed my clothes. After finishing my work, I hurried back to Shanghai, and it seemed that there were already one or two small rashes on my body. In a hurry, I didn't choose a doctor, and I invited myself. A flash of inspiration came to my mind, and I found the remaining Miejie oil from my young daughter and rubbed a little on the itchy area. It was even itchier the next day. I rubbed a little more, and the day after that, a large number of papules also appeared on my hands and legs, which were incomparably itchy! Because I had the experience of my young daughter before, I immediately stopped using Miejie. However, my head, feet, and scrotum were already swollen. That day, Professor Chang Ankun from my alma mater happened to come to my house, so I immediately asked for advice. At first, the professor couldn't immediately diagnose it. After I explained that I had used a small amount of "Miejie" and told him about my young daughter's poisoning experience, he also diagnosed it as "sulfur poisoning"! During this period, I searched through dermatology and pharmacology books, but couldn't find detailed descriptions and treatments for sulfur poisoning!

At that time, what I felt most peculiar was that the papules on the insides of my elbows and legs were about the size of mung beans, and they itched in waves, which was really unbearable! In addition to swelling, the itchy area on my neck developed wheals like cloud heads. What was especially inconvenient was the swelling of the scrotum. That day, I happened to be at the Huafu Hotel having dinner with my friend Zhong Zhifu, and I had to change into Chinese clothes temporarily. Later, after six "autologous blood" injections and six calcium injections, the symptoms of poisoning gradually subsided. During these two weeks, there were trace amounts of protein and a very heavy sulfur smell in my urine!

Six months later, in order to test the sensitivity of this skin, I specifically (for research interest) rubbed some sulfur ointment on the back of my hand. After rubbing it twice, papules began to appear again on the moist areas of my hands and legs on the fourth day! Because it was summer, I carefully studied these papules and found that they were no different from the last time. My "clinical experiment" was finally completed! (Here, I incidentally declare that when a doctor himself suffers from a certain disease, he can better understand the process of the disease! We admire the spirit of Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs!)

In the three years since then, I have paid special attention to this disease and have encountered at least thirty cases. Most of them were due to the urgency to cure scabies, so they overdosed on medicine and developed sulfur poisoning. In the early stage of poisoning, the itching of the papules led them to believe that the scabies had not been cured, so they added more medicine, adding fuel to the fire and making the situation worse!

Among the more than thirty people, those with deeper poisoning all felt severe itching in the anus and genitals! The most severe cases, three people, had swelling and exudation all over their bodies, and their body temperature suddenly increased and their urine output decreased. After the symptoms of poisoning subsided, there were also many people who suffered from chronic nephritis! Fortunately, no one died from poisoning.

Recently, I went to Beijing for something and stayed at the home of a relative. His thirteen-year-old son had also suffered from scabies before. Because he had been bathing in sulfur water too many times, he began to show signs of poisoning. Papules had been found on the inside of his elbow, and there were also wheals on his neck. The doctor diagnosed it as ordinary urticaria. At the same time, his mother thought that the scabies had not been cured, so she still bathed him in sulfur water and applied Miejie. I happened to chat with him and smelled the odor of Miejie. When I asked him about it, I discovered that he had symptoms of poisoning. I told him my experience and told him to immediately stop the sulfur bath. Sure enough, the symptoms of poisoning subsided in less than two weeks! On the way back to Shanghai, I thought that there must be many people suffering from the same disease in various places, so I wrote this article to tell those suffering from the same disease, hoping to express my sympathy!

### Prevention of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Yu Zhengxing

Respiratory infection: Transmitted by breathing in air. This is the most common way for tuberculosis to develop in the lungs. Pulmonary tuberculosis is mostly transmitted by inhalation, such as dust containing tubercle bacilli, which, after entering the body, forms tuberculous lesions. This type of transmission is harmful and common, and is usually very difficult to prevent and manage. This is called respiratory inhalation transmission, which usually occurs in two ways:

(1) Dust transmission: Sputum containing tubercle bacilli is spat on the ground. After drying, it flies with the dust, and others inhale it into their lungs, thus becoming infected. Airflow and strong sunlight are better. The dust in the patient's sickroom also has the potential for transmission and danger. Therefore, some call it a residential disease or family disease. However, in the open field, this type of sputum transmission is not easy. Due to the disinfection effect of sunlight, the risk of transmission is less.

(2) Droplet transmission: When patients talk, cough, or sneeze, if they use too much force, they can spray a large amount of droplets into the air. These droplets mostly contain tubercle bacilli. Ordinary larger droplets can be sprayed to a range of two or three feet away. Tubercle bacilli expelled from the mouth are very active and highly toxic, making transmission rapid and easy. It can directly reach the mucous membranes of others, or indirectly enter the mouth through food, fingers, and other contaminated objects. Therefore, it is easy to transmit in crowded and unclean air circulation.

Placental transmission: Although there are various reports of placental transmission of tuberculosis, it is extremely rare. As for the mixing of tubercle bacilli with sperm to enter egg cells, it cannot be proven. However, there are occasional cases where tuberculosis infection occurs through the placenta, causing the pathogens to escape into the fetal blood circulation. It is not caused by the maternal egg cells containing bacteria and being transmitted to the offspring. This type of direct transmission by the maternal placenta.

Self-inoculation: In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the sputum can cause tuberculosis in other parts of the body through injured areas. Such as laryngeal tuberculosis, skin tuberculosis. There are also cases where intestinal tuberculosis occurs due to self-ingestion of tuberculous sputum. These are all self-inoculation. Other genitourinary transfers are also easily found as secondary events due to hematogenous spread.

Early symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis

Tuberculosis is caused by a type of tubercle bacillus invading the human body and harming body tissues. The body then initiates a self-defense response, not allowing this foreign object to exist in the body. It forms a small nucleus around these tubercle bacilli, surrounds it, and eventually turns into a stone particle. Therefore, this small nucleus is the starting point of tuberculosis, which is also consumptive disease. This is the origin of what is called tuberculosis in scientific medicine. This disease-causing bacterium is therefore called the tubercle bacillus. Since the pathogen of tuberculosis is a bacterium, it is naturally an infectious disease. All those who contract this disease are infected with tubercle bacilli. If they encounter people with strong resistance, or if the number of tubercle bacilli invading is small, or because it is not a very virulent type, it will not cause harm. Conversely, they will be harmed. It can even become severely ulcerated, spread elsewhere, and become unmanageable, causing the patient to die. Almost no part of the human body cannot be harmed, and the lungs are the most commonly affected organ. Patients in the early stages of tuberculosis often have no significant symptoms, so very few people know they are sick and seek treatment early. By the time the symptoms are obvious, the disease is severe, and it is often incurable:

Pulmonary tuberculosis is not an incurable disease. If patients in the early stages can take good care of themselves, eight or nine out of ten can be completely cured. However, in the early stages, it is most easily overlooked. The so-called early stage refers to the initial stage of the disease. At this time, there are no significant symptoms. Patients may feel coughing, slight fever in the afternoon, and fatigue. They suspect it is a cold, or a chronic addiction, or neurasthenia. Therefore, they are mistaken again and again, and by the time the disease is serious and deep-rooted, it is difficult to treat. (To be continued)

### Where is the Candlestick?

— Bai Yong

The New Testament Matthew Chapter 5, Verse 15 says:

"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house."

I find this saying very meaningful. Doesn't China also have the same saying: "I wish the monarch's heart would turn into a bright candle, not shining on a brocade banquet, but shining all over the refugee houses"? Isn't it the concluding sentence of the poem "Cure the sore before your eyes, but cut out the flesh of your heart"? But although the poem says so, it is not easy to do. Honestly speaking, shining on a brocade banquet is ultimately more comfortable than refugee houses, and it can also avoid some sense of responsibility. Passively speaking, the people of Wei and Jin said: "Grease and fire burn from the front, talent is a source of harm." It's not necessarily about whether you shine on the suffering of other refugees, but you must first burn yourself, which is a major taboo for Chinese gentlemen of "preserving oneself wisely."

The invention of fire is truly a tragic history, which also symbolizes the difficulty of obtaining light. In Western mythology, Prometheus was imprisoned for stealing fire to mankind. Could it be that the omnipotent God, who aims to nurture all things, did not want mankind to have light and heat? Or does he think that light and heat are the exclusive property of God, the treasures of the gods, and that if humans steal them, they might lose God's rice bowl? This is really difficult to guess. The Chinese Zhurong clan also seems to have had wars when creating fire. I wonder how far the system of Jesus is from the gods and men of Greece, to be able to say such insightful words, no wonder he became an idol worshipped by mankind.

Even with pure lamps, don't you believe that there are those placed under a bushel? I remember when I was studying in middle school, someone used a cotton quilt to block the window and lit an oil lamp to play pai gow, hiding it from the training director as if it were an iron bucket. Light also needs "light" in the world, but darkness also needs "light." In this sense, you can't say that every candlestick is useful. The problem is where it is lit.

The young ladies in the Grand View Garden of the Dream of the Red Chamber often said: "Our Baoyu is an eight-foot candlestick, he can see others, but he can't see himself." This is not a good thing, it means that he is clear about blaming others, but ignorant of his own sins. However, if you take it out of context, then seeing others but not seeing yourself is an extraordinary sacrifice, which is the same as what the Bible says above, "it gives light unto all that are in the house." This is the spirit of a Bodhisattva who sacrifices himself to feed a hungry tiger. Li Yishan's poem says "The wax candle turns to ashes, and the tears begin to dry," although it is compared to love, in fact, as a wax candle, one cannot help but shed tears for one's own sacrifice. Therefore, I think of that Shanghai slang, do you really think that sacrificing yourself is foolish?

People are rational animals, or people are the spirit of all things, I have long believed that it should be discounted. Deer call each other to eat, fish keep each other moist, this is the spirit that humans lack most. One day I saw the way people crowded around the bus stop, and I was filled with emotion. My friend laughed and said: "Don't think that people can crowd just because there are more people. Even if there are only two people who have the same reasons, so when it comes to the rice bowl, of course they will argue with arms and rage, and even use their own strength to fight until the blood flows like a river. ——Being able to compete openly, such as elections, is still okay, but there are even some people who use the way of kicking someone when they are down, which is even worse than fish and deer.

People because the real candlesticks are buried under the bushel, the needed to see the hidden can not be achieved, so they have to put their hope in myths, what Qin mirror hanging high, what burning rhinoceros illuminating the monster, always thinking of having a sacred fire, or a dust-free treasure mirror, to shine out the faces of those dragon turtles and snake gods, even if there is no Zhou Chu down the water to kill clean, at least can know what to avoid. So, aren't these myths and poems the crystallization of the blood and tears of the people?

### Genius and Morbidity

— Ji Mu

Historically, many geniuses have been morbid, but some geniuses have also possessed sound physiques. Some have explained the morbid nature of genius by saying it is due to overwork. Their nervous systems, arteries, and so on are often overworked.

According to American books, composers like Chopin, poets like Keats, and writers like Stevenson were all consumptive geniuses. The first two died young, while Stevenson lived longer. If they had been able to cure their chronic diseases in their lifetimes, would they have been unable to write first-class masterpieces? Of course, no one dares to say for sure, but to those who believe that genius must suffer from deformities, it seems that the first step for a young person to realize their dream of genius is to contract lung disease!

When we mention morbid geniuses, we naturally cannot forget the two great English poets, Scott and Byron. They were contemporaries who both suffered from infantile paralysis in childhood, which was never cured throughout their lives. Scott's disease was in his right leg, while Byron's was in his left leg.

Byron's left ankle was weak and powerless, and his foot would twist when he exerted himself. However, he was an athletic person who loved swimming and riding. He spent a lot of time moving around on weekdays, trying to keep his body from "getting fat," so as not to affect his beautiful appearance.

As for Scott, his ankles were still strong, but his right leg was shorter than his left by several inches. He was also a swimmer and loved outdoor activities. He may have spent more time riding horses outdoors than Byron. The biggest difference between the two was their different personalities. Scott was naturally optimistic, generous to friends, and loved to tell jokes. Byron, on the other hand, was melancholy and cynical. He liked to mock the world, perhaps because of his illness. Although Scott suffered from the same disease, he did not lose his temper easily. If we say that Byron's lameness was the reason for his fame, then how do we explain Scott's actions, which were no different from ordinary people? In fact, both enjoyed great fame, and even if they had no physical defects, their works would still be immortal.

Finally, Queen Elizabeth of England, whose achievements shone brightly, also suffered from a strange disease, which is also a historical mystery. She was an extraordinary woman and an outstanding ruler. Although she very much hoped to find a suitable husband, have children, and raise a family, she never married. Of course, many people wanted to marry her.

According to historians, Queen Elizabeth inherited some incurable disease from her father, Henry VIII. According to a secret revealed by a man named Baggio at the home of his friend Clement one evening in 1619, fifteen years after the Queen's death, the Queen had an unspeakable "special gift," and a French doctor intended to perform surgery to remove it, but the Queen hesitated and the doctor died before her.

In short, there is a connection between genius and morbidity. It is difficult to say which is the cause and which is the effect. Some geniuses get sick because of debauchery or indulgence in pleasure, while others, like our Taishigong, only devoted themselves to writing after becoming ill and disabled. The relationship between the two varies from person to person.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (64)

When Yuru arrived at Qiyun's house for a visit, it was Little Wang's mother who came to open the door. Seeing an old man who wanted to see Qiyun and asking her surname, Yuru took out a business card and told Little Wang's mother: "I am from Xu Zhu's family. Go and tell her, and your boss will know." Little Wang's mother, upon hearing that he was from Zhu Qi's family, looked at Yuru a couple of times, guessing that he was probably Zhu Qi's father. She hurriedly took the business card and rushed in to tell Qiyun, whispering, "I think that old man is probably Mr. Xu's grandfather." As she spoke, she looked at Qiyun with a doubtful gaze. Qiyun, upon seeing the business card, could not help but be startled. She thought to herself, "Why would Zhu Qi's father come to me in person? Maybe Zhu Qi has already explained it to his family, so the old man came to see me today. But why didn't Zhu Qi tell me beforehand? And why didn't he come with him today?" Thinking this, she said to Little Wang's mother, "Please invite him in!" Then, thinking that the old people she remembered from the past were all diligent, thrifty, and simple, she needed to give him a good impression at their first meeting. She couldn't meet him in her pajamas. So, she called Little Wang's mother back and said, "Please ask him to wait in the living room. I'll change my clothes and come soon." She walked to the changing room, took off her slippers, put on leather shoes, and picked out a gray woolen cheongsam to put on. Only then did she go to the living room. Upon seeing Yuru, she bowed deeply and respectfully. She received the tea from Little Wang's mother's hand and offered it with both hands, then offered cigarettes. She stood aside, not daring to sit down, acting entirely as a junior. Yuru looked her up and down, seeing that she had a clever face and was dressed simply. Her manners were respectful and courteous, completely the attitude of a refined lady, which was unexpected. He asked her to sit down, but she insisted on not sitting. So, he said, "I have a few words to discuss with you today. Please sit down." Qiyun then sat down on a chair below him, sitting sideways. Yuru said with a smile on his face, "I've heard that you are a lady from a prominent family, knowledgeable and well-mannered. Meeting you today, I see that the rumors are true! Zhu Qi has good taste." Qiyun, upon hearing Yuru call her a lady from a prominent family, was both surprised and happy. Then, hearing Yuru say that Zhu Qi had good taste... she lowered her head shyly, assuming that he would bring up the matter of marriage. In the eyes of the older generation, it was nothing more than talking about thrift and diligence, and the lack of property, etc. She had already decided that no matter how the old man described their poor life, she would agree to everything, which would make him happy. Qiyun was filled with wishful thinking, but then Yuru sighed. Qiyun quickly looked up and saw him stroking his beard, staring at her face, and shaking his head, saying, "What a pity! What a pity!"

### Occasional Thoughts

— Nian Hong

Walking through the bustling city in the dim evening.

Looking up, I saw the crescent moon. Although the moon in the cold night is clear, there is absolutely no room for you to appreciate it on this busy street. Moving my gaze down from the moon, I saw the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" as if they were presented in mid-air. Suddenly, a faint smoke wafted between the glittering words. Looking closely, it turned out to be the smoke rising from the top of the International Hotel. At this moment, looking around, the flashing neon lights and the noisy voices of people are truly a picture of "universal peace."

Occasionally, I thought of the news reported a few days ago about the restriction of electricity consumption for users, and the story of many factories that had to stop production because the power company was overloaded due to the increasing use of electric heaters and water heaters. I couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion towards this black behemoth towering over the city, an emotion that anyone would have. Since this feeling is something that anyone would have, it is of course unnecessary to write it down, so as not to waste this precious space.

But I think how much better it would be if I didn't have this "occasional thought." In this prosperous world, with its dense population, water heaters and electric lights turn winter into spring and restore light to darkness. A series of beautiful words, given the hateful "occasional thought," all turn into problems and contradictions, becoming ugly and unbearable. In the ballroom, the lights are bright and the wine is green, but an occasional thought reminds me of the frozen corpses by the roadside. During the New Year and Spring Festival, the gongs and drums are deafening, but an occasional thought reminds me of the debts that have not been repaid. Sitting comfortably in a car speeding down the street, an occasional thought reminds me of Zhang Fei, who pushed Zhuge Liang across the bridge...

Once, I decided to stop thinking altogether, even if it was such an occasional thought. "Ignorance is bliss," especially in this era. However, everyone has had the experience of insomnia. The more a person wants to fall asleep, the more awake they feel. My situation of "quitting thinking" was just like a person with insomnia trying to fall asleep. The more I tried not to think, the more I thought. In the end, it was almost random thinking, fantasies, dreams, thinking east and west, thinking wildly, even thinking about why I wanted to think in the first place. An occasional thought could be ignored, but a series of questions that needed answers really tormented me.

There is no absolute freedom or thing in the world, only thinking is a freedom that is endowed to people and can never be violated. Despite prohibitions and mandatory compliance, thinking is free and unrestrained. A prisoner in prison is deprived of all freedom, but the freedom to think will never be lost. In the midst of gunfire, you can think of a peaceful and prosperous world; in high society, you can think of male bandits and female prostitutes. Anyway, only you know what you are thinking. Even if thinking is forbidden, what evidence do you have to prove that my thinking is wrong? Therefore, it is easy to prevent everything, but it is impossible to prevent people's thoughts forever.

However, although thinking is a right and freedom endowed to everyone, not everyone can use it properly. Some people have never even thought that they have the freedom to think. Every morning, they get up, eat three meals, drink a cup of tea, and follow the actions of others, acting for the actions of others, thinking nothing. No, they do think, thinking about how to sleep an extra hour today. Some people are indeed good at thinking, but what they are thinking about is how to turn other people's things into their own things, and to take other people's property as their own. Roosevelt thought about how to organize the United Nations, while Tojo Hideki thought about how to launch the Pearl Harbor attack. It is the same thought, but the results are completely different.

Thinking this way, I cherish my God-given freedom, and I feel a little apprehensive, afraid to think wildly, but afraid not to think, because if I don't think, I am afraid of becoming a walking corpse, a wine bag and rice sack, and wild thoughts are afraid of turning me into a madman or a criminal. And how to make what I think appropriate, and how to put what I think into action, is exactly the question I always yearn to answer.

### Blacks Despising Each Other

— Jin Jin

In Chinese literary circles, there is an idiom called "writers despising each other." A few years ago, it was used by fashionable essayists as a subject for satirical short essays. The emotions between people are so bizarre that, regardless of blood ties or profession, the closer the relationship, the greater the jealousy and the deeper the hostility. So-called unfortunate events such as "filial impiety" and "fratricide" ultimately occur within a family.

In a similar state of mind, I read about the event of "blacks despising each other."

It is said that during World War II, the movement of troops in various places was frequent. American blacks and French West African blacks, who had rarely had the opportunity to meet before, met in North Africa. West African blacks were very jealous of American blacks because the latter's equipment and supplies were superior to those of the French army. At the same time, they also looked down on their "compatriots," believing that their status was higher because they belonged to the troops who went to the front line to fight, while most American blacks served in the rear of the battlefield. Another reason why West African blacks despised them was that they claimed to be descendants of a lineage of "free men." On the other hand, American blacks were descendants of slaves.

Moreover, West African blacks could speak fluent French, and they boasted that their cultural level was superior. On one occasion, a West African black soldier was chatting with two French civilians. An American black soldier barged in and greeted them in broken French. The West African black soldier glanced at him contemptuously, shrugged his shoulders, and said to the Frenchmen: "Look, here comes an uncivilized idiot!"

### Old Yan and His Former Generals

— Xue Shou

On the fifth page of the newspaper on the 28th of last month, a half-length portrait of General Yan (Xishan) was published. He still had the same spirit as he did thirty-seven years ago, with only a few more white hairs. He was originally General Fu (Zuoyi)'s former superior. After Fu was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of North China, the Baoding and Zhangyuan Pacification Commissioner's Offices were abolished. Although Shanxi was one of the five provinces, Old Yan's Pacification Director was still in place. The "Jin" of the five provinces was only interpreted as "North Jin." This was reasonable in that the government was giving preferential treatment to an elder statesman and Fu was respecting an old marshal.

Old Yan was not only General Fu's old marshal, nor was he only an old predecessor to the generals in North China, but he was also the "Shanxi Military Governor" of the year before the founding of the Republic, and was one of the first governors at the same time as Li Yuanhong of Hubei and Yin Changheng of Sichuan. At that time, the revolutionary military governments of various provinces used the ancient name "Military Governor" to show that they were different from the Qing government's "Governor-General and Governor." Later, during the Yuan Shikai era, it was changed to "General," and during the Duan Qirui regime, it was changed to "Military Governor." The appointments of Li Yuanhong, Cao Kun, and others also had the names "Director" and "Supervisor." Therefore, "Military Governor" only existed for a short period from the revolution to the early Republic. Many military governors have long been dead, and now only one Old Yan remains, who can be called the "last fruit" of the military governors.

Looking back from today to Cao Kun, Zhang Zuolin, Wang Zhanyuan, Li Chun, Wu Peifu, and others more than twenty years ago, some of them had been "President," "Grand Marshal," and some had been "Inspector General" and "General," but now they have all been sleeping underground for ten or twenty years. In fact, in terms of military qualifications, they were all Old Yan's juniors. When Old Yan was a military governor, Cao Kun, Zhang Zuolin, and Wang Zhanyuan were only division commanders. Wu Peifu was under Cao Kun and was promoted from regimental commander to brigade commander. As for Feng Yuxiang, he was only a battalion commander, and his position was far below that of Old Yan's military governor.

In recent twenty years, Yan and Feng have been mentioned together, which was caused by their participation in the National Revolutionary Army in 1926. At that time, the "Three Zhangs" were entrenched in a corner, resisting the Northern Expedition (the Three Zhangs were Zhang Zuolin, Zhang Zongchang, and Zhang Xueliang). Feng had already turned against Old Zhang, while Yan was being strongly wooed by Old Zhang. Unexpectedly, Yan had already submitted to the National Government, and sent Fu Zuoyi to launch a solitary attack on Youyan, occupying Zhuozhou, and attacking Zhangjiakou in Chahar on the other hand. Old Zhang angrily wanted to use green gas cannons. Yan telegraphed to Zhang Zuolin, calling him "Marshal Zhang Yu," implying that he did not recognize his self-established "Grand Marshal." Old Zhang replied by telegraph, denying the green gas cannon incident, referring to himself as "This Grand Marshal" in the telegram, but Old Yan still ignored it. In 1928, the Northern Expedition was successful, and Yan and Feng each led an army, resulting in a "parallel" situation. In 1930, Wang Jingwei played a set of "expanded meetings" in Beiping, and the two generals Yan and Feng also put together some martial scenes. Therefore, people's impression of the two generals was like the "Yang Family Generals," "Jiao is inseparable from Meng, and Meng is inseparable from Jiao."

However, now the two have long since parted ways. Old Yan still holds on to his forty-year-old territory (Shanxi), which is a unique record for an old general. Not only have the old military governors of the early Republic all decayed, but none of the junior military marshals can remain in one province forever and defend their hometown. It is not difficult to review and know that Old Yan's "military governor qualifications" and Old Yan's leadership of Shanxi are both different from others. Because "Yan is inseparable from Shanxi, and Shanxi is inseparable from Yan," when Northerners mention it, they often call him "an authentic Old Yanxi" (it was customary in the old capital to call people from Shandong Old Dong, and people from Shanxi Old Xi. Yan led Shanxi for forty years, so he is an Old Xi who is old and even older).

Those who have experienced many places, those who obey orders do not last long, Shaanxi, Henan, Gansu, Chahar, Northwest, Shandong, military governors, supervisors, all have been done, promotions and transfers, like flowing water, and now they are flowing to the New World, which is in sharp contrast with Yan's old age in one place. Feng, since the Zhili-Fengtian War in 1924, turned his back on the Zhili faction and returned to the old capital, imprisoned Cao Kun, and expelled Pu Yi, with a full head of steam. Wu Peifu was dragged down by him. Therefore, Old Zhang had the deepest antipathy towards Feng, and would rather join hands with his old enemy Zhang Zuolin to fight Old Feng. Although Zhang Zuolin won Feng's strength in the Second Zhili-Fengtian War and overthrew Cao Kun, he soon turned against him, resulting in the Fengtian-Guominjun War in 1925. (Feng's troops called themselves the National Army.) Feng had not only not an old territory in the North, but also not a single long-term friend.

Yan and Feng had many talented generals under them, but Yan's troops were especially strong. In recent years, most of them have joined the National Army, directly under the Central Government, and are serving the country, sweeping away the colors of the former warlord factions, which is a great progress and a good phenomenon in the military.

The most outstanding of Old Yan's former subordinates is of course General Fu, the current Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Five Provinces of North China, with a great reputation and remarkable achievements, shouldering the heavy responsibility in the North, like the Great Wall. Furthermore, General Xu Yongchang, at the beginning of the victory, represented China and went to Japan to meet with MacArthur and the Allied countries to jointly accept the surrender. He witnessed the Japanese Shigemitsu Mamoru and Umezu Yoshijiro bowing and signing the agreement, completing a major and glorious mission. Also, General Shang Zhen, who served as Chairman of Hebei and Shanxi alternately with General Xu, was an envoy to foreign countries, promoting national prestige, and was both a civil and military talent, experienced at home and abroad, and was a rare talent. As for Old Feng's former subordinates, only Sun Lianzhong served in the Eleventh War Zone during the Anti-Japanese War, with outstanding combat achievements. In the past two years, as Chairman of Hebei and Pacification Director, there has not been much performance. He has now been transferred to the capital, because his previous work is sufficient to record. In addition, people such as Song Zheyuan and Zhang Zizhong had already broken away from the private system, served the country loyally, and died in their duties. As far as the present is concerned, Feng's former subordinates are all withered. (Written in the old capital on January 31)
