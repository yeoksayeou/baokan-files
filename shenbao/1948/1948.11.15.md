After a day and night of fierce fighting following our powerful forces' interception, over 5,000 bandits were killed. Observers generally believe that this move by the bandit army was an attempt to reverse their decline on the eastern Xuzhou front, but their attempt has clearly failed.

[Report from our Xuzhou office, 14th] The powerful national army advancing eastward captured the important strongholds of Yangjiaoshan, Dengjiale, Fanjiahu, and the eastern and western Liang villages, located seven kilometers south of Damiao, at 2 PM yesterday, annihilating the entire 11th bandit column and routing the 2nd and 7th columns. The remaining bandits fled eastward, and the national army followed and pursued them. At 3 PM this afternoon, the important strongholds of Mashan, located four kilometers southwest of Daxujia, were captured. The national army from the north and south will officially join forces in Mashan. Thus far, the 2nd, 7th, and 11th bandit columns have been eliminated. The national army is confident of victory in the Xuzhou campaign and is continuing to advance rapidly eastward.

[Report from our Xuzhou office, 14th] The powerful national army advancing eastward launched an attack on the main force of the bandit Chen's 1st, 7th, and 10th columns in the mountainous area 20 kilometers east of Xuzhou and south of Damiao on the morning of the 13th. The national army's land, air, artillery, and mechanized units launched a fierce attack on the bandits. In two hours of fierce fighting, they captured important strongholds such as Dengzhuang, Weizhuang, Shengjia'an, Xiaoji, Yinshan, and Xueshan, killing and wounding over 5,000 bandits. They also surrounded a bandit regiment at Jianshan, and are currently concentrating on annihilating them, seizing over twenty light and heavy machine guns, over seven hundred rifles, and over ten artillery pieces.

The aforementioned strongholds are all located in mountainous areas 40 to 50 li southwest of Nianzhuang. The bandits stationed troops at each stronghold to resist and delay our advance, but the national army destroyed them one by one. The fighting was extremely fierce, and the fields were littered with bandit corpses, with the remnants fleeing in all directions. The eastward advancing forces have annihilated a total of eight bandit regiments in the past three days, including three regiments at Damiao and Yuanshan, two regiments at Xiaoji, and one regiment each at Jianshan, Dingjialou, and Dongzhuang. The lead tank units of the eastward advancing forces are not far from Nianzhuang.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] According to front-line news at 12 noon on the 14th, General Qiu Qingquan's forces, advancing eastward, repelled the gradual resistance of the Qian bandit's 1st, 7th, and 10th columns in the Damiao area on the 13th, and continued to advance eastward in a fan shape with overwhelming force. Among them, the tanks commanded by Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo were approaching Nianzhuang. On the morning of the 14th, large formations of B-24 type aircraft from the air force also flew over Nianzhuang to provide support. The Huang forces, who were firmly defending Nianzhuang, were breaking out from the core to cooperate with the Qiu forces in a combined attack on the stubborn bandits. A grand and heroic battle of annihilation is currently unfolding on the vast plains west of the Grand Canal and south of the Bulao River, and the bandits are beginning to collapse.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] In the Xuzhou campaign, another major battle, following Nianzhuang, has now formed on the southern front of Xuzhou near the suburbs of Suqian County. Four columns of Chen and Liu's bandit forces and a portion of local communists, detouring south from the western flank of Xuzhou, infiltrated the southern section of the Jinpu Railway after passing through Yongcheng and Xiaoxian, and began to invade Suqian County before dawn this morning. Fierce fighting is still ongoing as of noon. Powerful national army forces are advancing towards the outer edges of Suqian County from both the north and south.

### Bandit Army Disregards Humanitarianism and Releases Large Amounts of Poison Gas

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] After our eastern front Huang forces defeated the advance of more than nine columns of Chen Yi's bandit forces on the line between Nianzhuang and Bayiji on the 13th, the bandits, in order to salvage their declining morale, disregarded humanitarianism and acted like beasts, releasing large amounts of suffocating and tear gas in the area north of Zhao Zhuang Bayiji on the evening of the 13th. Over 400 of our officers and soldiers on that line were poisoned at the time, and one of our battalions at Zhao Zhuang was completely poisoned, suffocating and sacrificing themselves. All of our officers and soldiers on the entire line were filled with outrage at this cruel and brutal national traitor, and vowed to never coexist with them. Some of the rescued officers and soldiers are still in a coma due to a lack of medical supplies. Our army has taken photographs and reported the incident. It has been found that the bandit army that released the poison gas was the New 8th Column and the 3rd Column, which were attacking our southeast sides. When our army was poisoned, it was during the bandits' counterattack at night, and our army hopes that people of justice around the world will issue warnings to the bandits.

### The Bandit Army Attacking Taiyuan Hesitates and Does Not Advance; Yesterday, There Was a Silence Like the Calm Before a Storm; The National Army Strengthens Its Deployment and a Large-Scale Battle of Annihilation Is About to Break Out

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th] The battle situation in the suburbs of Taiyuan on the 14th was like the calm before a storm. Only sparse artillery fire could be heard in the area within ten li of the city's eastern perimeter. This is because the attacking bandits have gradually entered our pre-arranged fortress fire zone and are showing signs of hesitation. The bandits are currently actively reorganizing and building fortifications, and the national army is also strengthening its deployment. A certain military observer predicts that a large-scale battle of annihilation will break out in the eastern suburbs within days. Our iron wing units are soaring in the sky all day long, carrying out reconnaissance and bombing of the bandits.

[Report from our Beiping office, 14th] After the fall of Nanbeiyan and Naoma on the outskirts of Taiyuan, the Taiyuan war has become urgent near the suburbs.

[Report from our Gubeikou office, 13th] Due to strategic planning, the national army in Chengde took the initiative to withdraw on the 12th. Provincial Chairman Sun Du led all staff members and personnel from various agencies to relocate to Miyun on the same day, under the cover of the original military steps. A large number of pedestrians are expected to pass through Gubeikou on the 14th. This reporter also withdrew to the area at the same time and arrived safely in Gubeikou on the 13th. Having witnessed all the scenes of the retreat, I have a detailed understanding. (1) At 8 AM, all sentry posts in the city were removed, order collapsed, and mobs scrambled to loot each other. All agencies were ransacked. (2) The rearguard of the defending army launched a feigned attack eastward toward Chengde at midnight, detouring north of Chengde, so the bandit army did not dare to advance rashly. (3) At 3 PM, 300 Chengde self-defense forces in the rear were intercepted by bandits in the Luan River. (4) At 5 PM, the bandit army patrolled to Sengmao Mountain and fired multiple shells at the city and the detached palace. Knowing it was an empty city, they began to descend the mountain and occupy Chengde. (5) It was discovered that the bandit army occupying Chengde was Li Yunchang's 9th Column, numbering about ten thousand people. Other local bandits and the vanguard bandit units had followed suit and fled westward. On the 13th, Zhangbaiwan on the Cheng-Gu road was also occupied by the bandits. The foremost defense line of the national army was set up around Luanping, and both sides were at daggers drawn. Gubeikou seems to have approached the prelude to the siege and defense.

[Report from our Gubeikou office, 14th] The withdrawal from Chengde has been successfully completed on the 14th to fulfill its proactive mission. Unshipped military-affiliated residual materials and the Lian Guan She Building were burned. Only a small number of agency staff members failed to evacuate, while the main equipment of the Telegraph Bureau was secretly withdrawn to the west with the army beforehand, and its effectiveness was uninterrupted, which is particularly gratifying. Other communications such as the post office and economics such as the bank all arrived completely in Gubeikou, but 3,000 tons of civilian grain collected from the autumn protection work did not have time to be transported out. Reporter's note: Since the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the province has been occupied for 13 years. After the victory, the provincial government was established in Chongqing on October 16 of the 34th year of the Republic of China. After the New Year, Liu Duoquan followed the army and stationed in Chaoyang. Chengde was recovered on August 29 of the 35th year of the Republic of China. The government-controlled area had reached up to 16 counties. After June of this year, only Chengde and the Cheng-Gu line remained. For the past three years, the military has been solely supported by Shi Jue's forces, and the political affairs have been changed three times by Liu Duoquan, Fan Hanjie, and Sun Du.

He has a complete plan for adapting to the current situation and reforming the military and political affairs of North China, and will begin to implement the powers granted by the central government with a firm pace, including the strengthening of military forces, the training of the people, and the unified allocation of all manpower and materials for combat. He will also uniformly command the central government's agencies and state-owned enterprises in North China. This morning, Fu revealed the details of the new policy for the first time in an excited and firm tone, first emphasizing the need to refresh the institutions in peacetime. The North China Suppression Headquarters will establish an agency similar to a political affairs committee, concentrating command of the military, political, economic, and cultural and educational departments of North China, and cultivating a large number of new cadres to take on arduous tasks. As for the existing provincial, municipal, and county institutions, they will be reduced to the minimum possible extent, and a large number of cadres will be extracted to implement talents and funds in the countryside, requiring civil servants to perform village duties day and night. Fu stated: He does not restrict those who are wavering from flowing south, and is willing to help solve transportation problems to promote their early departure and purify the ranks.

### Ambassador Gu Says in Washington That We Need One Billion US Dollars in US Aid; Two-Thirds Should Be Military Aid; Appeals to the United States to Issue a Declaration of Its China Policy

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 13th that the Chinese government needs approximately one billion US dollars in aid to continue fighting the communist army, but even without aid, China will continue to fight. Gu emphasized that one billion US dollars is only an approximate figure so that ordinary people can know how much China needs. Gu appealed for the release of a statement of US policy towards China to show sympathy and support for China's fight against communism, because China needs material assistance, and also needs moral and spiritual assistance. He said that this declaration could boost the morale of the military and civilians. Gu emphasized the importance of speedy emergency assistance and said that long-term plans are being discussed in principle.

When asked what kind of assistance was most urgently needed, Gu replied: Military equipment and ammunition, because the situation must first be stabilized. He also said: In addition to emergency assistance, a long-term assistance plan is also necessary.

Ambassador Gu confirmed the reports from Nanjing and Paris that Sino-US officials are holding talks in Washington. He said that the figures have not yet been discussed, but approximately one billion US dollars in aid is needed, of which approximately two-thirds should be military aid and one-third should be economic aid. Because this huge plan will take a lot of time, China needs rapid and concrete assistance. Due to the seriousness of the current situation, "we hope that there will be more and faster ways to help China."

Gu continued: Those who criticize the corruption of the Chinese government should read the government's records of eliminating corruption and its systematic efforts. In 1947, 14,000 government employees (mostly local government employees) were arrested for being accused of corruption, and 9,000 cases were convicted, many of which have been executed, including one major general and one colonel each.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Democratic Congressman Mansfield, who was sent by the late President Roosevelt as an observer to China during the war, proposed on the 13th that the United States adopt a bipartisan policy on the issue of aid to China, just like the aid to Europe. However, calling a special session of Congress to discuss aid to China can only be done by the President after being advised by Secretary of State Marshall.

Editorial

### Crying for Mr. Chen Bu Lei

Mr. Chen Bu Lei, National Policy Advisor to the President, passed away suddenly from a heart attack at 8:00 PM on the 13th. The coffin will be sealed in Nanjing today. When the sad news spread, whether acquainted or unacquainted, all upright and righteous people mourned the passing of this giant of his generation. Especially for us journalists, we must weep bitterly for the passing of Mr. Chen, who came from the ranks of standard news reporters to assist the government. Mr. Chen's death is not only a great loss to the Kuomintang, but also a great loss to the nation and society. At this time of national crisis, we feel so overwhelmed by national affairs that we are almost at the point of being unable to cry. Today, this experienced man has passed away prematurely, which only adds to the pain in our hearts!

Mr. Chen's life was burning with patriotism and the desire to save the world. Believing firmly in the Three Principles of the People for revolution and nation-building, and with the ambition of "serving the nation through writing," he worked as a journalist for fifteen years. During the Xinhai Revolution, he wrote articles in the Tianduo Daily, advocating the revolutionary movement. Before and after the Northern Expedition, Mr. Chen presided over the editorial policy of the Shanghai Shangbao in Shanghai. His daily editorials were highly respected throughout the country and were known as "Thunder." This can be said to be the golden age of Mr. Chen's journalistic career. Later, he followed the President into politics for twenty years. As a staff member, he shared the leader's burdens day and night. Most of the important letters, telegrams, and declarations issued by the President in the past twenty years were written by Mr. Chen. Especially during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, he drafted proclamations for the President. With his brilliant writing skills, he truly moved countless people and inspired countless patriots! He truly had the effect of "encouraging the weak and reforming the stubborn." When we read Mr. Chen's works, although we cannot praise him like Su Zizhan praised Han Changli, saying that his works could "revive the decline of the Eight Dynasties and save the drowning of the world," Mr. Chen's works, because of his sincere faith and deep emotions, were full of passion, making readers feel that every word was sincere and earnest, and every sentence was just and forceful, and they were unconsciously moved by them. Every word and every sentence in the articles drafted by Mr. Chen can be said to have been written with the last drop of blood in his heart. Mr. Chen himself often said: "Everyone says that I can write, but in fact, I can only do my best." The so-called doing his best is his sincerity, his passion, and that is what touches the hearts of readers the most.

Putting aside Mr. Chen's writings, his morality is even more awe-inspiring. He firmly believed in the Three Principles of the People, strictly adhered to our nation's five thousand years of national culture, and because he was not only a man of passion but also a man of reason, his faith was so deep that in today's world of declining morality and writing, perhaps no one could surpass him. Moreover, Mr. Chen's indifference to fame and wealth and his strict self-discipline were even more rare. He followed the President into politics for twenty years, and he always had the opportunity to become a "high official" and the possibility of making a "great fortune." However, he would rather spend his life working with words and remain a staff member for life. Speaking of his private life, it was even more difficult and miserable. He always maintained the style of a scholar, enduring hardships and being content with his situation, never thinking about it. Until the last moment of his life, what he missed most was not his posthumous affairs, but still the future of the nation and the country. Truly, as Fan Zhongyan said, "Be the first to worry about the world's troubles, and the last to enjoy its pleasures." He can be called a national hero without any exaggeration.

Usually, when we talked to Mr. Chen about national affairs, he always worried about the future of the country and was concerned about the leader's hard work. Mr. Chen had long intended to retire and recuperate due to his poor health, but when he thought about the leader's day and night hard work, he felt that it was his duty to do his best despite his illness. Mr. Chen's patriotism and his love for the leader are rare among the people in the government and the public. Mr. Chen understood the current national affairs most thoroughly, and he saw the overall situation of the world most clearly. He had a grand plan to turn the tide, but Heaven did not grant him long life. Mr. Chen passed away prematurely. As far as Mr. Chen himself is concerned, it can be said that he has done his best and given his all until his death, and his spirit in heaven can rest in peace. However, we, the people of the whole country, having been shocked by the death of this giant, should take this as a starting point, redouble our efforts, carry forward Mr. Chen's spirit of righteousness and courage, and turn the tide to comfort Mr. Chen's spirit in heaven.

### Mei Ruao Expresses Opinion, Advocates for Trying Emperor Hirohito of Japan, Believes His Crime Is No Less Than Those of the Convicted Criminals

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Mei Ruao, the judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East attending from our country, declared today: In his view, Emperor Hirohito of Japan should also be tried by the tribunal, just like other important war criminal suspects.

Mr. Mei told the reporter of the Central News Agency in a solo interview this morning: The Tribunal currently has a lot of evidence proving that the Japanese Emperor has committed various crimes and disrupted world peace.

### UN Political Committee Ends Debate; Soviet Disarmament Proposal Rejected; Belgian Plan Passed by Majority Vote

[United Press, Paris, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today rejected the Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third and abolish atomic weapons by a vote of thirty-six to six, with seven abstentions (mostly Arab countries). Soviet representative Vyshinsky loudly accused the United States of planning a new "Pearl Harbor" attack on the Soviet Union with atomic weapons. A similar Polish proposal was also rejected. The committee also passed the Belgian plan, previously agreed upon by a large majority of the Disarmament Special Committee, by a vote of forty to six, with one abstention. The plan calls for the Security Council and its subordinate Ordinary Armaments Committee to continue work in this area, and for the establishment of an international control agency to collect, verify, and publish information on the armaments and troops of member states, and to report to the next General Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] When voting on the Belgian proposal, the Political Committee also passed a French amendment by a vote of thirty-three to six, with eight abstentions, stipulating that the international arms control agency should be subordinate to the Security Council. It also passed a Syrian amendment by a vote of twenty-two to seven, with twelve abstentions, stipulating that concrete results in arms reduction should be achieved as soon as possible, without using the improvement of the international situation as an excuse. During the Political Committee's debate on the Soviet and Belgian proposals, Ukrainian representative Manusky supported the Soviet proposal. In response to the British question about establishing diplomatic relations between Britain and Ukraine, Manusky stated that Ukraine should first obtain its German reparations before establishing such diplomatic relations. Yugoslav representative Simir also supported the Soviet proposal, pointing to the situation in West Germany, stating that if Germany's war industry could be restored, it would not be difficult to rebuild Germany's war machine. If the United States assists in the reconstruction of West Germany's war machine, the British and American occupation zones in Germany will immediately become dangerous military bases in Central Europe, threatening the peace of Europe and the world. The French representative suggested that the international control organization in the Belgian proposal should be established by the Security Council, but the Security Council should not have the power of veto when discussing this matter.

### US, Britain and France Considering Response to Lie and Evatt's Peace Appeal; Still Insist on Not Negotiating Under Pressure

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] A spokesman for the US delegation to the UN stated that the letter jointly addressed to the four major power leaders by Lie and Evatt will be answered by Marshall, but Marshall will first consult with Truman. The spokesman added that the US delegation will also consult with the British and French delegations on this letter and submit a reply in a few days.

[United Press, Paris, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman commented on the "peace appeal" launched by UN leaders, stating that the Soviet Union already knows how to resolve the Berlin crisis, namely, to lift the blockade. The British spokesman stated that the Soviet Union's acceptance of the major power negotiation appeal initiated by Lie and Evatt would be of little benefit to stabilizing the Berlin blockade. Senior US and British officials privately expressed "surprise" at Lie and Evatt's intervention in the Berlin situation. This statement by the British Foreign Office spokesman is the first official reaction to the joint proposal of Lie and Evatt. Another official stated that this appeal is directed solely at the Soviet Union, as Western countries have already expressed their willingness to accept a compromise solution. The official also stated that the British government still insists that it is impossible to negotiate general German issues until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] Diplomats from various countries in the Palais de Chaillot have different opinions on the letters sent by UN Secretary-General Lie and General Assembly President Evatt to the four major powers calling for the reopening of negotiations on the Berlin issue. People close to neutral countries feel satisfied with this move, but people close to the four major powers remain silent and indifferent. Security Council President Bramuglia, after consulting with representatives of various neutral countries tonight, stated that "Lie and Evatt's peace appeal is very satisfactory, as it can represent the voice of all peace-loving people and will certainly have a considerable impact on the representatives of the countries concerned." The British representatives expressed extreme silence on this matter, believing that this appeal might shift the Berlin issue from the Security Council to certain aspects of the General Assembly. Some people were surprised by this intervention in the diplomacy of major powers. One noteworthy point is that a "Third International Group" is forming, with neutral countries as its core and Bramuglia as its leader. This group is working to help the four major powers reach an agreement on the Berlin issue.

### General Strike in Paris Leads to Demonstrations and Riots

### Security Council Orders Jewish Troops to Withdraw from Occupied Territories

Nikif Creates Demilitarized Zone

[United Press, Paris, 13th] UN mediator Bunche ordered Israeli and Egyptian troops on the 13th to establish a neutral "no-man's land" in the Nikif area. This plan has been approved by the seven-member group of the Security Council, but the details have not yet been announced. This plan will establish a "ceasefire line" to separate Arab and Jewish troops and will force Jewish troops to withdraw from their occupied positions. So far, neither the Arabs nor the Jews have formally accepted or rejected this plan, but the Israeli representative here has indicated that the Jewish side will withdraw from its gained positions with the utmost reluctance.

### Index Increases by Approximately Eight Times; City Government Can Approve and Announce Today; Compilation and Review Committee Holds Meeting This Morning

[Our Dispatch] The highly anticipated cost of living index has been decided to be published today. The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to hold its 17th meeting in the City Government conference room at 10:00 this morning to review and announce the cost of living index for employees for the first half of November. This index will not distinguish between staff and workers, and will be published uniformly with one number. The authorities felt it difficult to compile and review this index. When the Municipal Government meeting discussed this issue the day before yesterday, no rigid regulations were made, and there were rumors of a delay in publication. Finally, due to the trend of the situation, it was decided to publish as scheduled. According to sources concerned: The most dramatic price increases in the first half of this month compared to August 19 were for rice and flour, followed by meat, chicken, eggs, tofu, and green vegetables, all of which were around dozens of times. However, public utilities only increased by about five times. Therefore, the cost of living index for the first half of November should not exceed ten times, about eight times. The exact number can be known today. According to reports, the Index Compilation and Review Committee was suspended after the 16th meeting on August 15, following an order from the Executive Yuan to freeze the index. It has been exactly three months since then.

[Another Dispatch] The cost of living index for the first half of this month may not be directly published, because after the price limit was lifted, most commodity prices had a price but no market, so there was nothing to follow when compiling the index. Therefore, it is also possible that each representative will jointly formulate a salary multiple as a calculation standard during the meeting, and the index for the first half of the month will not be announced for the time being, but will be officially published at the end of the month. If half of the published index is higher than the salary multiple for the first half of the month drafted by the committee, the shortfall will be retroactively paid.

The Price Adjustment Committee is currently planning to propose 50 percent, and if necessary, 80 percent, but the raw materials required by each industry are different, and the foreign exchange profit-sharing figures also vary. Therefore, the association has specially convened 35 industrial merchants to discuss and make a final decision.

### Many Merchants Still Attempting to Obtain Profiteering; Barber Shop in Front of the Social Affairs Bureau Dares to Increase Prices Fiftyfold

After the price controls were lifted, the skyrocketing prices of various commodities have recently been falling due to the impact of tight credit. However, many merchants are still continuing to adjust prices, attempting to obtain exorbitant profits. Yesterday, according to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, the central government's principle of verifying costs and setting prices should be strictly followed by all industries. If prices are illegally raised or the market is incited, the Social Affairs Bureau will first provide guidance upon receiving a report, and if no results are achieved, it will immediately take action. According to investigations by reporters, the most drastic price adjustments after the lifting of price controls have been in the bathing and barber industries. For example, the Dahua Bathhouse on Junzhan Road in Nanshi, originally priced at 1.2 Gold Yuan per customer, is now charging 6 Gold Yuan, a fiftyfold increase. Furthermore, a barber shop across from the Social Affairs Bureau on Linsen Road, originally priced at 4 jiao, is now charging 20 yuan, also a fiftyfold increase. If the relevant authorities do not urgently seek to stop this, it will affect exorbitant price increases in other industries.

### General Commodity Prices: Surge and Rapid Decline, Calming People's Hearts

The price trends of commodities over the past week have been characterized by a surge and rapid decline. Fluctuations within a single day have ranged from several tens of percent to as much as one hundred percent, making the volatility unprecedented.

At the beginning of the week, various commodities opened trading continuing the momentum from the previous weekend. The rising trend was like wildfire, with chaotic bidding, making it difficult to find a normal market. By Tuesday, it was realized that this over-excitement had several illusory factors. As a result, people became insecure, and prices plummeted from their peaks. The factors contributing to this drastic volatility are roughly:

(1) Due to the price controls of the past two months, there was pent-up demand once they were lifted. People were optimistic, and prices rose like wild horses released from their reins. The price increases had exceeded both production costs and the amount of currency issued. Therefore, when people calmed down, this blind rising trend immediately subsided.

(2) The Huaihai Campaign between the Nationalists and Communists had already begun. The location of Xuzhou and Bengbu, bordering Nanjing and Shanghai, differed greatly from previous anti-communist wars. Therefore, military developments had a particularly significant impact on the economy.

(3) As commodity prices rose sharply by several times to several tens of times in a short period, there was insufficient currency in circulation, a shortage of chips, and extremely tight credit. Shadow interest rates soared, reaching a new record of four or five yuan. As a result, merchants had to sell their goods for cash to cope with this unprecedented credit crunch.

(4) This round of price increases was led by the shortage and frantic bidding for rice. The controlled price for top-grade white rice was 21 yuan per picul. Compared to last week's bidding prices, which ranged from 500 to over 1,000 yuan, this represented an increase of 30 to 50 times, greatly impacting sentiment. Subsequently, the authorities actively worked to secure rice supplies, placing orders from abroad and airlifting rice from Jiangxi. They made every effort to maintain the transportation and sales of rice. As a result, the rice market gradually opened up. By the weekend, most rice shops had top-grade white rice available for around 500 yuan per picul, which calmed people's hearts and moderated the general price increases.

Given the aforementioned factors, in the commodity market, cotton yarn reached a new high of 14,000 yuan per bale for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn when the market opened early in the week, closing at 13,000 yuan. It then gradually fell sharply, reaching 8,500 yuan by Thursday. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell from 7,000-8,000 yuan at the beginning of the week to 5,200 yuan by Thursday. It rebounded slightly over the weekend due to purchases from outside the local market.

Dragon Head fine cloth was 380 yuan at the beginning of the week. On Tuesday, there were frequent ups and downs, falling from 430 yuan to 260 yuan, eventually closing at 300 yuan, settling at 310 yuan at the end of the week.

In terms of food, the bidding for rice was most chaotic at the beginning of the week, with prices ranging from several hundred to over a thousand yuan. After the third day, normal transactions gradually opened up. Top-grade white rice was around 700 yuan per picul, eventually falling to 500 yuan by the end of the week. Bidding for oil and flour was also inconsistent, with raw oil fluctuating between 1,000 and 1,500 yuan, and flour between 100 and over 200 yuan.

The prices of daily necessities uniformly declined from their peaks. Gu Ben soap gradually fell from 400 yuan at the beginning of the week to 300 yuan at the end of the week. Ten small Great Britain matches gradually fell from 104 yuan at the beginning of the week to 70 yuan at the end of the week.

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree for Financial and Economic Affairs, the "Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations" and the "Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People," which had been in effect for less than three months, were replaced last week by new "Revised Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations" and "Revised Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" passed by the Executive Yuan. According to the revised regulations, significant changes include:

(1) The people are permitted to hold gold, silver, and foreign currency, but the circulation and buying/selling are prohibited except for silver coins.

(2) The exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and gold, silver, and foreign currency has been revised to 1,000 yuan per tael of gold, 20 yuan per US dollar, 15 yuan per tael of silver, and 10 yuan per silver coin.

(3) The total amount of Gold Yuan issued, previously rigidly set at 2 billion, is now revised to "The total amount of Gold Yuan issued shall be determined by order separately." In other words, there is no longer a limit to the maximum amount of Gold Yuan that can be issued in the future.

(4) It has been decided to mint Gold Yuan coins, with each coin containing 4.4434 grams of gold.

(5) Anyone holding Gold Yuan coins or Gold Yuan banknotes may purchase foreign exchange in accordance with the government's regulations on foreign exchange management. Anyone depositing Gold Yuan banknotes in a bank designated by the Central Bank for a term of one year, in addition to receiving interest as stipulated, may also exchange the same amount of Gold Yuan banknotes for Gold Yuan coins at the time of deposit. Before the Gold Yuan coins are minted, they may be exchanged for gold or silver coins at the prescribed ratio.

In short, this revision of the regulations has, in spirit, completely dragged the Gold Yuan back to the situation of the old legal tender era. How to stabilize future prices, we still have to find a fundamental solution.

Currency and Finance

### Tight Credit, High Shadow Interest Rates, Financial Institutions in Dire Straits, Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes on Overseas Remittances and Exports Uncertain

Last week, the tight credit situation in this city intensified, reaching an unprecedentedly severe level. The reasons for this are roughly:

(1) The war situation is critical, rumors are rampant, and floating capital is fleeing south, reaching tens of millions of yuan per day. Floating capital coming to Shanghai from the north is immediately transferred south, depleting the city's funds.

(2) Amid public panic, prices change several times a day, and there is often a price but no goods. Those who hoard goods hold on to their materials, making the need for funds urgent. Those who possess funds exchange them for materials, and some move their funds to the suburbs for purchases, further depleting the funds in the city.

(3) The issuance of Gold Yuan is rapidly approaching 2 billion, about ten times the amount of legal tender issued. However, the prices of various commodities compared to the "August 19th" controlled prices have exceeded ten times, and some have even exceeded forty times. Comparing the amount of currency with the prices of goods, the working capital feels short.

(4) As a result of soaring prices and high shadow interest rates, deposits in financial institutions are fleeing en masse. To protect themselves, financial institutions have decided to gradually tighten lending to customers and accelerate the recovery of outstanding debts. They are also restricting withdrawals to cope with the severe shortage of banknotes. This naturally creates additional pressure on the tight credit situation. The credit situation in this city has played out an unprecedentedly tight scene under the impact of these stormy waves.

On Thursday morning, the tight credit situation reached its peak. For example, shadow interest rates had already risen from 90 cents to 1.5 yuan on Monday, creating an unprecedented record. But on Tuesday, shadow interest rates reached a new peak, rising to 3 yuan, which means borrowing 1,000 yuan requires a cost of 30 yuan per day. This is truly shocking. On Wednesday, shadow interest rates remained at a high price of 2.4 to 3 yuan. On Thursday morning, credit was extremely tight, and shadow interest rates rose like wild horses, reaching a peak of 6 yuan. This can truly be described as a usurious loan that shook both China and foreign countries and was unprecedented. The severity of the overall situation can be seen from this. Fortunately, after noon on Thursday, a large amount of remittances from other ports arrived, relieving the credit crunch. Shadow interest rates also plummeted to 1.4 yuan, returning to Monday's level, giving the extremely tense financial market a breather.

Another measure of the tight credit situation is the sharp increase in bounced checks. On Wednesday, one in every fifteen checks bounced on average. On Tuesday, financial institutions' statistics showed that bounced checks accounted for one-half of the total amount of checks received and paid. On Thursday, one in every eight checks bounced on average. Times of chaos reveal people's hearts. In times of crisis, commercial credit is also greatly discounted!

In such a period, the situation of commercial financial institutions is indeed too precarious. The escape of deposits and the widespread shortage of orders have become commonplace within the industry. But talking about recovering outstanding principal and interest is easier said than done. Silver and money businesses can only rely on raising listed interest rates to comfort themselves. Last week, listed interest rates were raised twice. The first time was on Monday, with deposit interest rising from 6% to 9%, outstanding interest rising from 18% to 27%, and interbank lending interest rising from 15% to 22.5%. The second time was scheduled to begin on Friday, with deposit interest rising to 13.5% and outstanding interest rising to 39%. But compared to the market interest rate after the increase, there is still a difference of about ten times. Obviously, it is futile for financial institutions to rely on this method to restore their business!

Last week, the exchange rate remained unchanged. The main change in the foreign exchange market was the Executive Yuan's passage on Thursday of the revised Gold Yuan issuance regulations and the revised regulations for the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency owned by the people. According to this method, the people seem to be able to hold gold, silver, and foreign currency again. The regulations also changed the ratio of gold, silver, and foreign currency to Gold Yuan, calculating gold at 1,000 Gold Yuan per tael, US dollars at 20 Gold Yuan per dollar, and silver coins at 10 Gold Yuan per dollar. Among them, except for silver dollars, free circulation and trading are still prohibited. In addition, the authorities announced that they will start minting gold coins, and those whose Gold Yuan banknotes are stored for a full year will be exchanged for these gold coins according to the legal price. This is naturally a kind of "forward check." As to whether the authorities can use this method to shrink the rampant Gold Yuan, it still depends on the government's past credibility with the people.

As for whether export trade and overseas remittances will increase as a result, it depends on whether the black market price exists. In order to increase the foreign exchange income from overseas remittances and export trade, in the large environment of currency inflation, the gradual adjustment of the legal price of gold, silver, and foreign exchange may become necessary again. Although this is the old road of the legal tender era, what is different is that the middle class has now been rectified, and the other conditions for increasing overseas remittances or export trade have also undergone changes in nature. Therefore, it is obviously impossible to be optimistic about simply relying on the continuous changes in the foreign exchange rate to stimulate overseas remittances or promote exports.

### Regulations on the Handling of Uncertified Imported Goods

The Executive Yuan has announced and implemented the Regulations on Applications for the Withdrawal and Handling of Foreign Orders for Which Payment Has Been Made. The above regulations apply to all uncertified goods arriving at the port and goods shipped, which were previously stipulated to be re-exported or confiscated. The Import Control Commission, China Trust Bureau, Jianghai Customs, etc., recently held a joint meeting to discuss specific methods. Three measures were decided upon and announced by the Import Control Commission yesterday. The following are the regulations:

(1) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate before September 30, 1947, that should be compulsorily purchased by the government are not subject to the provisions of this handling method.

(2) Regarding the guidelines for handling cases that should be ordered to be re-exported or confiscated: (A) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate before September 30, 1947, that should be ordered to be re-exported or confiscated but have not yet been disposed of, may be handled in accordance with the provisions of this method. (B) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate from October 1, 1947, to November 20, may be re-exported within the prescribed time or may apply for import in accordance with this method. (C) Goods arriving at the port and goods shipped without a certificate after November 21, 1947, that should be confiscated but have not yet been disposed of, may be handled in accordance with this method.

(3) Interpretation of disposal: (A) In the case of confiscation, the customs' execution of confiscation and settlement shall prevail. (B) In the case of purchased goods, the China Trust Bureau's issuance of a purchase certificate shall prevail. (C) For re-exported goods, the actual declaration of export shall prevail.

### Examination and Payment of Foreign Exchange and Foreign Exchange, Import Control Commission Must Complete Within Seven Days

The Import Control Commission has received 29 requests for the Central Bank's foreign currency and foreign exchange payment methods. The Import Control Commission is accelerating the review of these applications. Director Huo entrusted that in order to import raw materials that cannot be produced domestically as soon as possible to regulate domestic industrial needs, it is specifically stipulated that they must be completed within seven days from the date of acceptance of the application. Therefore, more than ten applications can be approved this week. However, applications for import annex industrial raw materials are not accepted for the time being because the Executive Yuan has not yet approved the payment amount.

### New Measures for Managing Financial Institutions, Ministry of Finance Submits to Executive Yuan for Approval

After the revision and implementation of the Gold Yuan issuance regulations and the gold, silver, and foreign currency handling regulations, financial people are paying much attention to whether the management of financial institutions in the future will be changed in accordance with the new regulations. According to relevant sources: In the future, the management of financial institutions will still be handled in accordance with the previously established methods in principle. However, its use of funds will be aimed at assisting the development of production and public utilities to eliminate the act of using funds for illegal speculation. As for the interest rate part, the Banking Association will draft a daily rate and submit it to the Central Bank for approval. It is heard that the above measures are being requested by the Ministry of Finance from the Executive Yuan, and will be implemented as soon as they are approved.

### Great Victory Begins in Xuzhou

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

[Pukou News, 11th] The good news of the great victory of the Nationalist army on the east and west wings of Xuzhou on the 10th, especially the captivating subtitle "Foundation for Victory of Xuzhou Campaign Laid," excited millions of troubled people along the Jinpu southern section and instantly made several refugees who had been crying all day for not being able to buy train tickets laugh.

Million Soldiers Use Their Lives on the Cross-Shaped Position

The reason for the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign was sown long ago before the evacuation of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng and the retreat from Yantai. Under the wise decision of President Chiang, the Nationalist Command resolutely changed its strategy, strove for the initiative, and temporarily unloaded the two big burdens that could have burdened the safety of Xuzhou and Xinyang. After withdrawing from Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, it took extremely clever actions to build a cross-shaped position with Xuzhou as the core. People with a little modern military common sense have already seen that this major strategic change shows that the government has chosen a timely and appropriate anti-communist strategy. It can not only rely on to ensure Xuzhou, but also steadily on the cross-shaped position that spans hundreds of miles with Xuzhou as the core, ring the death knell for Chen Yi, who is arrogant and self-satisfied, and Liu Bocheng, who compares himself to "Eastern Xiaboyang." This is by no means an exaggeration. The composition of this cross-shaped position under Jiuli Mountain does have three favorable factors. (1) The morale is calm and the morale is high. The cadres and soldiers of Huang Baitao, Qiu Qingquan, Feng Zhi'an, and Sun Yuanliang, such as Confucian General Huang Baitao, Rao General Qiu Qingquan, and Veteran Anti-Japanese Generals Feng Zhi'an and Sun Yuanliang, have rich and tenacious experience in suppressing bandits. The strength of these large corps has an overwhelming advantage in terms of quantity and quality. (2) The command is flexible and the cooperation is appropriate. Huang, Qiu, Sun, Feng and other troops are well-equipped, able to defend steadily, attack fortifications, and are accustomed to mobile warfare. In addition, the length and width of the defense line are appropriate, and the terrain is conducive to the Nationalist army, which is easy to command and easy to echo. In addition, the flexible use of the indestructible armored corps makes it impossible for the bandit army to use the strategy and tactics of "using the big to eat the small." (3) Air Force Assistance Because large and small bases are close at hand, supplies and transportation are convenient everywhere and become more effective. In addition, it is mostly sunny in early winter. The terrain in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui is easier to identify at this time and place. Because there are few dense forests and dense jungles, the bandit army's positions are easy to expose, and the power of the Iron Crow is enough to chill the bandit's courage. The left coupon for the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign has been manipulated by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army's strategy of exchanging space for time has obviously achieved remarkable success.

Yuanliang Shows His Power in Northern Anhui

Exchanging space for time and accumulating small victories into big victories are two famous sayings that General Bai Jiansheng, the commander of anti-communist operations in Central China, often mentioned when he spoke to reporters about the anti-Japanese strategy before the Taierzhuang Victory in the early summer of 1938. This great victory in the Xuzhou Campaign was not a fluke. In order to pre-plan to cut off the pincer offensive of the Chen and Liu bandits, gain a firm grasp of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and strengthen the defense of the periphery of Xuzhou, the Nationalist army first benefited from Sun Yuanliang's corps, which successively captured Fuyang, Mengcheng, Woyang, and Sixian in one week, and recovered dozens of important strongholds along the banks of the Wo River, showing its power in northern Anhui. Continuing on the 8th and 9th, General Qiu Qingquan of the Nationalist army used the power of thunder to defeat the 9th Column, 1st Division, one brigade of the 4th Column, two regiments of the Liangguang Column, and two regiments of the 3rd, 8th Column, which were sent to their deaths by Chen Geng's bandit troops from western Henan, on the line of Huangkou (90 miles from Xuzhou) and Dangshan (150 miles from Xuzhou) on the west wing of Xuzhou. At the same time, Huang Baitao's corps also gave a dismount to the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and New 7th Columns of the Chen bandits on the line from Yunhezhan (150 miles from Xuzhou) to Nianzhuang, killing and wounding more than 10,000 bandit troops. In today's view, this is just a small victory, but the morale of the Nationalist army has been greatly boosted. The high fighting spirit of the Nationalist army on the east and west wings is only seen in the past anti-communist battles. It is reported that Chen Yi personally supervised the battle near Yunhezhan before the 8th and executed a regimental commander who was ineffective in combat. That night, he moved his headquarters back to a small village in the Taizhao branch line.

### Baitao Wins Every Battle, Lucky General Works Day and Night

According to reliable intelligence, it is estimated that Chen, who invaded Jinan this time, was complacent, thinking about claiming credit, and underestimated the strength of the Nationalist army in the core of Xuzhou and its periphery. He blindly tilted about 15 columns of the bandit troops in central Shandong and western and southern Shandong, and then combined Chen Geng, Liu Bocheng, Zhang Guangzhong and other bandits with more than ten columns, and the so-called "militia." The total number of troops in the first Qianbing was about 300,000 or more, and he was satisfied that he could defeat the Nationalist army Huang Corps on the east wing of the periphery of Xuzhou, and then directly attack the side and back of Xuzhou and lightly take Pengcheng. Unexpectedly, in the three days of the 10th, 11th and 12th, he suffered another defeat on the line of Nianzhuang and Bayiji on the east road of Longhai, with as many as 37,000 bandit troops killed and wounded. The main force of its elite 1st, 2nd, 7th, and 9th Columns has lost more than half, and its spirit has been greatly frustrated. On the Nationalist army side, although General Huang Baitao, who has won every battle, suffered casualties, it was only four or five thousand people. The value of this hard battle is comparable to the victory in eastern Henan this year. Therefore, when the news of victory reached Pengcheng, General Liu Jingfu, who was responsible for the safety of Xuzhou, immediately reported the victory to the Supreme Commander President Chiang in an excited and pleasant tone. At the same time, he immediately ordered the officers and soldiers of General Huang Baitao's troops to be commended and greatly encouraged, so that they could continue to make efforts and give Chen's bandits a greater blow to complete the sacred mission of defending the Greater Xuzhou. On the day when the good news of the victory on the east and west wings of Xuzhou was frequently reported (11th), General Bai Jiansheng flew to Xuzhou from Hankou to personally instruct the generals on the plan to eliminate the bandits. General Bai's confidence in the victory of the Xuzhou Campaign may be reflected in more brilliant and great battles in the next few days. Lucky General Liu Zhi is said to have worked day and night for as long as five days and nights. Now, because the war situation has turned for the better and the economy has stabilized, everyone on the front line and in the rear is thinking for the better. However, everyone should have a deep understanding of the hard work of the soldiers on the front line, and should do everything possible to launch a widespread movement to comfort the army in order to welcome the great achievements that turn the world around and reduce the infinitely painful bandit disaster. Here, the reporter can incidentally report to the readers that the real victory of the anti-communist military has begun in Xuzhou today. This can be seen from the good news that the closer the war is to the front line, the lower the prices are and the more stable people's hearts are. The price of rice in Xuzhou has fallen to 130 yuan per picul, pork is less than 10 yuan per catty, and daily necessities are also quite cheap. The merchants on the front line have already taken out their conscience.

### Large-Scale Armed Fight in Yi Area of Maoxian, Western Sichuan, "Beauty Trap" Leads to Sale of "Second Mao Ox" Suffering

[News from Chengdu, 10th] An unprecedented large-scale armed fight recently occurred in Maoxian County, Western Sichuan. Da Er Mao Niu (Yi chieftain's name) in the Heishui Yi area of the county have historically been in conflict due to power struggles. Recently, Gongyang Gaoping, a bigwig in the area, provoked discord between the two tribes and encouraged Da Mao Niu to encroach on Er Mao Niu's territory. Li Yinggang of Er Mao Niu led more than 2,000 Yi people to attack Da Mao Niu and Gongyang Gaoping last month. However, Da Mao Niu used a beauty trap, selecting more than 200 beautiful Yi women to dance the ge guozhuang (Yi dance) in nearby villages to lure the enemy. When Li's cavalry rushed to a point where they were panting and their attention shifted, they used cannons and machine guns to sweep them, causing heavy casualties to Li's troops. Currently, the two sides have thousands of troops and horses facing each other, forming the first large-scale city fight in the border area in a century.

### Jiangxi Plans to Formulate a Dike Repair Plan

[News from Nanchang, 12th] This year, due to the two floods of peach and grass, the water level of rivers and lakes in Jiangxi Province rose sharply. A total of 277 embankment breaches and collapses occurred along the rivers and lakes. Many embankments that were not breached were also eroded by wind and waves, causing many collapses. According to estimates by the Water Conservancy Bureau: the amount of earthwork urgently needed for emergency repairs is 2,125,152 cubic meters, and the amount of earthwork for secondary repairs is 1,276,389 cubic meters, totaling 14,560,673 cubic meters. A flood embankment restoration plan has now been formulated. The central government will allocate funds to handle it, and it is expected that construction will start during the winter agricultural gap this year and will be completed in early spring next year to prevent the spring flood.

### Homecoming

— Xu Chengyu

Returning home to a mountain dwelling overgrown with weeds,
Every day, rumors spread of soaring rice prices,
Sighing, I still bend to the burden of five dou of grain,
Dishes and goblets have long been neglected, collecting dust.

The people are starving and drowning amidst warfare,
What are my thoughts when I gaze at the world with sorrow?
After cleaning a room, I still stand with my hands clasped behind my back,
How can I bear to chant poems in the wind and rain?

I do not believe that the scenery surpasses that of Yongjia,
Empty words and laughter speak of pacifying the Tartar sands,
To whom do Mao Hong and An Shi belong now?
Sitting here, it is hard to quell the clamor of the world.

Shutting my door, my heart is still uneasy,
In these perilous times, the flowers and bamboo evoke endless feelings.
My children do not understand, spoiling the spring view,
I will lean against the orchids in the desolate courtyard for now.

### A Teacher's Life

— Yi Jun

The work of a teacher is arduous enough. Take me, for example: I teach two classes of Chinese, serve as a homeroom teacher for one class, and manage the library. My regular weekly workload includes teaching twelve class periods, grading one hundred and nine composition notebooks, one hundred and nine notebook assignments, sixty-three weekly journals, reviewing one hundred and twenty-six pages of large calligraphy, and one hundred and twenty-six pages of small calligraphy. In addition, there are library and student affairs matters to attend to. With so much to do, from dawn till dusk, besides waiting for and squeezing onto buses, all my time is spent either shouting in the classroom or writing non-stop in the workroom (even Sundays are busy). Shouting in the classroom is not like performing a play on stage to earn the audience's applause, and writing non-stop in the workroom is not as enjoyable as reading novels or writing articles. Especially when grading student writing, I become dizzy and my back and arms ache because their writing is not like the novels of Mao Dun or Ba Jin, not like the plays of Cao Yu or Tian Han, not like the selected works of Lu Xun or Guo Moruo, not like the new poems of Ai Qing or Zang Kejia. What is it then? Mostly muddled accounts, unclear and chaotic, "like drumming on a high mountain, no connection, no connection," immature works, filled with misspelled and misused characters, as if everyone aspires to reform Chinese characters.

Although my work is so arduous, I find it difficult, but not depressing (even taking it in stride). My depression does not lie here; perhaps it can be said that the depression of private school teachers does not lie here.

Our depression stems from livelihood issues, namely salary problems. Speaking of our salaries, at the beginning of the semester, it is considered relatively good. Again, take me as an example: my monthly salary is 104 Gold Yuan, which is 10 or 20 yuan higher than that of ordinary public school teachers, and it is paid out in one lump sum for five months. Less than a month after payment, seeing that the situation is not right, the salary for the last month is also paid out in full. Therefore, friends say that my treatment is "very good," and I myself feel that it seems not bad. However, now that price limits have been lifted, prices are rising for everything, and the rise is very rapid. As far as I know, train fares have increased fivefold, a regular letter has increased twentyfold, shoe shining has increased from one jiao to three jiao, and pancakes have increased from 100,000 to 600,000. The daily food allowance for our school teachers has been forced to increase from 2 yuan to 6 yuan. Even the salaries of public school teachers, which are the most difficult to raise, have increased by one and a half times. Only we, private school teachers, watch helplessly as prices rise and others receive pay raises, while we cannot get another cent. The money we received earlier has already become part of others' "endless treasures"; how can life not be a problem, and how can we not be depressed?

Perhaps someone will say: "If your salaries were not paid out in one lump sum, but paid monthly, how could you have gotten into this situation?"

Sir, your words have not been carefully considered. If it were paid monthly, at this time, compared to public school teachers, when they increase by one and a half times, we would be equivalent to decreasing by one and a half times; compared to train fares, when they increase fivefold, we would be equivalent to decreasing fivefold; compared to pancakes, when they increase sixfold, we would be equivalent to decreasing sixfold; compared to a letter, when they increase twentyfold, we would be equivalent to decreasing twentyfold. This is only in terms of this month or this ten-day period. I am afraid that as time goes on, our salary will be equivalent to decreasing to zero. How can we pay it out monthly?

And in fact, some private schools do pay monthly but do not adjust monthly, which is even more miserable.

Our work, although hard, is not depressing, but our lives have become so hard that we are on the verge of suffocation.

### In a Fourth-Rate Movie Theater

— Jingwen

At this time when everyone is worried about firewood and rice, I actually have the interest to lead a few children to see a movie in a fourth-rate movie theater near my residence on a holiday. It can really be said that I am "unaware" of the living environment or that my psychological state has become numb. Moreover, the remaining money on hand is only enough to buy a pound of biscuits, and the "food" for the next few days is nowhere to be found. Such "recreation" is no different from what the idiom says, "playing the qin under a Coptis chinensis tree."

But our stomachs were temporarily filled with red rice and green vegetables, and the children at home were restless. Their young hearts had no fear or worry, and they knew that "Dad got paid yesterday," so they could not avoid this small exploitation. Moreover, sitting bored at home would only consume more cigarettes, which would be enough to cover the price of tickets at a fourth-rate movie theater.

The fact proves that it is not only me who is suffering from numbness in life. Both movie theaters I went to were already full (even though there was still more than half an hour before the show). The crowd outside was still huge, a scene of complete prosperity. Finally, I managed to buy tickets at the third place, and even more fortunately, I actually found seats. Within five minutes, not only were all the seats occupied, but the steps on both sides and the aisles were filled with people.

It turns out that this fourth-rate movie theater has never had a system of assigned seating. The theater owner only seeks to maximize profits. If a "full house" sign is hung here, it is not only because all the seats are occupied, but also because it is difficult to find a place to stand inside.

Looking at the audience of men, women, old, and young standing next to me and sitting on the steps, I congratulated myself on arriving early, but at the same time, I couldn't help but feel that our people are really too easy to deal with. Although the ticket price is not high, they are still paying customers, and at the very least they should be given a seat. Now, they are allowed to sit on the cold cement steps or stand against the wall, while those special audience members who do not pay for tickets sit cross-legged, turning a blind eye to the plight of the paying audience, as if it were natural.

Although this is a scene in a fourth-rate movie theater, and everyone is already accustomed to it, it seems to me that the reason why China, although having the opportunity to join the ranks of world powers, has always been relegated to the status of a fourth-rate country is reflected in this fourth-rate movie theater.

The boss only knows about money, with a mouth full of flowery words, like a mirror image on the screen, which is accessible to the eye but not to the grasp, only for your "entertainment," "entertainment." The most pitiful thing is that the paying audience does not know their due rights and are manipulated by others. Cement is cement, standing is standing, and not only dare not protest, but even rarely complain. I often hear some old ladies in the crowd leaving the theater saying, "The movie was quite good, but my legs are stiff from standing," and I can't help but smile bitterly.

I doubt whether the audience's patience will be endless. The theater owners only want money, and those with privileges sit high in their seats. Even if the audience has patience, I am afraid that there will be a day when they will demand a "refund." Although this is a matter in a fourth-rate movie theater, is it really just a matter of a fourth-rate movie theater?

### Safety Film

— Cangyu

Recently, a certain laboratory in the United States invented a so-called acetate safety film. Ordinary film becomes brittle in less than twenty-five years, but this safety film, if the air around it is properly conditioned, can be preserved indefinitely.

### Aftersound

— Gongsun Wu

Li Yu said, "In the world, for every character, there is a head, which is the initial sound; and for every character, there is a tail, which is the final sound. After the tail, there is also an aftersound, which completes the character and brings it to a conclusion. For example, for the character '蕭' (xiao), the initial sound is '西' (xi), the final sound is '夭' (yao), and the aftersound is '烏' (wu). Spelling the sound with two characters is not as good as the single character for the aftersound." He also said, "The initial sound, final sound, and aftersound are all intended for slow melodies, which must have them whether one character takes one beat or one character takes several beats; fast melodies only have the main sound and lack the initial and final sounds." Li Weng was a master of opera in the early Qing Dynasty, and he was especially skilled in judging sounds. This theory can be applied to education. I have always said that having children practice singing more songs can help them pronounce characters correctly. Children who are accustomed to using dialects should be made to sing songs in the national language often, emphasizing singing out the initial and final sounds and then drawing out the aftersound, so that the pronunciation of characters will be accurate and unchangeable. Li Weng also gave an example, saying: "The master of ceremonies replaces '拜' (bài, bow) with the two characters '不愛' (bù ài, not love), and replaces '興' (xīng, rise) with the two characters '希因' (xī yīn, hope for reason), because bowing and rising take a little longer, and the singer cannot help but lengthen the sounds of the characters." In short, teachers of writing can use this method of lengthening the sounds to make character pronunciation easier to correct.

### Waste of Public Funds

— Yu Qiang

Various agencies, when preparing budgets, invariably have the intention of "asking for a little more." If the auditing agencies do not verify and allocate funds according to actual needs, public funds will inevitably be wasted.

The budget proposed by the U.S. "Veterans Administration" this year included a huge sum of $7.9 million for stationery alone. Part of this money is used to print 3,674,000,000 sheets of official paper. If it were distributed, each veteran would get 200 sheets, or each American would get 30 sheets.

The agency also requested to print over 303 million sheets of letterhead, costing over $550,000. With so many letterhead, allocated to all the employees of the "Veterans Administration" (including elevator operators), each person could write 1,348 letters in 1948.
