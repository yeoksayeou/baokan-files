### Fierce Artillery Battles Southwest of Dagu; Naval and Land Forces Cooperate to Vigorously Strike Invading Bandits; No Sound of Cannons Heard in Tianjin and Beiping, Outskirts Quiet

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th] The focus of the North China war situation has shifted towards Tanggu.  Artillery battles have been fierce in recent days.  At 2:00 AM on the 25th, the bandit 9th Column's 25th Division launched a fierce attack towards Honglou, southwest of Dagu, resulting in intense fighting throughout the day.  As of the evening, the two sides were still in a standoff. Non-military organizations have all been evacuated to Xingang, where fortifications have been completed with the cooperation of the navy.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Military News:  Lin Biao's 9th Column launched an offensive yesterday morning against the National Army's positions along the Tieshan line southwest of Dagu.  The National Army met the attack with fierce resistance. The bandits employed human wave tactics, launching dozens of attacks within three hours.  Supported by naval artillery, the National Army engaged the bandits in fierce combat for four hours, killing and wounding over 2,000 bandits.  The bandits retreated along the entire line.  Around 12:00 noon, the bandits launched another counterattack, with fierce fighting continuing until dusk.  The bandit 9th Column was ultimately defeated, suffering over 3,000 killed and wounded.  Today's battles were quiet.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th]  No sound of cannons has been heard in Tianjin for two nights.  There were no major battles in the surrounding areas today either.  A regiment of the bandit 2nd Column was discovered in Wujiazui, southeast of Tianjin, and a bandit regiment was found in Huidui, south of Tianjin, but there has been no intense fighting yet.  Furthermore, Tianjin security authorities launched a city-wide household census on the evening of the 24th.  Over 2,000 groups began simultaneously and completed the census within twelve hours.  The authorities are determined to eliminate all illegal elements.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Military News: National Army infantry and cavalry units patrolled and mopped up the outskirts of Tianjin yesterday and today. No trace of bandits was found within twenty *li* northwest and northeast of Tianjin.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th]  Snowflakes fluttered in the ancient capital on Christmas. This morning, National Army forces outside Guang'anmen conducted searches in multiple directions towards bandit forces in Lianhua Pond, the Racecourse, Luodao Village west of Yiyi, Shifangyuan, and the Caishen Temple area southwest of the city. There were minor skirmishes between the two sides. It is reported that the bandit forces around Beiping have not retreated and are constructing fortifications in the distant suburbs, seemingly with the intention of besieging the ancient capital. The area between Wanshou Mountain west of Beiping and Guang'anmen is still occupied by Lin Biao's 5th Column.  Bandits north of Beiping are currently entrenched in Qinghe and Shahe.  National Army forces in the eastern suburbs control the area between Tong County, ten *hua li* west, and Beiping.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th] It is reported that a powerful cavalry brigade of the National Army, previously ordered to launch a lightning strike and mop-up operation in eastern Hebei, has now reached the Yutian County area in eastern Hebei, striking hard at the bandits' rear.

[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Last night passed peacefully. Awakening, Beiping had become a silver-clad world, with various scenes resembling vivid picture postcards. Around the city walls, not a single gunshot broke the silence. There continues to be talk of the Communist troops shifting towards Central China. According to a spokesman for the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, this is quite possible.

### No Warfare in Northern Huai due to Rain and Snow; National Army Maintaining Strict Vigilance between the Xie and Fei Rivers

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Bengbu, 25th] Military News: The main force of the National Army on the southern front is currently north of the Fei River. Recent weather conditions have caused a lull in the fighting. On the northern front, the pressure on General Du's army corps has indeed decreased.  The serial numbers of Chen Yi's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 9th Columns, as well as the rebel Wu Huawen's troops, which were previously encircling the positions, have not been seen in recent days, and their whereabouts are unknown. However, with continuous rain and snow, air force activity is difficult, and the arduous conditions of General Du's army corps can be imagined. In the Huainan area, local Communist forces are limited to Sun Chuanjia's troops, who are harassing the area near Hujiaji. According to today's intelligence, these bandit troops have again moved to Hongxipu.

### Henan Provincial Government Decides to Stay Within the Province

Xinyang Becomes Political Center

[Central News Agency, Xinyang, 25th] Today, Xinyang is not only a forward base for the National Army but has also become the political center of Henan. Under the leadership of General Zhang Zhen, the military and political sides are gradually expanding with Xinyang as the center. Zhang has repeatedly emphasized that no matter how the situation changes, the Henan Provincial Government will remain within the province. To adapt to this situation, the Henan Provincial Government has completed its wartime structure. In addition to abolishing seventeen unnecessary subordinate agencies, the number of personnel in all subordinate units has also been reduced from over 1,500 in Kaifeng to 150. Those who are laid off will receive three months' salary for those who voluntarily disperse, while those who are willing to work in the countryside will be assigned to work in the areas where the government is located, organizing provincial government supervisory groups, work teams, and township-level grassroots political guidance groups to work in different districts and receive their original salaries, with subsidies provided when necessary.

### Zhou Yide Tells United Press Reporter That Military Aid to China Is Not Too Late; Blames Truman and Marshall's Policies as Erroneous

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Washington, 25th Broadcast: Republican Congressman Zhou Yide told a United Press reporter that "If President Truman and the State Department are willing to take responsibility for China's failure to the Communists, then Congress has no way to prevent them from taking such measures." When Congress is reorganized, Congressman Zhou will be a member of the minority party but will still be an important member of the House of Representatives. He is considered by other congressmen to be the main spokesman for the pro-China aid group. Therefore, he told reporters that he believes Congress is unlikely to exceed the government's position on military aid to the Chinese government forces, which he considers significant. He explained, "During the last session of Congress, I forced the government to take action to make military and reconstruction aid to China part of the Economic Cooperation Act, but subsequent developments have proved that although the law can be passed, its implementation cannot be controlled. If Truman and Marshall are unwilling to aid China, then we congressmen can do nothing."

Zhou said: If Roosevelt had been willing to sell out China ten years ago, the war against Japan might not have happened. However, Roosevelt and Hull were willing to accept war rather than accept destruction. If Roosevelt and Hull's decision was correct, then today Truman and Marshall's decision to allow the Communists to destroy China's independence is a major mistake. If the United States insists on forcing China to form a coalition government that includes the Communists, the consequences will undoubtedly create a second Czechoslovakia or Poland. It is not too late for the United States to take effective action today.

### New York Anti-Communist Society Urges US to Issue Statement Continuing Aid to China

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] An anti-Communist organization here, the "Fellowship," recently published a letter to President Truman, urging the US President to "clearly state a promise as the spokesman for the free world" and agree to continue aid to the Chinese government. The letter continued that Hoffman's statement in Shanghai had been misinterpreted as the US supporting a coalition government and increasing defeatism among the Chinese people. Therefore, the US President should issue a statement to clarify all ambiguities. The letter was signed by prominent figures, including the chairman of the Fellowship, Madam Pan Ying, Chairman Emmett, President Gannon of Fordham University, former Ambassador to Poland Lane, and prominent political commentators Thompson, Chamberlain, and Lyons.

### Vice President Wu Talks to Foreign Reporters That Government Is Determined to Continue Fighting Until Communists Understand and Need Peace; Military Service System Will Be Re-Examined

[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng recently met with United Press reporters alone and clarified that Sun Ke's new cabinet is determined to continue fighting the Communists until the Communists sue for peace. Wu said, "The sole objective of the new government is to continue fighting the Communists until they need peace and understand that peace is very important to the country. The current cabinet is a wartime cabinet, not a surrender cabinet." It is reported that Wu has always been one of President Chiang's closest advisors and is currently tasked with planning the policies of the new wartime cabinet. Wu expressed optimism in unmistakable terms that even though the National Army has been suffering repeated defeats, the new government has hope, and in addition to revitalizing and mobilizing the areas still in the government's hands south of the Yangtze River to fight the Communists, there are no other plans. He said, "The new government will strengthen the defenses of Jiangnan, promote production, provide manpower and new troops to revitalize the troops still in the north." Wu Tiecheng continued that it is too early to announce any new policies, but at the same time, it can be said that the blueprint is being drafted. According to this plan, the military service system will be re-examined, and huge manpower will be turned into a large number of troops. "This will be a comprehensive effort, and everything needed to continue the war against the Communists will be done." We will continue to fight until the Communists are the ones who sue for peace in the future.

The same optimistic spirit expressed by Wu is also quite evident in other aspects. In addition, there is also a clear and unusual image of full cooperation between the more important departments within the government, with each knowing what the other is doing and cooperating with each other.

No one denies the seriousness of the situation, but at the same time, very few senior government officials express pessimism about the future. A senior government official indicated that the Communists suffered greater losses than the National Army in the battles of northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, and Bengbu. He also made a series of remarks to prove this point, saying that if the Communist army had truly achieved the major victories they claimed, they would have quickly taken advantage of the good opportunity. "If the Communist army had the upper hand, they would not have given up taking the offensive. The Communist army was forced to abandon the offensive to replenish their strength and reorganize in order to find another way to attack the Yangtze River." He pointed to Tanggu as the main target of Lin Biao's troops in North China, followed by Tianjin, and said that Beiping has no strategic value for the Communists, so the Communists are unwilling to sacrifice troops to capture General Fu Zuoyi's main base of operations.

Summarizing the opinions of senior officials in the new government gives the impression that they have not given up hope and do not expect a collapse in the future. On the other hand, the carefully worded statements of senior officials have never failed to mention peace talks. At the same time, they are equally careful not to explicitly state that peace must be initiated by the Communist side. However, there is undoubtedly some behind-the-scenes peace work underway, and there is clear evidence of this. The news given to the United Press by some of the most reputable Chinese and foreign figures in Nanjing is proof of this.

### Sun Ke's Residence Meeting; Heads of Relevant Ministries and Commissions Invited to Participate; Exchanged Views on Policy for Handling Government Affairs

### Total US Military Aid to China After Victory Amounted to US$230 Million; US Newspaper Reports of US$2-3 Billion Are Inaccurate

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Chinese officials here said on the 24th that since the surrender of Japan, direct US military aid to China has totaled US$230 million. This number is far from the claim in some newspapers that such military aid totaled US$2 billion to US$3 billion. Chinese officials said that only a portion of the US$230 million in military aid, such as useful small arms and ammunition, has actually been delivered to China since the end of the war. China is officially publicizing the figures for aid on the Chinese side, and this number has been debated extensively in the press. In the past, China has tried to debate it carefully, fearing biased intentions. However, the official Chinese authority and officials believe that in the opinion of whether or not it is the United Press, there are slight differences in the basic viewpoint between the opinions of China and the United States on "Aid to China." The Chinese side said: "For example, the surplus materials that are being damaged on the Pacific islands should only be calculated at the recent sale price, while the US largely calculates this at the original production cost in the transfer of aid to China." US and Chinese officials have long disputed the book value figures of the surplus materials stipulated by the US Army Department. The Chinese side said that the recent reports in the United States that the total aid to China since the surrender of Japan has reached US$2 billion or US$3 billion are inaccurate and deliberately exaggerated.

"According to the estimates of the Chinese authorities, the total amount of US aid and loans to China in the three and a half years from the surrender of Japan to the present is US$1,173,300,000, most of which is for relief and civilian supplies, and the total amount of military supplies in the same period is US$230 million. "US aid can be divided into three types: first, gifts or loans; second, surplus materials; and third, service fees. The total amount of gifts and loans is US$1,173,000,000, including US donations to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other international relief plans, totaling US$518,000,000 for the US foreign relief program, US$145,000,000 in loans, US$110,000,000 in military supplies under the Lend-Lease Act, and US$400 million in the 1948 Aid to China Act, of which US$125 million is for military supplies. Some of the materials under the 1948 Aid to China Act have not yet been delivered to China. The second type of surplus materials is US$199,300,000, which is the most debated figure. China calculates its value based on the purchase price, while the US value is based on the production value of US$820 million. The third type of "service fees" is US$377,000,000. This number is calculated by the US and is for the service fees for reprocessing and Japanese reparations. The Chinese side said that this amount is almost half of the amount of the Lend-Lease Act given to China, and China cannot correctly consider this to be direct aid to China. The most difficult of all aid to China issues is the accurate number of war materials shipped to China. According to the base report to the United Press, what China needs most in the war against communism is small arms, such as rifles, machine guns, and ammunition. According to a Chinese report, from the surrender of Japan to October 1948, China received only 50 million rounds of ammunition, worth US$2 million, and 130 million rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition. The first batch arrived shortly after the surrender of Japan, and the second batch did not arrive until 1947. The US government estimates the value of the second batch of ammunition to be US$6,564,992. The Chinese side said that they cannot accept this book value because the actual sale price was US$656,499. The Chinese side also said that since October 1948, there have been four shipments to China under the US$125 million military aid project, the first shipment being 600 tons and the other three shipments totaling 12,000 tons. The first and second shipments have arrived in China, and the remaining two shipments are on their way to China. Since the surrender of Japan, the total amount of military supplies received by China is less than US$230 million, including military supplies under the surplus materials project and the US$125 million military aid plan. They also stated that of the US$728,000,000 Lend-Lease Act listed by the United States, US$337,000,000 was for handling fees and not materials, and for the remaining difference, the Chinese side stated that they only received invoices for US$110 million. The different opinions on the price are being negotiated. The Chinese side also pointed out that the Lend-Lease Act received by China was very limited, a far cry from the US$11 billion in Lend-Lease programs received by the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Chinese officials announced on the 24th that since the day of victory over Japan, the total amount of credit loans obtained by China from the United States was US$202,800,000 (including US$82,800,000), but there was still US$16,000,000 that had not been allocated, so the actual difference was US$186,800,000.

They said that China had already repaid US$132,000,000, and the overdue difference was US$54,800,000.

They also said: "The Chinese government and people are certainly deeply grateful to the US government for the massive assistance given to China, but especially today, when the issue of expanding assistance is under consideration, the explanation and statement regarding this assistance must be factual in order to prevent any exaggeration or misunderstanding."

### Scientific Research in China and the United States

— Luo Kaifu

China and the United States are both important countries in the world. The differences in the economic situations of the two countries are well known. A comparison of the state of scientific research in the two countries may not be without significance.

Theoretical science is the mother of applied science, and applied science is the foundation for improving material life. Americans are most fond of enjoyment, and their advocacy of engineering science can be said to be the same as improving agriculture. Major factories deeply understand that improving products cannot be achieved without thoroughly researching the principles of each product. Therefore, they compete to establish research departments, hire pure scientists, and research day and night. The equipment and talent in each research department are at least equivalent to any research institute in our country, and the scope of their research is often limited to three or several types of manufacturing. No wonder their products are constantly improving.

Newly emerging factories in our country, such as the Shenxin Textile Factory, have also known in recent years to hire scientific personnel to guide production, and the results are quite impressive. However, they are only responsible for guidance, and there is no establishment of research departments, let alone equipment specially designed for research. It is said that the success of literature depends on talent; the progress of science depends on equipment. Without equipment, there is no way to discover new knowledge; without new knowledge, there is no way to talk about improvement. The main reason why our country's industrial products cannot be compared with foreign ones is this.

There is an even more obvious contrast between the research departments of government agencies in China and the United States. During the war, the U.S. military organization expanded, and in the U.S. capital alone, it recruited more than a hundred geographers from China and abroad. A year before the landing in Europe, they had already studied the possibilities and gains and losses of landing at various locations. Before attacking Germany, the general staff had already calculated the route for advancing into Berlin, as well as the difficulty of each route and how to overcome it. In order to prepare for landing in our country to attack the Japanese army, they also collected a lot of information and made more than a hundred kinds of military maps of our country's coast. "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The Americans can be said to have deeply understood its essence. Even in peacetime, the U.S. State Department also employs specialized scholars to study the resources of various countries and other construction issues. Today, in the Consulate General in Shanghai, there are still people who specialize in collecting various geographical materials from our country and sending them back to the United States for research. Ah, understanding the national conditions is the key to diplomatic negotiations. How could our Ministry of Foreign Affairs not know this! It's just that due to limited funds, they have more than they can do. Envoys to foreign countries are already overwhelmed by the shortage of publicity funds, how can they have the extra strength to hire people to run around for inquiries and searches?

The research institutions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are even more grand and thorough. For each crop or livestock, there are several experts responsible for research. The methods and techniques for selecting seeds, eliminating diseases, and increasing production are available for farmers to inquire and ask for assistance. Agricultural meteorology, water and soil conservation, agricultural product transportation, and agricultural economics also have special departments for research. Each province has an agricultural department, and each department emphasizes both business and research. Under the department, there are local experimental stations and farms. Each farm often has research reports, and each department has even more publications. The department itself has even more publications, and they are especially valuable.

Our country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also has a Central Experimental Institute, a Forestry Experimental Institute, and other similar institutions engaged in research, promotion, and guidance. The research staff of each institute is carefully selected, and their publications are of special value. It is a pity that the same institutions cannot be popularized in various places. The equipment and talent of the agricultural and forestry departments of each province are mostly not sufficient. A certain director of the agricultural and forestry department knew that the publications of the department were not complete, and once advised the author not to adopt them. He was originally a pure scholar, otherwise he would never have confessed so frankly. His words of advice to the author are enough to reflect his sadness and emotion. A certain county agricultural extension center has a farm of more than one hundred acres, and the entire center has two staff members, one is an agricultural scholar and the other is a transferred military officer. The military officer was good at fighting and had been ordered to be placed by the county government, but there was no suitable position, so he was assigned to agricultural extension work! The "innate deficiency and acquired maladjustment" of research institutions has reached this point! The author sincerely hopes that the farm is the only example in the country.

Among the government agencies in our country that are dedicated to pure research work, the Academia Sinica and the Peiping Research Institute have better equipment. The United States does not have this kind of government agency, and many important countries do not have it either. Our country can indeed be proud of this. The Academia Sinica has thirteen research institutes, and the Peiping Research Institute has nine. In addition, there are also the Marine Research Institute, the Geodetic Survey Institute, the _______ Research Institute, and the Geographic Research Institute established by the Sino-British Education Fund and the Ministry of Education. There are also the Central Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of various provinces, as well as the Soil Research Institute, the Fujian Provincial Academy of Sciences, etc. University professors teach and research at the same time, while research institute staff are spared the trouble of teaching. Since the work is preferential, the selection of personnel is more strict. No matter how good the work results are, they cannot be research fellows without reaching considerable qualifications. Because of this, even if the equipment of the research institute is very simple, it still has considerable reputation abroad. During the Anti-Japanese War, life was extremely hard, but the research institutes were still able to publish research reports as usual. We are certainly not complacent about this, but American scholars have been amazed. There are also some research institutes that have not accumulated funds during the Anti-Japanese War, and the researchers have exhausted their efforts to ensure that each institute continues to exist. The inspiring and tearful struggle process is even more unimaginable to Americans.

The United States does not have government-run research institutions, but it has privately run research organizations. The Smithsonian Institution and the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., are examples of this. The research scope of the two academies is not broad, but they all have sufficient funds, and there is absolutely no shortage of funds. The addition of equipment is entirely up to the researchers. The achievements of the two academies have long been world-renowned. The publications of the Smithsonian Institution in biology and anthropology and the Carnegie Institution in botany are considered first-class works. This is of course the performance of the researchers' efforts. If the environment is not stable and the equipment is sufficient, how can it be expressed? If our country's research institutions can add equipment as the researchers want, how do we know that their achievements will not make American scholars admire even more?

Since there are fewer research institutions in the United States, most of the research work is done by university professors. Indeed, the reason why university professors are different from primary and secondary school teachers is that they can constantly obtain new facts and constantly update their knowledge and insights. Without research opportunities to discover new knowledge, teaching according to the book, and parroting what others say, then the university is a continuation of the middle school, how can it achieve the purpose of training research talents? The treatment of American university professors, generally speaking, is less than that of government officials, and even less than that of factory technicians. However, each department's main teachers (who can be associate professors or assistant professors) each have a secretary to organize their manuscripts. Better universities can also hire more people to compile their materials for the professor's research. Taking geography teachers as an example, if they need to go to a distant place for inspection during the holidays, the school can pay for it. It can be seen that the school not only cultivates students, but also cultivates teachers. How is the treatment of professors in our country? It is not necessary to discuss this in depth. But to give one example, a certain professor, because the income from his monthly income could not afford to send his children to school, once said to the author: "I can only teach my children not to study anymore, because I am afraid that after studying, they will also be like me who cannot support their children." The sad groans are unbearable to hear, how can American professors imagine this?

Chinese and foreign scholars all acknowledge that if students or teachers in our country can study hard abroad, their learning or research results will definitely not be behind anyone; when they return to China, they will gradually degenerate. Here, we can't help but feel the sorrow of being transplanted. If this is due to individual depravity, then why not be depraved in the easy and carefree life abroad, but be depraved in the land of propriety and righteousness?

In recent years, the political situation in Europe has been unstable, especially in Germany. American universities have taken advantage of this opportunity to recruit as much talent as possible. As a result, the world's first-class scholars have gradually concentrated in the United States, especially in the fields of physics, mathematics, chemistry, and meteorology. These scholars are not all Jewish. After coming to the United States, because of peace of mind and prosperity, their work is even more energetic. It can be seen that the progress of science lies in the spirit, especially in the environment. If it is said that the relationship between science and prosperity is purely an internal change of scientific personnel, may I ask why European scholars must go to the United States? Germany has always been known as the garden of science. Why has science made no progress in the years of war, while the United States has made rapid progress? Only if scientific personnel can settle down in the United States can the United States, which has not produced first-class theoretical scientists before, become a hub of science after being brewed by the first-class scholars.

Our government must have fully understood the difficulties faced by our scientific workers. I firmly believe that it will gradually improve them. It is heard that the research departments of military institutions have excellent equipment. I firmly believe that the government will be able to use this to infer the other, and strive to make all research institutions have excellent equipment, so that science can develop universally and not be subject to special restrictions. The other day, I read Mr. Li Chunyuan's article "The Crisis of China's Science Career" (Shanghai Dagong Bao, August 22), and I deeply admire the correctness of his views and the effective solution. Recently, I read Mr. Xu Foguan's article "Another Crisis of China's Science Career", and I can't help but feel a lot of emotion. I offer what I know to ask for advice from experts. The author only hopes that the domestic science career will develop smoothly, and seeing benevolence and wisdom is not what I care about.

### The Control Yuan Proposes an Impeachment Case Against the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, Requesting Prompt Adjustment and Punishment of Weng Wei and Thomas

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 55th] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Ren Bingjun believe that the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings and its subordinate bodies should promptly make reasonable improvements and adjustments in the entire organizational structure, as well as in internal organization, personnel, powers, and operations. Weng Wei, General Manager of the Subordinate Materials Supply General Warehouse, is difficult to shirk the blame for negligence, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the Automobile Management Office, privately sold automobile parts, which is not without corruption. An impeachment case has been proposed, requesting the Control Yuan to forward it to the Executive Yuan for careful handling and to be dealt with according to the law in order to maintain international credibility and emphasize the rule of law. The Control Yuan has entrusted Committee members Ma Qingduan, Qi Shixun, Yang Qunxian, and Liang Tiancai to review the case and it has been established. The case has been referred to the Executive Yuan for handling. The report of Committee member Ma and others' review decision is recorded as follows:

Committee members Tang Honglie and Ren Bingjun impeached the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, Weng Wei, General Manager of the Materials Supply General Warehouse, for dereliction of duty, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the Automobile Management Office, for privately selling automobile parts. After joint review by the committee members, they unanimously agreed that Deputy Manager Thomas of the Automobile Management Office of the Materials Supply General Warehouse privately sold twelve automobile parts to Hengyuhao in Shanghai in June and July of this year. Moreover, among the four spare parts sold to Hengxinghao on July 5, each part was priced at only 2 million yuan, while Hengxinghao had already resold the above four spare parts to the China Relief Corps on June 26, with a selling price of 5 million yuan each. That is, the deputy manager sold public property without approval, which is not in accordance with the law. Moreover, Hengxinghao had already resold the above four spare parts to other parties at a high price on June 26, which proves that the price ticket issued by the Automobile Management Office on July 5 was obviously false. However, Weng Wei, General Manager of the General Warehouse, did not investigate and close the case, which is difficult to shirk the blame for dereliction of duty. It should be requested that the Executive Yuan forward the case to the Executive Yuan to punish Weng Wei, General Manager of the Materials Supply General Warehouse of the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the subordinate Automobile Management Office, according to the law. Furthermore, the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee lacks specialized technical personnel, and most of the committee members are part-time, unable to devote themselves wholeheartedly. The various business plans are mostly restricted by the Custody Committee, so that the committee affairs cannot be actively carried out. Most of the Chinese committee members of the Custody Committee are also part-time, and do not often attend meetings. Most important decisions are decided by foreign committee members, and many institutions are added to the committee outside the statutory organization. The total number of staff members reaches several thousand, which is considered excessive. Its administrative expenses and business expenses are used independently from the custody funds, and the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee has no power to supervise and verify in practice. Moreover, the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee is located in Nanjing, while the Custody Committee is located in Shanghai, which is inconvenient for contact. It should also be requested that the Executive Yuan be notified to make reasonable improvements and adjustments to the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee and its subordinate Custody Committee in terms of the entire organizational structure, business operations, and powers and personnel.

### Improved Deposit and Exchange Method to Be Announced Soon

The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank Are Carefully Studying It

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Wang Yuan, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, said on the 25th that the improved method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver is currently under careful study by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and will be announced soon. Since the Executive Yuan announced the temporary suspension of deposit exchange on the afternoon of the 24th, prices have fluctuated since the 25th. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon, which is actually caused by the unsound psychology of the people. It is believed that after the improved method of deposit exchange is announced, prices will return to stability. When asked by reporters whether it was true that the amount of gold and silver deposits for exchange would be appropriately increased, Wang said that all speculations were premature in the process of studying the new method.

### The First Sound of Construction in Western Hunan: Harnessing Rivers, Building Roads

[This newspaper's Changde dispatch on the 20th] Many people who do not understand Western Hunan think that this place is strange and mysterious. In fact, it is not. It's just that feudal latent forces are rampant, transportation is blocked, and some aspects are more backward than the "Lower Yangtze" region. At present, Western Hunan can be considered a temporarily safe haven in the overall military situation of suppressing the rebellion. Seeking construction in stability is the key measure of Commander Li Mo'an. The two major projects recently called for by Li are rapidly unfolding with the support of the people.

Developing Resources, Harnessing the Yuan River

The Yuan River is the main artery of nourishment in Western Hunan. It originates in the mountains of Liping, Guizhou, passes through more than 20 counties, meanders eastward, and flows into Dongting Lake from Hanshou, with a total length of over 2,000 li. Important products in the basin include gold, coal, mercury, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron, medicinal materials, fir, bamboo, and tung oil, which is the main commodity for earning foreign exchange. However, the upper reaches are mostly mountainous, which is not conducive to navigation. There are five or six dangerous shoals in the middle reaches. The loss of life and property of the people over the years is countless. The downstream exit is gradually silting up, which will become a disaster. However, the harnessing project is huge. At the end of last month, Li Mo'an summoned the county magistrates, speakers, chairmen of chambers of commerce, local gentry, and experts from various counties in the basin to Changde and held an extremely important and decisive meeting. The steps of the entire project were decided, the difficulties that could not be solved over the years were resolved, and all technical problems were solved. Therefore, the full-scale construction started on the 10th of this month. The organization of this vast water conservancy project is that the Yuan River Project Committee is set up under the 17th Pacification Headquarters and the Hunan Yuan River Basin Planning and Development Committee. Project offices or engineering offices are set up in important project areas, and a large number of engineering consultants and expert committees are hired. Taking advantage of the low water period, it will be completed in twelve months in the next two years.

The most difficult blasting of reefs and chiseling of shoals in the middle reaches has been put out for tender to clear the rubble. As for the Tuan River project, the people are mobilized for voluntary labor, and food subsidies are provided. The project cost is estimated to be 100,000 shi of grain. Hanshou County is the main stream of the Yuan River, injecting into the total mouth of Dongting Lake. Since the collapse of the Dawei Dam, the Yuan River has not followed its old course, resulting in a high riverbed and siltation at the entrance of the main stream, obstructing navigation, and even threatening the drinking water problem in Hanshou. At the same time, from spring to summer, the water cannot be regulated, and the lives and property of Hanshou County are bound to suffer. Therefore, many project offices and engineering offices are set up in this section. The project cost is estimated to be 137,750 US dollars. The first phase started at the beginning of this month and will last until May next year. Speaker Bao of Hanshou has guaranteed that 50,000 laborers can be mobilized, and there is no problem with funding. Every mu of field can automatically donate 4 to 5 dou of rice. Because the benefits of the harnessing are the greatest for Hanshou, and the enclosed lake fields can reach 170,000 mu. The Doushan irrigation project in Changde mainly involves guiding the tributaries of the Yuan River to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of farmland in the Doushan area and can prevent droughts. It also started this month. A roller dam, raft channel, sluice gate, flood control dike, thorn sluice, diversion sluice, culvert, inverted flood pipe, flood reduction sluice, flood discharge sluice, temporary bridge, and 38,000 cubic meters of earthwork will be built in the upper reaches of the tributary. The project cost is estimated to be 60,000 US dollars. The central government has approved a subsidy of 55,200 yuan, and the entire project is estimated to be completed by the end of September next year.

According to the planned target, after the completion of this water conservancy project, ships and bamboo rafts with a load of 300 city dan can be installed and can be smoothly opened from Qinglang Shoal to Changde all year round. Below Changde, 300-ton or more transport ships can be navigated all year round, and the products of the basin can be exported smoothly. In the upper reaches, hydropower can be used to generate electricity and start various electric power industries. The completion of the Changde Doushan irrigation project can increase rice production by 30,000 zu per year. But a huge amount of money is currently lying in the mud? The people of Western Hunan firmly answer: We have endless manpower. In addition, the authorities are planning to levy a tax rate of 2% to 5% on water transportation products such as bamboo, wood, cotton, gallnuts, tung oil, paper, and tobacco. The people of Western Hunan are now happy to pay any price for this great project and work together.

Facilitating Transportation, Opening Up Roads

Opening the map of Western Hunan, with Changde as the center, in addition to the Changtao Highway, the Changyuan section of the Xiangqian Highway, and the Changchang Highway, there is a blank space in the vast area in between. There is not a single inch of road in the eight districts of Western Hunan. According to the resolution of the last pacification meeting, the Pacification Headquarters established the Military Road Construction Committee. The chief engineer of the Provincial Highway Bureau was sent to participate. The committee set up 23 construction sections. The local county magistrate served as the chief of the section. The first phase of the project first launched the Changde to Taoyuan, Cili to Yexian, Shimen to Cili, Cili to Dayong, and other lines. At the end of last month, Commander Li Mo'an convened a meeting of various counties and relevant personnel. In order to save time, it was decided to use the slack season of farming and adopt voluntary labor to start with the Changci, Ciji, and Ciyong lines. At the beginning of this month, various stations started construction at the same time.

The Changci Highway is 90 kilometers long, with two-thirds of it in Taoyuan. The Changtao section was built before the war and was destroyed during the war. The Taoci section started construction in 1945, but it has not been completed in the past three years. The county magistrate of Taoyuan said to the reporter that he is an official who cannot reach the top or bottom. Therefore, he is working very hard this time. Although he has been transferred to the province, he firmly stated that he would complete this road in his hands. He personally supervises the construction on the road and is obviously very hard. More than 2,000 laborers fetch sand from the river as far as five li away every day. Nearly 10,000 labor heroes sweat on the road without fatigue. In order to rescue themselves from poverty, their work mood is excited. The sweat is not shed in vain. County Magistrate Duan affirmed: In another 28 sunny days, the Changci Highway can be fully opened to traffic. The earthwork, bridges, and culverts from Cili to Yexian need to be newly built from scratch. The magistrate of Linye County worked barefoot, wearing straw sandals, and supervised the construction on the road in the rain. Sometimes he also dug a hoe. More than 10,000 laborers are working enthusiastically and nervously. The scene is said to be unprecedented. The Ciyong line is a new road along the Ye River, and it is also a tentacle inserted into the district for the first time. The project is more extensive than other lines. Cili is now concentrating all its efforts on the Cinong line, and this side is temporarily relaxed. But the general office of the section has been established, and let's see how much power Dayong County can spare.

Waterproof and Bandit-proof, Building the City of Changde

The reporter wants to report on another huge city building project: Changde has an ancient, old, and broken city wall. Many corners have collapsed into flat ground, and everyone can freely enter and exit. Only the area around the South Gate is still intact because it prevents the water of the Yuan River from rushing in, so it is constantly being repaired. However, if there are floods in spring and summer, relying on the corner of the South Gate alone will not help. Once a flood occurs, the lives and property of Changde City will inevitably suffer incalculable disasters. Especially in today's turbulent times, in order to consolidate the city's defenses, based on the call to protect property from bankruptcy and protect life at all costs, the reconstruction of the city wall in Changde has started again.

The City Defense Department specially set up an engineering team, and Deputy Commander Wang Mingsheng is responsible for on-site supervision and guidance. Commander Li Mo'an and other senior officials are all personally involved. Construction started on the 27th of last month. More than 5,000 laborers have no salary and no complaints. Men, women, old and young, from every village within 40 li, gather together, get up at dawn, and rest at night. Even smoking is done one by one. Every citizen of Changde is enthusiastically participating in this project that benefits others and themselves in order to protect their family and lives. For three days, all military and political organs in Changde, from the Pacification Headquarters and the Special Service Battalion to the Tax Bureau, all participated, giving the city-building laborers unlimited excitement. All walks of life in Changde recently launched a consolation campaign for them. Within one day, they raised 1,000 catties of pork, 5,000 yuan in cash, and 5,000 theater tickets. But there are also unfair things. Zou Zhensheng, the manager of Changde Juxingcheng Bank, considers himself a privileged class and has a relationship with someone. He does not contribute people or money to this project. He was surrounded by the masses led by the Baozhang and shouted to reason with him. He wanted to rectify it. Under the difficult situation of offending the public, under the true public opinion, he lowered his head and apologized on the spot, admitting to paying for 200 laborers. It should have been published in the newspaper, but for the sake of face, it was changed to a certificate, and the masses dispersed.

From the West Gate through the East Gate to the North Gate, the total length of more than 4,000 meters has been restored to its original appearance. In the prominent areas, countless bunkers and machine gun emplacements have been added. Cars can travel on the city wall. This did not waste a single penny. The workers are voluntary, the bricks are donated, and the materials are recycled waste. This steel chain surrounding Changde was built in such a tense and enthusiastic way. From then on, there are bandits to defend against bandits, and water to defend against water. In an emergency, once martial law is imposed, the gangsters can be easily rounded up, and countless bunkers will become demonstration teaching aids for military and political cadres from various counties who come to Changde for training.

Building cities, repairing roads, and harnessing water are the most severe test of the strength of the people of Western Hunan. Commander Li Mo'an's efforts for the people have not failed. I believe that Western Hunan should progress from now on. (This newspaper reporter Ke Yiren)

### The Netherlands Will Reject the Ceasefire Order, the Dutch Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Announced It Will Continue to Advance into Indonesia, Indonesia Believes the Ceasefire Order is Meaningless

[French News Agency, The Hague, 24th] A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhang Diao, stated that the Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue and the US delegation's declaration on the case cannot change the Dutch government's decision. Regardless of the repercussions, the Dutch government will continue its military operations against the Republic of Indonesia.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 25th] The Dutch side claimed on the 25th that the Netherlands will not accept the United Nations Security Council's ceasefire order because "the communists will use it." The Dutch side claimed that if a ceasefire is ordered at present, the small area between Madiun and Kediri in East Java will become a republic led by Trotskyite communist leaders. At the beginning of this week, the leader of the faction, Malarak, broadcast on Kediri Radio that he would lead the Indonesian people to resist the Netherlands and gain freedom. These Dutch people said that the communists and their sympathizers who participated in the September political riots have been released by the Republic of Indonesia and have joined the Malarak group in Central Java. They said that they are the most resistant in the current Indonesian-Dutch war. However, these people said that the Netherlands' acceptance or rejection of the ceasefire order must wait for The Hague to make a decision. They also said that officials here are waiting for The Hague's decision and cannot issue official comments on the Security Council's decision. At the same time, the Netherlands announced the release of 13 of the 17 senior officials of the Republic of Indonesia, including Dr. Darmastiwin, Hatta's personal representative.

[United Press, The Hague, 24th] The Dutch cabinet will hold an emergency meeting on Christmas Day to discuss the Security Council's ceasefire order.

[United Press, New York, 24th] The Indonesian representative to the United States, Sumidro, said today that the Security Council's ceasefire order is meaningless unless it simultaneously stipulates that Dutch troops withdraw to their positions before the attack. This kind of order only indulges the Dutch army in carrying out its so-called mopping-up war in the occupied areas. The Security Council is so accommodating to the Netherlands that other aggressors will follow suit.

[United Press, Singapore, 25th] The new radio station of the Indonesian Provisional Government in Sumatra has started broadcasting.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 25th] The United Nations Tripartite Mediation Committee notified the head of the Dutch delegation, Sulman, of the Security Council's ceasefire request on the morning of the 25th. A United Nations spokesman said that the official written note has been delivered to the Netherlands. He said that the Security Council's submarine telegram requesting a ceasefire from Paris was received at 8:50 am and was notified to Sulman by the US representative of the Mediation Committee, Coheren. Prior to this, the representatives of the three countries, Coheren of the United States, Krishilai of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Hermann of Belgium, held a meeting to discuss the situation.

### Indonesian Army and the Communist Party Unite to Resist Dutch Aggression, Guerrilla Warfare Has Begun to Become Active in Various Parts of Indonesia

[French News Agency, New Delhi, 24th] The Indonesian representative in New Delhi, Sudasono, claimed today that India, Pakistan, and Burma have decided to actively assist the Republic of Indonesia if the Security Council's resolution and plan for the Indonesian issue cannot satisfy them. He also said that the Dutch aggression has made the Indonesian Communist Party and the Kuomintang form a united front to resist the Dutch army. The Indonesian people will never yield and will do their best to fight guerrilla warfare. Mr. Su thanked Asian countries, especially Australia, for expressing their sympathy for Indonesia with a firm attitude. It is reported that Mr. Su flew from Burma to New Delhi last night and went to see Nehru after arriving and talked for half an hour.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] The Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Army in Banten Province, West Java, broadcast on the evening of the 24th that although the provincial capital of Serang in Banten Province has fallen, the Republican Army will continue to resist. According to a broadcast from the city of Mardis, there are still battles taking place in the Yogyakarta region. Dutch troops are hiding in fortresses at night and dare not go out, which indicates that guerrilla warfare may have begun. Republican General Tomok has been appointed commander of the Indonesian Suicide Squad. At the same time, the Islamic irregular army is preparing to organize guerrilla teams, and the transportation line to Surabaya has been cut off by the guerrilla teams. According to a report from the Republican Radio in Sumatra, the battle around the city of Bukittinggi, which is occupied by the Dutch, is still going on. The headquarters of Dr. Herson, the senior commissioner of the Republic of Sumatra, has moved into the mountains. The Dutch army suffered heavy casualties when attacking Bukittinggi. The Dutch army claimed that the Dutch army has occupied the city of Balok in Central Java. Dutch Commander-in-Chief General Spaba issued a Christmas message to all Dutch troops on the 24th, asking them to implement the spirit of Christmas and step up their efforts to fulfill the order and bestow the beautiful goal of peace on Indonesia.

### Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay for French Use

Vietnam Indicates the Area is a Strategic Zone

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 25th] Nguyen Quoc Dong, the Minister of Education and Acting Minister of Propaganda of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, announced at an important press conference on the morning of the 24th that Phan Rang and Quang Ngai provinces will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Central Government of Vietnam. However, Cam Ranh Bay, located in Quang Ngai province, will be temporarily used by France and the French Federation.

### In the Midst of the Anti-Corruption Case, a Large Number of Japanese Assemblymen Were Arrested

Including Former Minister of Health and Welfare, Giichi Takeda

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] The "Yomiuri Hochi" stated on the 25th that 34 members of the National Assembly have been arrested one after another in the midst of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office's detailed investigation of the chief's corruption case, including former Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida. The three major corruption cases that the District Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating are: (1) The Showa Denko case, which caused the Ashida cabinet to collapse in October. Many former cabinet officials were arrested and imprisoned, and Ashida himself eventually became a prisoner; (2) The coal mine corruption case, in which many key members of the current Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party have been arrested; (3) The cotton spinning bureau corruption case, in which Mrs. Kato, the leading figure in Japan's birth control theory, has also been summoned. It is reported that the chairman of a textile factory gave Mrs. Kato a donation of 1 million yen. The chairman is now in prison.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Former Japanese Minister of Health and Welfare, Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, Giichi Takeda, and six assemblymen were arrested this morning for being implicated in the coal mine or Showa Denko corruption case. Takeda accepted bribes of several million yen from Showa Fertilizer Powder Company and Kyushu Coal Mine Feidong.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office has recently stepped up the arrest of relevant criminals in the Showa Denko case, and Toshio Umabayashi, the president of the former Democratic Party assemblyman Umabayashi faction, was taken into custody on the 24th. In addition, the residence of former Democratic Liberal Party assemblyman Nakajima has also been searched, and there is a possibility of being detained.

### Britain May Convene an Imperial Conference Immediately to Review the New Situation in the Far East, British and Australian Officials Advocate Forming an Anti-Communist Alliance in the East

[Associated Press, London, 24th] The Star Evening News said on the 24th that there is a possibility of convening an emergency Imperial Conference early next year to discuss the situation in the Far East. The British Foreign Office described the situation in the Far East as "very serious and disturbing." Officials from the Commonwealth Relations Office told the Associated Press today that they knew nothing about such a conference. They did not completely deny the news, but said: "The holding of an emergency conference seems very unlikely."

[Associated Press, London, 25th] British and Australian Commonwealth officials, who are directly concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East, are considering an organization similar to the Western European Union, which needs to appear in the East. Due to the seriousness of the situation in China, the Communist Party has long been eyeing Hong Kong. British officials are worried that Hong Kong will be difficult to preserve if all of China is redized. In addition, the development of Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, these worries may not be far away. British businessmen are planning how to deal with their investments in various parts of the Far East. It is estimated that the total investment is around 500 million shillings. Australia believes that the situation in the Far East has cast the most serious crisis on Britain's foreign policy, and its impact will be seen soon. However, Australia does not prevent India and Pakistan from falling into the Soviet Asian Iron Curtain, but believes that the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia will further make Indonesia lean left.

### Partial Reorganization of the South Korean Cabinet

Changes in the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs

[United Press, Seoul, 25th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee announced today a partial reorganization of the cabinet. Foreign Minister Chang Taek-sang was transferred to the post of special envoy to the United Kingdom, and his vacant post was succeeded by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Koh Chang-il. Minister of Internal Affairs, Yun Chi-young, was transferred to the post of special envoy to the Philippines, and his vacant post was succeeded by Shin Sung-mo.

Chang Taek-sang said that the President had the power to dismiss me, and I had no power to resist, but Chang did not pursue this statement...

### Italian Diplomatic Activities, Prime Minister Gasperi Will Visit Washington Early Next Year to Remove Obstacles to Participating in the Atlantic Pact

[Associated Press, Rome, 25th] Diplomatic circles speculate that Prime Minister Gasperi may go to Washington early next year to clarify Italy's position in the Western European Union and the Atlantic Pact. These people said that Italy is trying to immediately participate in the discussions on the Western European Union, but they will not make any comments on whether they will actually participate in the alliance. They said, "The meeting between the British and Italian foreign ministers and Prime Minister Gasperi's visit to the United States are not impossible under the current circumstances." A certain authoritative diplomatic source said that Prime Minister Gasperi would not oppose visiting the United States again, as Mr. Gasperi went to the United States in January 1946 to seek economic assistance. These people also said that unofficial probes on this visit had already been launched in Washington, but it seems that this matter is still outside the official scope. Well-informed diplomatic sources said that Italy's urgent need to participate in the plan negotiations on the Western European Union was the main reason for Foreign Minister Sforza's recent meeting with French Foreign Minister Schuman. It is said that Italian Foreign Minister Sforza will go to Paris at the end of January next year to participate in the final stage of the Franco-Italian Customs Union Conference. Mr. Sforza's trip has attracted much attention here, because British Foreign Minister Bevin will also arrive in Paris at that time to attend the Western European Union Foreign Ministers' Conference, and Mr. Sforza may be able to meet with him. It is believed that this meeting will be a prelude to resolving the issue of the former Italian colonies.

### Canada Recognizes Israel, No Major Battles on the Negev Front

[United Press, Ottawa, 25th] Canada recognized the State of Israel and its de facto existence of the provisional government on the 23rd. This is the same as the recognition method adopted by the United States and South Africa, and there is no need to formally exchange diplomatic envoys. The Soviet Union and other countries have adopted the latter method of recognition. Canada's move will be a precursor to Britain taking similar action.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 24th] According to an Israeli military spokesman on the evening of the 24th, heavy rain on Christmas Eve has greatly hindered the movement of troops in the Negev Desert. Except for "a few air activities" on both sides, there are no other battles.

### Christmas Carols, Wishing for Peace to Descend on the World, Ending the Killing, Goodwill to People

[Associated Press, London, 24th] The lyrics of the Christmas carolers were sung sacredly on the evening of the 24th, especially to the military and diplomatic leaders of the world. The lyrics say: "Peace on earth, goodwill to men..."

Those responsible for world affairs will tell everyone (1) If ever, the world has had a long period of no complete peace. (2) World War II is over, but only an armed truce. (3) In addition to the Cold War between East and West, the world map is full of sores, and human beings are killing each other.

In the days before Christmas, new wars broke out in Indonesia and southern Palestine. The Chinese civil war has been going on for a long time, and it is said that one-fifth of China is seeking "glorious peace" from the Chinese Communists. At international conferences, such as the recent General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris, there is little "goodwill to men." The opposing sides accuse each other of being untrustworthy and even say that they are plotting to start an atomic war. The Security Council needs to continue its meeting during the Christmas holiday to end the disputes in the Far East and the Middle East. "Peace on earth, goodwill to men," sing the Christmas carolers, and the world hopes so.

### Bethlehem is Covered with Barbed Wire

### Barkley Arrives in Germany

New American-style airplanes for the Berlin Airlift

### Smith Departs Soviet Union for the US

[United Press Moscow, 25th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, accompanied by his wife, flew to the US today via Berlin.

### Eisenhower to Succeed Marshall as Secretary of State If Long-Term Rest Needed; US Foreign Policy Unlikely to Change

[French News Agency Washington, 24th] It is learned that if Marshall requires a long-term rest, General Eisenhower will succeed him as Secretary of State. Marshall is scheduled to leave the hospital next week for his residence in Pinehurst, North Carolina. According to his doctors, Marshall will need to rest for several months. It is said that Marshall met with President Truman before undergoing surgery and said that he might need a long period of rest after the surgery, and he would like to recommend Eisenhower as his successor, which Truman agreed with. However, it is not yet certain whether Eisenhower will accept the appointment.

It is widely believed that if Eisenhower accepts the appointment, US foreign policy will not change, because Eisenhower, during his time as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during the war, not only made decisions and issued orders, but also had to integrate the opinions of the heads of various countries, making him not only a military strategist, but also a diplomat. Eisenhower was also closely involved in the international policies of the late President Roosevelt and had mediated the disputes between Stalin and the late President. Eisenhower has always paid close attention to the position of Europe in international competition. According to those close to Eisenhower, he strongly supports the principles of the Atlantic Charter and advocates providing military lend-lease assistance to European countries if they engage in modernizing their armed forces. In his recently published book, "Crusade in Europe," Eisenhower expressed that even at this time, he still holds great optimism about the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. Although the two countries have very different systems, he hopes that they can reach a tacit understanding based on the concept of "live and let live." The idea of two vastly different lifestyles can be reconciled and formed into concrete and constructive agreements, and this optimism will never disappear.

### Inside Story Behind the Iron Curtain

— Translated by 礝石

In the vast area from the Soviet Union to Berlin, according to reports from American journalists, there are hidden reefs and underground activities by communists opposing Moscow.

The Tito regime in Yugoslavia is currently encouraging Eastern Europe to resist Moscow's orders. In Poland, pro-Moscow communists and nationalistic communists are openly confronting each other, and infighting is also occurring within the Czech Communist Party.

Although there are no signs of victory for communists resisting Moscow's orders in Eastern Europe, this has already made the Soviet Union feel chilled, so it is preparing to strengthen its control over Eastern Europe.

In Eastern Europe, communist leaders, in order to show their loyalty to the Soviet Union, are devoting themselves to pleasing Moscow. Czechoslovakia and Poland are currently carrying out cleansing movements, and both countries are adopting repressive measures for all administrative matters, regardless of whether they violate public opinion.

Eastern Berlin is a region controlled by the Soviet Union. It has encouraged the German Communist Party to occupy the Berlin City Hall and drive out the non-communist city government. The Soviet occupation forces in Germany are constantly creating incidents, imposing land and sea blockades on West Berlin, and threatening Anglo-American airlift assistance. The Soviet Union is using such means to take over Berlin and expand its sphere of influence.

The communist organization is directly controlled by Moscow, which is also the Soviet Union's best weapon in the "Cold War," because many communist leaders in those countries are loyal to Moscow regardless of their own national conditions. However, there are also patriotic communists in the Eastern European countries, which has caused uneasiness for Moscow.

Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, and the Soviet-occupied areas of Germany and Austria are all directly controlled by Moscow. Poland and Czechoslovakia are semi-controlled by Moscow. As for Finland and Yugoslavia, they are now countries that do not rely on Moscow and do not listen to Soviet instructions.

The communist dictator of Yugoslavia, Tito, refuses to obey Moscow's orders, which is a major concern for the Soviet Union. In the weeks following the Tito incident, Soviet newspapers did not comment in order to elicit Tito's "confession," but Tito ultimately did not "apologize" to Moscow, so they began to criticize Tito's rebellion, while Tito and his domestic public opinion, on the contrary, condemned Moscow for undermining communist unity. At the same time, he publicly declared to the communist parties in Eastern Europe, urging them to follow the Yugoslav line. Yugoslavia's position in Eastern Europe is better than that of other countries. Only a few people in Yugoslavia support Moscow, while the majority of the Yugoslav people support Tito. The opposite is true in other Eastern European countries, because those countries are ruled by a minority of communists backed by Moscow. It is precisely for this reason that those countries cannot openly resist Moscow like Tito. However, the Tito incident has opened up a new path for the countries of Eastern Europe.

Infighting among Polish communist leaders is fierce. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka is a figure supported by the domestic masses and communist party members, and he has caused protests and bad impressions from patriotic communists by refusing Moscow's orders and "confessing" to the Soviet Union, which has also weakened the influence of the Polish Communist Party. The main goal of the Polish Communist Party's struggle is to make all Polish farmers join the collective farms run by the Communist Party. Although the Polish Communist Party leaders are so enthusiastic about following Moscow's land reform policy, unfortunately, it has not gained Moscow's favor in its diplomacy.

The Polish Communist Party is very worried about the revival of Germany, so it often opposes Moscow's plan to unify Germany and organize a German government. On the other hand, Poland hopes to expand its trade with the West and is also cursing the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the Marshall Plan for European aid, so the anti-Soviet front in Poland is being secretly cultivated.

The Czech communist government is facing even more difficulties. Prague prisons are now filled with people who participated in anti-Soviet demonstrations on the day of former President Benes' funeral. The Slavic farmers in the eastern part of the country are unwilling to support the current communist government with food. At the same time, the Czech communist government, like Poland, is opposing the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany and wants to expand trade between Eastern and Western Europe.

In East Germany under Soviet military occupation, the communist party's efforts are considerable, but these communists, although within the Soviet sphere of influence, do not advocate that the Soviet Union transport large amounts of production materials and dismantle factories in the area to compensate for wartime destruction. As for the economic situation in East Germany, current production is below the target of its two-year recovery plan. At the same time, because the Soviet Union believes that the current East German Communist Party is not a true believer of Moscow, it is very unwilling to authorize them. As a result, the East German Communist Party is even more dissatisfied with Soviet policy.

Other Soviet satellite countries cannot help but rely on Moscow due to various factors such as geographical advantage and popular support. Since the Tito incident, the Albanian Communist Party, in order to show its loyalty to Moscow, has been currying favor with Moscow and publicly condemning Tito for rebelling against the Communist Information Bureau. However, Albania is harboring panic because it is adjacent to Yugoslavia and fears that Yugoslavia will invade its borders. As a result, it sought help from Moscow. The Soviet Union immediately sent a delegation of one thousand people, and the majority of them were military delegations. However, it pleased Moscow, but offended Yugoslavia.

Moscow is very concerned about Romania and Bulgaria. Soviet texts are now mandatory subjects in the schools of these two countries. However, the communist governments of these two countries are very troubled by preventing the nationalistic movements within their countries. The Hungarian communist organization is very weak, and now it is running the government with the help of Soviet troops stationed there. Although Finland is one of the Soviet satellite countries, it is under the rule of a non-communist government. Moscow is very dissatisfied with this government, but it is supported by the masses of the people. In short, an anti-Moscow front is budding in the communist circle of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union also knows about this crisis, so it is working to strengthen its satellite countries. (Translated from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine)

### New Methods for Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver; President Yu to Nanjing for Consultation; Public and Education Sector's Gold and Silver Exchange Basically Resolved

[Our Reporter] President Yu Hongjun of the National Bank took a train to Nanjing last night to consult with the Ministry of Finance on new methods for depositing and exchanging gold and silver, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai early next week. There are two observations here regarding the future deposit and exchange methods: (1) It is believed that the government may increase the amount of deposits when depositing and exchanging gold and silver so that its value is close to the black market, so that the situation of bank runs can be naturally eliminated; (2) In order to solve the problem once and for all, the price of gold and silver will be restored to being listed and adjusted at any time. The deposit and exchange of gold and silver will take this listed price as the standard. In other words, it is a policy of free buying and selling of gold and silver. As for the problem of gold and silver exchange for public and education personnel, after Mayor Wu negotiated with the Central Bank authorities, it has been basically resolved, that is, all public and education personnel who have been drawn and obtained permission will immediately handle the payment and exchange of gold. Starting from 4 pm yesterday, the Municipal Bank will first handle the payment of licenses numbered 1 to 7. For the remaining license numbers, the Municipal Bank will individually notify the deposit and exchange by number. As for those who have participated in the lottery but have not obtained a license, representatives from various agencies will directly negotiate with the Municipal Government to handle the matter. For those who have neither participated in the lottery nor have a license, Yu Hongjun will ask for instructions after going to Nanjing, and then decide on the handling method. In addition, the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau is extremely concerned about the public and education sector's gold and silver exchange, and sent representatives to the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the situation. After being informed to wait for the re-determination of the method, they left.

[Another Report] Employees of various state-owned enterprises in the city believe that the authorities' handling of gold and silver exchange for the public and education sector this time is limited to employees of units that receive in-kind rations, and they are also civil servants and should enjoy the same rights. Yesterday noon, more than a dozen representatives were sent to the Municipal Government to meet with Mayor Wu to petition.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 25th] The bodies of 32 victims of China Airlines Flight 104, the Overlord plane, were transported from Huoshizhou to Hong Kong on the evening of the 24th.

### Situation Bleak on Christmas Eve; Low Turnout at Labor Comfort Dance

[Our Reporter] The all-night labor comfort dance organized by the city's comfort association at various dance halls had its first night on Christmas Eve. Due to the curfew, the number of dancers was not as high as expected. According to the statistics group of the association, the number of tickets sold the previous night was 600+ at Paramount, 600+ at Ciro's, 200+ at New Ciro's, 200+ at Cosmopolitan, 111 at MGM, and 107 at Grand Shanghai. Smaller dance halls earned even less, such as New Dahua, which only sold 10+ tickets. In total, the amount raised was far from the association's goal of raising 1 million yuan per night. After 11 pm the previous night, Lido had to stop playing because the band temporarily requested a subsidy that was not granted, and the dancers all transferred to the Cosmopolitan. Business at various dance halls improved last night, but many dancers still evaded purchasing tickets. The comfort association sent personnel to randomly check and persuade them to purchase tickets. According to the person in charge of the comfort association, the purpose of holding the all-night dance is to raise funds for comforting the military and police who maintain the city's security on New Year's Day. The association has taken into account the business of the dance halls and has agreed in advance to allocate 50% of the ticket revenue to cover the dance halls' expenses. Therefore, it is hoped that dancers, dance halls, and the police and military who assist in maintaining order will fully cooperate with the association to achieve complete success.

Zhong He, former Chief of the Transportation Section of the Police Headquarters, was summoned to court yesterday to testify.

### Male Corpse Found While Fishing, Murder Case in East Shanghai Solved, Two Criminals Caught, Confessed to Revenge Killing

[Reported by our newspaper] At around 12:00 noon on the 20th, an unidentified male corpse was found in the Xijiazhai River in Ma Yushan Road, East Shanghai. A fisherman accidentally caught the corpse and reported it to the Xinshi Street Police Branch Bureau. Branch Director Wang Zhaoxin rushed to the scene for inspection. A national identity card was found on the deceased, identifying him as Zhu Asan, 18 years old, from Qidong. After returning to the bureau, Liu, the section chief, was instructed to deploy intelligence. At the same time, staff members Su Yongqing, along with criminal police officers Shi Chenghou, Qu Nairong, and Xu Daquan, were dispatched to investigate and apprehend the suspects. It was learned that many Qidong natives lived around Shanghai University of Science and Technology on Jungong Road, so investigations were started there. By dusk, it was learned that the deceased's foster father, Niu Xiqi (45 years old, from Haimen), worked as a school worker at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The investigating police officers rushed to arrest him overnight and asked him about the whereabouts of the victim. According to Niu: "I am a cook at Shanghai University. On the 21st, Zhu Asan came to my house from Baoshan. Because the room was small and there were too many people, I could not accommodate him. I accompanied him to the school to meet a fellow townsman, Zhu Zhongyi. At that time, Zhongyi was having dinner in the dining hall. I handed Asan over to him, and then I left. The next day at noon, I went to Zhongyi's place to call Asan for dinner, but Zhongyi said he had left. It was not until the 23rd that people in the school read the newspaper and learned that Asan had been murdered." After the investigating police officers obtained this confession, they arrested Zhu Zhongyi at Shanghai University of Science and Technology at 2:00 PM on the same afternoon and brought him in for questioning. Zhu confessed: Zhu Asan had joined the New Fourth Army in his hometown of Qidong. My younger brother, Zhu Zhongxin, died at his hands. My father was kidnapped, but fortunately escaped. All the family's property was confiscated by him. There was also a fellow townsman named Qian Bujian, a carpenter, who was also harmed in the countryside. His family was destroyed, and he was all alone. He currently lives at No. 64, Jia 12, Bao 14, Xinxishi District, Yinxiang Port. After learning that Zhu Asan was staying at my house, I discussed with Qian how to get revenge. We agreed to kill him. That night (i.e., the 21st), after discussing it, we invited Asan, falsely claiming to go back to Qian Bujian's door, and called Qian out to go to see a play together. When we reached about half a li southwest of Shanghai University of Science and Technology (i.e., the above-mentioned location, which is unusually remote), there was no one around. I grabbed Asan's hands, and Qian took out a carpenter's square and stabbed Asan in the forehead. He stabbed him four more times in the neck. Asan fell to the ground and died on the spot. We threw the body into the river and went back to school to sleep. Killing Zhu Asan was purely revenge." He also confessed the whereabouts of the accomplice Qian Bujian. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Qian was captured in a shantytown in Yinxiang Port and brought to the bureau for separate interrogation. However, Qian was extremely cunning and flatly denied helping to commit the murder. After the main culprit confronted him and identified him, he lowered his head and said nothing, admitting everything without hesitation. The branch bureau plans to apply for an extension of detention for the two criminals for further interrogation.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously, due to the promulgated "Supplementary Measures for Fiscal Reorganization," concerning the revision of fee collection standards, stipulated that the threshold for business profit income tax was 150 gold yuan, and the threshold for salary and remuneration income tax was 40 yuan per month. Both were based on the real value of the newly issued gold yuan at the time. Now that the gold yuan's value has depreciated fivefold, these thresholds should naturally be appropriately raised. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry replied stating that an adjustment plan for the threshold and tax brackets for fixed salary income tax had already been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, an order would be issued for implementation. As for the levy of business profit income tax for the second half of this year, it will be based on the net profit earned by businesses in the first half of the year. The original supplementary measures were determined based on the economic situation in the first half of the year and are not related to current prices. The request for adjustment should not be discussed, according to the Ministry.

### Tightening Monetary Policy to Suppress Price Inflation – National Banks Begin Selling Goods Yesterday – Materials Committee Prepared 30,000 Pieces of Cloth

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, prices in the city eased slightly. The Central Bank, in order to tighten monetary policy and suppress price inflation, resumed its policy of selling goods. It is estimated that the value of cotton yarn sold yesterday exceeded 24 million gold yuan. Therefore, the price of cotton cloth decreased slightly yesterday. Starting next week, the previously loose monetary policy will tighten. Yesterday, the city's monetary policy was slightly tight in the morning, with daily interest rates rising to 20 yuan at one point. However, due to continued large deposits from national banks, rates fell back to the range of 12 to 15 yuan. Black market prices for gold and silver were similar to the previous day. However, rice prices continued to rise sharply. The highest price on the Shangbai Market was 560 yuan, and retail prices even exceeded 600 yuan.

[United WeChat News] Recently, market fluctuations have resumed. To stabilize prices and people's livelihoods, financial authorities have decided to continue selling goods from the 25th, primarily cotton cloth. According to Central Bank Deputy Governor Liu, the quantity sold will depend on market needs. It is reported that the Central Bank's Materials Committee has prepared 20,000 bolts of cloth and 10,000 bales of cotton yarn for sale at any time.

[Another Report] Prices in the city turned downward yesterday due to various efforts to reduce demand. The Central Bank's response to this round of inflation, having decided to sell large quantities of cotton cloth, will adjust the quantity sold based on market demand. According to bank officials, this round of inflation is expected to subside within days after coordinated efforts from all parties.

The city's Financial Administration, in coordination with relevant agencies such as the Municipal Police Department, launched a strict search and arrest operation yesterday against the rampant black market for gold and currency, in order to cooperate with relevant agencies to combat inflation and stabilize the market.

### Suppliers Strongly Resist Price Drops – Rice Prices Rise Sharply Across the Board – Top-Quality Northern Rice Once Quoted at 600 Yuan in Beishi

Rice prices continued to rise sharply yesterday. Considering general commodity prices, the increase in rice prices was relatively small, and suppliers strongly resisted price drops. The morning market was extremely tight, and no one was willing to offer samples for a time. Later, trading gradually resumed, and prices rose sharply. Top-quality northern rice in the Beishi market was once quoted at over 600 yuan. However, due to weak reports in other commodity markets, prices declined slightly. Top-quality rice closed at 590 yuan, and white rice and Bo Dao rice were at 560 yuan, each up by 100 yuan. In the Nanshi market, white rice was at 545 yuan, and Bo Dao rice was at 555 yuan, the former up by 105 yuan and the latter up by 95 yuan. Prices of all types of rice weakened slightly near closing in both markets. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 10,946 shi.

Outside the flour market, shouted prices rose again, but prices fell near closing, resulting in a net increase. Initially, due to rising rice prices, confidence remained strong, and suppliers strongly resisted price drops. Lao Che, Bing Chuan, and various other brands were mostly quoted above 200 yuan. Lao Che opened at a high of 232 yuan, but later fell along with other declining commodities. Lao Che closed at 213 yuan, a net increase of 8 yuan. Bing Chuan opened at 220 yuan and closed at 208 yuan, up 18 yuan. Hong Feng Jian Cheng mostly rose by 7-8 yuan. Wheat bran also rose initially before declining, resulting in a net increase of 3-4 yuan.

### Monetary Policy Suddenly Tightens – Foreign Exchange and Securities Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday was the weekend, and monetary policy in the market tightened as the market surged, leading to a significant decrease in bank deposits. Internal supply decreased significantly, and many external investors also participated in bidding, leading to a major change in financial circulation. Market interbank lending rates were as high as 25 yuan, mostly between 20 and 22 yuan, and the demand for funds increased further near noon.

Cash funds also became slightly scarce. Industrial and commercial firms distributed year-end bonuses to employees, creating significant demand. The previous night's bank clearing was delayed, resulting in a decrease in balances at the Central Bank, which affected withdrawals yesterday. It is reported that the discount for large bills was unusually high yesterday, reaching 60 or 70 yuan per thousand yuan.

The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to rise yesterday, closing at 76.75 yuan, up 6.25 yuan from the previous day. The Central Bank's posted exchange rate for remittances from overseas Chinese also rose to 76 yuan yesterday, an increase of 6 yuan.

### Sino-Dutch Barter Trade – Both Parties Reportedly Reached Agreement

Rush Mat and Tung Oil for Western Medicine and Rubber

It is understood that the barter trade between China and the Netherlands has been finalized by the relevant authorities of both parties and can be implemented mutually. The Netherlands will ship large quantities of Western medicines and rubber to China. Western medicines and rubber are materials needed for China's war effort, especially since the domestic rubber industry is severely lacking in rubber raw materials. The import of these materials will benefit China. The materials shipped from China to the Netherlands will be rush mats, tung oil, and bristles, which are also needed by the Netherlands. In addition to tung oil and bristles, which are special products of China, rush mats are also famous products of China. Those produced in Taiwan and other places are well-known both domestically and internationally. The Central Trust Bureau, which is in charge of barter trade, is currently conducting a detailed survey of the quantity of goods that can be exported from China in various production areas for barter trade reference. The exact date when Sino-Dutch barter trade will officially begin will be determined after the contract is signed in the shortest possible time.

### Sugar Prices Retreat After Rising

The sugar market weakened yesterday. After a sharp rise for several days, sentiment softened, and other commodities generally declined. There was a strong desire to cash in profits. Prices declined across the board at closing. No. 45 Che Bai Jing, with shipments next Monday, traded at 800 yuan, down 30 yuan. Coarse sugar closed at 760 yuan, down 40 yuan. The Qingzhang Diao Qing sugar offered by special firms was relatively scarce and did not attract buyers after arrival, with only a slight increase in price. The rest all declined.

### Silk Prices Decline

Trade in rayon was sluggish yesterday, and the market was weak. Cotton cloth declined slightly, and the black market for finance trended downward. Sentiment was scattered. The market was saturated with supply, and retail investors sold off actively. Prices declined across the board. No. 120 Tianqiao opened at 24,700 yuan and declined steadily, hitting a low of 23,000 yuan. Later, buying interest picked up slightly, and the downward trend was reversed, closing at 23,500 yuan, a decline of 1,000 yuan. Various grades of Dongyang Jin Sanma also declined by 700-800 yuan.

Due to the Christmas holiday, most foreign traders were closed yesterday, and no transactions were reported for raw silk for export. The market sentiment for raw silk for domestic sales seemed uncertain due to the rising price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. However, due to the sharp rise the previous day, the market foundation was weak. D-grade 78 evenness was quoted at 26,000 yuan, but attracted few buyers and quickly fell back 1,500 yuan, with transactions finally occurring at 24,000 yuan. High-grade Lingdan Jiliganjing were all soft.

The silk and satin market was also weak yesterday. Buying interest was not strong, and retail investors competed to sell, but most buyers were watching, resulting in sluggish trading and weakening sentiment. Meiya Beimian opened at 16,000 yuan, briefly rising by 300-500 yuan, but later selling pressure exceeded buying, and the price fell by 1,000 yuan, closing at 15,500 yuan, a decline of 700 yuan. The rest were also soft.

### Tung Oil Prices Continue to Rise

In the tung oil market yesterday, the majority of the transactions were high quality export grade white oil. Although it was the Christmas holiday, exporters, considering the approaching shipping dates, continued to launch strong offensives. Sentiment remained upbeat, and holders continued to push prices higher. Prices rose again. Qingyou and Hongjiang tung oil also showed strength, with rapid increases.

### Financial Institution Business Inspections to Continue

The Financial Administration has been conducting inspections since this week to understand the flow of floating capital and the business situation of financial institutions. The first batch was divided into 15 groups, with each group responsible for inspecting two institutions. The inspections have been completed and the reports are being compiled. It is understood that the inspection situation is generally good. Due to the evolving situation, financial institutions are being extremely cautious in their deposit and loan operations to prevent risk. At present, due to the current situation, floating capital is actually entering the speculative market and accumulating materials. The authorities are trying to channel it. It is reported that the second batch of inspections is scheduled to begin next week.

### This Week's Export Price Limits Slightly Increased or Decreased Separately

Tea markets in Tianjin and Zhuang are closed due to the export for holiday. There's a flurry of purchasing activity as the overseas market turns feverish, boosting high export prices. Overseas observation shook, prompting a chorus of approval. However, authorities are facing increasing costs and search prices, with limited inventory available. Supply diminishes, reducing transactions, with interior colors like the local flowers still high in demand. Market prices followed by following increases.

### Manufacturers Exporting Industrial Products Can Use Export Foreign Exchange

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources, after the promulgation and implementation of the new measures for managing import and export trade, the "Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Exported Products" and the "Measures for Permitting Special Imports of Packaging Materials Needed by Exporters for Shipping Export Goods" formulated and implemented by the Export Control Committee prior to its reorganization are still valid. According to these two sets of measures, manufacturers who export industrial products, such as rubber, thermoses, straw hats, and enamelware, may use a portion of their earned export foreign exchange to import their manufacturing raw materials. In addition, exporters of agricultural, industrial, and animal products are also allowed to apply for the import of foreign packaging materials actually needed using a portion of their earned export foreign exchange. The intention is to enable manufacturers who export industrial products to directly order raw materials and packaging materials from abroad using their own export foreign exchange. This import is not subject to the qualification of being a registered importer, nor is it subject to quota allocation restrictions, which greatly assists manufacturers who operate export sales of industrial products. It is reported that the committee's past performance has been very good and can greatly supplement the newly promulgated import and export trade measures to achieve the effect of implementing commodity chain and promoting exports.

### Most Buyers Watching – Cotton Yarn Market Slightly Declines – Cloth Initially Weak, Continues Firm, Rises Very Slightly

Cotton yarn rose sharply and fell slightly. Most buyers turned to watching, and holders, wary of high prices, sold off at highs. Popular grades were also unable to open higher, and the market weakened slightly.

42-count Lanfeng rose from 27,000 yuan to a high of 27,500 yuan, then closed at a low of 26,900 yuan, down 2,100 yuan from the previous day. The remaining Baoguang and Tiannv, etc., all declined slightly by 1,300 to 2,000 yuan. 40-count Lanfeng fell slightly by 1,500 yuan, closing at 23,200 yuan. 32-count Yinyue retreated slightly by 800 yuan.

21-count Shuangma spot goods approached the 20,000 yuan level, opening at 19,500 yuan, a low of 19,100 yuan, noon closing at 19,400 yuan, finally down 800 yuan. Warehouse receipt fell 700 yuan to 18,400 yuan. 20-count Shuangma fell sharply by 500 yuan, Jinji and Tiannv all fell slightly by about 300 yuan, and Yida count also showed slight weakness. Except for Tongzijun, which rose by 200 yuan, 10-count yarn showed a weak state.

The cloth market was initially weak but then continued firm. Opening trade was uneventful. Small households retreated one after another. With demand for cheaper products still present, the market saw a better outlook.

Longtou fine cloth opened at 680 yuan, with prices raising to 715 yuan, before closing at 710, an increase of 5 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bi ji opened at 680, reached 700, and then closed at 690, remaining even with the day before. Jin Lian Miao Wu yuan bi ji also showed no gain or loss. Tiao Li Yuan bi ji fell by 40 yuan. Sijunzi yuan zhigong rose by 10 yuan, closing at 700 yuan. Private factories in and around Shanghai still sold at a value of 600. 190 was priced at 1300. Direct sales, while narrow, remained solid.

### Turnaround in Silk Exports

According to Hengwei from the silk industry, although silk companies are currently affected by high labor costs and expenses, outward-bound export profits are now satisfactory in comparison to the industry's decline last year. Authorities are hoping that the government will (1) restore export packing loans, and (2) encourage relevant agencies to provide convenient transportation tools to merchants.

### Hong Kong Before Christmas – A "Sky Master" Broken in Half – Even Japanese Goods Adorn the "National Goods Exhibition"

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Zi Jian

[Airmail report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 23rd] Before Santa Claus in red robes and white hair delivered his gifts to the people of Hong Kong this year, as if he had visited other cities in the past two or three years, he first brought a terrible disaster: a "Sky Master" at about 2 p.m. on the 21st, at a low altitude in Baiershen, more than ten miles northeast of Hong Kong, collided with the top of Huoshiniao Mountain, immediately destroying thirty-three lives. The danger of flying in fog has added another layer of shadow to people's minds.

"Sky Master" Victims – Half Burned to Death, Half Fell to Their Deaths

According to eyewitnesses returning from the disaster scene: the crashed "Sky Master" was broken in two, the upper half resting on the top of the mountain and already burned down. The lower half fell into a mountain pit, irreparably damaged. It seems that some of the victims must have died from falling rather than burning. A person close to the aviation industry said: Kai Tak Airport, because the visibility over Hong Kong had been obscured by dense fog, had telegraphed the Sky Master to divert to Guangzhou to land, but for some reason, it crashed into the mountain through the cloud gap and was shattered to pieces.

According to the company: Three "Sky Master" aircraft flew out of Shanghai at the same time on the morning, the other two landed safely in Hong Kong, good luck and misfortune are separated by a hair's breadth!

### Tragedy Followed by Comedy – Ma Lianliang's Play Performed for the First Time

Today, in front of the Hong Kong office of China National Aviation Corporation, people came and went, especially crowded. Turning a corner, we also found a pile of people, but the former were people inquiring about the plane crash, and the latter were audiences waiting to buy tickets to listen to Ma Lianliang sing. "Shanghai customers" also accounted for the majority of spectators in this tragedy and a comedy. At about the same time, the Li Li Opera Troupe and the Ma Lianliang Opera Troupe performed in two major theaters in central Hong Kong, respectively. This was the first Peking opera performance after the war. There were also many people who did not understand Mandarin but went to admire the name. In the past half month, the performances on the "political stage" in Hong Kong have also been quite lively, and Long Yun's arrival in Hong Kong has pushed this play to a climax.

### This Year's Christmas Gifts are Cheap – The Market is Colder

At the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula on the opposite side of Hong Kong, there is another very lively scene. The first Hong Kong "National Goods" exhibition after the war is being held on the open space on the side of the Peninsula Hotel. In this exhibition, people can see the production side of some Shanghai-escaped funds setting up factories in Hong Kong. Despite the big fanfare of the National Goods Exhibition, most of the goods in the major companies in the Christmas market are Japanese goods, which is simply a great irony! "This year's Christmas gifts are cheaper than last year," Hong Kong people say in unison, but this year's market is colder than last year, which shows that Hong Kong cannot prosper without a solution to China's economy.

### Scattered Bandits Fleeing in Jiangdu – County Government Launches Grain Seizure

### Gansu Industrial Loan of 20 Million Yuan – Distributed to Coal Mines and Various Factories

In addition, the production of various institutions has shrunk, and funds are insufficient, and they are considering reducing staff.

### Disagreement Within Three Universities in Western China Regarding Relocation to the South

The University has Transferred Request to the Ministry of Education for a Decision

[Report from this newspaper, Xi'an, 25th] There are new changes in the relocation of three universities, including Xida, to the south. Internal opinions in each school are divided. Since the relocation decision, professors, staff, and students of northern origin have unanimously opposed the relocation to the south and confronted those who advocate the relocation to the south. They have recently repeatedly petitioned, and the university has transferred this opinion to the Ministry of Education for a decision. Xi'an University has been on winter vacation since the 23rd, and the semester exams of Xi'an University and Xi'an Institute of Technology are in progress.

### Undetermined Boundary in Northern Section of Yunnan-Burma Border – Both Sides to Conduct Joint Survey Next Spring

[Report from this newspaper, Minming, 25th] The undetermined boundary in the northern section of the Yunnan-Burma border has been pending for a long time. It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed with the Burmese government to conduct a joint survey next spring.

### Document of Impeachment by the Control Yuan Against the Yangtze Company (End)

(3) Upon investigation, it was found that according to regulations, all goods stored in warehouses should be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau by filling out a material registration form. However, the said company prepared an inventory list in English on September 25th and directly submitted it to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office. This office should have immediately recognized the procedural error and ordered the company to submit it to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and instructed them to prepare a registration form in Chinese. Instead of doing so, they accepted it and treated it as a legal registration, which cannot be excused from suspicion of showing favoritism. Furthermore, after the case occurred on September 29th, it caused a national sensation. The office failed to take timely and active measures as it would have in other cases, and only handed it over to the police bureau to handle the case according to law and report back. This naturally failed to convince the public and had a significant impact on the work under its management at the time. It wasn't until November 6th, when economic controls were about to be abolished, that without waiting for the Shanghai Police Bureau to report back on the handling of the case, it took emergency measures to require the company's industrial raw materials and daily necessities to be supplied to the market at limited prices. Although this does not fail to be a remedial measure showing a sense of responsibility, it is still regrettable in that it failed to seize the opportunity to handle the matter completely. However, since the office was neither an executive agency nor under orders to conclude, the responsible personnel are temporarily excused from discussion.

(4) Upon investigation, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance estimated that the Yangtze Construction Company's income and profit taxes for the 36th year (of the Republic, i.e. 1947) were over 177 million yuan, which was less than one-thousandth of one percent of the amount it should have paid. No wonder the national treasury's tax revenue is decreasing daily, the burden on the common people is increasing daily, and the rich are becoming richer by the day. Further investigation reveals that according to Article 2 of the Measures for the Collection of Business Income Tax in the 37th Year (1948), Article 21 of the Income Tax Law, and the provisions of Article 31, in addition to paying the estimated income and profit taxes, the company should have determined the amount and paid it off as soon as possible. However, as of October 17th, when Huang Zupei, the Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, personally handed over the company's tax payment forms for the 36th and 37th years, there was only the estimated amount for the 37th year, and no income or profit tax for the 37th year. Furthermore, there was no record of the company's payment of the determined amount. With the value of currency falling daily, the delay in tax collection for more than half a year has caused significant damage to the national treasury. Furthermore, the special business tax rate stipulates that companies with profit income should be taxed at 1.5% of their turnover. The exact amount of the company's turnover in the first half of the year has not been investigated and reported. However, based on the 137 yuan and 47 fen in gold yuan that it paid for special business tax in the first half of the 37th year, its total turnover was only over 9,000 gold yuan. For such a large company, based on its inventory, its turnover in the first half of the year, converted into gold yuan, should be at least over one million yuan. Its income tax is actually less than one percent of that. In short, the huge amount of tax evaded by the company is a huge loss to the state, and it is also a huge piece of evidence of favoritism and illegal conduct by the personnel in charge of tax collection. The responsible personnel of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance are indeed guilty of illegal and derelict behavior and should be punished with the punishment they deserve.

(5) Upon investigation, since the 36th year (1947), the Import and Export Management Committee has issued more than 400 automobile import permits to Yangtze Construction and Li Han companies. The majority of these were for vehicles seating seven or fewer people, priced at more than US$1,200 or its equivalent in other currencies (Chevrolet, Fiat, and four-door Austin cars all cost around US$4,000 in Shanghai, and their factory prices in the United States must be above US$1,200, it can be asserted. Moreover, Kong Xiangxi and his son Kong Lingkan owned many Cadillac cars of Li Han in 1948, whose market price was no less than US$7,000 to 8,000 each). All of these were prohibited from import by Appendix (4) of the Import and Export Trade Regulations announced on November 17th of the 35th year (1946). It is incomprehensible why the committee issued permits. In recent years, luxurious new cars have flooded major cities, consuming large amounts of foreign exchange, which is hated by society. Based on the examples of Yangtze Construction and Li Han companies, the Import and Export Management Committee should bear the majority of the responsibility, and it should be investigated to rectify the situation and maintain law and order.

(6) Regarding Kong Xiangxi and Kong Lingkan's 1948 Cadillac cars, and another batch of more than six Fiat cars of Yangtze Construction Company, the Import and Export Management Committee claimed that it had not issued import permits. Why did the Jianghai Customs allow them to be imported? Even if the company and Kong evaded taxes through smuggling, how could these bulky cars have landed without collusion with the responsible personnel of the Jianghai Customs? Whether the company also colluded with the responsible personnel of the Jianghai Customs when using forged tax bills to smuggle goods should also be investigated to clarify responsibilities.

In summary, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Captain of the Economic Police Corps Cheng Yikuan, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance Huang Zupei, Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee Huo Baoshu, and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs Zhang Yongnian (or the responsible personnel in charge during their respective tenures when the misconduct occurred) should all be impeached and transferred to the Executive Yuan to investigate their responsibilities and impose appropriate punishments to rectify official conduct and maintain law and order.
