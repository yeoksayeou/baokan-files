### Proposal to Improve the Treatment of Public and Educational Personnel; Legislative Yuan Passes for Review; Also Requests the Government to Restrict Excessive Land Requisition; Secret Meeting to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow to Hear Diplomatic and Military Reports

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan's fourth meeting of the second session was held on the morning of the 21st, chaired by Vice President Chen Lifu.

### Issuance of Stocks of State-Owned Enterprises; Giving the People Investment Opportunities; Finance Minister Wang Says the Proportion of Commercial Shares Can Be Considered for Increase in the Future

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Before leaving Nanjing, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu made a statement, saying: Regarding the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises, it has now begun to be handled in Shanghai. Because this is a pioneering undertaking, the general public's understanding of the content of the issuance methods and the government's intentions may not be clear enough. He is willing to explain this slightly for the reference of the people when investing in the purchase. It has been found that the state-owned enterprises issuing stocks this time include the China Textile Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Taiwan Paper Corporation, and Tianjin Pulp Company, all of which are currently the best-equipped, best-operated, and most promising production or construction enterprises under government management. In order to induce and assist private capital to obtain proper development, the government has specially sold a portion of the stocks of the above five units separately, giving the people a most favorable opportunity to participate in investment. Therefore, the issuance of stocks is actually for the common interests of both the government and the people. The total amount of the issued shares is strictly calculated according to the lowest estimate of its total assets, totaling 1.753 billion Gold Yuan, which is actually much lower than the current market price of each enterprise. Moreover, the equity portion retained by the government must be transferred to the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee for safekeeping and used as a Gold Yuan issuance reserve. The committee will assess whether the stock value is commensurate with the face value and will not allow overvaluation. The publicly issued portion is 564 million Gold Yuan, accounting for about one-third of the total. Compared with the general joint state-private banks or factories and mines in the past, this proportion is not small. Moreover, according to the government's decision, a shareholders' meeting can be convened as soon as one-tenth of the commercial shares are subscribed. Regarding the administrative management of the company, shareholders can make claims at the meeting, and the elected directors and supervisors can participate in the actual guiding work. How the company will be operated in the future should also be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. Therefore, the government has fully considered the valuation of the company's assets, the proportion of equity allocation, and the legitimate rights and interests of commercial shares. In the future, the government will also consider increasing the proportion of commercial shares and increasing the number of issues, so that the people have the opportunity and power to legally control the companies and gradually move towards the path of complete private operation.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] Stocks of the five major state-owned enterprises were officially put on sale in Guangzhou on the 21st, handled by the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and China Trust Bureau.

### Hong Kong Assists Our Efforts to Stabilize the New Currency; Prohibits Money Changers from Unauthorized Buying and Selling of Gold Yuan; Finance Minister Wang Flies to the U.S. Today, Denies He Will Negotiate Currency Loans

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The Hong Kong government has formally notified all 141 large and small silver firms in Hong Kong that, with the exception of 23 designated banks such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Standard Chartered, and HSBC, which are permitted to directly conduct official exchange rates with designated mainland banks of the Chinese government, all others are prohibited from directly conducting Gold Yuan business with mainland China. Passengers arriving in or leaving Hong Kong carrying ornamental gold exceeding 20 Gold Yuan will be confiscated and prosecuted.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] In order to help China stabilize the new currency system, the Hong Kong government has recently issued an order that only banks authorized by the Hong Kong government to operate in foreign exchange are allowed to conduct buying and selling of Gold Yuan drafts and telegraphic transfers with designated banks of the Chinese government according to the official exchange rate of the designated banks. Other banks and money changers must go through the designated banks to buy and sell Gold Yuan drafts. At the same time, the Hong Kong government has revised the limit for passengers carrying Gold Yuan into Hong Kong, allowing only 20 Yuan per passenger.

According to a French News Agency report from Hong Kong, officials announced that the buying and selling of Gold Yuan between Hong Kong and Macau and any other foreign countries is prohibited.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing. He will take a Northwest Airlines flight to the U.S. at 8:20 AM today to attend the third annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Xi Demao, Zhang Yuelian, and others will accompany him. It is reported that Finance Minister Wang will stay in the U.S. for about ten days. Mr. Wang said when meeting with reporters that the bandit's propaganda about the inflation of the Gold Yuan is completely unfounded. According to statistics at the end of last month, the amount of Gold Yuan issued was only 290 million Yuan, half of which was spent on the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The 5-jiao silver auxiliary coins and the 1-fen copper auxiliary coins will be circulated and issued in large quantities starting next month. The government has sufficient preparations in three aspects to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan: (1) Full reserve, limit issuance, (2) Balance of income and expenditure, (3) Stabilize prices. In the future, it is also hoped that the Hong Kong government can cooperate closely with our country to crack down on smuggling in South China.

The management work in Shanghai is very satisfactory, and the control work in Guangzhou is also being improved. Regarding the rumors that this trip will negotiate currency loans, Finance Minister Wang denied it.

Editorial

### Diligence and Thrift Movement and National Responsibility

Since the President's broadcast speech on the evening of the 15th of this month, calling for a movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, people from all over have responded enthusiastically, believing that this is indeed a necessary measure to cooperate with the economic emergency decree. Because the soundness of a society's economy is based on two principles: increasing production and economizing consumption. Diligence is a key factor in actively increasing production, and thrift is essential for passively preserving it. Therefore, all economic reforms can only be truly thorough if these two words, diligence and thrift, are put into practice. Everything else is just a technical detail.

Anyone with a little self-respect generally knows that supporting oneself is a necessary condition for living in the world. As for those who rely on others for a living, the completely dependent, even women and the disabled, often consider it shameful. Therefore, the principle of "each doing their best and each taking what they need" is easily understood by most people. However, the most deeply ingrained and harmful common malady lies in the group that shuns labor and prefers leisure, all tending towards the division of profits. In other words, they are those who avoid production, do not engage in honest work, and only know how to use every means to pick up scraps left by others, or even to seize by trickery and force, enriching themselves at the expense of others.

Speaking of diligence, these people who do not engage in honest work but seize by trickery and force are not necessarily not working hard. Some even violate prohibitions and laws, take risks, and are willing to stake their lives on a single throw. For example, unscrupulous merchants who specialize in speculation and manipulation, how is their dedication and hard work any less than that of ordinary honest farmers, industrialists, and businessmen? However, it is these people who disrupt the market, and it is these people who destroy the economy. It can be seen that the meaning of the word "diligence" refers specifically to all legitimate occupations and formal duties, and not all diligence is worth promoting and praising.

Thrift is also a virtue, but the scope of its application varies greatly between public and private matters. For example, when manufacturing an item, even though domestic raw materials are available, imported goods are preferred in order to cater to current trends and increase profits. Also, when purchasing a tool or product, domestic goods are avoided and foreign goods are sought because they are cheaper or of better quality. From the individual's perspective, this may be considered thrift, but from the perspective of the overall national economy, it is a great waste.

For this reason, we believe that the value of diligence and thrift should not be measured solely from an individual's point of view, but should be judged from the standpoint of society or the nation. Only those who truly contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood can be praised for their commendable diligence and thrift. This is what should be given priority when promoting the diligence and thrift movement today. If viewed from the perspective of those speculative merchants who are very energetic, as mentioned above, and those users of foreign goods who only know how to seek profit, although they may be given the title of diligence and thrift in a certain sense, they certainly cannot be said to be building the country. Rather, the foundation of the national economy is being destroyed by these selfish and self-serving people.

In our previous article, "Responding to the Diligence and Thrift Movement to Build the Country," we said that in order for this movement to quickly achieve results, it is necessary for contemporary dignitaries to promote it. This was originally meant for them to lead by example, not just to preside over it. Although the effects of promoting diligence and thrift are mostly of economic significance, the nature of this movement is social and educational, not economic or political. The President said: "The way to promote it is to practice it personally, and for everyone to show a style of diligence and thrift in their daily lives." What a broad movement this is! If every citizen does not apply this principle to every corner of their daily lives, then its purpose will not be thoroughly implemented, and its effects will not be very significant. Therefore, the President did not initiate this movement as the head of national politics, but specifically promoted it as a member of the public, making it clear that this is a social reform movement, and that all levels of society should jointly undertake it and participate in it. It is absolutely not possible to entrust this responsibility entirely to a few people. Experience tells us that this kind of mission to change customs and habits will not have very good results if it does not have the foundation of everyone's self-awareness and self-discipline, and relies solely on political power to promote it. Putting aside other things, isn't the past "such and such" movement a very obvious example? However, the purpose of this diligence and thrift movement to build the country is to cooperate with the new economic measures; at the same time, it is also to cooperate with the fundamental work of suppressing the rebellion. It is the same as only allowing success and not allowing failure. Therefore, on the one hand, we want the general dignitaries to be proactive and self-aware, to practice it personally, and to set an example and lead.

(2) All banks should first convene a general meeting of shareholders in accordance with the relevant provisions on capital increase in Articles 41, 114, 246, 247, 251, 253, 254, 255, and 256 of the Company Law to discuss the capital increase plan. The valuation of existing assets should be handled in accordance with the capital adjustment measures.

(3) The original capital amount of all banks, after being verified as required, can be converted into gold yuan and regarded as part of the capital. No further verification is required.

(4) After the shareholders' meeting approves the capital increase plan, the new capital should be raised immediately, and a "Report Form for Commercial Banks to Adjust Capital" should be filled out in five copies. Two copies, along with the documents and fees required for the capital increase, should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. Two copies, along with the cash for the capital increase, should be sent to the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank for inspection. The remaining copy should be kept for reference.

(5) After receiving the aforementioned report form, the Ministry of Finance will review it. If the reported information is consistent with the regulations, it will immediately send one copy of the original report form to the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank to verify whether the capital is consistent, whether the assets are genuine, and whether the valuation is accurate.

(6) If the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank verifies that the assets and capital are genuine and there is no ambiguity, it will issue a capital verification certificate after the original applying bank issues a guarantee. The original report form will be signed and sealed by the responsible personnel of the inspection bank, and sent to the Ministry of Finance for review along with the guarantee and balance sheet. The cash deposited for the capital increase will be returned to the original depositing bank after three months.

(7) After receiving the aforementioned capital verification report form from the Central Bank or its entrusted bank, if the Ministry of Finance finds no discrepancies, it will approve the change of business registration.

### Moscow Talks Have Failed, Three Foreign Ministers Consult Frequently, Three Ambassadors to the Soviet Union Summoned to Paris, Whether Berlin Question Will Be Submitted to the UN General Assembly Still Undecided

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The Western Big Three ambassadors to Moscow are expected to arrive here today to participate in the second meeting of the three foreign ministers at the French Foreign Ministry at 6:00 PM this afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] Western Big Three representatives to the Soviet Union, Roberts, Smith, and Chataigneau, flew to Paris from here this morning. Before boarding the plane to leave Moscow, French Ambassador Chataigneau announced that he would stay in Paris for a short time to consult with French Foreign Minister Schuman, and then return to Moscow. British Envoy Roberts also issued a similar statement, saying that British Foreign Secretary Bevin wanted to know about the situation in the Moscow talks. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith did not make any statement.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th, Associated Press] The British, American, and French ambassadors to Moscow have all been summoned to Paris for consultations with their foreign ministers. Their seven-week talks with Molotov on the Berlin crisis have concluded, and the attempt to break the deadlock can be said to have completely failed. The general situation in Berlin and Germany must now be discussed by Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who is the Soviet Union's chief representative attending the UN General Assembly in Paris.

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] If the Western Big Three foreign ministers decide to formally put the Berlin question on the agenda of the General Assembly or the Security Council, the Soviet Union will definitely argue that the Berlin and German questions are within the jurisdiction of the Four Powers, while the Big Three will strongly assert that all efforts to reach an agreement have failed and the Soviet blockade has not been lifted. The Western Big Three have not yet decided whether to bring the Berlin question before the General Assembly or the Security Council. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. In the Security Council, the Soviet Union has veto power, and the Soviet Union may again walk out of the meeting like it did during the debate on the Iranian question in 1946. However, not putting the Berlin question on the General Assembly's agenda to avoid a deadlock between East and West may give the General Assembly more time to deal with other issues, and the chances of resolving it may be better.

[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman met for an hour at the French Foreign Ministry today to hold preliminary talks on the Berlin crisis. It is said that this meeting confirmed that the Moscow negotiation stage of the Berlin issue has come to an end. Other important issues at the UN General Assembly are also shrouded in the shadow of the East-West crisis. The three foreign ministers and the senior aides who participated in the evening meeting did not show a trace of a smile. Accompanying Marshall were Republican foreign policy expert Dulles, who may serve as US Secretary of State under Dewey, State Department advisor Bohlen, Ambassador to the UK Douglas, and Ambassador to France Caffery.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] US Commander-in-Chief of the American Zone of Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, flew to Paris on the evening of the 20th to meet with Secretary of State Marshall. The UN General Assembly opened in Paris on the 21st.

### Soviet Union Launches Another Propaganda Offensive, Demands Allied Forces Withdraw from Germany

[Our Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: The Soviet Army Official Gazette in Berlin stated: The Soviet Union demands that all occupying troops stationed in Germany and Berlin immediately withdraw. The newspaper compared Germany to Korea, urging Germans to pay attention to the actions taken by the Soviet Union in Korea, that is, preparing to completely withdraw Soviet troops from Korea before the end of this year. Washington officials believe that this Soviet demand is a kind of propaganda offensive to win the sympathy of the Germans.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 21st] Observers commenting on the Soviet occupation forces' newspaper's demand that all occupying forces withdraw from Germany said that the Soviet demand is based on its firm belief that once the Western Allied forces withdraw from Berlin, the Communist action teams and Soviet-trained German national army will be able to easily occupy Berlin. According to recent German newspaper reports, armed German Communist action teams are being formed in Soviet-controlled factories. Similar groups will immediately begin to be organized in factories in Berlin. Observers also believe that the timing of the Soviet demand coincides with the opening of the UN General Assembly in Paris. If the Soviet Union cannot prevent the United Nations from discussing the Berlin crisis, it will obviously propose a solution, that is, the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from Berlin by the Four Powers.

### Communist Rebellion Is Purely Indonesia's Internal Affair, No Interference by the Netherlands Is Permitted, Indonesian Government Rejects Dutch Joint Anti-Communist Proposal

[Associated Press, Batavia, 21st] The Indonesian government announced on the 21st via Radio Jogjakarta that the Republic rejected the Netherlands' offer of assistance in suppressing the communist rebellion, and was prepared to recapture the city of Madiun, occupied by the communists.

Prime Minister Hatta said that the Republic of Indonesia could not accept any Dutch "interference." The Dutch proposal for a joint Dutch-Indonesian resistance to communism was proposed by Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker in Washington, as reported by various newspapers here.

### Indonesian Government and Communists Have Not Officially Opened Fire, Government Announces It Has Been Able to Control the Overall Situation

[Associated Press, Batavia, 20th] The Madiun Communist-controlled radio station announced on the 20th: "The Soviet Republic of Java" has been established, with Moscow-trained communist Muso as chairman. It is learned that due to the danger of a coup by the Indonesian Communists, United Nations officials here are preparing to repatriate the three-nation delegation currently in the Republic area. The missions of Belgium, Australia, and Italy were originally scheduled to stay in the Indonesian area for three months. It is also reported that fierce fighting has broken out between Indonesia and the Netherlands in central Java. The communist-controlled Madiun radio station accused the Republic of Indonesia of pursuing a policy of surrendering to the Netherlands and Britain, and selling Indonesia to American capitalists. The radio broadcast combined with the orders of the communist government, ordering the guards to be stationed in the main buildings in the city. Forty-eight hours have passed since the communists launched the coup, but no news of war between the Republic and the Communists has been received.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 21st] The Indonesian Republican government said on the 21st that military authorities had prevented unrest by the Communists in Semarang. The report also said that at least 14 senior military and internal affairs officials are inspecting the west coast city where the unrest occurred. It is claimed that there have been very few armed conflicts, and very few military personnel have been killed. Finally, the broadcast said: The government has been able to control the entire situation.

### Dutch Foreign Minister Speaks in the United States

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker announced on the 20th that he plans to invite Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta to "renegotiate" and "redeploy" the joint Dutch-Indonesian suppression of communists and to resolve the future political system of Indonesia. Stikker told reporters that if Prime Minister Hatta is willing, the new Dutch cabinet is willing to support the current renegotiation. The Dutch cabinet has decided to recognize the legitimate hopes of true nationalists for independence and freedom. But we reject any negotiations that may strengthen communist action.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It is generally believed that the promotion of Lieutenant General LeMay, Commander of the US Air Force in Europe, to Commander of the Air Force Strategic Command is an implication warning to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is well aware that General LeMay is the person who presided over the Berlin airlift for the past three months, breaking the Soviet blockade.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] US Far East Air Force Headquarters recently announced: Major General Whyte has been relieved of his duties as commander of the 5th Air Force and has returned to the United States to take up a position at the US Air Force Headquarters in Washington.

### Our Delegation Has a Strong Lineup

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st] The representatives of our country attending this session of the General Assembly are mostly well-educated scholars, which is clearly different from delegations from other countries. Of the nine chief and deputy representatives of our country, eight have earned doctoral degrees, and representatives Wang Shijie, Jiang Tingfu, Xu Shuxi, and Zhang Zhongfu are even more well-known professors.

Furthermore, many guerrillas have re-entered Greece from Albania and launched attacks on government forces within Greece from Albanian territory. The above three governments have requested Albania to allow the United Nations Balkan Committee to station observers within its territory, so that the world can believe that Albania's claim of non-interference in Greek affairs is indeed factual, but no reply has been received to date.

### Former Chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Yamin, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Crime: "Extorting Merchants and Engaging in Stock Trading"; Before Death, He Pleaded to Speak, Repeatedly Saying He Was "Sacrificed"

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhang Yamin, the former chief of the Economic Section of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was escorted to Nanjing for interrogation in July this year due to a corruption case. He was sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and the sentence was approved by the highest authorities. He was returned to Shanghai for execution. Zhang was picked up by the Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai at 8:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, and was temporarily detained in the detention center of the Garrison Headquarters' Military Law Department that night. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Zeng Zhaoyi, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters, personally signed for Zhang, verified his identity, and escorted him to the Jiangwan execution ground for execution by firing squad at 3:45 p.m.

After Zhang Yamin was placed in the detention center, the Garrison Headquarters prohibited him from meeting with any relatives or family members. Therefore, Zhang did not know that his death was imminent until the jailer opened his shackles at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday. He immediately asked for paper and pen to write his will. At 3:00 p.m., Chief Zeng of the Military Law Department personally went to the detention center and set up a table to bring Zhang out of prison. Zhang looked slightly thinner after two months of imprisonment. He wore a white-bottomed blue-striped pajama suit and yellow leather shoes, with his demeanor as before. Chief Zeng inquired about his name, age, and ancestral origin, and informed him that he was ordered to be executed today. At this time, Zhang's nerves suddenly became tense. He asked to speak, saying, "I worked for the benefit of the five million citizens of Shanghai, but now I am being sacrificed and not understood by the five million citizens." He seemed to feel extremely wronged. He also said, "I am a sacrifice in the struggle for power and profit." In order to reduce his pain before execution, the court staff persuaded him to drink a large bowl of sorghum wine and injected him with an anesthetic. After Chief Zeng finished writing the execution order, he was escorted by soldiers of the Special Service Company and military police onto an execution vehicle and driven to the Jiangwan execution ground. When the vehicle arrived at the execution ground, Zhang had already lost consciousness. He was supported off the vehicle by the military police and laid face down on the ground. Tang Shaowu, the squad leader of the Special Service Platoon, aimed and fired a rifle. One shot was fatal, the bullet entering from the back and exiting from the front chest.

Will to Wife

The full text of Zhang's will to his wife is as follows: "Min: I have sacrificed myself for the sake of the lives of five million citizens of Shanghai. The rumors of treacherous merchants and the harsh environment have overwhelmed me like a torrent. My strength alone is too small to fight against the evil forces, but my heart is honest. I hope you cherish your Mao Mao (Zhang's daughter) and educate her well to become a great woman, leading humanity towards goodness and love. Take good care of my foolish old mother and weak younger sister. I will be grateful even in the afterlife. If there are problems with living expenses in the future, you can only borrow from relatives and friends. I only have a reputation for making money, but no real ability to make money for you to live on. I leave behind a watch, a fountain pen, and a ballpoint pen as parting mementos, as well as two photos. Please return them to Hui (Zhang Yamin's lover) so that there will be one more person in the world who understands me. There are also several poems I wrote in prison, which can also be left for the world to see. Farewell, life is like a dream. I didn't expect my dream to be so short, but death is inevitable. I also didn't expect my death to be so misunderstood. You don't have to be too sad. If you can forget, it's best to forget. Finally, I hope you are always happy, and I hope my soul can go to a fearless world, where I can often meet you in dreams. Farewell! Goodbye forever, I wish you peace and happiness. Written by Yamin on July 21st at 3:30 p.m."

Garrison Headquarters Bulletin

After the execution of Zhang Yamin, the Garrison Headquarters posted a bulletin to inform the public. The original text reads: "In accordance with Presidential Palace Document No. 51094, Chief Zhang Yamin of the former Economic Section of the Investigation Department of this Headquarters, abused his authority to extort merchants and engage in stock trading. After investigation, the evidence is conclusive, and he has been sentenced to death according to law and handed over to this Headquarters for public execution, and a report is to be submitted. Therefore, Zhang Yamin was identified at 3:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month and was escorted to the Jiangwan execution ground for execution by firing squad to serve as a warning. Zhang Yamin, 30 years old, from Pixian County, Jiangsu Province."

### Central China慰勞団 (慰勞団: delegation for expressing sympathy, appreciation, etc) Returns to Shanghai, Talks About Impressions

The head and deputy head of the delegation, Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao, met with the President on the 20th to report, and then took a car back to Shanghai. According to their impressions of this trip: 1. The situation in Central China is stable. Our army has changed from defense to offense, and we are confident of victory. The bandits have no chance to attack again. 2. The officers and soldiers were inspired by the comfort from all sectors of Shanghai. Zhang Changfa, a soldier representative from a certain unit in Suxian, said that he hoped to bring the flames of war and the bloody atmosphere back to the rear so that the people of Shanghai would no longer live in a dream and fight alongside them. 3. The distance between the front and the rear is too far. The President's advocacy of diligence and thrift in building the country is enough to connect the will of the front and the rear, and to stimulate morale with popular support, and to inspire popular support with morale.

### Resolving the Meat Shortage, Three Points Agreed Upon; Wholesale Prices May Be Adjusted Appropriately; Retail Prices Absolutely Must Not Exceed the Limit

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Social Bureau, Finance Bureau, Health Bureau, and Police Bureau convened representatives from the Fresh Meat, Pig Trade, and Fresh Pork industries at the bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and agreed on the following: (1) Slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to be used for trading. A public notice will be jointly issued by the Social and Police Bureaus, and the Police Bureau will send personnel to supervise regularly. (2) In the event of a shortage of supply, the wholesale price of meat is allowed to be adjusted, provided that the retail price remains unchanged, to 7.4 jiao per kilogram of live pigs and 5.5 jiao per catty of fresh meat. All retailers will be supervised by the Fresh Meat Industry Association, and are absolutely not allowed to exceed the 819 limit price. (3) The police bureau will strictly supervise the prices in the vegetable markets.

The Psychology of Meat Vendors Should Be Corrected

According to reports from the slaughtering industry, the number of pigs slaughtered recently has not decreased. The main reason why the supply of fresh meat is so abnormal is that there is a misconception in the minds of ordinary retail meat vendors: They believe that if they trade at the limit price every day, the profit is limited. If they hide the meat and wait for the black market price to sell, then even if they are detained for three days, the expenses will be less than the profit from trading at the limit price. This psychology is also very common among ordinary vegetable vendors and should be corrected as soon as possible.

### More Than Fifty Illegal Vegetable Vendors Detained for Three Days as a Warning

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Huangpu Police Branch sent six groups of police officers, five people in each group, led by Section Chief Ling of the First Section, at 6:00 a.m. yesterday to Ninghai East Road and Yongan Street and other vegetable markets to arrest a total of more than fifty vegetable vendors who had raised vegetable prices. They were each sentenced to three days of detention as a warning.

### Three Bookstores Sued in Gu Kebin Copyright Dispute, Verdict Announced

[Report from Our Newspaper] The writer Gu Kebin previously translated the book "Educational Measurement and Statistics," which was published by the Nanjing Bookstore in 1934 under a royalty agreement. The bookstore subsequently went bankrupt. On March 6th of last year, it was discovered that the Shanghai Dadong Bookstore was publishing the book. Upon inquiry, it was learned that when the Nanjing Bookstore closed, all 147 of its copyrights were acquired by the Zhendan Bookstore, including "Educational Measurement and Statistics." Later, the Zhendan Bookstore transferred all its copyrights and remaining books to Dadong, with a contract established. Gu Kebin, suspecting collusion among Dadong, Nanjing, and Zhendan bookstores in unauthorized transfers that infringed on his rights, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the District Court. The case was heard yesterday. The court noted the absence of a representative from the defendant Nanjing Bookstore. Dadong and Zhendan were unable to provide any evidence to prove the plaintiff's rights had been extinguished. The court ruled as follows: "The publication transfer of 'Educational Measurement and Statistics' by the defendants is invalid. It is confirmed that the Zhendan Bookstore and Dadong Bookstore do not have publishing rights for the above book. Dadong Bookstore shall cease issuing the book and submit relevant ledgers of printing and sales for the plaintiff's inspection. The plaintiff's remaining claims and request for provisional execution are dismissed. The plaintiff shall bear one-tenth of the litigation costs, while the defendants shall bear nine-tenths, divided equally."

### Chief Accountant of Minfeng Textile Mill Sued for Abandonment by Dancer

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ren Qianping, formerly a dancer at the Dadong Dance Hall, also known as Du Qianping, Yang Xiuying, and Yang Xingzhen, is now 29 years old. Seven years ago, while working as a dance partner at the Dadong Dance Hall, she met Yang Zhihuai, the chief accountant of the Dasimin Textile Mill.

### Changzhou Murder Case Unintentionally Solved, Two Killers Stealing for a Living, Confession to Old Case During Assault Complaint

[Report from Our Newspaper] Thief Xia Caifa (from Changzhou, residing at No. 2, Lane 1084, Yang Road) and Zhou Xijiu (from Taizhou, residing at No. 127, Xin Zhou Road, a cleaner) stole 84 meters of telephone wire from a utility pole on Dalin Road, Lin Yin Road in the South City on the night of the 8th. They hid it at Zhou Xijiu's house. Xia sold the outer lead covering to the Tongchangtai used goods store on Pingjili Road and the bronze and tin shop opened by Huang Quanli at No. 430 Zhihao Bureau Road in the South City. Huang resold it to Jin Guangyan and others at No. 116 Huangjiaque Road. Later, Xia and Zhou fell out over the division of the loot. On the morning of the 14th, Xia and his accomplice Fang Changqing went to Zhou's place, intending to kill Zhou. Zhou resisted fiercely and was only slightly injured. Xia and others fled. A few days ago, Zhou discovered Xia's residence and reported him to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, accusing him of assault. Xia was arrested and transferred to the Penglai Police Station due to jurisdictional reasons. After strict interrogation by Criminal Section Chief Li Dazhi and section members Yang Mianzhi and others, they learned about the theft. Then, Police Chief Huang Shimin, Police Officer Wang Yimin, Zhang Yuting, and others were dispatched to Sanpailou in the city to arrest Fang Changqing and the receivers of stolen goods Huang Quanli and Jin Guangyan. At this point, Xia began to tell the truth and confessed to a previous murder case. He said that in November 1946, while working as an apprentice at Sun Yongxing Iron Shop in Henglin Town, Changzhou, he secretly manufactured a copper pistol, intending to murder his uncle in order to seize his property. However, Sun Huanzhang (14 years old), the shop owner's son, discovered and exposed his secret. Therefore, he harbored resentment and shifted his target, planning to murder the young owner. He once came to Shanghai and discussed it with Zhou, asking for his assistance. On December 16th, the two went to the countryside and lured Sun Huanzhang away from Changzhou, tricking him to the Zhutoubang area in the barren suburbs of Henglin. They first stripped off his clothes, tied him up with a rope, and threw him into the river. After his beloved son disappeared, Sun's teacher reported it to the village office, and Xia and Zhou were detained and investigated, but due to lack of evidence, the two were released. After returning to Shanghai, Zhou forged a letter, impersonating Huanzhang, and sent it back to Changzhou in order to cover up the crime. Sun's body floated up until February 1st of the following year. After investigation, the authorities informed his family to collect the body for burial. After coming to Shanghai, due to a lack of livelihood, they specialized in stealing. The bureau believes that the case is clear and plans to transfer it to the judicial authorities for trial.

### A Gold Yuan Tragedy and Comedy in the South

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

In this subtropical South, although there are bursts of golden wind in the morning and evening, it is still sunny at noon, and the sun is like fire. People on the streets are still walking around in single clothes. As a summer resort, Lychee Bay is still crowded with tourists, and the excitement has not diminished. And on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, many people went there to boat and enjoy the moon, which is a unique scene in the South.

Indeed, autumn is the most popular season in the South. Especially this year, the news of currency reform that came with the autumn wind made people especially excited. This excitement was originally the same all over the country, but it was even more intense here. Because Guangzhou, the only metropolis in South China, is close to Hong Kong and Macau. Since the restoration, due to the trouble caused by the Hong Kong dollar in the market, the financial situation has been turbulent and prices have soared. In the past two years, the general living standards have been more than twice as high as those in Beijing and Shanghai, and the industry and commerce in South China have been almost completely suffocated. Everyone seems to be fighting on the front line of the economy, without any chance to breathe, and the suffering of the people is even more unspeakable, so as soon as this order for the new currency system was issued, the people in South China were like a long drought meeting nectar. How could everyone not welcome it warmly? This currency reform is undoubtedly a brand-new page in Chinese economic history, and it is related to the suppression of chaos and the establishment of the country, and the future of the entire nation. Since such an important decision is implemented, it is naturally impossible to take all aspects into consideration completely. Therefore, the Gold Yuan Certificate has been issued in Guangzhou for nearly a month, and during this period, some tragedies and comedies have occurred:

Painful Sacrifice is Inevitable. After the currency is changed, the financial situation will no longer fluctuate, legitimate industry and commerce can be revived, and the shackles of the people's suffering can be removed from then on. However, after the order to change the currency was issued, the people in Guangdong first suffered a loss that was not found in other places. That is, the Legal Tender in their hands on August 19th was worth half the next day. The reason for this is: After Song Ziwen presided over Guangdong, due to the implementation of a tight currency policy, the prevention of floating capital flowing south, and the crackdown on speculation, the "Shen Telegraph" fell sharply. Before August 19th, the "Shen Telegraph" fell to 50, that is, 500,000 yuan remitted from Guangzhou, and 1 million yuan could be received in Shanghai. At that time, the black market Hong Kong dollar in Shanghai was worth more than 2 million Legal Tender per dollar, while in Guangzhou it was still worth about 1.1 million yuan. After the Gold Yuan was issued, it was stipulated that each Hong Kong dollar was worth 2.25 million Legal Tender, which was not far from the original value in Shanghai, but in Guangzhou it doubled. Wasn't that the Legal Tender in the hands of the people of Guangzhou at that time, watching it lose half its value? Therefore, Chairman Song specifically pointed out at the financial and price symposium on August 23rd: "After the Gold Yuan is issued, there will inevitably be difficulties at present, and the suffering felt by the people of Guangdong is greater than in other places... I sincerely hope that the people of Guangdong will understand the overall situation deeply. Although they feel considerable difficulties due to the currency system reform, this is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. Everyone must have a spirit of sacrifice and faithfully implement the government's currency reform and emergency measures." This shows his sympathy for the people of Guangdong and his earnest encouragement.

Financial and Price Surge. Precisely because there are: The stipulated price difference of the Hong Kong dollar is too far away, smuggling has not been curbed, and these special relationships have caused drastic changes in the financial situation after the announcement of the currency change, and prices have soared, even more than in previous financial surges. From August 23rd to 26th, the municipal government successively assessed the public prices of the main necessities of people's livelihood, but because the inspection was not strict enough, unscrupulous merchants still raised prices, and financial speculators made waves, and also made a black market for the Hong Kong dollar, deliberately discounting the Gold Yuan. According to regulations, 75 Gold Yuan was worth 100 Hong Kong dollars. But for a very short period of time, the black market Hong Kong dollar actually involved exchanging it for Gold Yuan at par. The chaotic situation in the market at this time was unprecedented.

War of Words Between the City Government and Provincial Council At the same time, the public prices of various items assessed by the municipal government were generally considered too high, with an average increase of one time compared with before August 19th, which increased the suffering of the people. The National Assembly representatives, legislators, supervisors, and city party departments of Guangdong and Guangzhou unanimously criticized it. The Guangdong Provincial Council sent a telegram to President Chiang, asking him to strictly order the supervisors in charge to thoroughly investigate and deal with it, which aroused a war of words between the Provincial Council and the City Government: The City Government published in the city's newspapers on September 11th its "Evaluation Process and Principles", totaling tens of thousands of words, stating in detail that the city is a consumer market, and everything has to rely on external imports. If the pricing is too low, it is feared that the market will be blocked, so the principle of price assessment is based on the prices on August 19th, the reasonable cost, and the need to consider reducing production and reducing sources; and it pointed out that the Provincial Council was "ignoring the facts." Therefore, the gentlemen of the Provincial Council became even more indignant and immediately decided to draft a document refuting the City Government and collect evidence to present to the President again. This dispute caused by prices is still developing.

Wu Song is Here, Welcomed with Firecrackers

In this bad situation, there is also an interesting episode: About a week ago, there was a rumor here that Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo would come to Guangzhou. They gave Mr. Chiang the nickname "Wu Song." Two days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, firecrackers were suddenly set off everywhere. Someone said that "Wu Song" was coming today! So they set off firecrackers to welcome him. Even the police on the street said so, which startled the reporter, because wouldn't this news be leaked? I went everywhere to inquire, but it turned out to be some kind of god's birthday, and I couldn't help but smile. However, this also shows the general public's desire for governance.

Strict Enforcement of Economic Controls

On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, a large amount of capital from Shanghai fled to Hong Kong, and the black market exchange rate in Hong Kong increased sharply. The price fluctuations here have not stopped slightly. But after August 8th and 9th, everything completely stabilized. Because the Guangzhou District Economic Control Supervisor's Office officially started work on the 6th, and then, following the example of Shanghai, established three committees for price review, inspection, and material regulation. On the 8th, Song, who was also the Supervisor in charge, Ziwen, issued measures to restrict remittances to prevent Shanghai funds from fleeing south. At that time, Huo Baoshu took on the role of the assistant supervisor of economic control in the posture of a "warrior." He said to people: This time he came back to his hometown to do economic management work, he will strictly enforce the law and never show favoritism. Even if he breaks off relations with his relatives and his ancestral tomb is dug up, he will not hesitate, so as to express his determination to only allow success. In terms of inspection work, it exerted the pressure of thunder and lightning, mobilizing all the resident military police personnel in the city to conduct a general inspection. In recent days, more than a dozen privately set up radio stations have been seized, and more than 200 people who bought and sold financial products and raised prices have been arrested.

The main camp of manipulating the black market finance, "Thirteen Hongs," was in an uproar, who would dare to test the law again? Some silversmiths who usually specialize in this business also voluntarily closed down. This completely curbed the black market financial activities, and prices stabilized. Especially before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the silver market was tight, and the situation of various banks and bureaus exchanging Gold Yuan Certificates was even more enthusiastic than ever. Although they did not stop exchanging on Sundays, there was still not enough time to cope. Some people who had more foreign currency were eager to need Gold Yuan turnover, so they were willing to exchange Hong Kong dollars to the banks at a ratio of 71.72. This phenomenon of the Hong Kong dollar black market being lower than the public price is really unprecedented since the restoration. From here, we can also see the bright future of the Gold Yuan Certificate.

### Bandits Harass the Yangtai Highway, Ambush Cars, and Rob Ships

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 20th] Bandits harassed the area near Guangfu Bridge on the Yangtai Highway on the 16th. That morning, a passenger bus from the Taiyang Automobile Company, carrying over twenty passengers, was ambushed by bandits wielding machine guns as it passed through the area at noon. The driver quickly sped east, arriving in Qin County around 1 p.m. The driver, Tang Xueshi, sustained a shrapnel wound to his left finger. Due to the excessive speed, passengers suffered minor injuries from being jostled about. On the same day, the "Xie Jun" steamship, traveling from Zhenjiang to Qinzhou and towing two wooden boats, was near Wangjia River, close to Guangfu Bridge, when four bandits fired shots, ordering it to stop. After docking, the four bandits boarded the ship and ordered the passengers to disembark for inspection. After an hour, they confiscated four rifles and one passenger's wallet, causing no other harm. The ship safely arrived in Taicheng at 8 p.m. Also: on the same day, a scheduled ship traveling from Tai to Zhen discovered bandit activity ahead near Wangjia River and immediately turned back to Tai, thus avoiding losses. For days, the garrisons of Jiangdu and Taixian counties have been conducting suppression operations by land and water along the Yangtai and Yangzhen routes. The scattered bandits have been driven far away, and transportation on both lines has returned to normal.

### The Conclusion of the Lawyer's Convention and Events Surrounding It

— Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] As the Legislative Yuan reconvened in the capital on September 7th, and the Constitutional Oversight Committee was established in the capital on September 9th, the legal profession, entrusted with the mission of enforcing national laws and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the people, was also engaged in a major gathering. This was the establishment of the "National Federation of Lawyers Associations of the Republic of China" in the capital, and the successive convening of the association's "First Member Representative Congress."

Because this gathering was clearly different in nature from the gatherings of general professional associations, it was continuously observed by the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Central Organization Department of the Kuomintang from September 9th (the day the association was founded) to September 14th (the day the association's member representative congress concluded). The fact that the aforementioned authorities held tea parties for all representatives of the association a total of five times in six days is a clear indication of this. Furthermore, Mr. Ting De, an advisor at the Ministry of Judicial Administration, seemed particularly interested in this gathering and gave several speeches.

The Process of Organization

Before the war, the legal profession had an organization called the "National Lawyers Association," which was based on "natural persons." After the war, due to different historical backgrounds, the "National Federation of Lawyers Associations," based on "legal persons," was established. There are currently 104 local lawyers associations nationwide. The establishment of the federation was initiated by 29 units, including Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Changchun. After six months of tireless planning by preparatory committee members Dai Xiuzan, Jiang Yiping, Yu Zhongluo, and Dai Tianqiu, and with the coordination of manpower and resources, this organization for the legal profession was finally established.

The Grand Occasion of the Congress

The founding congress of the association was held at 9 a.m. on September 9th at the Overseas Chinese Hostel on Zhongshan North Road. Those in attendance included Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan; Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan; Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs; Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration; and Zhang Zhiben, President of the Administrative Court. The President also issued a special message of instruction. The "Representative Congress" was held daily from the 10th onwards on the second floor of the Builders' Association at Shangsheng Temple. The final total number of delegates attending reached 133. Many of them were authorities in legal circles. Those holding dual roles as lawyers and legislators included Jiang Yiping, Zhu Wende, Fang Jida, Wu Shipeng, Zhai Nianqu, and Liu Pengying. Those holding dual roles as lawyers and National Assembly representatives included Dai Tianqiu, Zhang Danping, Jin Chunhua, Cheng Shenlin, Wang Shanxiang, Qiu Zhaowen, Chen Wei, Yu Junzhu, Lu Huimin, Zhang Huanzhi, and Su Shangwen. Others, such as Jun Shizhao and Guo Wei, traveled from Shanghai to participate. It could truly be said that a great number of talents gathered together.

Important Resolutions

In the eyes of experts deeply versed in legal principles, some of the country's current laws are outdated or fundamentally at odds with the practical demands of democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, at their grand gathering, based on the standpoint of national democratic constitutional law, they submitted more than one hundred proposals to the legislative and judicial administrative authorities to abolish or amend these laws and to enact new laws that meet the demands of reality. Among the most important of these that have been passed by the congress are: (1) "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan promptly enact a law on compensation for wrongful convictions"; (2) "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan abolish various special criminal regulations and criminal case procedural regulations"; and (3) "Recommend that the authorities amend the Law of Court Martial for the Army, Navy, and Air Force."

Regarding (1) – "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan promptly enact a law on compensation for wrongful convictions," it is said that this was a goal that the former "National Lawyers Association" strived for at every congress from 1931 to 1937. Now, in an era of constitutional governance and new beginnings, the system of compensation for wrongful convictions, which has been proposed for many years, truly needs to be established in a timely manner. According to sources, this resolution has already received a response from the Legislative Yuan, which is preparing to enact this law immediately.

Regarding (2), "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan abolish various special criminal regulations and criminal case procedural regulations," their decision is naturally still based on the fundamental principle of democratic constitutionalism, to safeguard human rights and demonstrate prudence.

Regarding (3), "Recommend that the authorities amend the Law of Court Martial for the Army, Navy, and Air Force," the lawyers made this proposal because they saw the unreasonableness of military personnel committing ordinary criminal offenses and often not being judged under ordinary law.

Capital Disputes

The so-called capital dispute refers to the dispute over the legality of the representatives produced by the Capital Lawyers Association. The issue arose from the manner in which the Capital Lawyers Association selected its representatives. The five representatives from the capital, Dai Xiuzan, Sun Biren, Xue Fuqi, Wang Hongjiang, and Zhao Wenqi, were nominated by the association's board of directors. Lawyers Wang Long, Cui Peijun, and Yu Xizu and others rose up in opposition, arguing that it was illegal because the selection had not been made by the general membership meeting. Thus, both sides published "Announcements" on the front page of the "Central Daily News." The "Federation" has already concluded, but until now, the dispute does not seem to have been resolved satisfactorily.

At the association's fourth meeting on the 13th, it was resolved that September 9th would be "Lawyer's Day," and Xu Shihao, Chen Yaodong, He Shizhen, Chen Tingrui, and Hu Jingming were nominated as representatives to attend the next International Bar Association conference. On the morning of the 14th, the directors and supervisors were elected, and the closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. On the 15th, the association convened its first board of directors meeting and elected standing directors. As a result, Jiang Yiping, Dai Tianqiu, Bao Xiangling, Ji Qingyi, Zhang Qiping, Zhang Wenbo, Bo Chou, Zhu Wende, and Wang Bingjun were elected.

### Strange Event in Anhua, Hunan Province: White-Haired Old Man Loses Love and Seeks Immortality in Shifang Cave

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 18th] A strange incident of seeking immortality has recently occurred in Anhua County, Hunan Province, causing a sensation among pious men and women. It is said that there is a barber named Jiang Pusheng in the south gate of the county, who is 72 years old. He is usually fond of lust, and in recent years has been in love with a young woman named Tao Xian, who is only 18 years old. The romance between the white-haired old man and the beautiful young woman is intense, amazing all who hear of it. But the moon is not always full. Tao Xian has found another lover, and suddenly announced that she would break off relations with Jiang. Jiang was so stimulated that he suddenly disappeared on the night of the 5th of this month. Because he has no relatives, his neighbors are indifferent to it. Until the 9th, someone who came to the city from Zunshang, thirty miles outside the north gate, talked about this matter, saying that he had personally seen Jiang carrying straw alone into the Shifang Cave in that area, and had not seen him come out since, not knowing why. Thereupon, Jiang's neighbors, hearing the news, gathered several people and went to investigate. Arriving at Zunshang, each prepared torches, and shouted as they entered the cave. The cave is located at the foot of a high mountain, and the entrance is about a square zhang wide. After entering fifty or sixty steps, it becomes a dark abyss, its distance unfathomable. When the neighbors risked entering dozens of steps, they found the missing old barber curled up on the straw, snoring loudly, as if he were having a good dream. The neighbors shouted Jiang's name, and after a long time, Jiang slightly opened his eyes. When the neighbors advised Jiang to return home, Jiang suddenly stood up angrily and threw stones. Five of the neighbors, including Wu Xiang, were slightly injured and fled with their heads in their hands. Jiang also cursed loudly, saying, "I have not eaten for five days, and my cultivation of immortality is about to be completed. What is it to you?" Now, people from far and wide have heard the news and are vying to visit this "future immortal" in Shifang Cave. The flow of visitors never stops. Several nearby residents have built temporary shacks outside the cave, running tea shops, wine shops, and hotels, and business is unusually busy.

### The Surrender of the Notorious Bandit Kuang Guojun in Shaoyang: The Process

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 18th] Kuang Guojun, a notorious bandit who has been harassing the eastern countryside of Shaoyang for many years and is as famous as the bandit Zhang Pengfei, who has already been executed, has recently been formally announced by the Sixth District Commissioner's Office to have surrendered. Fifty-nine men and thirty-one guns, including a light machine gun, have been received. The process of accepting the surrender began in mid-August. At that time, Kuang made several demands, but the Sixth District Commissioner's Office insisted on unconditional surrender. Kuang finally agreed to accept. On August 31st, Commissioner Wei Zhen personally went to the bandit's den in Zhujia Chong to inspect and give instructions. Because the hostages kidnapped by the bandits had not yet been released, they were not formally registered at that time. Wei immediately returned to the city, leaving Deputy Commander Zhang Bohou of the Security Corps to handle matters in the countryside. On September 10th, the hostages Liu Xiangnan, the son of Mo Chengzhou, and the wife of Zhou Zilian were all released one after another. Commissioner Wei then went to Shaodong again on the 10th to inspect and formally incorporate them. The work was completed on the afternoon of the 14th, and that evening, Kuang handed over the entire roster of men and guns to Deputy Commander Zhang. Zhang had them sent to the city on the 15th. Commissioner Wei is currently meticulously studying plans for the long-term stability of the entire county and will submit them to the province for record.

(3) From September 25th onwards, each Bao will manage its own affairs, and all proceeds will be used for local autonomy expenses.

### Seclusion of Xue Fen's Family After His Death: Fudan Faculty and Students Discuss Aftercare

[Report from this newspaper] Dr. Xue Fen, professor and head of the Biology Department at National Fudan University, traveled to England for investigation and research at the invitation of the British Council. He left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the first of this month and took a ship to England, where he died in Penang on the 10th. The news has already been reported in this newspaper. It is said that he suffered from asthma on the ship, which later developed into heart disease, leading to his death. Xue passed the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship in his early years and studied in England, earning a Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool. He also traveled to various European countries. Since 1941, he has taught at National Fudan University. Recently, in view of the long coastline of our country and the urgent need to develop marine science, he was planning a project and went to England for investigation and research again. His great aspirations were not fulfilled, and he died in a foreign land, which is truly regrettable! Xue left behind many children, all of whom are young. His income from teaching during his lifetime was only enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. It is said that the Ministry of Education, President Zhang of Fudan University, and colleagues and students are discussing aftercare and plan to raise an education fund for Xue's children to fulfill the deceased's ambition to dedicate himself to scholarship.

### Request to Adjust Salaries: Hope to Restore Pre-War Standards; Municipal School Teachers Welfare Association Issues Written Opinion Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal School Teachers Welfare Association issued a written opinion requesting an adjustment to the salaries of public school teachers. In response to the call from professors at national colleges and universities in the capital and Shanghai to adjust the salaries of public school teachers nationwide, the Shanghai Municipal School Teachers Welfare Promotion Association hereby issues the following written opinion: (Previous content omitted) This association, on behalf of thousands of members of Shanghai's municipal primary and secondary schools, not only expresses its unanimous support for the call from professors at national colleges and universities in Beijing and Shanghai, but also expresses its full and resolute support for the rapid implementation of this demand. We also put forward our minimum requirement, which is simply to restore pre-war standards. As the professors in the capital said, "The salary adjustment for public school teachers nationwide is often unreasonable and the government should adjust it again according to pre-war standards." Taking municipal primary schools as an example, the pre-war salary for ordinary teachers was 45 to 50 yuan. Now, calculating the silver yuan price stipulated by the government at 20%, the base salary should be adjusted to at least 90 to 100 yuan. This requirement is not excessive in the slightest, and we have only put forward this reasonable opinion after deeply understanding the difficulties of the times. We firmly demand that the government consider the lives of public school teachers across the country and make adjustments promptly. Then the improvement of administrative efficiency can be expected, and the stability of society can be gradually realized.

### Ye Guanxiong Suffers Crushing Defeat in Straight Sets Tao Guanqiu Wins Championship Public Tennis Final Sees Unprecedented Spectacle

[Our Newspaper] City Open Tennis champion Tao Guanqiu, relying on his steady, reliable, and extremely accurate long strokes and short volleys, defeated the current National Games champion Ye Guanxiong in straight sets in his peak condition yesterday to continue to hold the title. At the same time, he also avenged his defeat to Ye Guanxiong in one set in the National Games. The scores were 6-2, 9-7, 6-0. The performances of both sides were quite exciting. The Youth Tennis Club announced yesterday that it was sold out, with an estimated 1,000 ladies and gentlemen in the seats, creating the biggest spectacle of this year's event. Before the match, in the women's singles final, Yang Weibin defeated Zhu Zhiying in three sets to retain the championship, with scores of 3-6, 6-0, 6-1. In the intermediate singles final, Ma Jingrong defeated Wei Shisun 6-1, 6-2, winning the double championship after the preliminary singles. The match details are as follows.

### Tao Guanqiu Indeed Has Brilliance

The audience in the stands has high hopes for the emergence of a new tennis talent, so many hoped that Ye Guanxiong would win and there would be a new champion. Therefore, when they saw Ye's defeat, they all sighed with regret. However, Tao Guanqiu does have his own unique brilliance. His steadiness can be said to be one in a hundred. In the first set, Ye Guanxiong tried his best to take the offensive, fiercely pulling the ball up to the net, but as a result, Tao won by a large margin of 6-2. The general trend of the world seems to have been largely determined. There were already predictions for a straight-set victory. Tao Guanqiu's strengths are so difficult to break. Since Ye Guanxiong could not win by pressing the net, he made numerous mistakes in the first set, with countless balls touching the net and going out of bounds. In the second set, Ye changed his style, repeatedly using long strokes and short volleys to attack, which happened to be to Tao's advantage. The steadier he played, the worse he performed. He took the lead at 4-2 and was chased by Tao to 4-4. Then he took the lead again at 5-4, 6-5, and 7-6, but Tao Guanqiu won three games and ended the second set at 9-7. When Ye took the lead at 6-5, Ye lost a set point, and the score was leveled at 6-6, which was a pity. In the first half of the second set, both sides fought fiercely. In the second half of the set, both were exhausted. Tao once looked impatient, but Ye touched the net and went out of bounds, unable to catch his breath. In the third set, Ye was unwilling to fight and had already indicated his abandonment. After two sliding games, Tao Guanqiu won six games in a row, completing the straight-set victory. , Women's Singles Champion and Runner-up (Right) Yang Weibin (Left) Zhu Zhiying (China News Agency Photo)

### Ye Guanxiong is Slightly Inferior

It was expected that Ye Guanxiong would have such difficulty defeating Wang Wenzheng and would have difficulty defeating Tao Guanqiu. This shows that his skill is not yet up to par, and there is much room for improvement. With today's Tao Guanqiu, one must have Carson's golden age and Xu Chengji's ball skills to defeat him. The speed must also be increased, and the net strokes must be deeper and more accurate, and the net kills must be fierce. Mid-court balls are useless, and short balls and close balls landing can only be used occasionally. If this is the case, there is hope for defeating Tao Guanqiu in straight sets. Yesterday, Tao took the lead at 4-1 in the first set. Ye won Tao's serve, and Tao won two more games in a row, winning 6-2 easily, which was unexpected. In the second set, Ye took the lead at 4-2 and 5-4. In the eighth game, when Tao served at 4-3, Ye actually lost five points at 15-40, resulting in 4-4. In the subsequent games, after repeated equalizations, Tao finally won. This is a sign of a lack of confidence. The outcome has been decided, Ye Guanxiong has a long way to go, and Tao Guanqiu does have something to commend.

In the women's singles final, Zhu Zhiying arrived late. The first set was quite exciting, but she was exhausted in the second and third sets. Yang Weibin was consistent throughout and is indeed a veteran. The results of the three groups are listed below:

Intermediate Singles Final

Women's Singles Final

Advanced Singles Final

### Men's and Women's Doubles Finals Today

The Open Tennis Doubles finals will continue this afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Youth Tennis Club. Tickets are one yuan, two yuan, and reserved seats are five yuan and three yuan. Presales will begin at 10 a.m. If it rains, the matches will be postponed to Saturday. In the first match, women's doubles Yang Weibin and Zhu Zhiying will face foreign generals Shen Lufu and Mrs. Fu. Yang and Zhu are the women's singles champion and runner-up, and the victory is highly anticipated. Next is the men's doubles Ye Guanxiong and Cai Guoji against Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu. Tao and Wang were the champions of the previous event and are well-coordinated.

Free Talk

### Cangjie Invents Characters

— Wu Yong

Jin Shenghuan said: "The invention of characters does not necessarily depend on Cangjie, but it must depend on Cangjie. In that case, the name of Cangjie does not belong to one person alone." He also said, "Everyone can make characters." Xunzi's "Solution of Obstructions" also said: "There are many who invented characters, but only Cangjie is uniquely passed down." This theory is very appropriate. For example, the "Records of the Grand Historian" is known to everyone as the work of Sima Qian, the Grand Historian of the Han Dynasty. In fact, it quoted many ancient books such as the "Zuo Zhuan" and "Strategies of the States." Sima Qian was the great synthesizer, and Ban Gu was the great synthesizer of the great synthesizer.

Another example is the origin of printing from seals, rubbings from stone inscriptions. The turning point in the idea of ​​printing from rubbings is estimated to have taken 500 years. Therefore, tracing back to the root, the invention of printing cannot be attributed to any one person. The same is true of writing brushes, ink, paper, and even modern inventions such as electric lights, telephones, ships, trains, and so on. There are many cases of simultaneous and individual inventions in different places, which shows that the invention is an inevitable result of the progress of the times. If Marconi did not invent the telegraph, Niukeni would have come out. This point is explained in detail in W.F. Auben's book "Social Change", with extensive references and sufficient evidence, making it impossible not to be convinced.

Changes in social systems and shifts in popular customs can also be viewed in the same way. The prosperity of other countries' politics and the decline of our country's national affairs are only a continuation of past historical evolution. Their origins are gradual, not brought about by one day or one night, nor can one person alone be responsible for their merits and demerits. As the saying goes: "One general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither." This saying sympathizes with the ten thousand bones and blames one general alone. It is indeed worthy to sympathize with the ten thousand bones, but why do the ten thousand bones die wholeheartedly and willingly wither for him, so that the boy becomes famous? Therefore, according to reason, there are still some shortcomings. Therefore, when evaluating people and discussing things, we must remember: culture is cumulative, and martial culture is also cumulative.

### Oxygen Expert

— Old Man Half-Dream

The backwardness of our country's industry is due to the lack of talent, but talent can be cultivated. As long as the authorities vigorously promote it, all those who study abroad must study the latest and most recent scientific inventions in European countries. After returning to China, the government should first promote them and actively organize the latest industries to provide a place for those who have completed their studies to display their talents, so as to avoid the traditional drawbacks of "not using what they have learned and not learning what they use." In this way, how can the country not flourish?

My friend Mr. Qian Shiqing, who once served as the supervisor of students studying in Europe, had long understood this matter. Therefore, when his brother Mr. Yunsheng went to study in England in the year of Dingchou, he chose oxygen and devoted himself to research. Years ago, he obtained a Master of Mechanical Engineering and still stayed in England for three years of practical training. He obtained a Doctor of Chemical Engineering and achieved success in oxygen research. He can be regarded as the first person in China to study oxygen.

However, it is said that before Yunsheng returned to China, he had already accepted a professorship at Tsinghua University in Beiping. He can indeed instill the theories he has learned into the minds of general university students, but it is a pity that the country does not allocate funds to organize an oxygen chemical plant for him to develop what he has learned.

On his way back to China, Yunsheng composed four poems and sent them to his father, expressing many feelings. One poem says: "In my youth, I was bold and unrestrained, traveling all over the world and the oceans. The advanced countries of Europe and America, the great cause of the ages lies in the people's livelihood." The second poem says: "From the beginning, those who have aspirations can succeed. I have devoted myself to engineering for ten years. I am fortunate to have obtained a doctorate, but I still hesitate to serve the country." The third poem says: "The morals of all nations are from the old, and science is now always new. Even if atoms can threaten the four seas, seeking peace requires benevolence." The fourth poem says: "The virtue of the former kings protects the descendants, and the hard work of parents is beyond words. The sound of the woodcutters' machine reminds me of the past. When will I be able to repay my parents' kindness!"

His respected Mr. Shiqing copied and sent them to colleagues for poems in response. Jin Xihou said: "Overseas, the flowers on the road bloom again. The prince slowly composes poems about returning by raft. He makes colorful flower dances in brocade clothes, and he is the first family in Wu and Yue." Yu Jingzhai said: "Ten years of diligent study, the art is equally respected. His fame abroad moves the nine pavilions. The students in the classroom look forward to him eagerly, admiring him for having a garden full of peaches and plums. (After returning to China, he taught at Tsinghua University.) The jade trees and orchids in the courtyard are even more beautiful. He returns home after thousands of miles of sailing with a smile. Loyalty and filial piety are passed down from the family, and I am happy to see him dancing in brocade clothes in front of the hall." Jia Jingzhai said: "He has been studying diligently overseas for many years, and he is determined to start a career with refined craftsmanship. He seeks a magical way to save the world, and he supports the weak and saves the people." Qiao Kemaoting brushes the clouds with its branches, and the rain and dew nurture the emerald green. He is outstanding in poetry and elegance, and he brings back the poems of the sea and sky to the court." I also followed the rhymes and wrote poems in response, which are not included here.

Mr. Shiqing inscribed on the portrait he sent: "On the 13th day of August, in the year of Dingchou, the artillery fire in Shanghai was continuous. The ceasefire was at two o'clock to evacuate overseas Chinese. The sea wheel docked in Wusong. The four children risked taking the wheel to study overseas with a firm will. They rode the wind and waves for thousands of miles, and the specialized academic expenses were discussed and studied. After only one year at the University of London, the population was evacuated again. The school was moved to Edinburgh, and the credits from London were not counted. Jing'er first negotiated with them, temporarily changing the regulations and asking them to follow the authority. The evacuation was in accordance with the intentions of the authorities, and the students should not be blamed. The excess tuition fees were raised, and academic and diplomatic relations should be taken care of. I wrote to the board of directors of the school, and the original credits were allowed to be supplemented. Many students studying in England cited this as an example, and my false name has been passed down to this day. After four years of graduation, I entered the factory to practice and study the atmosphere of the atmosphere is fresh. Now the factory affairs have been completed, and the deputy engineer is qualified. It is a good opportunity once in a thousand years, and studying can reach the true essence. Learning is valuable to compare and divide the good from the bad, and conduct on-the-spot inspections before returning. I sent the graduation portrait by post, and I am very happy to see it now. Relatives and friends come to ask from time to time, so I will report it with a piece of paper. The four children are still unmarried, and marriage can be discussed when they return. It has been seven years since they went abroad, and the country is in distress and chaos. The rivers and mountains are still the same, but only the river water still has the surname Qian." He described the facts of his study abroad, and the style is like that of Bai Juyi. I sincerely hope that after Mr. Yunsheng returns to China, he will develop and promote what he has learned, uphold his long-standing patriotic spirit, support the country, and move towards a scientific position. Then, can we not say that China has no hope?

### Long Song to the Moon on Mid-Autumn Night

— He Tianjian

How can the heart of the old man be wrong? The sun strengthens me, and the moon deepens my opportunity. I have feelings of eternity, and I often express them to the moon. Express and express again, and express their signs one by one. The sky cannot always be clear, and clouds often cover the moonlight. I am the cloud for the moon, and this is not my personal feeling. Who in the vast world likes the night to be blind? Counting the Mid-Autumn Festivals, the earth complains and the sky is sad! Strange winds and rain seem to be enemies of the moon! Last year's today became a false hope, but this year's today is as happy as crazy. The fourteenth night is bright, and the fifteenth day is dignified. Sugar taro is like a fist and moon cakes are sweet, and everything goes well and can be forgotten. As expected, there is a full moon in the night, as bright as silver as I wish. Even if there are black clouds like monsters, they do not interfere with each other, nor are they close to each other. Each goes its own way, and embraces its own truth, so that the people of the world who look up to the sky, the barbarian emperor and the barbarian sky, make this night the moon god's festival. Colorful curtains and incense burners, the colors and grades are all displayed. It is pitiful to see the children, gathering together to worship frequently. When asked what they wish for? National peace and people's prosperity. When I hear this, I feel ashamed, and my heart sinks, only knowing how to play with its color, not knowing fraternity and benevolence. Moon, shine upon the sky tonight, and see how many people there are in the world! How is the north? How is the east and west? How is the Central Plains? How can I bear to ask, but feel sad! Moon, O Moon, You have hands, and I know that there is something pulling your elbow. You have a head, and I know that you can only shake right and shake left. You have a mouth, and I know that you can only groan and not roar! Moon, O Moon, I am tired, I will re-order this year for next year. There are still ten thousand miles in the long sky, I will ride the toad while walking; I cannot defend you, but I think for you, the wind is strong, and the clouds are foolish!

### Grand Academician Li Gen

— Qian Dacheng

I read "Free Talk" on September 14, which contained my friend Wu Zongcan's "Remembering Li Gen" (Pan) and mentioned Mei Ximing. Jin recalled that Ximing once wrote a poem to Gen Da, saying: "He is respected in Pengcheng Prefecture, and his name is high in the Jinshi Department. His appearance is like Jiang Bo, and his pen is like Xiao He. The root still produces sons, and a 'fan' is added to the insect. The most difficult thing to learn is thirty-six cakes." Gen Da's appearance was ugly like a martial artist. On the day of the palace examination, he carried thirty-six cakes in his chest, which he ate almost entirely. When he was a student, he was known for his pen. Therefore, Ximing's poem is also teasing and abusive. Gen Da and Ximing both met with misfortune due to the imperial examination case. Is this also the obvious retribution for their lifelong misdeeds? The world always believes that the champion should have a handsome appearance. Gen Da's appearance is not as good as the average person, and his literary talent is not quick. It is appropriate that he is ridiculed by ordinary people. Ximing is a famous scholar, and he is also from the same department as Gen Huo. However, he also made evil jokes about him, so it is not without jealousy and resentment, and he repaid him with evil words. This is also the worst of the unprincipled scholars. Gen Da has no works handed down to the world. Today, those who still know his name are only because of his ugly appearance and ugly deeds. How strange!

### Strange Thief

— Lin

The mayor's office in a certain town on the riverside of the Idaho River in the United States recently accepted a theft case. The stolen thing was a steel bridge in a remote area of the river, weighing 20 tons and 40 feet long. The highway authority thought that the bridge was of no practical use, so they sent someone to investigate and wanted to move it elsewhere. Unexpectedly, when they looked at that place, it had already been stolen.

In Algonquin City, Illinois, the residents have good character, and the police station has been idle for many days, so the police authority is very gratified and specially held a banquet to entertain all the police officers. Unexpectedly, while they were happily celebrating peace, someone secretly sneaked into the police station and stole two pistols, three boxes of bullets, and ten police badges - even the key to the prison gate was taken away.

Someone in Baltimore called the police and said that he had lost a good police dog. According to him, the police dog was best at catching thieves and was guarding the door when it was stolen.

A resident of Michigan, named Clark, suddenly found a thief in his garage one day when he returned home. The thief was stealing his car repair tools. Clark was furious and couldn't help but curse loudly, and ran up to try to beat him up. The thief saw that it was not good and quickly ran away. Clark couldn't catch up, turned around and sorted out the things that were almost stolen. After sorting for half an hour, he looked up and saw that the thief was in front of him again. He saw that his face was ferocious and he took out a pistol, scaring Clark to the color of earth. The thief restarted and put the best of the car repair tools in his bag, and then walked up and took away the two hundred and seventy-three US dollars from Clark. Before leaving, he also said: "You won't curse people as soon as you open your mouth in the future, will you?"

### Yushan Misty Rain

— Lu Qingzhao

Yushan, also known as Ma'anshan, is one of the famous scenic spots in Kunshan. It is located to the north of the county seat. The scenery is beautiful and it enjoys a good reputation. Every spring and autumn, tourists come in droves. If you take the Jinghu Railway and pass through Kunshan Station, you can vaguely see it by looking out.

I have been away from my hometown for more than ten years. This time I came back, seeing Yushan was like seeing an old friend, so I stole half a day of leisure from my busy life, encouraged myself to climb and enjoy the scenery to my heart's content. Although it was already early autumn, the weather still had the feeling of summer. As I walked to the middle of the mountain, suddenly dark clouds gathered and it started to rain. Fearing that the rain would get heavier and heavier, I quickened my pace and rushed to the top of the mountain, lingering in the corridor of the temple. Looking around, it was quiet, and there was a unique taste of calmness. I leaned on the railing and quietly watched the mountain scenery shrouded in misty rain, which looked like a painting, and I felt that the colors were suitable, and the beauty was overwhelming.

At this time, the entire mountain peak was painted with light yellow and light green colors. The curling clouds floated from bottom to top, from white to gray, and drifted slowly in the air. Looking far away, the clouds and trees were vast, very much like a vast and boundless sea of fog. Floating clouds blew past the treetops, fluttering in the wind and scattering into the distance. Dense raindrops hit the iron railings, making a series of ringing echoes. A gust of wind blew through the green bamboo, and they collided with each other, making a sound like silk being torn. Thus, the sound of rain and the sound of bamboo, like broken jade and metal, joined the mountain colors and sky colors that were rich and light like a painting.

Yushan has some artificial decorations, but once it is washed by the mountain rain, it is like washing away the extravagant makeup and returning to its pure color.

The misty rain is hazy, and the forest and trees are fluttering, which is really an indescribable beauty. When I went down the mountain, I looked back at the exquisite small pagoda on the top of the mountain, faintly visible in the sea of clouds, like a layer of light gauze covering the face of a girl, making the tourists linger endlessly. I saw it unintentionally, and it can also be said that it was destined.

### Our Country's Stone Carving Art

— Xu Weinan

One of the greatest arts of China, and regarded by the world as possessing value in the history of world culture, is stone carving. Open any book discussing Chinese art, and Chinese stone carvings always occupy the most glorious page.

Firstly, because the relics of stone carving are of such ancient times, they are the crown of our country's art. Chinese architecture is undoubtedly magnificent, Chinese painting is undoubtedly splendid, but the architecture of the Han dynasty has long since turned to ashes, and the paintings of the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasty only survive in the wall paintings of the Dunhuang grottoes, while many Han dynasty stone carvings still exist, and even stone carvings from the Shang dynasty were excavated not long ago in the underground of Anyang. Secondly, the greatness of the stone carving project is simply unparalleled. For example, the initial construction of the three grottoes at Longmen Mountain in Luoyang, Henan, took 25 years and cost 802,366 workdays. Furthermore, the Buddha statues in the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi, are dozens of times larger than those in Longmen, so how astonishing their construction is, it is difficult to imagine. Thirdly, the richness and excellence of stone carving art, as well as the multitude of subjects, are also beyond the reach of any other art in our country. The carving and decoration of stone carvings are truly a synthesis of Chinese and foreign sculpture, with Chinese style, Indian style, and Greek style, all of which can be seen in various stone carvings in various places. As for the breadth of the subjects of stone carvings, there are China's most ancient myths, war history, religion, and various other historical sites. The universality and longevity of stone carving art also occupy the leading edge of our country's art realm. Ancient stone carvings have been discovered in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Sichuan, and other places. Those nearby include stone carvings of figures still remaining on the tomb of Lu Shen in Pudong, Shanghai. Even today, one or two master craftsmen of stone carving can still be found in Suzhou. Although these great stone carving masters do not explicitly hold the title of sculptor, it is indeed through them that we have maintained our Chinese carving art for thousands of years.

The reason why China's stone carving relics can be so abundant is twofold: one is that the custom of lavish burials from the Han dynasty onwards has never been interrupted, and the other is the popularization of Buddhist propaganda. The former preserved Han tomb stone carvings in Shandong, Sichuan, and other places, and the latter preserved Buddhist grottoes in Henan, Shanxi, and other places.

Classified by carving method, stone carvings in our country can be roughly divided into two categories: one is three-dimensional, such as stone figures, stone horses, and stone lions, and the other is two-dimensional, such as steles. Some of the carvings on steles are intaglio, and some are relief carvings, which can be called relief sculpture.

Our country has always attached importance to the study of epigraphy, but it is too focused on the textual aspect, and thus the figures in three-dimensional stone carvings and the images in two-dimensional carvings have been neglected. The epigraphy books of the past, even if they described stone carving images, were extremely cursory and did not pay attention to them. Therefore, now is still the best opportunity to study this greatest art of stone carving in our country. This time, the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum is holding an exhibition of sculpture art in our country, which is the first voice of publicity for stone carving art after the victory, and is really worthy of praise. It is a pity that the exhibition venue is not large enough to display large stone paintings, nor is there enough wall space to hang huge and rich stone carving rubbings. The stone carving rubbings produced this time only take one or two percent of a collector's collection, which is really only giving visitors "a taste."

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Ten Years of Bigamy - Taking a Concubine Before Marrying a Wife

Chi Zhonglong asks me: Twelve years ago, I married Ms. Jia in a simple ceremony. Ten years later, I married Ms. Yi. I would like to ask: (1) Does this situation constitute the crime of bigamy? (2) The latter was with the consent of the parents, and the marriage was done under the name of "concurrent wife." Is this legal? (3) Ms. Jia has known about this for ten years. Does she still have the right to sue? (4) Before the former marriage relationship is dissolved, what is the status of the latter in the family? (5) Is there any legal basis for my intention to first take a concubine (Jia) and then marry (Yi)? (6) Is there any way to remedy my relationship with Ms. Yi? (7) If the crime of bigamy is committed, can anyone sue?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Since a ceremony was held, it certainly constitutes the crime of bigamy. (2) There is no legal basis. (3) An invalid marriage can certainly be sued for cancellation. (4) Cohabitation relationship. (5) If the former marriage relationship is indeed non-existent, the latter can naturally be regarded as the formal spouse. (6) Bigamy is not only not legally protected, but should also be punished by law. (7) Not only can the parties involved sue, but others can also report it.
