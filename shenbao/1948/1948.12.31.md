### President to Deliver New Year's Day Message, Earnestly Explaining the Current Situation, Major Policies to be Finalized Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] According to reliable sources, the central government is about to make a significant decision regarding the current situation. It is currently under careful consideration and may be finalized on the 31st. The approach may involve President Chiang issuing a message explaining the government's consistent advocacy for peace, pointing out the crux of the matter to clarify the situation and reassure the people. This decision is due to the recent turbulence in the situation, with frequent rumors spreading in Nanjing and Shanghai. Although all have been proven to have no factual basis, they clearly have some impact when they are spread. In particular, after the news of Yan Xishan, Hu Zongnan, and Lu Han arriving in Nanjing, and Song Ziwen and Fu Zuoyi coming to Nanjing, all parties paid the utmost attention and concern to the gathering of important local leaders in Nanjing. It is understood that President Chiang's purpose in summoning Yan, Hu, Lu, Song, and Fu to Nanjing was to consult their opinions on the current situation. Zhang Zhizhong, the Northwest Military and Political Director, who was originally scheduled to return to Lanzhou from Nanjing on the 30th, was also persuaded to stay by the President. Key figures in Sun Ke's wartime cabinet, including Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, and Wu Tiecheng, also participated in the meeting. On the 30th, they had frequent contact throughout the day, and then gathered again at the President's official residence in the evening for consultations. It is reported that after listening to the opinions of the central government and local leaders, the President's decisions for the future have gradually become concrete and can be finalized after further consultations on the 31st, and announced to the country during the New Year. As far as is currently known, rumors of the President's retirement are absolutely false. It is even more absurd to say that people from a certain country hope that the President will retire in order to seek peace. The "certain country people" who were rumored have solemnly denied the matter to the relevant parties. Since inheriting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution, President Chiang has never considered his personal advancement or retreat, and has always been concerned with the interests of the people of the whole country. Therefore, his actions are also based on the interests of the people. The President's position was elected by the people, and he cannot have the idea of retiring without the permission of the people. After the victory and restoration, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference and peace talks with the Communist Party were all to respect the opinions of the people. When the Political Consultative Conference failed, and negotiations were hopeless, the Communist Party expanded its armed rebellion, and the government issued an order to suppress the bandits, also to save the people from fire and water, and to lay the foundation of the country for eternal peace. Future plans will still be decided by the people. President Chiang himself and the government seek peace and have long had a consistent belief in it. It is only because the Communist Party has resorted to arms and caused chaos that we have had to painfully carry out military suppression of the rebellion, in order to achieve peace as soon as possible. If the Communist Party can stop the rebellion and lay down its arms, the government will naturally be tolerant and study the way to coexist. However, the current rumors of peace are only the subjective opinions of some so-called "middlemen". The Communist Party has no response, let alone the opinion of the Communist Party. Therefore, the future development of the overall situation depends entirely on whether the Communist Party is aware of its errors. President Chiang's New Year's Day message may give a sincere explanation on this, so that the Communist Party knows the wrongness of its past and turns over a new leaf, then the people of the whole country can avoid the fate of being plunged into misery. Otherwise, the government will continue to work hard to suppress the bandit rebellion and cannot ignore the people in deep water and fiery heat. As for the military aspect, the government is still confident in reversing the situation, and the opportunity has already appeared. It is not necessary to rely entirely on foreign aid, and the government can firmly grasp the situation, so that the Communist Party realizes that its stubborn insistence on relying on force regardless of popular sentiment will inevitably lead to failure and destruction.

### Yan Xishan and Others Attend Meeting at President's Official Residence, Fu Zuoyi Stays in Peiping, Song Ziwen Flies to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The new Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Shen Changhuan, refuted the rumors that Vice President Li advocated peace when answering questions at his first press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in the afternoon of the 30th. Because a reporter at the press conference asked whether it was true that a certain news agency reported that Vice President Li advocated peace, Shen replied that he had personally visited Vice President Li today. Vice President Li was very surprised by the above news, dismissed it as unfounded, and said, "My will is always the President's will, and my decisions are always the President's decisions." Then a foreign reporter asked about the President's will. Shen replied, "The President's position can be found in the President's messages published in the past. I have nothing else to report." Shen also said that a message will be released on New Year's Day evening.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] General Yan Xishan paid three visits to the President at 7:30 p.m. on the 30th.

He had not returned to his residence by 11:00 p.m. On the afternoon of the 30th, American Ambassador Stuart Leighton hosted a dinner for Yan. At 5:15 p.m., Lieutenant General Barr, the head of the US military advisory group, also visited and had a long talk. On the 30th, those who visited Yan included Li Zongren, Zhang Qun, Wang Chonghui, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, and dozens of others. In the afternoon, Yan also visited Chen Lifu and Zhou Zhirou, and attended the Supervisory Committee's welcome party at 4:00 p.m., and attended Xu Kan's dinner at 6:00 p.m.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] As of 6:00 p.m. on the 30th, Commander-in-Chief Fu was still stationed in Peiping and Tianjin and had no news of going to Beijing. According to observers, the situation in the Tanggu and Dagu war zones is tense, and Fu urgently needs to be stationed in Peiping to command.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 30th] Song Ziwen, summoned by the President's telegram, flew to Nanjing on the "Meiling" special plane on the morning of the 30th. Xu Shixuan and others accompanied him.

### At the Supervisory Committee's Reception, Yan Xishan Reiterated His Determination to Coexist with Taiyuan, Asking the Central Government to Provide Food for Soldiers and Civilians

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] All the members of the Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing held a tea party at the International Club at 4:00 p.m. on the 30th to entertain Director Yan Xishan, who had come to Nanjing recently. During the party, Yan said that he was absolutely confident in ensuring Taiyuan and reiterated his determination to coexist with Taiyuan. When President Yu Youren and Vice President Liu Zhe gave welcome speeches, they praised Yan's revolutionary history, his contributions in the War of Resistance, and his achievements in suppressing the rebellion. They believed that the seamless cooperation between the army and the people in the Battle of Taiyuan, and the unyielding of the famous city, were all due to Yan's great spirit and wise leadership. Yan reported the current situation of Taiyuan in detail, saying that all the people of Taiyuan, except the old and the weak, had been fully mobilized, divided into three tasks: combat, participation in combat, and assistance in combat, directly and indirectly participating in the battle to defend Taiyuan. There are sufficient combat personnel and high morale in the Battle of Taiyuan. There is no problem in defending Taiyuan. The only current difficulty is the supply of food for the army and the people. He also said: The purpose of coming to Beijing this time is to ask the central government to help solve the food problem. Yan finally said that in addition to actively carrying out all deployments to defend Taiyuan, he had long been determined to coexist with the city. Success is for the happiness of the people and the needs of the country. If he unfortunately dies, it is also his personal destination. Supervisory Committee member Wang Xiangzhu then delivered a speech on behalf of the Supervisory Yuan's North China Inspection Group, saying that the group will soon go north for inspection. The original intention was to pay tribute to the military and political leaders and all the people of North China, and to learn from the effective measures to suppress the rebellion. Taking advantage of Director Yan's visit to Beijing, he first expressed his respect to him and asked him to convey his condolences to all the soldiers and civilians in Taiyuan. Wang also praised Yan for bringing a strong fighting will to the capital. The tea party ended at about 3:00 p.m.

### Wu Tiecheng Continues to Meet with Envoys, Schedules New Year's Day Reception for Diplomatic Corps

### He Yingqin Declares that He Did Not Send Representatives to Hong Kong

Yingqin has never sent representatives to Hong Kong during his tenure as Minister of National Defense and after his resignation."

### Chen Cheng is in Taiwan, No Date Set for Inauguration

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 30th] Chen Cheng met with reporters at his private residence at 3:00 p.m. today at the request of the press. He had a ruddy complexion and was in good spirits. He talked for an hour without showing any signs of fatigue. Chen said: The illness has recovered, but he still needs a short period of rest. Therefore, after receiving the President's telegram last night, he replied by telegram requesting a delay in the transfer. The date of his inauguration is still awaiting orders. He also said: The country is in increasing difficulty, and he is willing to devote his life to any position. When reporters asked about his policy for governing Taiwan, Chen modestly said that he came to Taiwan to recuperate and had not had much contact. He is currently planning a week-long trip to the central, southern, and eastern parts of Taiwan. It is too early to talk about the policy for governing Taiwan, and even the impression of Taiwan needs to be gathered after the trip. However, Taiwan has been pioneered by Chairman Chen Yi and laid the foundation by Chairman Wei Daoming, and its stability is better than that of other provinces. The future problem should be how to achieve the supremacy of the people and the primacy of people's livelihood. The life of public education should be improved.

### The 30th Meeting of the Legislative Yuan Passes a Five-Fold Increase in Domestic Postage Rates, the General Budget Awaiting Submission Next Spring is Also Accepted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The 33rd meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan began on the 30th. Because members from other provinces did not arrive in time, and the weather was bad, it was not until 10:30 a.m. that the legal quorum was barely met and the meeting was declared open. First, the reporting matters were heard. The Executive Yuan submitted that the government's general budget for the 38th year should be submitted for review when the meeting is resumed next spring. At the beginning of the new year, the budget and policy guidelines for the second half of the 37th year will be temporarily extended, and it is proposed to report them when the Legislative Yuan meets next time. All were accepted without objection. As for the draft amendment to the Business Tax Law, the draft amendment to the Household Registration Law, the draft amendment to the Organization Law of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the Temporary Property Tax Regulations, which have been approved by the President and transferred for reconsideration, were respectively submitted to the relevant committees for review. Then the discussion matters began, and the bills were handled as follows: (1) Draft Management of Foreign Exchange Regulations, resolved to pass according to the review amendment of the Financial Committee. (2) Adjustment of domestic postage rate table, resolved to pass according to the bill. (3) Amendment to Article 2 of the Organization Regulations of the Strategic Advisory Committee, resolved to pass according to the bill, changing the wording "specially hired strategic advisor" to "specially appointed general or appointed lieutenant general strategic advisor." As for the (4th) bill, the Legal Committee reported on the review and amendment of Articles 4 and 9 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law (i.e., adding one deputy secretary-general and two political members), the Executive Yuan temporarily notified by telephone and requested its withdrawal, and it was not submitted for discussion. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at 4:00 p.m. to discuss bill (5) Amendment to the Air Force Medal Regulations, resolved to pass according to the review amendments of the Ministry of National Defense and the Legal Committee. (6) Amendment to the Mineral Area Tax Rate and Additional Amount in the Mining Law, resolved to pass according to the bill. (7) Supplementary Amendment Contract for US Cotton Loan, resolved to pass according to the bill. (8) China's loan contract for purchasing ten N3-type cargo ships from the United States, resolved to pass according to the review opinion, and the Executive Yuan was consulted for further explanation, and the necessary reference documents were supplemented. (9) Amendment to Article 57 of the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations, resolved to pass according to the bill. At 5:00 p.m., the meeting was declared adjourned because the meeting place was again out of power, and it was decided to continue the meeting on the 31st to handle the unfinished cases.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan passed the bill to adjust domestic postage rates on the 30th, increasing postage rates by five times the current price, which will be implemented simultaneously nationwide from New Year's Day in the 38th year. The new prices for various types of mail are as follows: letter 5 jiao, postcard (single) 2 jiao 5 fen, (double) 5 jiao, newspaper category 1 3 fen, category 2 2 fen, category 3 1 fen, books, printed matter, trade contracts, etc. 2 jiao 5 fen, Braille documents 2 jiao 5 fen, business circulars 5 jiao, samples 5 jiao, registration fee 1 yuan 5 jiao, priority mail fee 5 jiao, express registration fee 2 yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan passed the bill to amend Article 57 of the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations at the regular meeting on the 30th, deleting its second item. Because the household registration business has been transferred from the police agency to the household registration agency, it is not necessary to include it in the Law on Punishment of Violation of Police Regulations.

### Anhui Western Local Communists Stirring Up Trouble, Situation in Huoshan Unclear, Personnel of Anhui Provincial Government Encountered Bandits on Way West

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 30th] In the freezing weather, this place has become an isolated city. Except for the smooth running of the Hefei-Bengbu train, all highway vehicles have been suspended. Most of the telephone poles in Hefei City collapsed due to excessive icing. The last batch of personnel of the Provincial Government encountered bandits on the way to Anqing, and some personnel were captured. It is now reported that they have escaped, but some vehicles and equipment have been lost. The Anhui Western local communists took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the situation in Huoshan has been unclear since yesterday morning.

### Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming's Speech: The Air Force Exerted Its Greatest Power in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Battle, Emphasizing the Determination of All Officers and Soldiers to Save the Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming, braving the rain at the airport today, after repeated invitations from reporters, finally talked to reporters about the Air Force's operations in the Xuzhou-Bengbu battle, saying: (1) Due to the rampant bandits, the Air Force had to exert its high function to save the situation. Therefore, the places where the ground fighting was the fiercest, such as Nianzhuang, Shuangduiji, and Qinglongji, were also the places where the Air Force concentrated its firepower to attack the bandits. Once the bandit troops were discovered, they immediately became mutilated. The Air Force does not want to estimate the figures of this battle result. The fact that the bandits have not been able to launch a crossing-the-Huai River attack on the Yangtze River so far can be found in this factor. (2) A battle example can be cited as evidence: At dawn on the 7th of this month, just as Liu-Chen's bandit troops were confronting the National Army's Huang Wei and Du Yuming units in Shuangduiji and Qinglongji on the west side of the Jinpu Road, Chen Yi's bandit troops sent a force of more than 10,000 people, bypassing to the east side of Jinpu Road, Heqiaozhen, Xuyi County, to steal across the Huai River and go south, intending to attack the rear south of Bengbu. At that time, there were 200 wooden boats busy loading bandits and crossing the river south on both sides. The beaches and reeds on both sides were also full of bandit personnel, mules, horses, carts and other baggage. Because the weather was unusually bad on the night of the 7th, the bandits thought they could hide from the eyes of the Air Force and take the opportunity to steal across the river. Unexpectedly, at dawn the next day, they were discovered by Squad Leader Wu Guoliang's single plane. He reported the bandit situation by radio and swooped down to bomb and shoot. I immediately sent about 50 aircraft of various types to fly to Heqiaozhen to intercept. By the afternoon, all the bandit troops had been wiped out. Broken boats drifted on the river, and the reeds on both sides were completely destroyed. Only a few hundred bandits escaped. If this bandit unit that raided the rear had not been wiped out at that time, the bandits would have fled to Mingguang, cut off the rear road of Bengbu, and then took the opportunity to increase the number of bandit troops pouring south, which might have changed the situation between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers early on. (3) Today, I received a telegram from Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming saying: According to the captives' confessions, "The instructor said that if Mr. Liu had not gone to Jinan for medical treatment, the situation would not have become so bad today." Judging from the current state of depression of the bandits after the Huaihai battle, it is possible that some major accidents have occurred within the bandits' side. The heavy casualties of the bandit troops are certainly one end, and Liu Bocheng being bombed to death may be one of the key factors. Ground intelligence said: "On December 14, when Liu Bocheng's command post was fighting fiercely in Shuangduiji, it moved from Sunchouji to Qixianji." The route of the movement must pass through Taoyuanji. Since December 5, the Air Force has blockaded all the main roads and small paths around Shuangduiji. Since the 12th, it has carried out destructive bombing of the villages occupied by the bandits on the periphery. On the 14th, it also sent C24-type aircraft to concentrate on bombing Taoyuanji. If the Liu bandit was indeed bombed to death, it must be the battle result of the C24-type aircraft on that day. Wang emphasized the Air Force's determination to save the situation and its firm loyalty to the President, believing that the "kneeling political strategy" of those who advocate peace will harm the military force far more than the blows inflicted by the bandits, and hoped that the situation would be clarified as soon as possible.

### National Army Launches Pursuit in Tanggu and Dagu, Strongholds on the North Bank of the Haihe River Recaptured One After Another, The Main Force of the Bandits in the Suburbs of Peiping Has Moved Far Away, There Was Contact in Southern Tianjin Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 30th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: The National Army in the Tanggu and Dagu area has a strong force and solid fortifications. The bandits could not find an opportunity to take advantage of it. At dawn on the 29th, they fled one after another. The National Army's cavalry troops, in cooperation with the naval forces, immediately launched a pursuit. By 3:00 p.m., the strongholds on the north bank of the Haihe River along the coast, Xichang, Jingfeng Material Factory, Zhao's Factory, and Xinhe, had been recaptured one after another. The troops in Xidagu are echoing the troops attacking from Tanggu from the north and south, and are searching westward along both banks of the Haihe River.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 30th] The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters announced: Xinhe, west of Tanggu, has now been confirmed to have been recaptured by the National Army.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 29th] The bandits' movements in the outer perimeter of Tianjin and Tanggu are frequent. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th columns of Lin Biao have been discovered one after another. Most of their main force is concentrated in the area north of the Tianjin-Tanggu line. There are currently no signs of a full-scale fierce battle in the outer perimeter of Tianjin. There was no fighting in Tanggu on the 29th. The 7th column of bandits in the outer perimeter is fleeing to Yangcun. The National Army gave chase on the morning of the 29th. The 2nd column of bandits is still organizing fortifications in the outer perimeter of Tanggu. Under the suppression of the National Army's naval artillery fire, the 9th column of bandits south of Dagu is also retreating in a southwest direction. Some of them fled to southern Tianjin. On the morning of the 29th, they came into contact with the National Army in Liqizhuang, southern Tianjin. The National Army fired artillery fiercely, which could be clearly heard in the city. The bandits retreated in the afternoon. Several thousand bandits occupy Yixingbu in northern Tianjin, and the 8th column of bandits occupies Guan'erzhuang in eastern Tianjin.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] As the new year is approaching, the atmosphere of war in the ancient capital is gradually fading. The main force of the Lin bandits in the surrounding area seems to have moved far away to other places. Although the sound of aircraft bombing and shooting and the sound of gunfire at midnight can still be heard from time to time, the citizens are accustomed to it and no longer panic. They all believe that Commander-in-Chief Fu will be able to protect the safety of the ancient capital. The city defense works in Peiping have been completed after two weeks of rushing repairs. Houses, graves, and trees around the city that do not cause major obstacles have been ordered to stop demolition. Order in the city has returned to normal, and the troops occupying civilian houses in the west city are gradually moving out. The streets are no longer crowded with hurried scenes. Through the efforts of the authorities, the use of water and electricity has not fully recovered, but the great panic no longer exists.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 30th] Fighting around Tianjin has resumed. Fierce fighting broke out on the line of Caijiatai and Wujiatai (west of Huidui) in southern Tianjin at noon on the 30th. The Air Force flew to the suburbs of Tianjin for the first time and assisted in the battle there. The fierce fighting stopped after more than two hours. There was also contact in the Dabizhuang area in northern Tianjin in the afternoon, which continued until the evening. The situation in the Tanggu and Dagu area was quiet.

### Lamentable and Tragic: The Rear Cannot Imagine the Reality - A True Account of the Arduous Battles Fought by Du Yuming's Troops - Report from an Air Force Officer Flown Out of the Xiaoyong Area

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] An Air Force senior officer who landed at the airfield in the Xiaoyong area where Du Yuming's troops were stationed on December 18th aboard a C47 transport plane piloted by Captain Lin Guanxiong, having spent eleven days in the hellish battlefield and completed his mission, flew out of Du's defense area on the 29th aboard a TT17 Mosquito aircraft piloted by Chen Xianyu and Li Zhongqing, arriving in Nanjing.

This Air Force officer began by stating emphatically, "I can responsibly say that the role played by Du Yuming's troops in the Qinglongji and Chenguanzhuang areas of Xiaoyong is beyond the comprehension of those in the rear, such as Nanjing and Shanghai. The morale of the officers and men of the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi army corps is currently very firm. Although their lives are miserable, they are, after all, veteran troops of over ten years and will certainly not disintegrate. Moreover, they will certainly be able to bear the heavy responsibilities they have on the entire Jianghuai battlefield."

When asked by the reporter about the number of troops under Du's command, he stated with certainty, "There are currently 240,000 men, fully equipped."

The following are the words of the officer. Why did this large army corps head south from Xuzhou to attack the enemy's rear, only to end up stationed in the Xiaoyong area for over twenty days? What are its future movements and its role? These are not things that newspapers can reveal. This is a mixed group formed by the characteristics of the troops, habits, strategies, and tactics of both the Nationalists and the Communists. One thing is very important: unless it collapses on its own, such a large and well-equipped army corps will never be swallowed up by the current weak enemy forces. With Du Yuming's talent as a general, assisted by Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi, it will certainly not collapse.

The area where Du's troops are stationed is not very large, and there are not many villages or houses. Most of the soldiers are sleeping in trenches in the open. Fortunately, the parachutes used for airdropping ammunition are being used by the soldiers to provide shelter from the cold. In recent days, heavy snow has fallen, preventing the soldiers from dying from snow penetration.

The officers and men do not lack ammunition. For the first ten days, they dug up civilian food to satisfy their hunger. After the airdropping of food, the food supply was resolved. However, when bags of rice weighing 20 and 40 kilograms fell, they killed and injured about 30 to 40 officers and men every day. For the first ten days, the enemy fired over a thousand artillery shells into the area every day. In the following ten days, only a hundred or so shells were fired each day. The destructive power of the artillery shells was very small. The enemy surrounded the Nationalist troops in deep trenches, adopting a purely psychological warfare tactic, with the shelling serving only as a decoration.

Counter-Screaming is Like a Play

The concrete expression of this psychological warfare is shouting. The Nationalist troops also responded with banter, for example:

Enemy: "Come over here! What are you fighting for when you have nothing to eat? Don't suffer!"

Nationalist troops: "Who says so? We have airdrops!"

Enemy: "What are you airdropping?"

Nationalist troops: "Canned beef, pancakes, bread. Listen to the sound of the cans!" The soldiers knocked on empty cans.

The enemy sounded envious.

Another shouting example:

The enemy beat gongs and drums, attracting the attention of the Nationalist troops, and shouted: "Come over here! We have roasted pig to eat!" The enemy whipped a pig, and the pig squealed. Suddenly, the pig ran out, crossed the trench, and reached the Nationalist troops' position, where it was pinned down.

Nationalist troops: "Haha, your pig has defected! You come over too!"

The enemy was disheartened and silent. The pig became a birthday gift for the Chief of Staff of the 72nd Army.

The Miserable Situation is the Same on Both Sides

At night on the battlefield, dozens of deserters from both sides fled to the other side. Spies sent by both sides were also mixed among the deserters to gather intelligence about the enemy. The multicolored parachutes supporting the shelters looked like a market or yurts. The soldiers under them were lying in trenches day after day, mixed with the groans of wounded soldiers and military dependents giving birth, making hell appear in the glow of the watchman's lamp. The enemy deserters who surrendered also recounted the enemy's miserable situation: they had been lying in trenches for dozens of days, eating only one or two bowls of porridge a day, which was brought by the enemy forcing the common people from thirty miles away. The enemy was not full, and the people were crying in agony. Initially, fifteen Communist columns came to encircle them. After 27 days of stalemate, the enemy had suffered 100,000 dead, wounded, deserted, and sick. Now, only the remnants of nine column numbers remain to guard them.

A Cigarette Costs Two Hundred Yuan

The officer also said: General Du Yuming was not wounded and was as healthy as ever. He treated the Air Force personnel who came to share the hardships as brothers, giving them cotton shoes, cotton quilts, and coats to keep them warm. In his spare time, he often played bridge with these Air Force officers and the head of the medical department, constantly supplying them with cigarettes from Shanghai and Nanjing. On the battlefield, a cigarette cost 200 yuan, and a puff cost 10 yuan. Those who were addicted but had no money often surrounded those who had cigarettes, waiting to enjoy the end of their cigarettes. All the generals below Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi were safe, with only two division commanders suffering bullet wounds. The wounded officers and men were eagerly awaiting airdrops of penicillin and other medicines, and even more so, cigarettes. Due to a lack of fuel, it was imperative to change the airdropped food to pancakes and bread that could be eaten immediately.

Editorial

### Expectations for the New Administration in Taiwan

Just as generals from all over are gathering in the capital, the Executive Yuan, in order to strengthen local administration and cooperate with the overall war effort, has approved the appointment of Qin Decun as the head of Shandong Province and Chen Cheng as the head of Taiwan Province. This is a measure that deserves great attention. General Qin Decun is a native of Shandong. The central government's appointment of Qin to head Shandong demonstrates that the government will not abandon Shandong and intends to recover the lost territories of Shandong. General Chen Cheng is proficient in military strategy and is a well-known military and political figure of our time. The central government's appointment of Chen to head Taiwan demonstrates the government's emphasis on the Taiwan region and will fully leverage Taiwan's human and material resources to carry out economic construction and support the war against the Communists. We attach importance to Taiwan's future and, on the day of Chen's assumption of his new post, we would like to express our wishes for Taiwan's future.

Taiwan is currently one of the most stable and peaceful provinces in our country, and its political and economic status has attracted worldwide attention. Geographically, Taiwan is located between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Its famous islands include three parts: Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, and the Nansha Islands, which are collectively called Taiwan Province. It overlooks the Pacific Ocean to the east, faces Fujian Province to the west, adjoins the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and faces the Philippines to the south. Its situation is extremely dangerous. The land area is 35,961 square kilometers, and the population is about 6.6 million people. Currently, the number of agencies and factories evacuated to Taiwan from Nanjing and Shanghai is increasing day by day, and the population has reached more than 7 million, and there is a trend of continued increase. Taiwan Province has fertile land and abundant products. Medium-sized industrial organizations and agricultural cooperatives have already built a solid foundation. Unfortunately, in the three years since its restoration, human resources, geographical advantages, and products have not been fully utilized, leading to criticisms of being closed-minded and self-sufficient. In fact, Taiwan Province is a part of China. Its relationship with the mainland is like that of lips and teeth, especially the relationship with the provinces of South China is the closest. Therefore, in the future, Taiwan's construction preparations must strengthen the connections with the provinces of South China, and how to use the human resources and technology of the mainland to give play to human resources, geographical advantages, and products in the province, which is the important issue for the administration of Taiwan Province in the future.

In the past, those who governed Taiwan with the most outstanding achievements and were recorded in history were the two generations of national heroes, Zheng Chenggong and his son. Ming general Zheng Chenggong once defeated the Dutch and restored Taiwan, using Taiwan as a base for restoring the Ming Dynasty. Zheng Chenggong and his son ruled Taiwan for 23 years, laying the foundation for construction and enhancing the national spirit. Although it was later invaded by Japan and Taiwan was lost, the national consciousness and the spirit of national restoration had taken root in the people of Taiwan. The Japanese ruled Taiwan for 51 years, and the revolutionary movement of the people of Taiwan never ceased for a day. It was not until Japan's defeat and surrender that the revolutionary movement of the people of Taiwan cooperated with the surrender of the Nationalist army and showed their pride. Now, the country is in turmoil, and there is a sea of ​​fire north of the Yangtze River. Only the three islands of Taiwan stand between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Therefore, how to promote the national spirit of Zheng Chenggong and his son and use Taiwan as a base for the restoration of the mainland is a matter of great historical significance.

We attach importance to the importance of Taiwan, cherish the great historical significance of Taiwan, and naturally hold endless hopes for Taiwan's political and economic construction in the future. We hope that General Chen Cheng will adhere to the spirit of hard work, practical work, and tough work, use a new style to promote new policies, sweep away the past accumulation of slackness in local administration, build Taiwan into a new Taiwan, and further promote the spirit of Taiwan to support the current crisis of the nation-state. Mencius said: "Now, if the state of Teng were to take the best soil of the state of Chu and the best soil of the state of Yue, and add them together, it would only be fifty square li. Even then, it could be a good country." What's more, today's Taiwan has abundant products, a prosperous population, and all industrial and agricultural organizations have established a solid foundation. Governing and constructing Taiwan with a new style, leading Taiwan to progress and brightness, is bound to be a certain thing, and it is something that Chen can bravely do. We are delighted to hear about the great significance of Chen's leadership of Taiwan, and therefore we have endless hopes for Taiwan. We hope that Chen will recognize the difficulties of the times, strive to do his best, and answer the people inside and outside Taiwan Province with new facts as soon as possible.

### Supervisory Committee Dissatisfied with New Silver Standard Regulations - Representatives Sent to Visit Xu Kan - Decisions on Censure or Rectification Will Be Made After Investigation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] In view of the many areas in need of improvement in the national bank's gold and silver exchange policy, the Supervisory Yuan submitted the issue for discussion in the Finance and Food Committee on the 30th. Chairman Sun Yulin and other committee members expressed their opinions on the current policy, and strongly criticized the improvement measures decided by the Executive Yuan this time. Two points were emphasized: (1) Collecting a balancing fee when exchanging is tantamount to raising prices in disguise, and when prices rise, public school personnel cannot benefit from it. The result is that it still flows into the hands of scalpers. (2) The gold yuan issuance method once stipulated that each tael of gold would be worth 2,000 gold yuan. Now, increasing the price with a balancing fee is equivalent to changing the law by order. As for cracking down on the black market, the issue is not whether it can be cracked down, but whether there is the determination to crack down. It was then decided to send committee members Wang Xiangchen, Sun Yulin, and Yu Zhenzhou to visit Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance on the 31st to investigate before deciding whether to propose a censure or rectification case. In addition, a temporary motion was also discussed at today's meeting, which was a censure case against Liu Gongyun, the current deputy governor of the Central Bank, for embezzling state bank funds and engaging in corruption and bribery during his previous tenure as director of the Central Trust Bureau. This case was filed by Committee Member Tang Honglie after receiving a petition from the people. The case listed several facts, including the part of the Fujian Railway Company, the part of manufacturers such as the Datong Cotton Industry Company borrowing funds from the Trust Bureau, and the part of Northeast soybeans. After discussion at the meeting on the 30th, it was decided to hand it over for review.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th] The Supervisory Committee of Hubei and Hunan believes that the financial authorities have repeatedly changed the silver standard regulations, and it is difficult to escape the blame for dereliction of duty.

### Truman Orders Relevant Departments to Draw Up New Foreign Aid Plan for Submission to the New Congress for Review Next Year

[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman today urged the drafting of a massive new foreign aid plan to bolster foreign reconstruction and strengthen anti-communist defenses. The President has ordered government departments to quickly provide foreign aid budgets so that the President can draft a message for discussion after the new Congress convenes. State Department Legal Counsel Gross has been qualified as a foreign aid plan adjustment commissioner to preside over this work, and the foreign aid economic plan will be provided by Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration. The new Congress is scheduled to open next Wednesday. The military aid program includes the supply of weapons and equipment to Western European countries, and the United States is discussing a joint defense treaty with Western European countries. It also includes continued aid to Greece and Turkey to combat communism, and possible aid to China. The first-year funding to restore Western European armaments is estimated at between $2 billion and $3 billion. The actual funding requested from Congress may be greatly reduced, and some supplies can be drawn from inventory. According to the State Department, Truman has ordered all relevant departments to closely adjust their work to the greatest extent possible so that all aspects of economic and military foreign aid can be as perfect as possible in terms of policy, budget, and supply.

### First Draft of the Atlantic Pact Completed; Seven Countries Jointly Defend Against Aggression; Has Been Sent to Their Respective Governments for Approval

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] It is learned that the first draft of the Atlantic Pact was completed today. The ambassadors of France, Britain, Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands to the United States have sent the draft to their respective governments for approval. Once the governments have approved it, or made detailed revisions, it will be sent back to Washington for immediate negotiation of the final draft. Although the pact recognizes the principle of mutual agreement among the participating countries, no provision stipulates that if one of the countries is attacked, the other countries will automatically intervene militarily. Each country is free to make its own decisions on this matter.

The outline of the pact is as follows: (1) No participating country has a veto; (2) Provisions regarding the completion of economic and political sanctions in the event of aggression; (3) The pact stipulates that in the event that one of the signatory countries is attacked, each signatory country will take immediate action, but one of the signatory countries may not take military intervention without consent (4) The pact should be regarded as a regional agreement formed within the United Nations framework to further unite Western European democracies. The signatory countries appear to have included a clause in the agreement to invite neighboring countries such as Italy or the Scandinavian countries to participate in the future. The broad policy of the pact has three characteristics: (1) In terms of the regional agreement formed within the framework of Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, it aims to defend each other when signatory countries are attacked and the Security Council has not yet taken action. (2) In the event of aggression, the decisions passed by a two-thirds majority of the signatory countries must be followed by the remaining countries. (3) The pact stipulates a method for consultation between the seven countries of the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, and other possible signatory countries.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced today that the negotiations between the United States, Canada, and five Western European countries to conclude the North Atlantic Joint Defense Pact are progressing smoothly, and a broad plan is being discussed with leaders of Congress.

Around 3:00 PM, Zhang, accompanied by Ouyang Zunquan, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, arrived at the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Orchestra played music to welcome him. At exactly 3:00 PM, the medal conferral ceremony began, presided over by Mayor Wu. After leading the attendees in a bow, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating roughly: Mr. Zhang Hanting is today receiving the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal, which is deeply respected. There are precedents for shipwrecks and risking one's life to save others. Mr. Zhang saved the lives of hundreds of passengers in a moment of crisis, abandoning the cargo of the "Jinyuanli" without regard. This spirit of righteousness and courage is truly commendable and has great significance for social morality. When he was offered the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal, Mr. Zhang humbly declined. After I explained in detail that the heroic spirit of all the crew members of the "Jinyuanli" was sufficient to represent and promote the virtues that our country has always possessed, and to inspire citizens to emulate, he finally agreed to accept. The "Jinyuanli" rescued passengers of the Jiangya, acting selflessly to save others, which is sufficient to reverse the declining trends in social morality. Therefore, in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council, the Honorary Citizen Medal is solemnly presented to commend his actions. After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he proceeded to read a telegram from Minister Hong of the Ministry of Interior. The medal conferring ceremony was then held, and amidst the melodious music, Mayor Wu presented the finely crafted gold Honorary Citizen Medal to Mr. Zhang and pinned it on him. The audience applauded, with applause thundering. The Central Film Studio filmed the newsreel on site.

Zhang Hanting Expresses Humility in His Acceptance Speech

After receiving the Honorary Citizen Medal, Mr. Zhang Hanting delivered an acceptance speech, saying: Mayor Wu has presented me with the Honorary Citizen Medal for rescuing the passengers of the Jiangya, and I feel extremely ashamed to accept it. The "Jinyuanli" motor sailboat sailed out of Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month and, passing the sea area where the Jiangya shipwrecked, saw the passengers in a moment of crisis. All the crew members bravely rescued them, driven entirely by human compassion. The "Jinyuanli" is a very small tonnage vessel. It placed its bow against the side of the Jiangya, rescuing more than 450 passengers. It was a stroke of luck, and there is no merit to speak of. The forty-odd crew members of the "Jinyuanli" not only saved the lives of the passengers of the Jiangya but also provided warmth with their clothes to the rescued passengers and refused to accept rewards from the rescued passengers. This is something that can comfort the leaders of all sectors and people of society. After Mr. Zhang finished his acceptance speech, Xu Jiliao, on behalf of Municipal Councilor Chairman Pan Gongzhan, and Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association, delivered speeches, all praising Mr. Zhang for receiving the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal. The ceremony concluded at 3:40 PM.

Here is the telegram that Minister of Interior Hong Lanyou sent to the Mayor yesterday to be forwarded to Zhang Hanting, the righteous and courageous captain of the "Jinyuanli": To Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, please forward to Mr. Zhang Hanting: When the Jiangya sank outside Wusong Estuary, more than 3,000 passengers were swept away by the waves. Their cries for help shook the heavens. Just then, your ship passed by, and you immediately threw the fully loaded cargo into the river and rescued hundreds of lives. You valued righteousness over profit, and sacrificed yourself to save others. Your compassionate virtue and benevolent demeanor are admired far and wide. Your compassion for the hungry and drowned, and your great benevolence and wisdom, are enough to awaken the world to value human life and to be courageous in doing what is right. In the future, your model and example will surely inspire others to emulate your virtue and save fellow countrymen from danger. There will be no end to it. As you are being presented with the Shanghai Honorary Citizen Medal and a ceremony is being held, I hereby send a special telegram to express my intentions and sincere congratulations. Hong Lanyou.

### A Glimpse of the Border Region of Zhenjing: Savage Lands Transformed into Communist Bandit Hideouts, Authorities Urgently Need to Pay Close Attention

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liang Yushan

[Guilin, This Newspaper, 24th] Jingxi and Zhenbian counties, remotely located in the southwestern border region, have always been obscure. Years of war have turned many remote villages into bustling marketplaces. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy's iron hooves forced groups of people to flee to the southwest. After the victory, the communist bandits incited chaos, and Jingxi and Zhenbian became transit points for bandits. The "Zhenjing Border Region" began to attract people's attention.

**Perilous Stone Mountains, Communist Bandits Entrenched**

Zhenbian and Jingxi counties are adjacent to each other, forming the protruding area in southwestern Guizhou Province. They connect to Yunnan in the north and Longzhou and Pingxiang in this province to the south, and border Vietnam. Along the Leizhou indigenous territory to Sile, there are 207 boundary markers erected with Vietnam, the boundary line is 1901 li in length. To the area where Zhenjing connects, the Bainan territory is 90 li from the Vietnamese Baole territory, the Pingmeng territory is 8 li from the Vietnamese Shuojiang territory, and the Longbang territory is 25 li from the Vietnamese Chaling territory, similarly managing border affairs between the two countries. Zhenjing is a hilly area more than 400 feet high, with no good natural barriers along the border. There are also many stone mountains within the territory. The local people live by the mountains, and villages are formed at the foot of stone mountains on all sides. There is no communication between the villages. Due to the treacherous terrain, it is easy to attract bandits to gather. From last winter to February this year, communist bandits colluded with local bandits to occupy the Pingmeng, Nongyin, Bainan, Mianliang, and Guole townships. When officials came, the bandits fled, and the bandits had long relied on the terrain to commit evil deeds.

Zhenbian and Jingxi were savage lands during the Tang Dynasty, and remained under indigenous chieftains until the Qing Dynasty. In the fifth year of the Yongzheng reign, the system of indigenous chieftains was abolished and replaced with centrally appointed officials, belonging to Zhen'an Prefecture. In the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign, Jingxi was changed to Guishun Directly Subordinate Prefecture, and Zhenbian was also changed to Zhen'an County under its jurisdiction. In the Republic of China, the prefectures were abolished and counties were established, and the names were changed because they were considered uncouth, hence the current names. During the Sino-French War in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign, the Qing government ceded territory and sought peace despite winning the war. The relationship of suzerainty between us and Vietnam for more than a thousand years was severed from then on, and Zhenbian and Jingxi became important areas for national defense.

**Sleeping Above, Raising Pigs Below**

Jingxi County has an area of 10,976 square li, with a population of more than 240,000. Zhenbian is smaller, with an area of 8,721 square li and a population of more than 80,000, of which Zhenbian still has more than 1,000 Miao and Yao ethnic minorities. Most of them have been assimilated. Even the few Miao and Yao ethnic minorities are no different from the Han people in appearance, only retaining their characteristics in clothing. The collar of their upper garment has only a round neckline, without a raised collar edge. Their clothes and trousers are decorated with thick diagonal stripes.

The lives of the border people are exceptionally arduous. Their dwellings are as simple as bunk beds, with people sleeping on the upper bunk and pigs and cattle in the trough below. The stench fills the air, and they seem to have become accustomed to this simple life, like "entering a stall of abalone." The land there is barren and desolate, producing very little rice, and they mostly rely on coarse grains to maintain their lives. Corn (i.e., millet) is widely grown in the mountains and fields. The annual corn harvest is enough to feed them for half a year, so after each autumn harvest, all their hopes are placed on this crop. Another special product among the coarse grains is called Job's tears. Job's tears is called "Gan Zhu" by the Vietnamese, and they often use it as a substitute for rice or mix it with rice to cook.

**Eating Rice and Job's Tears, A Sweetness in the Bitterness**

There are two lines in their folk songs: "Eating rice and Job's tears, Job's tears cost one, rice costs two, from my man two rice, I only get one Job's tears." Another goes: "My man is Gan Zhu, I am Job's tears, pitying that we are both beads, sweetness and bitterness are always similar." This folk song, passed down for a long time, vividly expresses their living conditions, their lives are a bittersweet mix. Men and women are also very open-minded, especially those young girls, who are even more passionate and unrestrained. After work, they gather in groups of three or five, resting in the mountains and forests, answering each other in pairs, singing out the love words hidden deep in their hearts. Men mostly sing words of flirtation and admiration, while women respond with words of encouragement. Here are a few lines of their singing and answering: "Small mouth, moth eyebrows, melon seed face, who can see her and not love her?" (Man) "The sun is setting and heading west, if we don't go back, how can we explain?" (Woman) Accompanied by their "Ah Ai!" folk tunes, it is quite pleasant to hear. In the border areas, these operatic scenes are not difficult to see. After a deeper feeling develops between a man and a woman, they give each other gifts, but the gifts are very simple. Ordinary men mostly give handkerchiefs and cloth, while women mostly give cloth shoes made by their own hands. A beautiful girl's object of admiration is a young man from outside. They admire them very simply because they have knowledge and have read books.

**Education of Border People Gradually Improving**

The educational level of the border people was relatively backward compared to the interior at that time. In fact, as a result of the government's encouragement of border people to study and encouragement of teachers to go to the border areas, the education of border people has greatly improved in recent years. Judging by the number of students in Jingxi County alone: currently, there are more than 20 students studying at Guangxi University, more than 10 at Nanning Normal College, and also several at Guangxi Provincial Medical College. Considering their environment, these numbers are quite remarkable.

**Mao Bandits and Viet Cong Echo Each Other**

Currently, there is a more important issue than education in this border area. The Viet Cong Ho Chi Minh faction has recently been suppressed by the French army and is hiding in the Yue area of Heshang Township, Vietnam, while another faction uses Shangnong in Baole as its base. The bandit army commanded by Mao bandit's Xiang Ying and Li Jishen, including Zhu Jiabi's "People's Self-Salvation Army of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Border Region," and the "People's Liberation Army of the Yunnan-Vietnam Border Region," and the "Jingzhen People's Liberation Army," etc., are also entrenched in the mountainous areas of Tongwen and Baole, echoing the Viet Cong, oppressing border people to join the army, engaging in replenishment and training, and at the same time implementing a poisoning policy, forcing border people to plant large quantities of opium, causing Jingxi County to become a den of "black goods" and a paradise for criminals. The impact has spread along the Zuo River and You River to the West River, a large river traversing Guizhou Province, covering it with the footprints of opium addicts. The bandits have changed their past style of killing and adopted a gentle policy to deceive the border people, using local communists in various villages along the Sino-Vietnamese border, ostensibly "arming and protecting the autumn harvest," but in reality satisfying their ambition to plunder grain. The lives of the border people are no longer as comfortable as before.

Heshang and Tongwen are inhabited by the Miao people. They call themselves "Tongwen Prefecture, Heshang Province," forming an independent tribe. Although nominally under the jurisdiction of Guizhou Province, it is actually another small world, which is being used by the bandits as a nest for lurking and growing. The government must pay attention to saving the border people and defending the border as soon as possible, and never allow them to grow stronger.

### Two Major Tasks in Xikang: Eradicating Drugs and Suppressing Bandits, Stabilizing the Rear and Supporting the Front Lines

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Xu Renchang

[Ya'an, This Newspaper, 22nd] Xikang, an exception to the national martial law, seems much quieter than other provinces. There are no communist bandits entrenched or causing disturbances in the territory. The people are generally not facing great turmoil except for being threatened by commodity prices to some extent. In this situation, compared with those provinces with wars and famines, it seems to be a "Shangri-La" paradise. It can be said that it is really not easy for Xikang to have such stability today, but this stability work is not enough and has not yet reached the ideal state, and further efforts are still needed. This is what the Xikang authorities should pay special attention to.

**Eradicating Opium**

This is the most important task for stability in Xikang now, because the territory is full of high mountains, which are continuous. In recent years, Han people have been forced by high prices and livelihood to find other ways out besides collecting herbs or growing crops in the mountains, and they have to take risks in the direction of high profits. This group of poor people has also opened up new roads in the high mountains bordering neighboring provinces, where people are not easy to reach, opening up fields and secretly planting tobacco seedlings, applying fertilizer, and harvesting them in the second year. The profit is ten times the income from collecting herbs and farming.

**Secretly Planting Tobacco Seedlings**

In addition to these people who are forced to take risks and secretly plant tobacco, there are also people who have money and can live a good life who also do this. Most of these people are evil forces in society, with the name of Elder Brother Society, they have considerable military power in the local area. They usually do whatever they want, bully the people, and collude with the government. They want to do everything between the people and the government. With a small amount of funds, they use the ignorant and weak people they control to do the work of secretly planting tobacco seedlings. In the end, they can get a huge sum of money without hard work. There are such people everywhere in this vast crowd. In addition, there is another kind of people who secretly plant tobacco seedlings, using vendettas or armed fights as a cover. Originally, in this Xikang territory with special folk customs, the people often have the deepest personal grievances. Because of a small matter, they often gather a number of people and guns and fight each other, staging a bloody tragedy, or they occupy a certain strategic location and guard each other, making a self-defense demonstration. In this situation, everyone also secretly plants tobacco seedlings in the area they occupy and reaps the benefits. For example, such phenomena have occurred in Tianquan, Shixing, Lushan, and Danba counties. If the government sends troops to eradicate them, they deliberately fabricate their words, saying that the government is partial to private feuds and helps the other party, so they do not hesitate to make all sacrifices to resist with arms and protect the growth of tobacco seedlings.

**Difficulty in Eradicating Seedlings**

The eradication work of tobacco seedlings in the Yi area every year is not thorough, which is undeniable. Since the Yi area has been planting tobacco for a very long time, it has not been eradicated even in other years when the strictest and most thorough prohibition policies were implemented. Because these Yi people are all unassimilated people, they have never obeyed the government's laws. If you want to thoroughly eradicate them, you must gather all the Yi people, who will not only resist eradication, but also invade and plunder the Han Chinese area, causing an irreparable great chaos. This prohibition policy has a considerable relationship with Yi affairs, and is definitely not comparable to the Han area.

When it comes to harvesting tobacco juice in the places where tobacco seedlings are secretly planted, people who seek profit outside exchange rice and cloth, and also smuggle prohibited items such as bullets and guns to exchange with people who plant tobacco. As a result, the private military power in the tobacco planting area is increasing day by day, and in addition, most of those who sell tobacco are people who are not afraid of things in society, and they have become dens for hooligans and bandits to do evil. Of course, it will have a considerable impact on social order, especially in the Yi area, everything can only be exchanged for guns, ammunition, and silver. When those things flow into the Yi area, it goes without saying that it is a most terrible phenomenon of lawlessness, which naturally increases the difficulty in solving the Yi affairs problem.

**Cause and Effect**

The Xikang authorities have put in a lot of effort on the inseparable problems of tobacco and bandits and tobacco and Yi affairs, because to thoroughly suppress bandits, it is necessary to strictly prohibit the planting of opium, so as to avoid the lingering of unscrupulous elements. At the same time, to thoroughly eradicate opium, it is necessary to suppress the bandits of unscrupulous elements, so as to prevent evil forces from doing evil. To solve Yi affairs, it is necessary to prohibit opium, so as to avoid external support. To thoroughly prohibit opium, it is also necessary to solve the Yi affairs problem, and the law can be effective only when it is in-depth. These cause-and-effect problems are really not simple. Between the 35th and 36th years, the authorities made their best efforts, not hesitating to sacrifice everything, to thoroughly eradicate tobacco seedlings, and the Tianrong incident occurred. Those who did not know the inside story at the time thought it was a civil uprising, but how could it be a civil uprising? In fact, it was a bloody fact that was staged to resist eradication. Another example is the suppression of Puxiong Yiyi, which is one of the solutions to the Yi affairs problem. How could it be a war of Yi people rebellion?

**Permanent Stability**

This year, due to the emergency of the war to quell the chaos in the front, some unscrupulous elements are taking advantage of this turbulent situation and are thinking of secretly doing the business of secretly planting tobacco seedlings again. However, in order to strengthen the stability work in the rear, maintain social security, and increase the strength of the front to quell the chaos, the Xikang authorities have made drug eradication and bandit suppression the important tasks at the moment, and have ordered Yuan Pinwen, deputy director of the Ningzhu Committee, and Wu Peiying, who is stationed in the army, as well as Liu Yuanxuan and Wang Zhiren, who are stationed in the army in Yushu, to be responsible for handling it. Now the persons in charge of these two areas have separately convened a meeting of the county magistrates and the speakers and deputy speakers of the council of each county and the military officers stationed in the county, and the ultimate principle is to effectively connect between provinces and counties and thoroughly handle it. Everyone in the military, government, and people must cooperate, be consistent from top to bottom, so that no tobacco seedlings appear, and there is no bandit, to accomplish the task and stabilize this Shangri-La Xikang for a long time.

### The National Bank Throws Out Huge Amounts of Foreign Exchange, the Money Market Has Become Tight

According to related sources, the Central Bank threw out foreign exchange certificates in the market the day before yesterday, estimated to be over US$120,000 in one day. Yesterday, it secretly entrusted the China and Communications Banks to sell US$600,000. This is a rare phenomenon since the currency reform, and all parties are paying close attention.

The Central Bank's exchange rate for overseas remittances was adjusted for the twelfth time to 110 yuan per US dollar yesterday, an increase of another 10 yuan. The opening of the foreign exchange transfer certificate market was weak. Banks and bureaus bought at 114 yuan and sold at 115 yuan. Designated banks bought at 109 yuan and sold at 110 yuan. The market supply exceeded demand, and prices trended downward. In the afternoon market, the buying price was 103 yuan and the selling price was 105 yuan.

The city's money supply, which has been loose for a long time, has become tight in recent days due to the soaring prices of goods and the urgent demand from various industries. The Central Bank's contraction of floating funds and recovery of balances has reached more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, yesterday's trend has become tight. The highest overnight lending rate in the market reached 50 yuan per day, and generally 40 yuan or 45 yuan. Compared with the day before yesterday, the increase was doubled, which is quite alarming. The industry is urging the repayment of loans, which makes the city's turnover even more difficult. It is expected that the tight situation will become even worse today.

Cash chips were also tight yesterday because the bank and village were generally short of orders the day before yesterday, resulting in a rare balance deposited in the Central Bank. Yesterday, it was impossible to withdraw cash, and the year-end is approaching. The wages and year-end bonuses of employees in the industrial and commercial sectors in the second half of the month are approaching, and there is a great need for funds. It is said that there is also a discount on general cash, and the banks and villages repeatedly restrict cash withdrawals, about 500 yuan or 1,000 yuan. It is said that there are people in the market who offer 60 yuan or 70 yuan for overnight balances.

### Money Market Tight, People's Hearts Vacillating, Rice Prices Begin to Fall, Flour Plummets, Coarse Grains and Cooking Oil Drop Sharply

The rice market turned down yesterday because other goods had already fallen first, and people's hearts were also weakening. In addition, the money market was very tight at the end of the year, and there was not much demand. There were more transactions in the early market, and prices immediately dropped by 20 to 30 yuan (nearly 100 yuan lower than the shouting price at the close of the previous day). Transactions in the middle market were sparse. White japonica rice was 670 yuan, thin indica rice was 680 yuan, and early indica rice was 660 yuan. At the close of the market, the downward trend was even more sluggish, and prices fell again by 20 to 30 yuan as described above. Thin indica rice closed at 650 yuan, a decrease of 60 to 70 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day, and a decrease of more than 100 yuan compared to the shouting price after the closing of the previous day. The situation in the north market was the same. Only 8,353 shi of goods arrived in the north and south markets yesterday.

**Flour**

The market situation plummeted because people's hearts were stabilized by the resumption of gold exchange and storage. Various goods outside the industry fell sharply. The cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell out, and there was a sound of selling in the market. The opening price of old car flour was 285 yuan, and then it fell to 272 yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 87 yuan. The closing price of battleship flour was 262 yuan, a sharp drop of 93 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour were all opened in the after-market, and prices fell uniformly by 80 to 90 yuan. Wheat bran also followed suit and fell sharply by 47 yuan.

**Coarse Grains**

They all fell sharply because all goods saw a return wind. The decision to resume gold exchange and storage stabilized people's hearts, and the cargo owners took advantage of the high prices to sell out. Hankou peas fell straight to 370 yuan, a sharp drop of 180 yuan. There were more shipments of corn than purchases, a decrease of nearly 100 yuan. Red sorghum also fell sharply by 100 yuan, and there were still few households paying taxes. Green beans fell rapidly by 50%, sesame also fell sharply by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were not taken by the Ke Bang, and sales were sluggish, falling by 400 yuan.

**Cooking Oil**

The downtrend was fierce because gold exchange and storage resumed, commodity prices outside the industry fell, and year-end closing, the money market tightened suddenly. The cargo owners rushed to sell, and the soybean oil factories also opened their prices, the highest being 2,300 yuan, and the closing price was 2,150 yuan. Rapeseed oil retreated to within 2,000 yuan, closing at 1,950 yuan, all falling sharply by 400 yuan. The closing price of Jitone raw oil was as low as 2,000 yuan. The market for sesame oil was also extremely weak. There were more bean cakes on the market than purchases, with a decrease of 47 yuan and the spot price for raw peanut cake at 153 yuan.

### Bank and Village Increase Capital and Transfer Deposits by Today

The Ministry of Finance has made a final decision on the issue of bank and village capital increase, that is, the cash part will still be transferred for deposit and can be used at any time, but it must be approved by the Financial Management Bureau. It is learned that the Banking Association convened a meeting on the 29th and decided to comply with the law. Yesterday morning, an emergency notice was sent to all member banks and villages. Regarding the transfer of the cash part of the bank and village capital increase to the Central Bank for deposit, a quick telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the deposit should be transferred to the Central Bank for verification by December 31. As for the use of funds, the government has decided to give a reasonable and generous flexible approach, and is currently discussing it, and it will be announced in early January.

The reporter recently visited authoritative figures in the industry about the transfer and deposit of the cash part of the bank and village capital increase. It was reported that this move indicates that the government has decided to concede to the requests of the banking industry, and the transfer for verification is only a routine procedure. It is expected that it can be used at the beginning of the new year. The bank and village authorities have long been prepared for the cash capital increase, so it does not affect the industry's balance.

### Cigarettes Fall Back by 20%

The cigarette market, because it is heard that gold exchange and storage will still be implemented, the money supply will tend to be tight, there is a lot of floating capital, and because the banks and villages are closed for several days, the interest rates are unbearable, and the sale is very strong. The market situation suddenly plummeted due to lack of demand. At the close, it was slightly stable. The price of Jia Li Ke fell by 40 yuan compared with yesterday, to 120 yuan. The price of 3-5 also fell by 35 yuan to 210 yuan.

### Soviet Coal Arrives in Shanghai by Jin

### A Batch of Green Tea for Export Has Been Officially Traded at US$0.95 per Kilogram

[This Newspaper] According to export sources: China's tea exports have become active because of the French economic delegation's purchase for French North Africa. The total purchase volume is 500 tons, all green tea, priced at US$0.95 per kilogram, jointly supplied by Shanghai tea exporters. It has been officially traded and will be shipped and exported after the New Year next year. Therefore, the tea market has improved recently. Because there is not much tea in stock in Shanghai, after this batch of transactions is successful, most of the stock has been cleared.

Another news: Red and green tea, because the licensees saw the sudden surge of goods outside the circle the day before yesterday, affecting the reproduction cost, and also because of the scarce tea stocks, although the money supply is tightening and the market interest rates are increasing, they are not restricted at all. They are all trying to hold on to their attitudes, and the shouting price is skyrocketing, so the upward trend and the prices are even more amazing. Because of the narrow supply source, there were only a few transactions in the end.

### Sluggish Buying, Quiet Trading: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Falls 3,500 Yuan

Yesterday, the yarn market halted its rise and began to fall. Since the 20th, the upward trend had been unstoppable, finally reaching an unprecedented peak. Although this was due to loose monetary policy, there was also suspicion of opportunistic price gouging. However, with high prices comes the risk of decline, and extremes are followed by reversals. Therefore, yesterday, all yarns declined uniformly.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a low of 33,000 yuan. Midway, there were still many who sought to buy at lower prices, and the market closed briskly at 36,500 yuan, a decrease of 3,500 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell 4,300 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 27,500 yuan, once reaching 30,500 yuan, but finally returned to 30,000 yuan at the close.

Cotton cloth plummeted across the board. It was rumored that gold would resume convertibility, and that the money supply in the market was tightening. Furthermore, it was the end of the year, and the market would be closed for five days starting today. Therefore, both buyers and sellers were wary. Large and small traders were cautious and prudent, and trading within the market was quiet.

Fine Dragon Head cloth initially opened at 900 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge at 850 yuan. Subsequently, bulls sought to buy at lower prices, and the market rebounded slightly, with prices slightly recovering. Finally, the former closed at 960 yuan, and the latter at 900 yuan, a rapid decline of 200 to 250 yuan from the previous day. The quality of Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge rose from 870 yuan to a high of 930 yuan, closing at 910 yuan, a final drop of 240 yuan. Although the quotations of other cloth factories opened low, not much business was done.

### Sugar Market Declines

Yesterday, the sugar market saw Taiwan Sugar Corporation selling special grade white sugar on behalf of the National Bank. The industry's finances were tight, and prices had risen excessively, leading to caution. Overall, the market for various goods weakened, and many speculative positions were liquidated, resulting in a soft market. No. 45 grade white sugar opened at a soft price of 1,100 yuan and continued to decline throughout the day, closing at 1,050 yuan, a sharp drop of 400 yuan. Coarse sugar fell 390 yuan, and various other grades fell by about 400 yuan each.

### Wood Market Softens

The upward trend in the wood market has come to a halt, and plywood has begun to decline. 3'x6' plywood opened at 42 yuan, and 3'x7' plywood opened at 50 yuan, each falling by more than ten yuan. Foreign pine and pine boards have remained stable, but fir strips remain firm due to their use in doors and other frequently sold items. The market opened at 3.5 yuan, with transactions occurring at 3.3 yuan and 3.2 yuan. However, industry observers believe that the wood market will soften.

### Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank to Close Today

The person in charge of the French Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank stated that the bank, under the orders of its Paris headquarters, will close its banking operations in its Shanghai branch today. All unfinished matters will be transferred to the French Banque de l'Indochine for continued handling. At the same time, a financial office will be established at the original location to focus on investment business, according to reports.

### Sino-Dutch Barter Trade Begins; First Batch Worth 50,000 Pounds; Barter Trade with Japan Also to Be Relaxed Starting Next Year

The barter trade between our country and the Netherlands has now been approved by the Import and Export Control Commission. It is learned that the first batch of barter goods is worth 50,000 pounds, a considerable amount. The barter trade between China and the Netherlands can be expanded from this. The export authorities are currently purchasing fine grass mats from Central and Southern China, preparing to concentrate them for sale in the Netherlands. The Dutch side will soon ship a batch of Western medicines to China. Dutch barter goods with our country in the future will mainly consist of Western medicines, according to reports.

### Silk Prices Decline

The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. The market for various external goods continued to decline, and credit tightened suddenly, with interest rates rising. Furthermore, with the New Year holidays approaching, banks will close, and the market will be closed for several days. Holding goods incurs high interest, and the risk is high, so many speculative positions were eager to liquidate.

120-count Tianqiao opened at 33,000 yuan in the morning. There were more sellers than buyers, and major players settled their accounts, causing the market to weaken. The market declined again, falling below the 30,000 yuan mark, hovering between 28,500 yuan and 29,000 yuan for a long time. By the close, credit had eased slightly, and many short positions were also arranged, causing buying interest to increase. Prices rose back to 30,000 yuan, and finally closed at 31,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, long positions were bought on small dips, and the black market price of gold and banknotes rose, improving sentiment and revitalizing the market. 120-count Tianqiao was traded at 33,300 yuan, up 2,500 yuan from the morning session. Dongyang, Jin Sanma, Siniya, Xishi, and other brands all initially moved flat to soft, and rose at the close. Dongyang was traded at 33,700 yuan in the afternoon, also up 2,500 yuan from the morning session. The upward and downward trends of other grades were the same.

The raw silk market was initially flat and then softened yesterday. Due to the wild fluctuations in market prices and the high risks, foreign firms were cautious, and credit was generally tight. Initially, it was heard that the market for various external goods was relatively flat, and prices were relatively stable. Later, due to the overall softening trend, there was continuous selling to obtain cash. Grade D 7/8 evenness opened at 40,500 yuan, and premium odd lots opened at 39,000 yuan. Midday saw small retailers selling off, and trading was quiet, causing prices to fall. Grade D fell to 37,500 yuan, and premium fell to 36,500 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in rayon and the apparent stabilization of the market for various external goods, and a slight increase in the black market price of gold and banknotes, prices rose after softening. Grade D was quoted at 41,000 yuan, and premium was quoted at 39,000 yuan, both up from the morning session.

The silk and satin market was initially down and then up yesterday. After the opening, sentiment was weak, and major players sold off to obtain cash. There was strong selling pressure. Furthermore, with the market closing for several days around the New Year, many small retailers planned to profit from interest, and sold off to lend money. As a result, the market became increasingly unsustainable. Meiya opened at 18,000 yuan, and Huaqiang opened at 17,800 yuan. There were more sellers than buyers, and the trend was weak, causing prices to decline. Meiya fell to 17,200 yuan, and Huaqiang fell to 17,000 yuan, hovering at low prices. Trading seemed sluggish. After the morning, credit tightened and then eased, and short positions were covered, causing prices to rise after softening. Meiya closed at 19,500 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 19,400 yuan. Transactions outside the market were done at 100 to 200 yuan higher, but the result was still a decline.

### A Difficult to Break Stalemate: Air Force Academy Wins Narrowly Against Renyu; 49 to 47, a Difference of Two Points; Liao Xuewen's Throw Decides the Victory

[Report from Our Newspaper] In yesterday's basketball friendly match, the Hangzhou Air Force Academy narrowly defeated Renyu 49 to 47 by two points. The score was 22 to 21 at halftime. The battle was tense and close throughout, attracting hundreds of spectators, which was unexpected. Cheers erupted in the City Gymnasium.

In the first half, the Air Force Academy's Zhu Shengyi, Liao Xuewen, and You Jianxing were the most agile and active, while Renyu's Wu Xinyun was more lively. The Air Force Academy worked hard to intercept the ball, and with Shengyi's brilliant shooting, the Air Force Academy led Renyu by one point at halftime, 22 to 21. In the second half, Renyu initially maintained a back-and-forth situation, but after ten minutes, chaos broke out, with players acting individually, and the Air Force Academy dominated. They often led by four or five points. The later part of the game became a fierce battle between the two sides. In the end, the Air Force Academy's Liao Xuewen scored a basket as the buzzer sounded, giving the Air Force Academy a narrow victory over Renyu by two points. Zhu Shengyi of the Air Force Academy and Wu Xinyun of Renyu each scored 22 points. The starting lineups for both sides were: Renyu: Wu Xinyun, Li Zhaohe, Yao Wenyi, Le Jiazhou, Sun Guozheng; Air Force Academy: Zhu Shengyi, Liao Xuewen, You Jianxing, Sun Huanting, Yuan Fuchu. The Air Force Academy's You missed a free throw, and Renyu's Le Jiazhou made a free throw to open the scoring. The Air Force Academy's Zhu Shengyi intercepted the ball in the air and scored, creating momentum. Renyu replaced Le with Zhuang Yirong, and the defense became stricter. Only two to one was scored in five minutes. Zhu Shengyi scored again, and Renyu's Xinyun, Yirong, and Guozheng scored frequently, giving Renyu a 9-6 lead. The Air Force Academy replaced Yuan Shixian with Liao Xuewen, and Yuan made contributions, only falling behind by one point. The scores were close, and the Air Force Academy surpassed Renyu several times. Xu Shuyuan scored a basket, making the score 21 to 18, and Renyu raised its head again. Shengyi performed exceptionally well, and the Air Force Academy led Renyu by one point, 22 to 21, at halftime.

After the break, Xinyun scored a basket, taking the lead. The scores between the two sides rose and fell. The Air Force Academy's passing was particularly magical, and they suddenly took a 32 to 27 lead of five points. Renyu gradually became flustered. After struggling, Renyu gradually caught up. Wenyi scored a basket, making the score 39 to 38, finally giving them a breath of air. Jiazhou seemed to have divine help, making every free throw, but by focusing on the front and neglecting the rear, they gave the other side a point, making the score 42 to 41. With five minutes remaining, Wenyi scored a long shot, changing the situation again. Shengyi of the Air Force Academy and Xinyun each played for their own team. Renyu called its sixth timeout with the score at 45 to 44. At this moment, Liao Xuewen of the Air Force Academy made a free throw to tie the score. He then scored another basket to add two points. Renyu failed to take advantage of two free throw opportunities, and Xinyun scored a long shot, tying the score at 47. Who knew that Liao Xuewen would grab the ball and score, giving the Air Force Academy a narrow victory over Renyu by two points, 49 to 47.

### Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament Concludes; Zhejiang Xing Team Wins Second Place

The second Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament, sponsored by the Yinqian Industry Alumni Association, held its final match at 6:00 PM the night before at the China Bank's fourth-floor auditorium. China Yellow and Zhejiang Xing, two strong teams, competed for second place. Chen Linsheng, Wu Lianquan, and Zhu Xiguang served as referees. China Yellow had no hope of winning the championship due to their loss to Siming the night before, so their morale was low and they fell behind. They were unable to catch up, with only Zhu Yongkang defeating three Zhejiang Xing players, maintaining his veteran status. Under the leadership of team leader Wu Zhaofeng, Zhejiang Xing's players fought hard. As a result, Zhejiang Xing defeated China Yellow 13 to 5, winning second place. China Yellow fell to third place. The championship was won by Siming. The entire final schedule of the tournament has been successfully completed. The complete list of rankings is recorded below:

(Champion) Siming, (Second Place) Zhejiang Xing, (Third Place) China Yellow, (Fourth Place) Shanghai, (Fifth Place) Citibank, (Sixth Place) Communications Bank.
