### Vice Chairman Sun Discusses U.S. Aid to China: Military and Economic Aspects Should Be Equally Emphasized; Constitution Needs Implementation Before Revision; Currency Reform Awaits Currency Stability

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Vice Chairman Sun Ke met with reporters on the morning of the 14th to discuss the National Assembly's tasks, the Vice Presidential election, and the international situation. Regarding this National Assembly, Sun pointed out that its primary task is to elect the President and Vice President. He heard that some people advocate amending the constitution during this session, but Sun believes this is inappropriate. The quality of the constitution cannot be determined subjectively; it must be implemented before revisions can be proposed. Regarding whether he himself will participate in the Vice Presidential election, Sun did not explicitly confirm or deny, but said, "I have neither actively campaigned for the Vice Presidency nor explicitly announced my withdrawal, because the party has not yet decided on this matter, and it is inconvenient for me to express any personal opinion. Recently, Mr. Li Zongren wrote to me, asking about my attitude, and I replied to him in this way. Foreign reporters have asked me, and I have replied in this way as well. Friends from various parts of the country and overseas Chinese have sent telegrams to inquire, and I have replied to them in the same way." Sun also said with a smile, "My personal views and actions have always been based on the interests of the country. I am willing to let the party and public opinion decide what the country needs me to do most." Sun further emphasized that there is no explicit provision in the constitution that the Vice President and the President of the Legislative Yuan cannot be held by one person. The Vice President has no administrative powers, which does not conflict with the role of the President of the Legislative Yuan. The U.S. Vice President also serves as the President of the Senate, and his office is located within the Senate. However, the proposed organizational law of our Presidential Office does not prepare an office for the Vice President.

Sun then discussed the issue of U.S. aid to China, believing that military and economic aid should go hand in hand. The military setbacks in the Northeast and other regions prove that there are many aspects of the military that need reform. Therefore, he believes that American advisors can be invited to assist China in training its troops to achieve reform. Aid in military supplies is especially necessary. The treatment of troops should be improved immediately, and officers should eliminate long-standing bad habits and share weal and woe with their soldiers. In terms of the economy, what we need most at present is to stabilize the currency value. This is the first priority. Therefore, U.S. aid should aim at this goal. Only after the currency value is stabilized can we talk about reforming the monetary system.

The Soviets Attempt to Communize the World; Difficult to Be Optimistic About Peace with Japan

When discussing the Northeast issue, Sun stated, regarding the petition from the Northeast delegation to strengthen diplomacy with the Soviet Union and urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty, that this is a matter of national strength. We concluded the Sino-Soviet Treaty with great sacrifice, aiming to seek cooperation for internal stability, but have not yet obtained the Soviet Union's friendly cooperation. Given the current situation, it is difficult even for the government to urge the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Sun said, "I have been to the Soviet Union. In the past, the Soviet Union's expansion for its own security was limited, but now it not only defends its own security but also attempts to communize the world." Sun then discussed the Czech issue, saying that the Soviet strategy is to establish communist rule in countries it can militarily control; otherwise, it uses political means to form coalition governments, waiting for opportunities to achieve full control. Czechoslovakia was originally a democratic and free country, trying to be friendly with the Soviet Union for independence and autonomy. After this coup, the hopes of all those who adopt this policy have been shattered. The situation is like this in the West. How could it be different in the East? The issue of peace with Japan is of utmost concern to us at present. Judging from the Soviet Union's attitude, there is no room for optimism. Future changes in the international situation will also change our attitude towards Japan.

### Bayonet Fight in Luoyang; National Army Tenaciously Defends the Core; Reinforcements Rush Westward

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 14th] Luoyang Fang had a phone conversation with Zhengzhou on the evening of the 14th, stating that street fighting was still ongoing in the area. The National Army reinforcements advancing westward from Zhengzhou have arrived near Luoyang and are stepping up their suppression with combined air and ground support.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 14th] The National Army rushing to the aid of Luoyang crossed the southern area of Yanshi County this afternoon and is rushing towards Luoyang. It is expected that they will reach the outskirts of Luoyang tonight.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th] Military news: Chen Yi's 3rd and 8th columns of bandits, along with Chen Yaping's 4th and 9th columns and Kong Congzhou's bandit forces, totaling 70,000 to 80,000 people, have been moving around Luoyang since the beginning of this month, attempting to seize Luoyang in three days and nights. Starting on the 8th, they launched a fierce attack on a certain youth army division defending Luoyang. Our army, under the command of Division Commander Qiu Xingxiang, first fought bravely in the outposts, inflicting heavy blows on the bandits multiple times, and then retreated to the urban area according to the planned. After noon on the 9th, the bandits swarmed towards the city, and under the cover of various cannons and mortars, they pounced on our East Gate. The defending army calmly responded, unleashing maximum firepower and annihilating all the bandits approaching the city gate. However, the bandits' ferocity has not diminished slightly, and they still rushed to attack, with shells falling on the urban area one after another. In the fierce battle until the night of the 11th, the bandits repeatedly broke into the East Gate, but were all annihilated by us. Until 2:00 AM on the 12th, the bandits concentrated their firepower again and bombarded the East Gate, eventually collapsing the city gate. Our officers and soldiers fought bloodily for five days and nights without closing their eyes. They were unable to block the breach in time, and the bandits broke in through the East Gate. The defending army immediately surrounded the bandits and repeatedly charged and killed, determined to win at all costs. The intensity of the street fighting was unprecedented. Although the bandits left corpses everywhere, their reinforcements kept pouring into the city, and our army, with its numerical inferiority and substantial depletion, the bandits turned to defend various independent strongholds and core positions within the city while waiting for reinforcements. After the fierce battles of the 12th and 13th day and night, although the bandits continued to bombard our various points with fierce artillery fire, they ultimately relied on our defending officers and soldiers, united in hatred of the enemy and determined to quell the chaos at the cost of their lives, to inflict heavy blows on the bandits at any time. The bandits never crossed the Lei Pool. As of the 14th, our morale was getting stronger and stronger, and we were still fighting the bandits in bayonet combat. Now, our various reinforcement corps are rushing to the aid of Luoyang. Division Commander Qiu has a telegram stating that he is determined to fight to the last man and not to be discouraged in order to repay the Party and the country.

### Communist Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Use Youth to Infiltrate the Rear Areas of Nanjing and Shanghai

Zhang Xuezhong Hopes All Sectors Will Raise Their Vigilance

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 14th] Definite Intelligence: A large number of male students from "Nation Building Schools" and "Cadre Schools," numbering over 8,000, and female students, numbering over 3,000, have come with the bandits in this southward flight. Most of them are youths from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the bandits refer to them as students from the Tianmu Mountain area. Their mission is clearly to prepare to infiltrate the rear areas of Nanjing and Shanghai, gather intelligence, and confuse the people. Today, Commander Zhang of the 7th Pacification Zone, in an interview with our newspaper, specifically emphasized that the political significance of Chen Yi's arrival in Northern Jiangsu is far greater than the military significance. Militarily, the National Army is confident that it can strike the bandits in a short period of time, but politically, it earnestly hopes that all sectors in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will strengthen anti-espionage organizations and raise their vigilance.

### The Flames of War in Central Shandong Gradually Shift Westward; National Army Strengthens Defenses Around Jinan

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] In order to shorten the defense line, the National Army in Central Shandong has taken the initiative to withdraw to the area east of Longshan on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. The war has spread to the area east of Longshan Station, 33 kilometers outside Jinan, since the 13th. More than 1,000 bandits who attacked from Zhoucun and Puji suffered heavy casualties after being counterattacked by the National Army. The defenses of Jinan City have been strengthened, and the residents, who have the highest faith in General Wang Yuewu and are rich in military experience, are as stable as before.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] The addition of National Army defenses has greatly reassured the people of Jinan. In order to ensure the safety of Greater Jinan, the authorities have taken necessary military measures, and officers and soldiers have become a fighting unit. The curfew hours have been brought forward to 8:00 PM every night to 6:00 AM the next morning. The defending army of Huantai withdrew automatically after repeatedly defeating stubborn bandits. The struggle for the Hongshan Dahuangdi mining area in Zichuan is extremely fierce. In addition to sending troops to provide reinforcements in different directions, the National Army has also strengthened the outer defenses of Jinan.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 14th] According to refugees who escaped from Zhoucun, there were many Japanese machine gunners and artillerymen among the communist bandits who attacked Central Shandong this time. After entering Zhoucun, they engaged in widespread rape, looting, and plunder. Now, refugees are flocking to the western section of the Jiaoji Railway.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] Yesterday, the National Army pursuit and suppression corps in Western Shandong compressed the remnants of Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, and 6th columns into the triangular area of Xicheng Dongping Lake in Western Shandong.

### Catastrophe in Siping: Major Fire in the City; Defending Army Fights House to House, Inch by Inch; Bandits Break Through City Defenses with Human Wave Tactics

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] According to aerial reconnaissance by the Air Force, there is a major fire in Siping. This transportation hub in Northern Liaoning has been ravaged twice, and the name Siping is now truly deserved! It is reported that the bandits attacking Siping are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th columns and the 2nd and 4th independent divisions of Northern Manchuria, the 5th independent division of Western Manchuria, totaling approximately 80,000. The defending army of 3,000 infantrymen fought bloodily to defend the city, fighting house to house and inch by inch. However, reinforcements could not arrive in time, and more than half were sacrificed. This isolated army of bloodshed lost contact during the breakout. [Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th] The next action of the communist bandits after they captured Siping has not yet been determined. It is expected that they may launch a tentative attack on Changchun. It is widely believed that the period before the opening of the National Assembly is an important stage, and the bandits in the Northeast will use their severely damaged and exhausted troops to make a desperate gamble, threatening Shenyang in an attempt to confuse international public opinion. The National Army has made thorough preparations to counter the bandits' conspiracy. [Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] The bandits besieging Siping launched a full-scale fierce attack on the urban area with infantry and artillery throughout the night of the 13th, focusing on the northeast corner of the city, Yimiancheng, and Liujiatun. The fighting was extremely fierce. The bandits braved our intense artillery fire, using four tanks as cover, and charged repeatedly, but were repelled by the defending army one after another. In addition, the bandits continued to increase their forces at the slaughterhouse and South Gate in the southwest of Siping, and charged repeatedly. The defending army fought bravely to kill the enemy, engaging in extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat and fighting for every inch of ground. As of the morning of the 14th, the positions were still firmly held by the National Army. (Another dispatch) The bandit forces that infiltrated the urban area of Siping engaged in a fierce battle throughout the night of the 12th. Every stronghold was subjected to fierce fighting. Under our dense fire net, the bandits disregarded heavy sacrifices and used their so-called human wave tactics to attack recklessly. Our army fought bravely, and every inch of ground was won at a heavy price. Later, as the city defenses were completely broken through and many strongholds were destroyed by artillery fire, the two sides began close combat on the morning of the 13th, engaging in a heroic hand-to-hand battle, which has now turned into a mixed battle. It is reported that after being repelled from both sides of the Liao River and fleeing back to the Liaobei area, the communist bandits gathered their remnants, totaling more than seven columns, and began attacking Siping on the 3rd of this month. Our army, defending the isolated city, fought loyally and bravely outside the city defenses for eleven days and nights, repeatedly repelling the bandit forces. Later, as the bandits repeatedly reinforced their forces, and on the 12th, they continued to charge with tanks and deployed many anti-aircraft guns around the city to resist our air force, while dozens of their heavy artillery pieces bombarded our urban area. This granary of Northern Liaoning, the urban area of Siping, has suffered a communist bandit artillery barrage for the second time since last summer.

### Song Ziwen Leaves Guilin and Returns to Guangzhou; Declares Determination to Stabilize Currency Value, Ban Gold and Foreign Currency Transactions; Eliminate Communist Bandits and Fully Develop Guangdong and Guangxi

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 14th] Song Ziwen returned to Guangzhou by special plane at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Before leaving, he inspected the military police at the airport. Song was very concerned about financial issues and issued a notice to the public before his departure, firmly stating that he would stabilize the currency value and strictly ban foreign currency and gold transactions.

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 13th] Song Ziwen gave his first speech to the people of Guangdong and Guangxi at the welcoming meeting in Guilin at 8:00 AM on the 13th (the speech was simultaneously telegraphed to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for publication), firmly stating that he would spare no sacrifice in the military and political aspects to eliminate the communist bandits in Guangdong and Guangxi. In terms of the economy, he would fully develop Guangdong and Guangxi. Guangdong and Guangxi are one family, and he hopes that Guangdong and Guangxi will work together. After the meeting, he convened a meeting of the heads of various departments of the provincial government to seek opinions on cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi. The provincial government requested three points from Song: (1) Develop Guangxi's finance; (2) Combine the military forces of Guangdong and Guangxi to jointly suppress the bandit troubles on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi (Guangdong will provide firearms and ammunition); (3) Dredge the West River and extend the Xianggui Road to Sanshui, Guangdong, to connect with the Guangdong Sanshui Road. The cost of this plan is requested to be 180 billion, and Song has agreed to assist as much as possible. The specific plan is currently being drafted by the relevant parties and submitted for approval. Song hosted reporters at 4:00 PM to report on the current situation in the Southwest, stating that the bandit troubles in the Southwest are not worth worrying about. There are currently 7,000 to 8,000 communist bandits in Guangdong, and our team has increased from 15 regiments to 20 regiments. Regarding the bandit troubles on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, he has now consulted with the other side to jointly suppress them. It will not be difficult to eliminate the bandits in the Southwest within this year. In terms of the economy, he plans to develop the economy of the Southwest in a unified manner, with the first priority being the construction of Hainan Island. He plans to use scientific equipment to develop the island's minerals, sugar cane, and fisheries in the same way as the Japanese did. Guangxi is rich in mineral resources, and he plans to fully exploit them to revitalize Guangxi's industry. Regarding the Guangxi Province's request to restore the Wuzhou Customs Office to increase income, he is also considering it.

### America's Futile and Useless China Policy

A Special Article Published by Ms. Annalee Jacoby, author of "The Last Stand of the American in China", in the "San Francisco Examiner" on the 7th of this Month

For months, Republican members of Congress have been advocating active aid to China. Senator Bridges, for example, has said: "If billions of dollars are spent in Europe to stop the spread of Communism, while at the same time our government sits idly by and lets China fall into the hands of the Communists, this would render aid to Europe meaningless."

Now, President Truman has finally recommended $570 million for China.

But this money, donated by American taxpayers, is not intended to stop the Communists, nor is it intended for construction purposes.

According to President Truman's message to Congress, this is for relief. He recommends that almost all of this money should be used to import food, cotton, oil, tobacco, and other commodities from China. A very small amount, $60 million, is allowed for construction, but no military aid is given to China at all.

We can't imagine a better example of "filling a rat hole" than this.

When the urgent need of the Chinese people is "security", what good is it to pour hundreds of millions of dollars of relief into China?

Relief measures may allow a few Chinese people to eke out a living for a few months, but the Chinese Communist forces continue to destroy railways, blow up factories and mines, and drive countless farmers and workers into the territory under the control of the National Government to become refugees, causing more and more people to lose their jobs, become impoverished, and be displaced. We don't know what good this approach can do.

We have to suspect that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, when forced to concede to Congress's demands for aid to China, are still determined not to help the Chinese National Government put down the Communist rebellion instigated and assisted by Moscow.

The proposed $570 million in aid to China looks almost like a bribe to Congress, to ensure the passage of the European Recovery Program, which seems to be of paramount importance to the government.

It is, of course, obvious that it is futile to help Europe recover without at the same time ensuring the defense against Soviet aggression. But, at least in the case of Greece, in addition to relief, arms and military guidance are also provided.

On February 16, two days before President Truman expressed his views on China, he requested more money for military aid to Greece. He said: "Greece is under increasing pressure from a Communist minority party, which is subservient to foreign forces and receives its support, and is trying to impose its will on the Greek people by force."

Every word of this statement applies equally to China.

President Truman also said that the Communists are "deliberately destroying Greek villages,肆無忌憚," determined to use "ruthless destruction" to "make people homeless, leave their villages and fields, and force them to crowd into cities, further increasing the already heavy burden of the country, deliberately creating miserable and difficult conditions, hoping to use this to incite political unrest." This statement also applies equally to China.

Then why is the government adopting opposite policies in Greece and China?

Why did General Marshall, when he took office as Secretary of State in 1947, give $400 million to the Greeks to stop the Communists, but not a similar amount to China to wait for the Communists to penetrate deeper?

Why, after we gained this experience in Europe, did General Marshall, on January 7, 1947, still classify the Chinese who "frankly declared that cooperation with the Chinese Communists in the government was inconceivable and that only a policy of force could solve the problem" as "reactionaries"?

Has General Marshall's experience in dealing with the Soviet Union as Secretary of State led him to know that the Chinese were right?

If so, then why doesn't he retract his statement?

It is now hard to believe that anyone, even the State Department's Far East Division, still thinks that the Chinese Communists are different from the Communists in Greece and other countries, and are not "real" Communists, but a group of harmless, liberal rural reformers!

This secret has been revealed by the Chinese Communists themselves, because they are daily scolding "American imperialism", restoring the old policy of "liquidating" landlords and all peasants who resist them (this policy was abandoned during the War of Resistance Against Japan), burning churches and announcing their 100% adherence to Moscow.

Now, is the State Department refusing to admit it just for "face"?

Are the Secretary of State and President Truman unwilling to admit how wrong and harmful the policy of sending General Marshall to China and forcing the Chinese government to share power with the Communists was?

### Division of Loan Business Between Farmers Bank of China and Cooperative Treasury

Agricultural Bank to Hold Business Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Regarding the division of loan business between the Farmers Bank of China and the Cooperative Treasury, a preliminary agreement has been reached after consultation between the two parties.

### Watching the Cold War with a Cool Eye - The Opening of the Sixteen-Nation European Conference

The political and diplomatic figures of the sixteen European nations have already gathered in Paris and are scheduled to hold a conference today to discuss the European Recovery Program. At the same time, the treaty of the Western European Union agreed upon at the Five-Nation Conference in Brussels will also be signed by the five foreign ministers. In today's increasingly clear polarization of Europe, the diplomatic dynamics of the Western European countries naturally deserve our special attention. In particular, the success or failure of this Sixteen-Nation Conference will not only determine the future fate of the sixteen participating countries, but also the European aid plan of Secretary of State Marshall will depend on the outcome of this conference.

As this article meets the readers, it is just a moment before the opening of the Sixteen-Nation Conference. How will this Sixteen-Nation Conference end? Of course, we cannot draw any conclusions lightly. However, looking around the environment of Europe, it is not only that the barriers are strict, and the iron curtain and velvet curtain have divided Europe into East and West, but also there have been a series of shocking developments recently, which have made people feel "shocked several times in one night." Even the American political and diplomatic figures standing on the other side of the Atlantic are frightened. For example, President Truman frankly stated that his confidence in world peace has begun to waver in response to the recent developments in Europe. Secretary of State Marshall also said that the world is now in a great crisis. Former Secretary of State Byrne shouted loudly, claiming that the world crisis is coming. From these short talks, we can really see the severity of the European crisis.

Since the successive surrender of Germany and Japan, the end of the war has only been two years and six months. After the war, the world was looking forward to the ideal of "all people are one family" and hoped that the great powers would create world peace after the war in the spirit of fighting side by side during the war. However, in the past two years, not only has the ideal failed to become a reality, and true peace has not been achieved, but also the "cold war" between the two major groups has intensified. As of today, even this silent and odorless "cold war" has the danger of evolving into a bloody "hot war." We do not want to blame one side for the creation of this situation, but if we just look back at the international politics of the past two years, it is not difficult to understand where the responsibility lies.

Strictly speaking, the United States and the Soviet Union represent two fundamentally different ideologies, coupled with conflicts of interest everywhere. Hoping that they will work together to create world peace is originally an unrealistic fantasy. However, the world has suffered from the cruel lessons of the war, and ultimately hopes that they can coexist and coexist in peace. Unfortunately, this minimum hope was completely shattered in the late spring of last year. From that time on, both sides openly engaged in a "cold war" and did their best. Standing in the position of a third party, we watched both sides use their "magic weapons", which became more and more amazing, and are now approaching the stage of "the dagger is revealed at the end of the scroll."

We do not deny that the United States took the offensive first in the early stages of this "cold war". For example, the advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the announcement of the Marshall Plan can all be regarded as the prelude to the United States' anti-communism. However, because the United States is a democratic country, whether it is domestic or foreign policy measures, they must be discussed by Congress and supported by public opinion. Therefore, the United States is inevitably slow in action, and it is not surprising that its words and deeds are not thorough. Therefore, the United States is lagging behind in the cold war against the Soviet Union. We summarize the measures taken by the United States as follows: (1) Advocating the anti-communist Truman Doctrine; (2) Implementing the Marshall Plan; (3) Merging the three occupied areas of West Germany; (4) Forming the Western European Union. The above four steps all have profound significance in theory, but in practice it is difficult to exert their role. Especially the first two, have not yet been concretized.

On the contrary, look at the magic weapons used by the other side, not only are they quick to act, able to make decisive decisions, and do what they say; but also, in response to the magic weapons used by the other side, there is a situation of "the Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high". The performance of each action is shocking. Among them, the most noteworthy ones are the following: (1) Organizing the New Communist International, using anti-imperialism and anti-Americanism as slogans, to prevent the implementation of American aid; (2) Concluding military mutual assistance treaties with Romania and Hungary; (3) Encouraging the Czech coup and establishing a communist regime, so that the heart of Europe is also controlled by the Soviet Union; (4) Forcing Finland to conclude a military mutual assistance treaty with it. Finland, forced by the general trend, can only follow the Soviet Union's orders. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's iron curtain in Eastern Europe is not only deeply rooted, but also its power is becoming more and more consolidated and unbreakable. It makes everyone feel that the Soviet Union is taking the lead in the cold war and is becoming more and more aggressive.

Some say that the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe will cause a serious backlash from the United States, and the United States will inevitably intensify its European aid plan and encourage Western European countries to form an alliance in order to resist it; but in the current situation, the conclusion of the Western European Union and the holding of this Sixteen-Nation Conference will not only be insufficient to resist the Soviet Union's actions in Eastern Europe, but will also be enough to promote the Soviet Union to take new actions against Sweden and Norway in Northern Europe and Greece and Turkey in Eastern Europe. In the past few days, rumors have spread throughout Europe, either saying that the Soviet Union will take action to threaten the four countries of Greece, Turkey, France, and Italy, or that the Soviet Union has asked Norway to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Although it can be said that rumors are not credible at present, who can guarantee that these rumors will not become a reality?

We want to formally tell people all over the world that they should immediately raise their vigilance about the current world situation. We do not want to be alarmist, but the facts have proved that the seriousness of the situation cannot be ignored, especially do not forget that the current situation is more serious than after the Munich Conference in 1938. At that time, the aggressor, Nazi Germany, could only control Austria and part of Czechoslovakia, while Eastern European countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia all had mutual assistance treaties with Britain and France, not to mention that there was a "third party" force further east. But today, in addition to owning nine Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union also has part of Germany and Austria. Regardless of human and material resources and geographical location, the Soviet Union in today's Europe is as solid as a rock and cannot be helped. How can the five Western European countries' alliance prevent it from continuing to develop westward! When general historians discuss the causes of the outbreak of World War II, they all attribute it to the democratic countries' policy of appeasement towards the aggressors. This mistake has been remedied, but it has been paid for with countless blood. We must not repeat the mistakes in history in the future. We hope that the US authorities, which bear heavy responsibility for world peace, will take effective measures as soon as possible to save the world's tide before it falls! As the political and diplomatic figures of the sixteen European countries gather in Paris, the United States and the public should first conduct self-examination on the current diplomatic policy and quickly determine a plan to reverse the international trend.

### Supplementary Measures for Production Enterprise Loans Implemented

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] The Four Joint Offices have always attached importance to loans for export goods in order to assist exports and earn foreign exchange, and they are still included in the guidelines for production enterprise loans this year. The 360th meeting of the Board of Directors of the Office has now approved the "Outline for Fixed-Amount Foreign Exchange Settlement Loans for Export Goods" (already seen on page 7 of this newspaper on the 13th). In addition, it has been learned that the Office has continued to add four supplementary measures to the implementation of the guidelines for production enterprise loans for the 37th year, which are listed as follows:

A. Regarding order loans, purchase of finished products, and commissioned production, the following should be followed: (1) Order loans, purchase of finished products, and commissioned production will be jointly or separately organized by various banks and treasuries entrusted by the Central Bank on behalf of the government within their professional scope. (2) The scope of orders and purchases is temporarily limited to the items stipulated in the Provisional Measures for National Banks and Treasuries in the Shanghai area to purchase finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government. Other local specialties that meet the conditions for orders or purchases should be reported to the Four Joint Offices for approval before being processed. The items for commissioned production are limited to those specifically designated by the government. (3) The funds required for handling the foregoing business will be fully advanced by the Central Bank. (4) Unless otherwise approved by the Four Joint Offices, interest will not be charged on any payments for handling the foregoing business. (5) The goods received for handling the foregoing business will be inspected and accepted by the Central Bank in conjunction with the handling banks and treasuries, and then handled by the government competent authority or entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. The proceeds will be transferred to the Central Bank at any time to recover the advance payment account. (6) The Central Bank will give the handling banks and treasuries a handling fee of 2% to 3% of the value of the goods.

B. Regarding the short-term working capital loan part, the types, terms, and applicable scope are specified as follows: (1) The maximum term for short-term overdrafts is three months, which is only applicable to transportation and public utility enterprises. However, basic industrial and mining enterprises and export goods enterprises may also be given short-term overdrafts if specifically stipulated by the Four Joint Board of Directors. (2) The term of the export bill loan depends on the distance of transportation and is only applicable to the transportation and sales of daily necessities for people's livelihood and export goods enterprises. (3) The term of the packing loan is up to 60 feet, which is only applicable to Sichuan goods enterprises that can settle foreign exchange in accordance with government regulations.

C. Calculation of loan interest rates: (1) The following loans that fully cooperate with national policy are still handled in accordance with the low-interest principle, and the interest rate standard is approved by the Four Joint Board of Directors: Yan industry production loans and cooperative production loans. (2) Production enterprise loans whose production, sales, or pricing are strictly controlled by the government. (3) Other loans related to the implementation of national policies submitted by the Chairman and Vice Chairman for special discussion. (4) The loan interest rate of banks and treasuries shall not exceed the local Central Bank's listed market interest rate, and shall not be less than 75% of the above listed market interest rate.

D. The loan funds of banks and treasuries should first be used to pay for the deposits received, and the deposit interest rate should be calculated on a monthly basis and adjusted in accordance with the loan interest rate. The local Four Joint Branch Offices should discuss and standardize the handling.

### It is Incorrect to Say that Business Tax is Assessed Once a Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] According to the Ministry of Finance: According to the Business Tax Law, business tax is assessed once every three months. The Implementing Rules of the Business Tax Law stipulate that merchants should declare and assess business tax for the past three months within ten days after March, June, September, and December each year. This year, on February 14th, this was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to amend the Implementing Rules, stipulating that merchants should declare the business volume of the previous month within five days after each month, and pay taxes in the order of declared business volume, but the tax will still be verified and assessed fifteen days after March, June, September, and December each year. If the taxable amount is inconsistent with the amount already paid after verification, the tax will be supplemented. This amendment is still in compliance with the provision that business tax is assessed once every three months. The rumor that checking and assessing once every three months has been changed to "once a month" is somewhat different from the fact.

Including European and Non-European Countries

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake Dispatch on the 13th] The Executive Committee of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund has decided to expand the proposed medical program to include all European and non-European countries.

### Various Industries in Guangzhou are in a State of Semi-Stagnation

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 14th] The Guangdong Construction Department previously organized an industrial investigation team to investigate the industrial situation in Guangzhou.

Most of the larger factories have been unable to support themselves and have closed down one after another. Even those who are struggling to maintain are in a dangerous situation. Only handicrafts can barely survive for a while, but they are also dying. The reasons are: (1) Insufficient funds, (2) Lack of raw materials, (3) Severe financial fluctuations, (4) Sales channels cannot be developed, (5) Foreign goods are flooding the market.

### US Aid to European Recovery Program Passes Senate, Moves to House

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US Senate passed the European Recovery Program with an overwhelming majority on the 13th to support Western Europe and prevent communism and chaos. The largest peacetime foreign economic program in American history completed its first legislative procedure with a vote of 69 to 17 in a special Senate meeting late on the 13th. The bill has now been sent to the House of Representatives and is expected to pass in early April. The bill authorizes the government to provide 5.3 billion dollars worth of goods and money to sixteen Western European countries, and the total amount of money will be allocated at a later date. The Senate's passage of the bill came after warnings from Secretary of State Marshall and President Truman that the new pressure of communism in Europe has worsened the international situation. It is reported that the administration is considering a new military preparedness plan in the hope of curbing the progress of communism in Europe. The European Recovery Program has been opposed by the International Communist Information Bureau, which has announced its intention to obstruct it. The Senate's passage of the bill was a victory for Senate Chairman Vandenberg. With strong bipartisan support, Vandenberg led lawmakers in defeating the proposals of more than 30 Republican "revisionists" to reduce and rewrite the entire plan. Vandenberg said that some Western European countries are still outside the Iron Curtain and that the European aid plan is the US's fulfillment of its promise to continue to support their democratic institutions and promote economic recovery. The European aid bill passed late on the 13th is essentially the same as the original bill submitted by Truman to Congress. An independent administrator will preside over the plan, and Congress will set up a "supervisory committee" to review its progress. The US will also appoint an "ambassador-at-large" to liaise with the participating countries.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The historically groundbreaking 5.3 billion dollar European aid bill was passed by the Senate yesterday. The bill stipulates that relief matters for the first year must be implemented starting from the first day of next month. The House of Representatives is also expected to pass it, but there is a tendency to reduce funding and discuss it in conjunction with the economic aid to China plan. After the two houses of Congress pass the bill, an actual appropriation bill will still need to be submitted. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to handle foreign aid matters in one case. The content of the case is divided into two parts: economic aid and military aid. Economic aid is targeted at the sixteen countries of Western Europe and China, and military aid is targeted at China, Greece, and Turkey. How to adjust it with what the Senate has passed is quite troublesome.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US Senate last night rejected, in a voice vote, a Marshall Plan amendment for a Western Allied military alliance against the Soviet Union. The amendment was proposed by Republican Senator Bower, who called for an "immediate" showdown with the Soviet Union, otherwise the European Recovery Program would only lead to "failure, bankruptcy, and war."

### White House Holds Secret Meeting to Plan New Military Strategy: Using Force as a Backing to Stop Soviet Aggression

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US administration is actively considering a new military preparedness plan to make the Soviet Union understand that further aggression will endanger itself. Officials said that the plan is being studied by President Truman and the cabinet. They feel that the US has the possibility of promulgating a tough foreign policy, which will state that future communist aggression will be regarded as a threat to international peace and Italian security. If the two-pronged motion currently under discussion is approved, it will be implemented to prevent a possible communist coup in Italy. The US will assure Western European countries that the US intends to support them militarily and economically under the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The US Joint Chiefs of Staff held a secret meeting with Secretary of Defense Forrestal at the Naval Air Station in Key West, Florida, 1,200 miles from Washington, D.C., over the weekend. The location is where President Truman is vacationing, hence the name "Little White House." The US military leaders discussed the tasks of the army, navy, and air force in future wars. It is generally believed that although this meeting is unrelated to recent developments in Europe, the tension in the international situation has prompted Congress to intensify its criticism of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's failure to formulate a joint combat plan for the three services. The results of the Key West meeting can eliminate the differences between military leaders on the tasks assigned to each combat unit in the strategic plan and produce a plan with full flexibility. It is reported that the most important difficulty is the conflict between the navy and the air force on the issue of long-range operations. The air force believes that long-range reconnaissance and bombing are the tasks of the air force, so the funds allocated to the navy for this purpose should be allocated to the air force. The navy believes that the air force's task is only to protect American skies, and that the airplanes of naval aircraft carriers should be responsible for attacks outside the country in the initial stages of any future war. Furthermore, opinions on national defense are not consistent in the political sphere. President Truman is once again asking Congress to approve a universal military training system so that the army and navy will have a large number of reservists, while Senator Taft argues that the US's defense should be built on an exceptionally powerful air force, and that the number of navies and infantry may be reduced.

### Outline of the European Recovery Program

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The outline of the European Recovery Program passed by the US Senate is as follows:

"Purpose": To rebuild the economic stability of the sixteen countries of Western Europe and West Germany, increase trade between Western Europe and the Americas, and eventually restore commercial relations between the industrial countries of Western Europe and the agricultural countries of Eastern Europe.

"Method": The United States should provide goods and assistance to countries that are making unremitting efforts to recover. Within four years and three months, the United States will supply the main items urgently needed for economic construction. Since Europe is unable to repay in gold, the United States will immediately lend some and provide long-term loans.

"History": On June 5, 1947, US Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech at Harvard University, initially proposing this plan. One month later, representatives of sixteen European countries gathered in Paris to draft a balance sheet of recovery needs and guarantee cooperation.

"Administration": The Recovery Administration will be established by one independent official, who will hold a cabinet position and preside over the plan. One ambassador-at-large will maintain contact with participating countries. Congress will set up a "supervisory" committee to inspect the progress of the plan. "US Funding Period": The case recommends establishing a 51-month plan. If European countries cannot fulfill their promises, or if the situation in Europe changes, making it unnecessary to continue the plan, Congress or the President may cancel the plan. The total cost for the first year is 5.3 billion yuan, but the detailed funds must be allocated by Congress, because the estimated total of 51 is as high as 17 billion yuan.

"European Guarantee": Recipient countries should reveal the "national goals" of rebuilding the economy and production, guarantee efforts to balance currency, reduce trade barriers, and cooperate to maximize production.

### French Miners Strike on Eve of Sixteen-Nation Conference

Reportedly Manipulated by the French Communist Party

[United Press, Paris, 13th] As the Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference is scheduled to be held here on the 15th, the French Communist Party-controlled General Confederation of Labor threatened to strike or issued strike threats on the night of the 13th, striking a blow at the French economy. 30,000 miners in the northern French coal mining area, which is known as a "communist hotbed", have already gone on strike. Officials fear that the coal mine strike will extend to the metal industry, but the union representatives of 18,000 striking workers voted to end the strike and return to work on Monday. At the union meeting on the 13th, this group of representatives will advise them to resume work. Minister of Commerce and Industry Lacoste said that the strike was "purely political". Hotels in Paris are also threatening to stop work. The strike is taking place just as the delegates of the sixteen countries are gathering in large numbers to hold talks. The future of Western Europe may be greatly affected by these talks.

### French Official Denies Annexing Kiel City

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman today denied that France had annexed the city of Kiel in the French-occupied zone of Germany, but admitted that the city was almost entirely inhabited by French families from Strasbourg who had crossed the Rhine River.

### Pignon Arrives in Haiphong, Bao Dai Arrives in Hong Kong

The Two Will Meet in Da Lat Bay

[French News Agency, Hanoi, 14th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam Pignon arrived in Haiphong on the French warship La Grandière. French senior civil and military officials went to welcome him as the ship approached the port of Haiphong. After holding a short military meeting with several senior army and navy generals, Pignon inspected the city of Haiphong. Pignon will go to Da Lat Bay on the 14th, where the French cruiser Duguay-Trouin is anchored. The warship is the place chosen by Pignon to meet with the Vietnamese ex-king Bao Dai. It is expected that the Vietnamese ex-king Bao Dai will arrive in Hanoi on the 17th of this month.

[French News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] Vietnamese ex-king Bao Dai, along with his cousin and secretary, arrived in Hong Kong on the 14th. Those who went to welcome him included the former Vietnamese Prime Minister and representatives of the people of Tonkin and Cochinchina.

### Second Conference of Sixteen Western European Nations Opens in Paris Today

British Foreign Secretary as Chairman to Deliver Important Speech

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] When the first conference of the sixteen Marshall Plan countries opens here on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, as chairman, will deliver a major policy statement. The countries of the continent are waiting with great concern for Bevin's speech, and they are very keen to know whether the future of the British economy will be closely linked to the continent. Diplomatic circles believe that the main issue on the agenda of this conference is the issue of making West Germany participate in the Western European economic plan. This proposal is the result of consultations between Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on the German issue in London and the five-nation conference in Beijing, and will be approved by this sixteen-nation conference.

It is also learned that the French delegation, after seeking the consent of the British delegation, will propose defining the permanent institutions of the sixteen countries that handle aid under the Marshall Plan. It is reported that the French proposal intends to make the permanent institutions formulate annual comprehensive economic plans for the sixteen countries based on the plans of each of the sixteen countries, with reference to the achievements of the sixteen countries in self-help in the past year and the US aid they will receive in the future. According to related sources, the Portuguese delegation will move at this conference to make Spain participate in the European Recovery Program.

### Establishing a Permanent Organization for Genuine Economic Cooperation

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The Western European Sixteen-Nation Conference will have as one of its most important tasks the appointment of inspectors under a permanent economic cooperation organization. The task of these inspectors is to investigate the use of aid materials by recipient countries, submit periodic reports to Washington, and ascertain that aid materials have appropriate sources and destinations. The first two or three days of the Paris Conference will be devoted to general discussions, after which participating experts will begin to study: (1) the organization of a permanent cooperation agency representing the sixteen nations; (2) the achievements of each participating country regarding short-term and long-term assistance since last July. British and French delegations have contacted the capitals of the other fourteen countries and have reached a preliminary agreement on the aforementioned two points, so it is expected that this conference will make smooth progress. However, some difficulties are expected regarding the appointment of inspectors, with some countries, such as Switzerland, opposing the right of foreign inspectors to enter their territory to exercise inspection and control powers. The idea of ​​US officials supervising the transportation and use of European aid materials has apparently been abandoned, and Western European politicians have expressed their approval of this US attitude. Regarding the report on the progress of the sixteen-nation self-help plan since last July, the secretariat of the European Economic Cooperation Committee established by the first conference last year has drafted a report, which is only awaiting review by this conference. Discussion of the consequences of the Anglo-French-Dutch-Belgian-Luxembourg fifty-year alliance treaty is not on the agenda of this conference. However, the establishment of the five-nation treaty will definitely make a significant and useful contribution to strengthening the unity of the sixteen nations.

### Austria's Anti-Communism Is Relentless and Determined Not to Follow in Czechoslovakia's Footsteps

[Reuters, Vienna, 13th] Austrian Prime Minister Figl delivered a powerful speech here today, emphasizing that Austria is determined not to follow in Czechoslovakia's footsteps. He said that the development of Czechoslovakia is a serious warning to Austria. However, the Communist Party in Austria is only a "dwarf" party, not involved in the government or other administrative institutions, and trade union organizations have been quite stable in the past week. One side has repeatedly accused the Austrian government of selling out Austria to the West by participating in the Marshall Plan. It must be understood that Austria's situation is like that of children after their parents' divorce, with one side beating them and the other willing to take them in. Of course, Austria can only turn to the side that is willing to take them in.

### The "Renoir Explorer" Plane Arrives in Los Angeles

Returning to China for Work After Repairs

[Central News Agency, Los Angeles, 13th, Associated Press] The "Renoir Explorer" plane, which was sent to the United States for repairs, arrived here today from Honolulu, piloted by Captain Odom. This world-renowned aviator said that although the "Explorer" experienced an engine oil leak en route, he had no difficulties during the long night flight. The only inconvenience was that we could not smoke for thirteen hours. The cause of the oil leak was that ground crew in the East mistakenly added 145-octane gasoline to the aircraft's fuel tank, while the aircraft usually uses 100-octane gasoline. Odom said that while the plane is being repaired, he will fly another plane to New York to visit his family. Then, he will fly the "Explorer" back to China to work for the scientific expedition led by Renoir.

### Soviet Military Philosophy Has Been Thoroughly Reformed

The Military Is Entirely Controlled by the Politburo

[United Press, New York, 13th] Lei, former Director of the Soviet Economic Division of the US Department of the Army, wrote in the current issue of "United Nations World" magazine: "Soviet military philosophy was thoroughly reformed a year ago. The new military theory regards the military as a tool of persuasion as part of an overall ideological war strategy. General Zhukov, the hero who defended Moscow and Leningrad, was dismissed for holding different ideas and offending the 'political generals' Voroshilov and Zhdanov. There is fierce infighting between the Communist Party and Red Army generals. The military advocates the separation of the military from the Party, and that the military structure should be established along traditional military lines, focusing on land warfare and concentrating on the defense of the Soviet homeland. The leader of this theory, Zhukov, has the support of a small number of professional soldiers, including Air Force General Novikov. The opposition believes that the military is a revolutionary political tool. This faction is headed by the current Minister of Military Affairs, Bulganin, and supported by Generals Rokossovsky and Konev. The dispute between the two factions was resolved by Stalin, who replaced Zhukov and other senior generals. The mission of the Soviet army was completely revised according to the path indicated by Stalin. Stalin said that the Red Army has three major characteristics: first, it is a tool for liberating peasants and workers from the shackles of landlords and capitalists; second, it is a common army of the people of the Soviet Union; and third, it has an international character, it is an army of world revolution, an army of workers in all countries. The practical strategic result of this doctrine is the alternating use of politics and war. This war is not directed by any military organization, but by the Politburo of the highest political organ. The Soviet Union does not hope for an actual war at any time now or in the future, because the outbreak of actual war proves the complete failure of the Soviet Union's political war."

### Britain Implements Summer Time

[United Press, London, 13th] Britain has decided to implement summer time from the 14th, setting the clocks forward one hour at 2:00 am standard time (10:00 am Shanghai time) until the end of October.

### US Government Decides to Abandon Dismantling Japanese Zaibatsu Economy, Believing Past Plans Were Too Drastic

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Well-informed sources told the Associated Press that the State Department and the military have decided to abandon the plan to dismantle Japan's economic monopoly. These sources emphasized that this does not mean that the United States has abandoned the dismantling of Japan's "excessive economic concentration" such as the Zaibatsu groups, but that the United States believes that the original plan was too drastic.

### Five Hundred Yugoslavs Join Arab Army to Fight

[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] During the discussion of the Palestine issue by the United States, the Soviet Union, France and China, it was learned that 500 Yugoslav Muslims had departed from the south for Palestine to join the Arab forces. According to Rome Radio, 77 Albanians, 20 Yugoslavs, and 21 Croats have arrived in Beirut via Italy to join the Arab army.

### Soviet Union Instills Communist Ideas in Japanese Prisoners of War

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] According to Nishimura Tadashi, a former Mainichi Shimbun reporter who resided in a Siberian prisoner-of-war camp for more than two years, more than one million Japanese prisoners of war were transported to the Soviet Union after Japan's surrender, and most of them were engaged in labor and technical work. Nishimura recently wrote an article in New Star magazine, analyzing the political education of Japanese prisoners of war, stating that the Soviet Union believes that these more than one million young Japanese people are a major contribution to its Fourth Five-Year Plan. Nishimura explained in detail the Soviet Union's education work for Japanese prisoners of war, saying that all ideological education is based on the motivation of increasing production. In 1946, it also launched the "Elite Force" and "Youth Action" movements to promote labor efficiency. In addition, it launched the "Democratization Movement" to increase the prisoners of war's willingness to work. The Soviet authorities' movement to win over communist believers mainly targeted young people in their twenties. Older people are more likely to accept the disguise of communism and strip it off after returning to their home countries. Young people find it difficult to accept communism, but it is also not easy to forget. Some young people have deeply believed in communism.

### US Helps Turkey Strengthen Air Force, Soviet Union Will Adopt Deceptive Policies Towards Turkey

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 13th] Hogg, the leader of the Air Force Group of the US Military Delegation to Turkey, arrived here today, accompanied by 30 US Air Force experts. The first batch of American aircraft supplied to Turkey under the Truman Doctrine will arrive in Turkey from western Germany within 48 hours. After the above-mentioned aircraft arrive, US pilots will conduct test flights over Turkey and then transfer them to Turkish pilots.

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 13th] Krakowski, the recently retired Czech envoy to Turkey, told reporters that after Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union's first target is not Finland but Turkey. The new Soviet ambassador will arrive here soon, and his mission is to prepare for this work. According to Krakowski, the new ambassador will adopt deceptive policies to achieve his economic aggression goals.

### Indo-Dutch Talks End, Reportedly Without Results, Hatta Flies Back to Yogyakarta from Batavia

Hatta will fly back to Yogyakarta on the 14th to discuss with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Provisional Parliament. After meeting with Van Mook today, Hatta also met with the British Consul General in Batavia, Sun Puxi, and the Indian Consul in Batavia, Raghavan, respectively. It is reported that the Indonesian Republic is eager for a solution to the Indo-Dutch dispute so that Indonesia's export trade can be restored. The negotiations between Hatta and Van Mook concerned the Indonesian Republic's participation in the Indonesian Provisional Federal Government to prepare for the organization of the United States of Indonesia. The topics discussed included the Provisional Federal Government's foreign relations, military cooperation, food distribution, currency unification, customs control, and foreign exchange. The Dutch side did not express any opinions on this meeting.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] It was announced here that the Czech government has ordered the removal of Barbuněk from his post as the country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Barbuněk had complained to the United Nations a few days ago that the Soviet Union used force to overthrow the Czech government. Chile supported Barbuněk yesterday and formally requested the Security Council to investigate the Czech situation. Barbuněk himself said that he would ignore the matter, saying that he could not recognize the legitimacy of the current Czech government and that he would continue to fight for the freedom of his motherland.

[Associated Press, Prague, 14th] Prague Radio broadcast a statement condemning Chile's request for the United Nations Security Council to investigate the Czech coup. The statement said, "Chile's fascists severed relations with Czechoslovakia for no reason last year. If Chile requests an investigation into the Czech political situation, this is an arrogant provocation."

### The Spring Crisis Is Imminent, the US and the Soviet Union Have Approached a "Showdown," and the US Attention Will Focus on the Situation in Italy

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The expansion of Soviet communism and the unity of Western countries may result in a showdown this spring, which is a matter of deep concern for the United States and other countries overseas. The United States has been committed to curbing the spread of aggressive communism since the promulgation of the Truman Doctrine, and is now in the most urgent international crisis since World War II. A final showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union is almost inevitable in the near future. On March 12th of last year, President Truman announced to Congress that US policy must support free nations that resist armed minorities or external pressure to conquer them, and requested assistance to Greece and Turkey. This implicitly demanded that the Soviet Union stop in the Middle East. The Congress then passed a bill to aid Turkey with 400 million US dollars to resist the direct pressure from the Soviet Union, and to support Greece against the internal aggression of the Communist Party. However, the effect of this doctrine has a greater impact on other countries. The direct result was the conflict at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow to discuss the treaty with Germany. France suddenly changed its course, gradually leaning towards Western countries, and expressing that it was no longer afraid of the Soviet Union. The entire Europe reacted, and the United States finally decided not to make empty speeches about political freedom against Soviet threats, but to be realistic. US officials hoped that the declaration of the Truman Doctrine, coupled with hundreds of millions of US dollars, would stop the Soviet Union, but its policy of assisting Greece and Turkey was not successful. Today, Marshall has asked Congress to allocate an additional 275 million US dollars to extend military assistance to Greece and Turkey for one year, and there may be other requests in the future. Last June, the economic collapse of Western European countries alarmed the US government. Marshall promised to provide assistance to European countries that cooperate and help themselves, which gave rise to the so-called Marshall Plan, as an economic barrier to prevent communism from spreading in chaos. Now, the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have established an agreement and will inevitably ask the United States to provide military guarantees. The Communist Party's conquest of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union's demands on Finland have clearly come to an end. The entire phenomenon of the Soviet Union's post-war policy, whether direct or indirect, has actually been completed. The question is whether US officials are bothered, and what will happen next? The Soviet Union's current actions will inevitably involve the countries to which the Truman Doctrine applies. The general public is deeply afraid that the expansion of Soviet communism will have a showdown with Western countries this spring, and this is the reason. The focus of attention in the entire United States is now on Italy. April 18th is the date of its general election, and the United States will do its best to reduce the number of votes won by the Communist Party, so that it cannot rise to power. Whether the methods used by the US government will be successful and whether the Communist Party will resort to force are all questions. The imminent crisis of spring is evident from this.

### The Conscription Lottery Committee Was Established Yesterday and Decided to Hold the Conscription Lottery on the 23rd

Those Found to Have Committed Fraud in the Transfer of Draftees Will Not Be Tolerated

[Reported by this newspaper] The Conscription Association Lottery Committee held its inaugural meeting at the City Council at 10:45 yesterday morning. The attending members were Lu Yin-chu, Tong Xing-bai, Zhao Jun-hao, Zhou Xue-xiang, Chen Bao-hua, Hou Jun-ren, Zhao Yang-xiong, and the district chiefs of each district and the chairmen of the district people's representatives, a total of 41 people. Zhang Xiao-song, Lei Ke-nan, Tan Yi-min, and Yao Wen-ying also attended. Director Pan Gong-zhan presided over the meeting, announced the establishment of the committee, and reported on several points: (1) Last year, 3,000 conscripts were recruited, but 57 were still missing, failing to meet the quota. This year, they should be made up; (2) The methods of voluntary conscription and lottery will be adopted, and the two will be combined. Voluntary conscripts can offset the conscription quota; (3) According to orders, conscription will begin on April 1 and be completed by the end of June. All lottery work must be completed before the end of this month; (4) An indirect lottery method will be adopted (see page 4 of this newspaper on March 2). The Conscription Lottery Committee bears a heavy responsibility entrusted by current active and draft-age men. It is hoped that all lottery committee members will be on time to assist and supervise the lottery work on the day of the lottery implementation. Then, Zhang Xiao-song, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, stating: This city is implementing lottery conscription for the first time this year, and we have widely hired the heads of legal entities, schools, and district heads and chairmen of district people's representatives as lottery committee members, proceeding with caution. At the same time, because the implementation of lottery conscription involves as many as 170,000 draftees, we will definitely be frank and fair in promoting military administration. Mr. Zhang then announced that a certain district and a certain bao in this city, during the conscription process, under the circumstances where draft-age men were prohibited from applying for relocation, had approved the relocation of draftees without going through the application procedures, which was suspected of fraud. A staff member has been sent to investigate thoroughly. If it is found that there is indeed fraud, it will be sent to the court for the crime of undermining military administration. He solemnly announced here that these criminals will never be tolerated. Finally, Yao Wen-ying, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau, explained the indirect lottery method in detail and demonstrated the lottery in public. After discussion, it was decided to hold the lottery at the City Council at 2:00 pm on the 23rd. In order for all sectors to have a clear understanding of the significance of this conscription and the lottery method, a military service propaganda conference will be held at the Empress Grand Theater at 9:00 am on the day before the lottery (i.e., the 22nd). Finally, various attendees raised a number of military administration issues, all of which were answered by Director Zhang one by one, and the meeting adjourned at noon.

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to request the removal of the oil depot in Donggou Town, residents of Gaoqiao District in this city have once again submitted a document to the City Government and relevant agencies, the general meaning of which is: The oil depot is extremely dangerous and should not be located in the densely populated Donggou Town. In the event of carelessness, or if the oil depot explodes due to war, the lives and property of the people of Pudong will be reduced to ashes. During the period of the Republic of China in the 17th year, Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, in view of this, convened leaders from all walks of life, and after more than a dozen meetings, it was resolved to move the Shan Pond to the Laoshu Sand at the mouth of the Huangpu River. After the victory, the competent authorities not only did not implement the ban, but the Land Administration Bureau and the Public Works Bureau tacitly allowed Sino-American Shan merchants to build new oil ponds on a large scale, causing the people of Pudong to be uneasy about eating and sleeping.

### China Textile Promotes Planting, Wu Weijing Left for Hangzhou Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, went to Hangzhou with Mr. Hu Jing-liang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Cotton Production Improvement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, at 8:00 am on the 14th to promote flax planting in Zhejiang Province. Mr. Wu told reporters before leaving: Most of the yellow flax promoted in Zhejiang Province is concentrated in Hangzhou, Haining, and Xiaoshan. This year, due to the high price of flax, flax farmers are very interested in planting flax. China Textile specifically purchased more than 260 dan of good yellow flax seeds in Taiwan at the beginning of this year, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai within one or two days and then be transported to Hangzhou for sowing. Including the flax seeds harvested last year, it is estimated that 100,000 mu of yellow flax can be promoted in Zhejiang Province this year, and it is estimated that 500,000 dan of yellow flax can be harvested, which is more than double that of last year. He also carried 1,500 tons of phosphorus and ammonium fertilizer on this trip. In each flax planting area, it is planned to first register the flax farmers, and then handle the procedures for receiving seeds and distributing fertilizer, so as to promote the process in an organized and systematic manner, so that the flax species in Zhejiang Province can gradually tend to be improved.

### Conflict Occurred While Buying Tickets: Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company, Qingpu Station Completely Destroyed, Two People Beaten and Injured, Seven Culprits Detained, County Magistrate Liu Expresses Regret and Resolves to Punish Impartially

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning, Qingpu Station of the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company was suddenly attacked by seventy or eighty Qingpu County government employees, who completely destroyed the offices and parked buses within the station. Two people were beaten and injured. A reporter, traveling to Qingpu on one of the company's buses, obtained the following account: Some Qingpu County government employees had previously planned to organize a Qinghu automotive freight company. However, the Qinghu Long-Distance Bus Company did not agree at the time, citing its exclusive franchise on the Qinghu highway. Later, in order to avoid confusion when county government employees received preferential fares, the company required identification and the recording of passengers' names when purchasing tickets. County government employees considered this procedure overly troublesome and insulting, harboring resentment. Unexpectedly, at 9:25 AM yesterday, seventy or eighty employees from the County Government's Tax Bureau, Land Grain Bureau, Judicial Bureau, and Military Affairs Section attempted to take a bus to Shanghai. A conflict arose with station staff while buying tickets, which escalated into violence. Order collapsed, and all station staff fled and hid. As a result, the waiting room, ticket office, stationmaster's office, kitchen, and Bus No. 10, which was preparing to depart for Shanghai, along with indoor furniture, miscellaneous items, telephones, rice cookers, and bus windows and engines, were all destroyed. At that moment, Bus No. 110, the first bus from Shanghai, arrived. Before it could enter the city, it was overtaken by the group, who shattered all the windows. A female passenger named Zhang Cuiying, 27 years old, from Gao Huren, was injured in the head by broken glass and bled profusely. She was taken to the city's health hospital for treatment. Subsequently, led by a Mr. Yu, the group attempted to go to the company's headquarters in the city. When they reached Fuxing Bridge near Genchen Gate, a city defense patrol officer, Zhong, tried to dissuade them but was severely beaten and also sent to the hospital for treatment. After reaching the headquarters, the group further damaged maintenance vehicle No. 104 inside the gate. Yang Zhifan, the company's general affairs section chief (also a county assemblyman), heard the commotion and went out to stop them, but he was also slapped. Xu Jiwu, the township head of Baihe Township in Qingpu County, happened to be present and tried his best to persuade and mediate, and the group eventually dispersed. Fifteen minutes after the incident, Yuan, the chief of the County Police Bureau, arrived at the scene with over ten police officers to investigate. The company is currently assessing the losses and plans to submit a representation to the County Government, requesting compensation and guarantees for the company's future safety, along with a bayonet found at the station. The reporter then visited Liu Jin, the County Magistrate, to inquire about his opinion. During the meeting, he told the reporter with a very sorrowful expression: "I just returned from reporting my duties in the provincial capital the day before yesterday. After the suppression of Ding Feixi Shan's banditry in this county, we are making every effort to consolidate local security. At the same time, military service matters are urgently needed to be launched. I did not expect this incident to occur just one day later. I feel deeply saddened and ashamed, and I have nothing to say. Currently, the seven ringleaders of the incident, including Li Weixian, a staff member of the military affairs section (including four county government workers), have been detained. At the same time, I will report to my superiors and request punishment for myself. I guarantee that the perpetrators will be dealt with fairly, severely punished according to the law, and will not be treated with favoritism simply because they are my subordinates."

### Serial Crimes Committed by Bandits: All Nine Apprehended, Many Guns and Stolen Goods Confiscated

[Report from this newspaper] Since the New Cheng Police Sub-Bureau has recently seen a series of theft cases in the past month, in order to maintain local security, Zhao Peijin, the sub-bureau chief, and Ding Zhenduo, the deputy sub-bureau chief, have ordered their subordinates to patrol the辖区 day and night in groups. They also ordered Hao Jingyi, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, to personally lead criminal police officers in disguise to infiltrate all levels of society, especially in places where bandits are likely to hide, to conduct detailed investigations, in the hope of discovering the faces of the bandits and solving the cases.

Disguised Investigation Yields Clues

Finally, at around 3:00 PM on the 6th, Gao Changbiao, a criminal investigation section officer, disguised as a peddler, was patrolling Xinzha Road when he caught sight of two men of medium stature riding in a rickshaw. Their faces were similar to the characteristics described by the victims in various theft cases. He immediately followed them and saw that the two men were looking around in the rickshaw, appearing quite flustered, which made them even more suspicious. He rushed forward, stopped the rickshaw, and interrogated them. They stammered and prevaricated, so they were taken to the bureau. The theft case victims, Qu Jinsheng and others, identified them without error, and they finally confessed. They revealed that one was named Dong Wencai, and the other was named Li Wensheng, and that there were other accomplices residing at Room 40 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road. After the confession, Chief Hao immediately dispatched Liu Zhufeng, accompanied by police officers, to rush to the address and apprehend the bandit leader, Cha Shouren, who confessed that other accomplices were staying at No. 42 Heming Hotel on Guangdong Road. They apprehended bandits Pan Jinshan and Gu Baogen. Several gun parts were found in Pan's coat pocket. Later, at Room 30 on the third floor of No. 560 Huangpi Road, they found accomplices Zhang Ming and the receiver of stolen goods, Shen A'da (female). Two Shanghai-made pistols were found on the female bandit, and a disassembled .45 caliber pistol was found in the wardrobe. Following the confessions, officer Weng Yongquan led police to No. 8 Fuxing Lane, Qianjia Lane, Yuyuan Road, and arrested an accomplice named Chen Dafu. At 7:30 PM on the same day, officers who remained at the Huizhong Hotel continued to capture Cao Zhixing, a bandit who had brought back several pistol bullets from Pudong. By this point, a total of nine bandits, men and women, had been apprehended in this case. According to the bandit leader, Cha Shouren's confession, at approximately 4:30 AM on the 7th, officer Gu Qiliu and patrol officer Wang Jichuan ordered police chief Huang Yulin, Wan Jun, police officer Zhang Baichuan, and joined forces with Shen Kang and Feng Caixiong of the volunteer criminal police squad to go to the home of a bandit surnamed Cai in Huajia Lane, Caolu, Chuansha County, Pudong. They recovered one Type 38 rifle and two Italian-made rifles, which were brought back to Shanghai and presented as evidence.

Confessed to Committing Seventeen Cases

After separate and strict interrogations, all the bandits confessed that from October of last year until their arrest, they had committed as many as seventeen cases in succession: (1) Three rifles were robbed in Pudong in mid-October last year.

### Suspicious Death by Hanging: Coffin Exhumed for Examination

[Report from this newspaper] At approximately 5:00 PM on the 13th, the Xujiahui Police Bureau received a tip-off that a Zhang family at No. 10, A, Lane 179, Tianping Road, was moving a coffin in a hurried manner, suggesting suspicion of murder. Police officers were dispatched to investigate and found that the family was burning joss paper inside the house. Zhang Hanqing, the head of the household, was taken to the bureau. He stated that he was 41 years old, from Shandong, and worked as a rickshaw puller. He confirmed that someone had died at around 8:00 AM today. The deceased was named Li Shirong, 21 years old, from Jiangxi, and was the son of his brother's wife, Zhang Zhengshi, from a previous marriage. He slept on the upper floor of a loft, and for some unknown reason, he hanged himself. His mother discovered him at 8:00 AM this morning, but he was already stiff. Because there were many people in the family, they had already bought a coffin, prepared the body, and transported the coffin to the Yizhong Cemetery of the Shandong Association on Jinji Road for burial. Zhang Zhengshi's statement was consistent with the above. The coffin of the deceased has now been exhumed from the burial site and sent to Tongren Fuyuantang to await the court's dispatch of personnel for examination, in order to facilitate the investigation.

### An Involved Party in the Xu Jizhuang Case: Sun Xiaojun Commits Suicide by Train in Wuxi: Three Suicide Notes Say He Feared Being Wrongfully Convicted: Declared He Only Received Salary and Did Not Receive Benefits from Peng and Xu

[Report from our Wuxi correspondent on the 14th] Sun Xiaojun, an involved party in the embezzlement case of Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the China Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, was afraid of being prosecuted. He returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, got off the train in this county midway, and committed suicide by lying on the railway tracks. He had a suicide note beside him, saying that he did not receive any benefits from Xu and others and that he feared being wrongfully convicted if he turned himself in. His words were very impassioned and desperate. The deceased, Sun Xiaojun, was 47 years old and from Nanjing. He had served as a specialist in the Liquid Fuel Management Committee of the Transportation Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission. After meeting Xu Jizhuang, he became Xu's trusted aide, holding full power over the Bashan Bank and the Far East Trading Company. When Xu Jizhuang's embezzlement case occurred last year, it was reported by the Jiangsu Inspectorate and repeatedly investigated by the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, which filed a public prosecution. Sun was also included as a defendant, and he abandoned his post from then on. However, Sun's businesses were mostly in Shanghai, and many things needed to be handled personally. Moreover, his wife, Zhou, still worked at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and his children were also studying in Shanghai. Therefore, Sun dared not turn himself in nor did he want to leave Shanghai. Furthermore, Sun had a wide circle of friends in peacetime, and recently, his friends in distress kept demanding loans, taking whatever they wanted. Sun suffered from being unable to refuse them, and he also feared being imprisoned. Under these circumstances, the thought of ending his life was not new. On the 12th, after Sun handled the funeral of his brother, Jifu, in Beijing, he took his nephew, Jiang Qingyu, by overnight train to Shanghai. At this time, Sun had already made up his mind to commit suicide. When the train passed Wuxi Station, it was dark and quiet. Sun quietly got off the train and lay down on the railroad tracks when a train from Shanghai to Beijing passed by. By the time he was discovered, he had already been crushed to death. At that time, Jiang Qingyu had already reached Suzhou Station. He could not find Xiaojun in the train and saw the suicide note, knowing that something had happened. He urgently called Wuxi Station to inquire and learned that he had committed suicide in Wuxi. He immediately came to Wuxi and jointly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office. When his wife, Zhou, received the call, she also rushed to Wuxi and bought a coffin. Now, Sun Xiaojun's suicide note is recorded as follows:

Words at Death: Intense and Tragic

Suicide Note (1): Dear Sister Hua, my dearest virtuous wife, you will surely be saddened to know of my tragic death, but you must know that everyone will eventually die. I was destined to die, and I am not good at arguing. Moreover, my nerves and heart are weak. After surrendering myself, I would inevitably be unable to withstand interrogation or torture, or even be wrongfully convicted. Even if that were not the case, I only received a salary and did not receive any benefits from Peng and Xu. Apart from your current job to support you, my honesty will inevitably make me a criminal. Even if I was imprisoned for three days, I would die of anger, and if I fled far away, I would suffocate to death. Moreover, I would forever suffer injustice, which is not worth it. Furthermore, Fang Lin may push me into a trap, leaving me at his mercy. His part (Peng was the mastermind) of the crimes was not done by me. He once showed me a document of sending money to Xu Jizhuang and others. Rather than dying of anger and suffocation, I would rather die by falling on the tracks and committing seppuku with the spirit of Bushido. In this way, my spirit can ascend to heaven and not go to hell. In this way, my wife, children, and family can still be good people. I hope my son will become the world's greatest scientist and do things that benefit the country and save the people. If so, I will be proud, and I can die peacefully. The other children are still young, but each has their own future. The three and five families, with five sons and three daughters, although they are divided, I hope they will help each other. You can discuss with the eldest grandfather about using your hard-earned salary to join the Xiehao shares, which may provide a living. I hope that the job at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will not be cut. It would be even better if you could get my job and then transfer to any location you want. In this way, I will be comforted when I go to heaven. My spirit will always protect you and love you. I was originally very painful, but now I feel relieved. Please restrain your grief and adapt to the change. Your health is important. Do not harm yourself with grief. My house can be sold for 4,000 [unclear]. My death is going to heaven, not hell. You must take the long view. Please ask Yinglin and others to take care of the orphans in the Yangzhu Lane house. Suicide Note (2) Please Inspect Again, Ronglin: A dying man speaks the truth, and since I have been loyal and honest all my life, my words are even more sincere. As a dying man speaking the truth, I would like to inform you that the small box in my house that should be handed over but has not been (because there is no heir) only contains the "Bachuan" and "Yuanyang" directors' seals and business licenses. My wife does not know the truth, please do not mistakenly accuse her. Suicide Note (3) Mother-in-law, older and younger mothers, elder brother and sister, siblings, I know that although they are not blood-related sisters, they are like flesh and blood, and all my nephews and nieces, you all love me, do not grieve my death, I hope you will be open-minded and recognize that I am going to heaven, and there will be comfort. Please take care of my orphans. Goodbye! Wishing you good health, not writing separately to relatives and friends.

### Qibao Agricultural School Hosts Visit

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Qibao Vocational Agricultural School hosted a visit from the press yesterday.

### Wages to Be Settled According to Last Month's Index: Shanghai General Labor Union Voted to Oppose Yesterday

### Commercial Competition Intensifies Daily: Roadside Advertisements Soar, Empty Walls and Rooftops Becoming Excellent Bases; 200 Square Feet Exceeds 50 Million in Value

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The astonishing number of roadside advertisements in Shanghai and the rapid advancement of production techniques powerfully illustrate that today's commercial competition has reached a fever pitch. Starting from posters like "Dog Skin Plaster for Sale, Specializing in Treating Traumatic Injuries," in just over a decade, advertising has spread from wall corners and streets to every available space. In the eyes of businessmen, no blank wall, incredibly high dangerous building, important construction, or eye-catching place is not an excellent base for their "advertising war."

Among these, Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, the Bund, Avenue Joffre, and Xizang Road, due to their dense population, are naturally the most intensely contested advertising areas for various commercial firms and companies. However, some have unique ideas, abandoning the city and focusing on remote rural areas. For example, "White Snow" advertisements are mostly scattered around Caojiadu, Wujiaochang, and Caohejing, while "Wuzhou Gubenzao" has erected 50,000 feet of roadside advertising signs along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, penetrating deep into Yixing, Liyang, and other counties. Some aim to attract urban crowds, while others strive to win over rural customers. Although the regions differ, their desire to attract more customers is the same.

Tiny Wall Space, Considerable Rent

It is not a simple task for advertising companies to erect advertising signs for clients in various locations. Even for a small space on a wall, they must first lease it from the landowner. The transfer fee and rent are like renting a house. In the city, prices are quoted in gold bars or US dollars, while in the countryside, they are calculated in rice and grain. The advertising signs that stretch for miles alongside the racetrack require advertising companies to pay a considerable monthly fee to the Shanghai Race Club. The attractive grassy advertisements on both sides of the Ciro's dance hall also charge advertisers substantial ground rent. Many residents are fortunate to be favored by advertisers who wish to use a corner of their wall for advertising, and these residents' monthly income may be several times more than the rent from leasing an entire house.

Four Small Windows Reduce Wind Force

What advertising merchants fear the most is a sudden typhoon. Roadside advertising signs bear the brunt and are naturally vulnerable. In the past, during storms, roadside signs often broke and were uprooted, resulting in considerable losses. Now, they have come up with a solution: opening four small windows in the center of the roadside sign. These are usually closed tightly, appearing seamless, but when a strong wind rises, the small doors are shaken open, significantly reducing wind resistance and avoiding disaster.

Advertising merchants usually put a lot of effort into communicating with and dealing with lower-level figures and behind-the-scenes forces in various sections of the city. The most important thing for advertising signs is to be beautiful, and they must avoid being smeared or damaged. Especially at night when there is no one to guard them, it is even more difficult to prevent petty thieves from stealing. Therefore, expenses for holidays are particularly generous. It is said that this tacit form of transaction is quite effective. Now, each 200-square-foot advertising sign is worth over 50 million, and if there is any mistake, the advertising merchant will naturally risk incurring losses.

Freehand Drawing, Accurate to the Millimeter

The life of an advertising sign lies in the drawing of the design. The best paint for drawing is German-made, followed by British goods. Although American paint has bright colors, it is not durable. Generally, advertising merchants and clients sign contracts for roadside signs for a period of six months. Except for movie advertisements, the rest are rarely changed, so they must choose durable paint colors. There are also craftsmen who draw the designs. They have not received any art training. As long as they look at a piece of soap or a can of cigarettes, they can draw it accurately to the millimeter on a hundred-foot hanging wall, whether it is small or large. They usually paint a 300-400 foot drawing with a dozen colors in just two days. Their skilled techniques enable them to earn over 40 to 50 million.

Loyalty and Villainy, Each Resembling Their Character

The most profound expression of wisdom and spirituality is the drawing of movie advertisements. The faces of so-called "stars" are known to everyone, not like drawing gods never seen by anyone on the kitchen stove in the countryside. It is a very difficult task to accurately, vividly, and beautifully transfer a photo onto a three-dimensional roadside sign. It is said that there are only four or five people in Shanghai who can handle this kind of work, and Zhao Xikui is the best of them. A "Night Shop" advertisement at the intersection of Avenue Foch has nearly twenty "stars" who are all well-known figures. Their beauty, ugliness, loyalty, and villainy each resemble their character. Each of their faces is radiant, which has been praised by many passersby. This is Zhao Xikui's masterpiece.

A Piece of Grassland, Cleverly Arranged

According to precise surveys, there are now more than 2,500 advertising signs in Shanghai, and cigarette advertisements account for 35%. These advertisements are distributed inside and outside the city, on rooftops and walls, almost without exception, and are visible everywhere you look up. Currently, due to the limited space in the city, roadside advertising has begun to develop to other cities, and they have appeared successively along both roads. Strictly speaking, Shanghai's advertising has progressed from "roadside signs" to "landed" advertisements. A piece of grassland is opened up by the roadside, cleverly arranging a few geese, a few large cigarette cans, and a few lanterns, so that people on the road feel the temptation of these things at their feet. Take a closer look, friends! What they hope is that you will take another look!

### Some Problems Behind the Small Well-being in Shandong Province

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 11th] Due to the full-scale suppression by the National Army in the past and the successive southward escape to Central China by the remaining main forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, Jinan, which has been the heart of Shandong for more than half a year, has been able to maintain a relatively stable and small-scale well-being.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Jinan had a population of only over 300,000. After the victory, due to the difficulties created by the Communists and the smoke of war spreading throughout Shandong, refugees from various counties crowded into Jinan, Qingdao, and other cities, resulting in Jinan's population reaching a maximum of 800,000. Since the second opening of the Jiaoji Railway's Jin-Wei section last autumn, followed by the official repair and opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Xu-Ji section in December, although the people gathered in Jinan have been partially dispersed, the remaining atmosphere is still not cleared up, and a large area of various villages and towns is still under the control of local Eighth Route Armies. Therefore, the city's population, excluding the military, has always maintained a record of over 600,000 to 700,000.

"The people regard food as heaven." The most serious issue after the increase in population is naturally the grain problem. According to statistics from the Shandong Construction Department: there are seven flour mills in Jinan, and if their production capacity is fully utilized, they can produce 700,000 bags of flour per month, requiring 200,000 bags of wheat, which is just enough for the entire city of Jinan. However, at present, due to the blockade of the four rural areas by the Communists, the source of wheat is short, and only a quarter of it is produced per month, that is, more than 170,000 bags, requiring 50,000 bags of wheat. In addition, even when coarse grains are included in the calculation, the average daily amount of food imported into Jinan City from other counties is no more than 3,000 bags, totaling 90,000 bags per month, which is only enough for two-thirds of the current population of Jinan City to eat. (Coarse grains consume very little when ground into powder). Although there are no accurate statistics on the original grain reserves in Jinan City, under such supply and demand conditions, the rise in food prices is naturally a matter of course. From mid-December of last year, when the price of first-class flour (44 city catties) was 500,000 per bag, to early February (the end of the lunar year), it broke through the 1 million mark. By early March, the black market price of flour rose again to 1.8 million per bag. Although it is currently hovering around 1.5 million, this price obviously cannot be maintained for long. As for millet flour, one of the coarse grains, the current market price has also reached 2 million per 100 city catties. According to Jinan Mayor Wang Chongwu, at least half of the 700,000 people in Jinan are refugees, and at least 200,000 of these 350,000 refugees rely on relief to maintain their lives. The light luggage that the refugees could only carry when they left their hometowns could not withstand the long-term consumption of more than two years, and most of them were sitting idle and facing desperation. The original number of public school personnel in the directly affiliated and affiliated organs of the Shandong Provincial Government was more than 4,700. Under such heavy pressure of high prices, they were already on the verge of death. In December, the Jinan City price index calculated by the Shandong Provincial Bank reached more than 180,000 times. However, the central government listed Jinan as the third level, other counties in Shandong as the fourth level, and only Qingdao City as the first level. This not only made the public school personnel in Jinan City unable to "live," "die," "be born," or "get sick," especially the public school personnel who risked their lives at any time to serve in the recovered areas where the remaining atmosphere was not cleared up. The treatment they received was even lower, so low that it was not only impossible to "support a family," but even "making a living" became a problem. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to talk about rewarding outstanding and promising personnel to go to the recovered areas to compete with the bandits in politics, economy, culture, and education.

In peacetime, government agencies proliferated one after another. Once the government's expenses are huge and income is not enough, they ignore life and death, summarize and generalize, and issue an order to limit local governments to cut staff by 25% within five months (February to June). Although this is also a problem in the rear, the problem should not be as profound and serious as in the pacification zone. Take Jinan as an example: there are already enough refugees and unemployed people, and the treatment of the original public school personnel is already bitter enough. However, even this bit of life is to be destroyed. The civil servants who are laid off have no place to go. Therefore, this simply made Chairman Wang Jianu feel distressed. He wanted not to cut staff, but the central government did not care about anything and began to deduct 30% of the funds from February, so he had to start cutting staff by 10% from early March. Other military organs (such as the pacification area) and party affairs organs also have to cut staff, especially the party affairs organs, where the number of people laid off reached 80% of the original staff.

According to personnel who recently escaped from the "Liberated Area," the Communists, in order to "reduce the burden on the people, implement drought preparedness and disaster relief, produce savings, ensure land reform, and strive for the final victory of the self-defense war," issued eight "prohibitions," of which the third is "Stop expanding the army, and in the future, without the decision of the military region or the provincial government, no one shall be mobilized to join the army again." He also told me: "The Communists have set up reception centers in all 'Liberated Areas' and on the boundary lines of the National Army's recovered areas to welcome refugees who have escaped to return to their hometowns. In the past, the Communists did not allow landlords to return to their hometowns, and returning to their hometowns was punishable by death. However, this year, their policy has changed. Landlords can also guarantee their safety when they return to their hometowns. They still issue one mu of land per person according to the population. In the first three months, the bandits supply two city catties of food per day, issued once every ten days, and then sell it at the expiration date." He solemnly told me: "Only 30 miles away from Jinan, the Communists have set up a large reception center in Sangzidian on the north bank of the Yellow River, especially emphasizing that they welcome government employees who have been laid off to go to the 'Liberated Area.' They are responsible for guaranteeing and protecting their work."

At the same time, in Jinan, I don't know how many middle and lower-level civil servants have said to me: "In the past, what we ate every day was wowotou (corn bread). When we were eating wowotou, we could still compare ourselves to 'holding gold nuggets in our hands' and get some spiritual satisfaction. Today, even a family of five civil servants of the first rank have problems eating wowotou!"

This series of problems cannot be solved by the strength of the local government alone. If the central government does not address the special environment of the pacification zone, adapt to the special needs of the pacification zone, earnestly improve the treatment of staff, reward a large number of outstanding youths to go to the recovered areas to engage in political, economic, cultural, educational, and other competitions with the bandits in order to achieve the true mission of "total war," and does not allow the transportation of grain from the south to the north in order to enrich the source of grain, and allocate a large number of food loans to purchase grain and transport it to Shandong; and does not allocate a part of the 1.2 million tons of American relief food to Shandong to help alleviate the serious spring famine in Shandong; and does not stop layoffs, and instead of giving relief after the layoffs, it is better not to lay off staff to enhance their work efficiency; then, in order to fight for the most basic survival, the people will inevitably drink poison to quench their thirst and be confused by the one-sided propaganda of the Communists. Liu Xiang, the Director of the Shandong People's Department, said well: "Even in terms of layoffs, it is at most a social problem in other places, but in the pacification zone, it has become a serious political problem."

### The Shandong Women's Legislative Election Dispute, Which Caused a Sensation, Comes to an End

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, Our Newspaper, 12th] The Shandong women's legislative election dispute has attracted widespread attention from all over the country since it occurred. Now, Ms. Chen Jiujing, the wife of Shandong Education Director, who participated in the election with the participation of social figures and received many votes, has expressed her willingness to give up the right to run for the Legislative Yuan after being persuaded by Chairman Wang Jianu Yaowu and others. At the same time, Ms. Lü Yunzhang, a member of the Central Committee and a member of the Senate, who participated in the legislative election, deeply admires Ms. Chen's move. The talks between Ms. Lü and Ms. Chen are recorded below. This Shandong election dispute, which caused a sensation, should come to an end here!

Lü Yunzhang's talk: My purpose in participating in this legislative election is to obtain a speaking position in the Legislative Yuan. Legislative Yuan members are not officials, but people's representatives. Therefore, running for the Legislative Yuan is not so much a personal right as it is an obligation to the people. Unfortunately, I am very sorry for offending friends because of the election. I am very grateful for the assistance of people from all walks of life. I recently heard that Ms. Chen Jiujing declared to Chairman Wang that she would give up her right to be elected to the Legislative Yuan, expressing her concession. This kind of humble demeanor is not only admired by Yunzhang personally, but also leaves a good example for Shandong society and the future of elections. Yunzhang and Ms. Jiujing were originally classmates and have a very close friendship. The misunderstanding that occurred in this election was due to false rumors and caused estrangement. Now, after being explained by friends, the two sides have completely dissolved their differences and will never affect the friendship between the two of us due to a temporary misunderstanding.

Chen Jiujing's talk: I recently read an article published by Ms. Lü Yunzhang in various newspapers in the city (i.e., the one mentioned above), which is largely inconsistent with the facts. My attitude in participating in this election has been consistent from beginning to end, and I have not changed in the slightest due to any resistance. Since I have decided to run for election, how can I give up my right to be elected? In the past half month, because of the election, Ms. Lü Yunzhang disregarded everything and published news fabricated facts in various newspapers, and then published it in the Dahua Daily. The so-called photo of Ms. Li Yang was intended to cover up her fabricated facts, confuse the hearing, and intended to damage the reputation of my husband Li Taihua and insult my personal personality. Since Ms. Lü has destroyed the friendship so much, although Chairman Wang instructed friends to mediate a few days ago, I believe that the issue of concession cannot be discussed until the friendship between the two sides is restored. My husband submitted a resignation and planned to deal with Ms. Lü in the capacity of a private citizen, but Chairman Wang dissuaded him, so it is inconvenient to have any other expressions. As for the issue of giving up the Legislative Yuan, it will be easily resolved after the election results are announced. Because Ms. Lü is my old senior, if I can be elected, it is not impossible to give up to her.

Lü Yunzhang took the Tianjin-Pukou Express train to Beijing and then to Shanghai on the morning of the 12th of this month to treat her eye disease. Since the occurrence of this case, Li Yingchang Taihua has not gone to the department to work since the 10th and has formally submitted his resignation to Chairman Wang, but it is heard that Chairman Wang believes that Li has made many contributions to Shandong in the past two years and decided to retain him.

### Haining Land Collapse: Waves Splashing and Stirring Up a Strange Joy

[Dispatch from Haining, Our Newspaper, 13th] The rising sand on the sea embankment outside the South Gate of Haining County has reached a flat surplus, and sea transportation has been cut off. The commercial depression in the urban and rural areas has made it impossible to carry out various constructions, so the people all hope that the sand will collapse as soon as possible in order to seek revival. At present, the sand and soil on the embankment have risen to a height of one zhang, and they are only a foot or so away from the embankment. Looking from a distance, it is a plain of yellow sand, and vehicles often come and go. These days, it is the time of high tide, and the sand collapse is accelerating. When the tide comes, the sound of the sand collapse is loud. Looking from a distance into the river, the waves are splashing, forming a strange scene, just like a group of machines bombing the position. According to those who are familiar with the tide, the sand will collapse very easily in the recent situation, and the view can be restored in the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. The "Haining Tide" will still be praised by the world.

### Re-election of National Assembly Representatives in Changhua

[Dispatch from Changhua, Our Newspaper, 12th] After the Changhua County National Assembly representatives were ruled invalid by the Zhejiang High Court, the county election office was ordered to actively prepare for re-election and has set the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month as the re-election dates. Candidate Wang Xuequan came to the county from Shanghai a few days ago to visit the elders of each district. Another candidate, Chen Yi (the current Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Food and Grain Department), also transferred dozens of Changhua-born grain administration personnel back to his hometown half a month ago to run around for him. He himself returned to Changhua in his own small jeep a few days ago to preside over the process. Now, there are only a few days left before the election date. According to what the reporter has learned: this election is not as turbulent as the previous one, and there is less textual propaganda. However, the situation of threats and inducements is still undiminished from the previous one in various villages. I recently learned that Wang Xuequan, in view of the increasingly deteriorating election atmosphere, published a general letter to the elders of the county, firmly expressing his intention to give up the election. Judging from its content, it seems that there are infinite emotions. The original letter is recorded below: "Xuequan is humbled by his talent, and is honored to be sincerely loved and cared for by the elders of each district. He resolutely participated in the previous National Assembly election in Changhua. Afterwards, due to the county election office's violation of the law and other relations, our Changhua election did not have a good result, which is a major stain on the history of constitutionalism. This time, the Zhejiang High Court ruled for a re-election. Xuequan, in view of the unwavering love and care of the elders of each district, came back again to prepare for a second election. However, rumors and whispers have been spreading in recent days, and the power of the evil has spread all over. I deeply know that many elders are suffering in such an environment. I deeply understand this. If I burden the public again with my own body, it is unbearable, and I am unwilling to be a sinner of democracy. After repeated consideration, I have decided to give up the election. If the elders are determined to love and care for me and still vote for Xuequan, then Xuequan will also regard it as the supreme glory and be grateful. I hope that my humble heart will be enlightened." After reading it, fair people in general in each district and village expressed their sympathy.

After receiving the order, the department immediately began active preparations. However, the Ministry of Education limited the group to ten people, and Taiwan Province has a total of seventeen counties and cities. If each county and city sent one person, it would still not be sufficient. After approval, the number was increased to seventeen people.

### Xie Shou Kang Gives Lecture on the Overview of European and American Literature and Art

[Our report] The Municipal Literary Writers Association, the Shanghai Art Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, and the Youth Hall jointly invited Mr. Xie Shou Kang, the former envoy to the Holy See and a member of the Belgian Royal Academy of Literature, to give a lecture yesterday titled "Overview of European and American Literature and Art". Mr. Xie briefly stated: After World War I, the social economy recovered very quickly, and the literature and art after the war also bloomed like flowers, dazzling and dazzling. The situation after this war is the opposite of the previous one. People are wandering and have nowhere to live. They are pursuing in distress but are very interested in Chinese literature and art. Now the world is in poverty. Except for the United States, which is wealthy, other countries are in recession. The sales of literary and artistic works are also a problem. It can be said that the barrenness has no source; some people have turned to look at the distant Far East with envy. Recently, France also feels that it cannot live in its own country and wants to come to China. This kind of depression is everywhere. China attracts people's attention, and European ancient culture is also influenced by China, such as the Italian Renaissance. Important figures in modern French culture have been influenced by Chinese literature and philosophy. According to Mr. Xie, after the victory, due to the death of Deng Zhenan, a senior member of the Belgian Royal Academy of Literature, Xie was elected by public vote to take his place. This is also a great honor for China in the overseas literary and art circles.

### World Games Football Preliminary Round Proceeds Smoothly in Hong Kong. The Representative Team Will Leave the Country on the 10th of Next Month. The Preliminary Competition Will Feature Java as the Opponent.

[Our city news] Dong Shouyi, the Secretary-General of the Chinese National Sports Federation, and Rong Qizhao, the Chairman of the World Games Football Selection Committee, flew to Hong Kong on the 5th of this month to cooperate with the Hong Kong selection committee in handling the selection matters for China's participation in the 14th London World Games football selection. It is now learned that Dong returned to Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong on the 11th. According to Dong, this selection was jointly handled by Cai Huihong, Chairman of the Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese National Sports Federation, and relevant parties. The results were exceptionally satisfactory. Participants in the selection competition included Java, Kowloon Chinese United, and Zhu Zhicheng (goalkeeper) and Xie Wenliang (right winger) selected by Singapore. On the 9th, 11th, and 16th of this month, three games were held separately with Java as the main body. The two representatives from Singapore joined the Chinese United team to compete. Once the final preliminary round on the 16th is completed, the list of candidates for the World Games football team can be determined by the entire selection committee, and the team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 10th of next month after completing preparations. It is also learned that Dong has repeatedly consulted with Hu Wenhu and his son in Hong Kong on matters related to the football team's departure.

Java Chinese are very popular in Hong Kong

[Our Hong Kong air report] The selection of World Games football representatives is causing a stir in Hong Kong. Dong Shouyi, Rong Qizhao, and Yu Hengzhi arrived in Hong Kong, and the Java team, led by Zhang Huaijin, also arrived in Hong Kong with 20 players to participate in the election for the World Games representative quota. In order to thank the Java team for their enthusiasm for returning to the country (the players' travel expenses were all pooled from their own savings), they received a wide welcome. In addition to the South China Athletic Association hosting their accommodation, the local Sports Association Branch, South China, and Sing Tao also held banquets to entertain them separately, and private individuals such as Chen Rongbai and Tang Xuanqing also held banquets.

However, while the selection competition is proceeding smoothly, there have been many unpleasant news. The biggest obstacles are the issue of funding for going abroad and whether the selected players are willing to depart with the military. Combining the opinions of all parties, the departure of the World Games football team is still subject to change.

This time, the Sports Association Branch arranged three competition schedules for the Java team to perform in Hong Kong. The first match was against Hong Kong Chinese United, held on the 9th (Tuesday). The second match was against Kowloon Chinese United, held on the 11th (Thursday). The third match was against Hong Kong West United, held on the 16th (Tuesday). The venues were all at the South China Jia Shan Field, and ticket prices were 5 yuan, 3.5 yuan, and 2.4 yuan. After the Java team completes its matches in Hong Kong, it will fly to Bangkok for a tour-style competition. If time permits, it will make a trip to Shanghai.

Fans Packed

The 9th was the first battle, with Hong Kong Chinese United lined up to meet the enemy. Perhaps this was a new stimulus. The game started at 5:00 PM, but fans started arriving in droves after 3:00 PM, packing the South China Field. The income was统计ed at more than 14,000 yuan, which is not a bad number. As a result of the match, Hong Kong United showed better skills, winning three goals in the first half and adding another one in the second half, with four goals to nil against Java. The lineups of the two teams during the match were as follows:

(Hong Kong United Team)

Tan Junqian, Zeng Zhongyun, Hou Rongsheng, Tan Huanzhang, Zhang Jinhai, Liu Songsheng, Xie Jinhe, Li Zhaorong, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen

(Java Team)

Wang Wenqing, Wang Liangde, Cai Ruichang, Wu Changhe, Zhang Mingkun, Huang Shuangquan, Guo Hongcheng, Luo Tianxiu, Hu Jinli, Chen Yun, Gao Jinquan

Hong Kong United Takes the Lead

Hong Kong team had regular players Lin Rushun, Song Lingsheng, Chen Dehui, and Zhu Yongqiang unable to play due to injuries. Zeng Zhongyun, Tan Huanzhang, Li Zhaorong, and Xie Jinhe were temporarily substituted. Captain Feng Jingxiang chose a favorable wind direction. The Java team kicked off, and the first few kicks were quite decent. Four minutes passed, and Yingfen got the ball and rushed up, passing it back to the mountain road. Songsheng intercepted it from 25 yards out and scored a goal, and Wenqing was caught off guard. Hong Kong United scored the first point.

Three Goals in a Row

In the second battle, Yingfen and Jingxiang advanced again. Yingfen aimed at the goal, and Yingqi flashed in and headed the ball, hitting the post and bouncing out. After eleven minutes, the two players on the right advanced again, passing each other deep into the penalty area. Yingfen passed the ball to Jingxiang, and the "divine leg" rose, making it 2 to 0. Continuing the melee, the visiting team launched a fierce counterattack, forcing a 12-yard penalty kick. Luo Tianxiu hosted the guests. After 32 minutes, Jinhe advanced from the left and sent the ball horizontally to the right. Jingxiang gently touched it, causing it to fall at the feet of Zhaorong. The "Buddha" quickly抽ed it, making it 3 to 0. Hong Kong United had an absolute advantage in the first half.

After a short break, Java played better than in the first half. Hong Kong United only scored a free kick by Liu Songsheng, while Java fought hard but failed to break the duck egg in the end. Hong Kong United then defeated the Java team by a score of 4 to 0.

Judging the Java Chinese Team

Looking at the entire game, Hong Kong Chinese United had an above-average performance. The forwards Feng Jingxiang and He Yingfen played the best, and defender Zhang Jinhai was the most outstanding. What about the Java team? Left-winger Guo Hongcheng was good, and both defenders had a chance to perform, but the midfield was too weak. Although the forwards had strength in their feet, they did not have a way to shoot. The most disadvantaged part was not understanding Hong Kong United's style of play. This is where the Java team is far inferior to the Hong Kong United. The attack in the front was not organized, and there was no certainty in fighting for headers, but they liked to use high balls to advance, so the opposing team had a chance to advance, but they couldn't shoot at all. But from the perspective of combat spirit, it is worthy of praise. Although they lost four goals, they remained consistent throughout, which is the most exciting thing.

### Bitter Battle at Jianqiao Air Force Ends in Defeat; Last Night's Loss to Oncas; Today's Farewell Battle Against Lianqing

[Our Reporter] The Hangzhou Jianqiao Air Force Military Academy basketball team came to Shanghai for an expedition. Last night, in their second match, they encountered the strong local Western team Oncas. After a hard-fought battle, they were defeated 53-28. In the first half, the Air Force school trailed 12-25. Oncas' offense was fierce, and their players were tall. The Air Force fought bravely but was no match. The gymnasium was quite crowded, with an estimated audience of over 1,000 people. Tonight, the Air Force school will have its final battle against the Lianqing team, a new force formed by Chengyou, Renyu, and Yuxun of this city. The battle report from last night is as follows:

The Air Force presented flags as a courtesy before the match began. The Air Force school gained the initial advantage. Xu Weiyuan's momentum was strong, but Oncas' Bowley and Cairo Siqi were active for a time, quickly turning the score to 14-6. The Air Force school's biggest problem was that they "couldn't break through." They lingered in the half-court, within sight but out of reach, and fell behind all the way. The foreign soldiers swaggered, making it 24-9. Within 15 minutes, the situation had become dire. The first half ended 25-12. In the second half, Oncas implemented a rotational strategy. Their tall stature further aided their shooting. Although the Air Force school tried hard to advance in the final ten minutes, it was too late, and the game ended with a score of 53-28.

Dagong versus Qingbai began at 6:30 PM. After the opening, it was difficult to separate the two teams. After much effort, the first half ended in a 28-point tie. When the second half began, Cai Wenhua and Tu Wenlong repeatedly scored skillfully from the right of the basket. Qingbai's Xu Hengyan was still able to cope, making it 39-37.

In the end, Dagong won the tense match with a score of 56-52.

### General Prices: The Vicious Cycle Intensifies; Hope for Swift Measures to Break It

The fierce wave of price increases after the Lunar New Year had slightly eased in the previous week. It seemed that the price fluctuations had completed a cycle and should enter a period of rest, at least for about a week, following the tightening of credit at the end of the previous week. However, the actual development of events was unexpectedly surprising. Although credit remained tight last week, interbank lending among money traders became more frequent, and price fluctuations became more intense again. This indicates that the tightening of credit at the end of the previous week was merely a phenomenon of relative shortage of payment chips after a sharp rise in prices, and not the effect of a large surplus injected by national banks. Although the surplus in the previous week reached 119.98 billion yuan, more than half of it was injected by the Central Bank, and more than half of the National Bank's injection was fixed deposits from other banks. Other income, such as coal, sugar, and taxes, also accounted for only half. Last week's surplus was 89.61 billion, which cannot be considered small, but the situation was similar to the previous week. Therefore, although the weekly surplus is large, it cannot promote tight credit. Instead, after a sharp rise in prices, credit may tighten accordingly, but this is still a natural result brought about by the sharp rise in prices, with less pressure from active human intervention. This is precisely what patriotic and concerned individuals feel is the most worrisome aspect of the future, because prices are constantly completing a cycle of rising and leveling off, and credit is tightening and loosening intermittently. Then, after a short period of rest, a second cycle follows. The momentum is becoming more and more intense, and the cycle is becoming shorter and shorter. This is a vicious cycle, a malignant tumor in the national economy. If this series of cycles cannot be broken, and this malignant tumor cannot be removed, then its future is something that patriotic and concerned individuals cannot bear to speak of plainly. However, according to the facts, not to mention the distant past, this series of vicious cycles has only been repeated endlessly with acceleration since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. We hereby reiterate a fervent hope that the wise financial authorities will no longer make any minor facilities, but will quickly cut off this series of vicious cycles in the late stage of hyperinflation. If this series of vicious cycles cannot be cut off, the effectiveness of any minor facilities will probably not be as ideal. Because the severity of the economic situation has reached a decisive stage, we cannot help but issue an ardent appeal. As for the method of cutting off this series of vicious cycles, it is impossible to discuss it in detail here. According to the wholesale price index classified by the use of goods compiled by this association, the increase in the two weeks after the Lunar New Year was 71%, which was a fierce wave of price increases. However, the situation had already eased in the previous week. At the end of the previous week, credit tightened and prices uniformly reported declines. It seemed that the past week should have continued the stability of a certain period of time amidst the sound of tight credit. However, the large influx of hot money from North China and Northeast China, especially the large inflow of Northeast circulating coupons into the interior, caused a sharp increase in the currency in the interior in the short term. According to the statistics of the Tianjin Financial Administration, the inflow of Northeast circulating coupons into the interior in the second half of last month reached more than 460 billion. This city is of course greatly affected. Therefore, although credit tightened last week after a sharp rise in prices due to the sharp rise in prices, the funds in this city did not appear to be short due to the continuous inflow of a large amount of hot money. Interbank lending among various banks and firms was frequent, and as a result, prices rose again, with a momentum that was more fierce than in the previous three weeks. The number of goods reaching new highs was countless. Forty-two count Blue Phoenix rose 18% in a single day on Tuesday, reaching a maximum of 180 million in a week. The leading Longtou fine cloth rose 13% on the same day, reaching a maximum of 3.73 million in a week. The highest price of high-quality white japonica rice on Thursday reached 3.88 million, with retail sales reaching 4.1 million. 120 count A-character Tianqiao rayon rose 17% in a single day on Wednesday, with the highest price reaching 238 million. Factory counties exceeded 300 million. At the weekend, credit tightened again in the morning and prices fell. However, the National Bank injected a large amount of funds in the afternoon, credit loosened again, and prices rebounded again. As a result, the National Bank injected as much as 301.9 billion on the same day, setting a new record for previous injections. From this, it can be seen that although the National Bank is doing its best to tighten credit, there are limitations due to the facts, and although it is doing its best to tighten, the effect is not always able to reach the ideal level. This point is especially worthy of attention, especially in the past year, when the authorities have almost taken tightening credit as the only means to stabilize prices. Among the general price indices last week, food, textiles, and building materials rose more. The appreciation of foreign exchange on Tuesday certainly had a great impact on import and export goods. However, whether export goods can recover from the exhaustion of the previous week due to the appreciation of foreign exchange this time is also quite problematic. The fact is probably not as simple as ideal, because the appreciation of foreign exchange also affects the domestic prices of export goods. As a result, the latter often offsets the impact of the appreciation and there is a surplus. This time is no exception to this common rule. In short, the economic machine is a whole, interconnected. It is absolutely impossible to cure a disease in a certain part by treating only a certain part. The wise financial authorities must already be aware of this, so we do not need to waste more words.

The wholesale price indices classified by use last week are as follows:

Category Name Last Week's Index Percentage Change from Previous Week

Currency and Finance: Credit Tightens, But Hot Money Reserves Remain Thick

Credit in this city tightened from the end of the previous week to last week. The authorities' active tightening of credit did have some effect, but this effect was very limited. For example, in terms of the surplus figures of the National Banks, the actual daily surplus of the banks last week (deducting the fixed deposits of commercial banks in the Central Bank) was as low as 60 billion on Thursday and 35 billion on Friday. At the weekend, it even reversed the norm, with a surplus of over 370 billion. Compared with the fact that the actual daily surplus of the banks was over 100 billion in the week before last (i.e., the last week of February), the actual surplus figures of the banks last week are truly far behind. However, credit in the last week showed a general tightening, while credit in the week before last was indeed excessively loose, which shows that in the late stage of inflation, the situation of currency flooding cannot be saved by tightening and other artificial forces. As for the reason why credit in this city tightened again last week, it was only the result of the relatively smaller size of the payment chips after the soaring of prices. The time for this kind of credit tightening will not only gradually shorten, but will inevitably lead to another larger credit situation.

The repeated high prices of commodities and the result of competition among various groups to purchase them have led to a shortage of orders in the market and an unprecedented demand for funds. As a result, the underground interest rate has also gradually risen. At the beginning of last week, the underground interest rate was fixed at 25%, but by Friday, it had already reached as high as 31.2%. As for securities arbitrage, it also reached as high as 27% on Thursday. Generally speaking, although those seeking funds are very eager, the source of funds has not been excessively scarce, and interbank lending is also quite flexible, which shows that the reserves of hot money in this city are very abundant. The fact that general commodities have not seen a sharp decline due to the tightening of credit in the past week is mainly due to this.

The surplus figures of foreign banks last week increased from Wednesday, with the average surplus amount from Wednesday to Friday being over several hundred billion, which is said to be related to the continued outflow of funds to the south.

The output of the indirect exchange group among commercial banks and firms decreased to more than 100 billion on Tuesday and Wednesday, but increased to 230 billion again on Thursday and Friday. As for the amount of cash used by banks and firms to settle and submit vouchers to the Central Bank, the daily average was around 560 billion, which shows the general tightness of credit.

Internal and External Exchange Rates

Last week, the exchange rates of internal exchange in this city to various places generally fell on Tuesday, but gradually rose after Wednesday, reaching new highs. For example, the exchange rate from this city to Guangzhou was only 120 yuan per thousand yuan on Tuesday, but it rose to 220 yuan on Friday, creating an unprecedented high price for the Guangzhou exchange rate. Similarly, the exchange rate to Xiamen was only 120 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, but suddenly rose to 250 yuan on Friday, an increase of more than double. The exchange rates to Chongqing and Hankou also increased after Tuesday, but the rate of increase was not large. The fluctuations in the discount rate in Tianjin were not significant. The speed of exchange rate fluctuations can indicate the intensity of capital flight from this city to the south.

Last week, the benchmark rate for the foreign exchange market, the US dollar, was also raised again on Tuesday, from 149,000 yuan to 195,000 yuan, an increase of 30%. The pound also rose to 585,000 yuan. Last week, the Hong Kong dollar in Shanghai could be exchanged for 1.52 Hong Kong dollars per 100,000 yuan of legal tender on Monday, but it had shrunk to 1.17 Hong Kong dollars on Friday, a decrease of more than 20% within a week. The market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong was stable between 5.67 Hong Kong dollars.

Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Last week, the fluctuations in the Chinese and foreign stock markets were quite drastic. The tightness of credit in the market could not resist the impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate. Before Friday, the stocks generally rose. On Wednesday, the 14 types of Chinese stocks for the current period all reached the limit increase due to the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate and the unfavorable prospects for US loans. On Thursday, hot money continued to flock to the stock market, and 10 types of Chinese stocks for the current delivery again flew to reach the limit increase. On Friday, the market suddenly fell due to rumors of tighter credit and the hope of active US loans. However, from the end of the previous week to Friday of last week, the increase rate of Chinese stocks such as Yongsha was close to 20%. The trend of other stocks was also similar. As for foreign stocks, due to the repeated impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate, they repeatedly reached new peaks. From the end of the previous week to Friday of last week, Yisha and Yisheng rose by about 30%, and British Federation rose by 20%, and Jardine Matheson rose by about 25%. Generally speaking, the increase was higher than that of Chinese stocks.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics

(1) Production: The shortage of raw materials and equipment, the inflexibility of capital turnover, the daily increase in production costs, and the heavy burden of donations and taxes all constitute fatal threats to the current industrial sector. Sometimes, these threats exhibit some potentially diminishing postures due to public appeals, certain expressions of government authorities, or certain fantasies of the hopefuls themselves. However, almost as soon as they do, all kinds of rumors and wishes are shattered by ruthless facts.

Let's take an example: Last week, the Shanghai industrial sector unanimously supported and placed new hopes on the section regarding the Export Management Committee's opening of self-provided foreign exchange to purchase production equipment. However, according to relevant authorities, the section that depositing US dollar funds in the Central Bank would allow the purchase of production equipment in two months was not accurate. Thus, the question shifted to how to use foreign deposits to import production equipment and other supplementary equipment. This not only provides an outlet for Chinese monetary capitalists living abroad, but also encourages the current capital outflow to some extent. The various difficulties of the Shanghai industrial sector can be easily seen in the appeals and constructions of various industrial organizations. In the past week, the suggestions of the National Association of Industry on the 7th were expressed first, and the proposals of the board of directors of the Shanghai Industrial Association on the 8th were disclosed later. The former's suggestions were (1) Please the government to increase coal allocation to meet needs. (2) The prices of Japanese compensation machines should be reduced, and the application deadline should be extended. (3) The income tax should be levied at six times last year's rate, and should not be rigidly stipulated. (4) Exemption from special relief donations for industrial and commercial units should be requested. (5) All quota raw material allocations for the fifth and sixth quarters should be handed over to the industrial sector for self-distribution, etc. In addition to the suggestions, the National Industrial Association also sent representatives to Beijing to petition. However, whether the petition result can achieve its purpose is quite problematic. For example, regarding the opposition to the pre-collection of income tax at six times last year's rate, Dong Xianguang specifically issued a statement believing that the standard of six times is only a part of the tax payable. The actual situation will be checked in the future, and taxes will have to be made up except for those whose business has indeed suffered losses. If there are indeed losses, they will be refunded, and the government will pay interest. According to him, the income tax levied this year is the income of the previous year, so it is actually estimated at six times, not pre-collected, etc. This statement is like pouring cold water on the representatives who went to Beijing to petition and the majority of members waiting for good news in Shanghai. As for the general manufacturers who are only exempt from closing down, I am afraid there will be more feelings.

Speaking of the proposals of the Shanghai Industrial Association, its content can be divided into two points. One is aimed at the government, that is, advocating that the government increase the variety and quantity of workers' physical distribution and reduce the distribution price to avoid index increases. The second is to deal with workers, that is, requiring the authorities to rigidly stipulate that the calculation of wages must be based on the index of the month before the month of issuance. This kind of proposal of the Municipal Industrial Association does have its difficulties, but everyone knows that the faster the price increases, the farther their monetary income will be from their actual income. Therefore, wanting to calculate the actual salary issued in this month according to the cost of living index last month is probably not tolerable by the majority of people who live hand-to-mouth. Then all the requirements can only be directed at the government authorities, but can the authorities not reduce or even increase the physical distribution to employees? I am afraid it is another difficult problem that cannot be solved. In this year, even entrepreneurs engaged in production have been squeezed into the cracks and cannot be supported!

So many smart ancestral lines have had to turn to the south, and the idea of increasing profits has made people plan to build another paradise. In this time of turmoil and wind and rain in the Central Plains, the cry for factories to move south is clamoring everywhere. However, according to reports, after a certain industrial tycoon returned from inspecting South China, he had many feelings. The industrialist believed that the South was even more lacking in raw materials, and product sales were also very difficult. Moreover, according to the tycoon's analysis, industry needs mutual assistance, and a small number of industrial relocations are of no help. The conclusion is that the machine industry and various factories will no longer plan to relocate.

Indeed, in this difficult place and difficult season, all fantasies are inevitably shattered by ruthless objective facts.

(2) Foreign Exchange: The benchmark rate was adjusted again on Tuesday of last week. The US dollar was raised from 149,000 yuan to 195,000 yuan, which is still far behind the black market price of gold and silver, but in terms of the benchmark rate itself, it has increased by 30% again. It is said that the increase in foreign exchange can not only bring black market remittances into the right track, but also stimulate exports. However, after this adjustment of the market price of foreign exchange, the prices of general export goods, like previous increases in foreign exchange, have generally increased. For example, the production cost of sausage casings must be priced at 80 million yuan per barrel. However, foreign prices are falling day by day, and although foreign exchange has been raised again, the market price is still 25 million yuan, which is not enough to cover the huge cost. In addition, the market price of by-product light intestines has reached 80 million yuan, which is only enough to maintain production costs. In addition, duck feathers are between 6.5 million and 8 million yuan per sima dan, and Huzhou wool is 3 million yuan per dan, with very few Hakka people selling. In addition, the selling price of No. 17 local bristles has risen from 47 million to 52 million. According to this situation, although foreign exchange has been continuously raised, domestic and foreign prices have not been balanced. Obviously, engaging in exports at the current exchange rate and production cost is still unavoidable to lose money.

Whether foreign exchange can continue to be raised, and whether the market price after the increase can be close to the black market price to ensure that the black market price will no longer rise, are all problems. Therefore, a certain person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Export Management Committee once stated that in order to strengthen exports, in addition to adjusting the exchange rate, the purchase method will also be adopted at the same time. It is said that when the foreign exchange rate cannot promote the export of materials at a certain time and in a certain environment, the government will try to purchase them. Moreover, it is said that if exporters want to export on their own, the government will never force purchases. Otherwise, the government will purchase them and then have the exporters distribute them on their behalf. It is said that the purpose of this method is to assist exporters and promote export trade. However, in today's situation where the market price of foreign exchange can never keep up with the black market price, exporters are afraid that they have to gradually give their own export business to the control of the authorities in order to avoid losses when settling foreign exchange for exports. As for the exporters themselves, they have to become a technician who distributes on their behalf.

Furthermore, in terms of the proposed export material loan method, I am afraid that those who are truly benefited by the loan are still limited to the number of export products that the government can control. Therefore, the Import and Export Business Association expressed its opinions on improving the export material loan method last week: The main ones are (1) Export loans should not be limited to only a few items such as tung oil, Shantou yarn, raw silk, tea, bristles, and egg products, but should include general commodities. (2) Excess loans should be declared by the exporters themselves, and the quantity should be verified based on the number of foreign exchange that can be exported within a specified period. (3) Extend the total application period to six months. (4) Collateral can be guaranteed by bank credit, otherwise it can be mortgaged with commodity valuable securities or other real estate. (5) The interest rate should be handled according to the method of not exceeding 3% per month.

The crux of the problem is obviously whether the conflict of interests between the official and the private sectors can be reconciled. For the income of foreign exchange, the authorities are only afraid of getting too little. Exporters naturally understand this point. Therefore, although the authorities of the Export Management Committee expressed their approval "in principle" to the above request, they still had to go to Beijing last week to make "technical" consultations with the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices for the loan opening issue!

### The Situation of the Match Industry in Shanghai

There are currently twenty-five match factories in Shanghai, with a total of two hundred and twenty-six board-making machines, producing approximately 24,000 boxes per month, each box containing 7,200 small boxes. Among them, the Great China Match Factory is the largest, possessing one-fifth of all the board-making machines and its output accounts for one-fifth of the total. In addition to supplying the needs of this city, most of the products are transported and sold to North China and inland areas. Recently, due to the impact of the war, transportation has been obstructed, and sales have been poor. Furthermore, the main raw materials for manufacturing matches all rely on foreign imports. The sources and required quantities are listed below:

Sources and Required Quantities of Raw Materials

Name　Source　Quantity Required per Box　Quantity Required for a Monthly Production of 20,000 Boxes (in kilograms)

Potassium Chlorate　USA, Domestic　5.45　109,000

Paraffin Oil　USA　4.54　90,800

Rawhide Intestines　Domestic　48　3,000

Sulfur Flowers　USA　41　8,200

Red Phosphorus　USA　31　6,200

Rosin　USA　22　4,400

Potassium Dichromate　USA　14　2,800

Zinc Chloride　USA　14　2,800

Lampblack　USA, Domestic　08

Manganese Dichloride　Domestic　82

Trisulfide　This City　31

Amber　Singapore, Domestic　37

Fine Glass Powder　This City

Rose Red　USA

Chrome Yellow　Australia　7.8 kg

Phosphoric Acid　3.9 kg

Phosphoric Acid　Australia　3.9 kg

1,000 lbs Kraft Paper　USA　8 sheets　160,000 sheets

26 lbs Blue Paper　USA　89 sheets　1,780,000 sheets

55 lbs Red-Green Paper　USA　60 sheets　1,200,000 sheets

28 lbs Yellow Paper　USA　33 sheets　660,000 sheets

Cottonwood　USA, Qingdao　72 sq ft　1,400,000 sq ft

Planing Knives　France　120 pieces

Cutting Knives　France　120 pieces

Raw Sulfur　USA

Box Pieces　Domestic　7,000 pieces　144,000,000 sets

Trademark Paper　This City　7,200 pieces　144,000,000 sets

Since the implementation of import restrictions and allocations, the allocations have been decreasing each quarter, and the goods are becoming scarcer and more expensive, making sourcing even more difficult. Taking only potassium chlorate as an example, the current monthly demand, based on a production volume of 20,000 boxes, is 110,000 kilograms, with a current value of US$0.456 per kilogram, totaling approximately US$50,000. However, the current foreign exchange allocation per quarter is only US$150,000, which, in reality, is only enough to purchase this one raw material. The foreign exchange for other raw materials is then not available. In addition, the increasing cost of living and the increasing expenses further threaten the factories. Therefore, the current match industry has reached its most difficult stage, and it is not easy to maintain operations.

Science

### The Source of Solar Energy

— Zhou Shimin

The energy radiated by the sun into the external world every second is equal to the total energy that can be produced by five trillion atomic bombs. Scientists have been discussing this astonishing question for several centuries, trying to understand the source of that output energy.

The first relatively well-known scientific explanation was proposed about a hundred years ago. The explanation was based on the idea that the sun's energy is due to gravity, just like a stone falling to the earth requires energy. Because of the sun's enormous mass, it gradually contracts under its own gravitational pull, and gradually releases a large amount of energy.

If the energy radiated by the sun truly originated from gravity, then mathematical calculations would tell us that the energy would be exhausted within a period shorter than the Earth's lifespan! As for other mechanical explanations of "energy generation", they have also been proposed, but none of them can be expressed very well.

By 1930, the research of Sir A. Eddington and other astrophysicists in England proved that the sun is a mass of incandescent gas, with a core temperature of about 20 million degrees Celsius. At such high temperatures, not only are molecules broken down into atoms, but electrons are also stripped from the atoms. These atomic nuclei collide with each other at any time, causing nuclear changes. This is the source of the sun's energy.

The nuclear change from one type of atom to another has also been tested in the laboratory, and the energy released is a million times higher than ordinary chemical reactions. However, the efficiency of nuclear reactions produced in the laboratory is too low, and the result is often that the energy produced is less than the total amount of input. We know that only the high heat of the sun can provide sufficient opportunities to automatically maintain its own nuclear reactions.

In 1938, the German Hans Bethe made a detailed examination of known nuclear reactions, and came to the conclusion that the chain nuclear reaction of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen has good reason to be regarded as the source of solar energy generation. This chain reaction is called the Carbon Cycle. The carbon cycle can almost certainly be regarded as the source of energy for the sun and other stars.

What is the carbon cycle? Obviously, the carbon cycle is not just a single nuclear reaction, but a set of reactions that occur sequentially, starting with a hydrogen nucleus, which is a proton, and an atomic nucleus with an atomic weight of twelve, called carbon-12. The proton collides with the carbon-12 atomic nucleus, breaking through the electrical repulsion it encounters and being absorbed into a radioactive nitrogen-13 atomic nucleus. The nitrogen-13 atomic nucleus automatically emits a positron with a positive charge, and then transforms into carbon-13.

In the hot gas inside the sun, carbon, after a short moment of nuclear orbiting, acquires another proton and becomes a stable nitrogen-14 atomic nucleus. This nitrogen nucleus will continue to move until it acquires another proton to form a radioactive oxygen-15 atomic nucleus. Then another Positron Disintegration appears, generating a nitrogen isotope with an atomic weight of fifteen. After some time of movement, the final reaction occurs, but the atomic nucleus reaction at this moment is no longer a simple reception, but the final atomic nucleus splits into two, one is the carbon-12 atomic nucleus, and the other is the ordinary helium atomic nucleus, with an atomic weight of four.

In summary, after six reactions, only the changes of four protons and three positrons produce stable helium atomic nuclei, but this production method releases a staggering amount of atomic energy. The energy released by one pound of hydrogen in this way is more than ten times greater than the maximum efficiency of energy released by one pound of uranium in an atomic bomb. In fact, the storage of this energy is indeed very large. If our sun emits radiant energy at its current rate, it can last for at least five hundred trillion years without feeling a lack of fuel.

It is worth noting that the carbon is re-reduced without any loss in the carbon cycle. Although carbon is a relatively abundant element, it is not as abundant as nitrogen. Therefore, if carbon is consumed, the fuel supply may be exhausted within a certain period of time, perhaps fifty million years, while nitrogen can maintain the future life of the sun for five hundred trillion years under these circumstances!

In the laboratory, all nuclear reactions in the carbon cycle have been observed and measured. The atomic energy released by the Swlf-regenerative Cerbon Cycle does indeed conform to the solar radiation energy determined in the observation. Moreover, no other atomic nucleus reaction is so close to the energy numbers radiated by the sun at a high temperature of 20 million degrees Celsius, which can serve as a powerful basis for confirming the accuracy of this "theory."

It is worth pointing out the similarities and differences between the nuclear reactions that exist in the sun and the reactions that occur in atomic bombs. One or two of them store a large amount of energy in the atomic nucleus, and once the reaction starts, it promotes continued progress with its own power. But the similarities are limited to this. Later, carbon atomic nuclei are regenerated in the sun, while uranium atomic nuclei are permanently eroded in atomic bombs. The carbon cycle contains all light atomic nuclei, and the release of energy is when the lightest atomic nucleus—the proton—creates a larger helium atomic nucleus. Atomic bombs, on the other hand, contain the heaviest atomic nuclei—uranium and protactinium, and the release of energy is when they disintegrate into two almost equal parts.

Finally, the most important difference is that the carbon cycle occurs between protons and other atomic nuclei that carry a charge, while atomic bombs are reactions between neutrons and other atomic nuclei that do not carry a charge. This is the point that explains why on Earth, we can only use atomic nucleus fission, and not a set of atomic nucleus reactions like the carbon cycle, to produce a practical amount of atomic energy. Because uncharged neutrons can penetrate uranium and protactinium atomic shuttles at room temperature, while the carbon cycle requires extremely high temperatures, and at high temperatures, protons must also be endowed with high speeds in order to effectively overcome the electrical repulsion possessed by carbon and nitrogen to achieve the purpose of combination.

Regarding this point, we can assert that we need high speed for protons in the circulating system in order to use it to start the carbon cycle. The main difference lies in this. All protons in the sun are endowed with high speeds, while only a very small amount can be produced in the laboratory. At the same time, when protons pass through matter, its degree is sharply reduced. The atomic nuclei in the sun always maintain a certain speed, so the reactions between carbon nuclei and nitrogen nuclei can proceed indefinitely and maintain themselves. This is also cyclic. The energy released by the carbon cycle generates high temperatures, and the thermal energy of this high temperature also allows the carbon cycle to continue.

Can we generate the same high temperatures on Earth as in the sun? This is a new question. Finally, I will answer you like this.

It can be said that this is possible with atomic bombs, but even if we can generate this high temperature, we cannot maintain it, because the heat will immediately dissipate in the form of various bond radiation energies. The large amount of matter surrounding the center of the sun can prevent radiation from escaping quickly. There are many situations on Earth that we cannot imitate, so it can almost be said with certainty that we will never be able to maintain a nuclear reaction like the sun.

### Physics for Entertainment

— Wang Qiande

An Introduction to a Good Book

Generally speaking, in physics textbooks, the descriptions of phenomena or laws are all serious. A set of modified words is used, and a phenomenon or law is explained quite seriously. Then, like traditionalists, an example is given. The law then comes to an end – that is still a relatively well-compiled textbook – or even some textbooks are hard to find even one example. As a result, after reading the entire physics book, or memorizing all the laws, formulas, and principles of physics, you still get nothing. This situation is the most pitiful and the most terrible.

Physics for Entertainment can be said to be a booklet specially for giving examples in physics. Moreover, some examples are rarely encountered in any physics books, so it is a supplementary textbook for physics. Although it does not explain the laws of physics clearly, after some simple or novel examples, those laws of physics are clearly displayed in your mind, and there is no ambiguity at all. Besides, the words in this book are very lighthearted, making people feel no trouble and burden when reading it.

Physics for Entertainment is divided into ten chapters. Each chapter talks about examples with completely different natures. Its order is also arranged similarly to ordinary physics. The first chapter is "Speed," followed by "Gravity and Pressure," "Basic Laws of Mechanics," "Environmental Resistance," and the last chapter talks about "Magnetism and Electricity." Which part of the wheel moves faster?

Almost everyone has seen the fact that wheels rotate, but perhaps only a few people have noticed, or even no such idle people, standing by the roadside all day long, gazing at the wheels of passing cars, to notice a novel thing, that is, "The upper part of the wheel moves faster than the lower part. If you look at the wheel spokes (or bicycle spokes) of any carriage (or bicycle) when it is speeding, you can also see that the upper wheel spokes are mixed together, while the lower part can still be seen as separated. The situation that the upper part of the wheel moves faster than the lower part still occurs." After such a description in the book, there are also some small experiments and proofs.

A Question That Is Not a Joke

When a speeding train runs past in front of you, you will feel dizzy or uncomfortable, but have you ever noticed the wheels of this speeding train? "In a speeding train, there are also wheels that do not move forward but backward. Indeed, this action is only in a very small fraction of a second. However, the fact that this speeding train moves backward does exist, no matter how contrary it is to our daily perception" — Physics for Entertainment says this, and there are also three illustrations used to prove that this fact is accurate.

Walking and Running

Chinese people often feel "unintelligible" about what they do. This feeling of "unintelligible" is a disease caused by the low level of academic education. To cure this epidemic is not an easy task. It is excusable that we feel we do not know why for complex and profound things, but "walking and running" are closest to you, and you should not not understand their truth. In Physics for Entertainment, there are two pictures and some words, which give a detailed description of these two ordinary actions.

Should You Jump Forward When Getting Out of a Car?

People who grow up in cities must have seen the phenomenon of "jumping off a car." Before the car has stopped, some experienced people can get on and off freely, just like when the car stops. Honestly speaking, as long as you can hold on to the support on the car when jumping on, it is foolproof, and there is no danger that can arise. However, getting off the car can cause great danger, so it must be done by experienced people and jump backward. "Never jump towards the front of the vehicle's movement, because the speed given to our body by inertia when jumping backward can be eliminated, so that when our body lands, there is no danger of strong tilting."

Where Will an Object Be Heavier?

The weight of an object is produced by the earth's gravitational pull; but the question "Where will an object be heavier?" seems a bit novel. Indeed, this is a question that ordinary people have not imagined, but Physics for Entertainment tells us: "Objects are heavier near the ground. As an object goes deeper into the earth, its weight also decreases. If it reaches the center of the earth, the weight will disappear completely. Moreover, when an object is slightly higher off the ground, its amount will also decrease."

Perpetual Motion Machine

Although this is somewhat close to fantasy, it is also a text worth reading.

Others, like "Where Does the Gunfire Come From?" "How Much Is a Lightning Bolt Worth?" "Can Archimedes Lift the Earth?" "Is It Faster in the Day or Faster at Night?" "Non-Stop Train," are all excellent articles.

In short, for friends who hate physics, after reading Physics for Entertainment, they will naturally feel interesting. Friends who love physics will gain more valuable knowledge after reading it. (Physics for Entertainment, written by Soviet Perelman, translated by Cui Shangxin, Kaiming Edition)

### The Gaoshan People of Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan

— H.K. Zhou

Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan not only has scenery and power, but also a treasure trove of anthropology – the Gaoshan people.

There are a total of eight types of Gaoshan people in Taiwan, including primitive ethnic groups with dark skin, facial tattoos, and shell bead clothing. In the past, the Japanese called them "savages," but now they are called Gaoshan people. Each ethnic group does not speak the same language, and they have no writing system. However, the Gaoshan people by Sun Moon Lake have been Sinicized and, on the surface, are almost the same as ordinary rural folks. However, their lives are simple, so you can still see traces of their primitive existence everywhere.

They only arrived at Sun Moon Lake 273 years ago, settled on the east side of the lake, and lived by farming and hunting. The entire ethnic group has more than 4,000 people, ruled by one chieftain and two squad leaders. In the past, they had to train in arms. When they fought with other tribes, the entire ethnic group would turn out, and everyone was a fighter. Their weapons included spears, short knives, bows, and arrows. The chieftain was the most prestigious and most skilled in martial arts in the entire tribe.

Their sources of livelihood include agriculture, fishing, and hunting. They eat by putting food in bowls and grabbing it with their hands. During the farming season, men and women work from sunrise to sunset. Men take care of the fields, and women take care of household affairs, weaving, and papermaking. Their houses are very simple, all made of firewood. Some also make mud walls. Their means of water transportation are still primitive dugout canoes. When they are free from farming, they go hunting and fishing.

They also have a God, their own God, whom every family must worship.

They have no calendar and rely entirely on celestial phenomena to predict the time. Therefore, the time for the New Year is not the end of our lunar year but our Mid-Autumn Festival in August. The New Year is the most important festival of the year for them and also their happiest time. They celebrate the New Year for half a month, from the Mid-Autumn Festival in August to the end of August. During this half-month, they only drink, sing, and dance all day long, and they do not care about anything else. They also make their own wine and love to drink very much. When drinking, they use large bowls. If they have a good capacity for wine, they invite guests to drink with large bowls, and guests must drink it all in one gulp. It is impolite not to finish it, so tourists who cannot hold their liquor dare not go there during their New Year. Their best friends drink a bowl of wine together. They also love to smoke, and they are very addicted to it. The pipe is made of bamboo tubes.

Speaking of the Gaoshan people's singing and dancing, it can arouse our interest: When singing, men and women gather in a square. Each woman takes a wooden stick that is thick at both ends and thin in the middle, called a "pestle." The long ones are seven or eight feet long, and the short ones are four or five feet long. Children take the short ones. Everyone gathers around a flat stone and constantly knocks the wooden sticks on the stone, which can emit a kind of different thicknesses of drumming sounds. Women who do not hold wooden sticks squat beside them, each holding a bamboo tube and only knocking on the ground, which can emit another thicker drumming sound. Such a collective drumming is very rhythmic and sounds very complex. After drumming for a while, they begin to sing. Everyone's voice is different in pitch, but they are very harmonious. According to what I heard, it is at least a two-part female chorus. After singing, everyone puts down the wooden sticks, holds hands, and forms a circle, and then starts dancing. Their hands have no movements, only the jumping of their feet. It can probably be divided into four kinds of steps. Sometimes they jump in circles, sometimes they shrink the circle, and sometimes they enlarge it. The movements are neat and natural. Later, they even jump and sing. After singing for a while, they rest, which is considered the end of a section.

The appearance and color of their clothes are very bright and eye-catching, and there are sometimes distinctions between seasons and classes. The material of the clothes is already cotton fabric (most of which are now bought from outside). Some of the men's coats are made of animal skin, and they also wrap a piece of skin on their heads as a hat. Men and women all have bare feet and have not yet invented shoes (some of the shoes now are introduced from the outside). We can still see many primitive qualities from their decorations and clothes, but now they are no longer what they used to be. Almost all of them are wearing Han clothing.

What interests tourists most now is a pair of princesses of the Gaoshan people, especially the Second Princess, who is beautiful and lively, only in her twenties. In addition to speaking their native language, she can also speak Japanese and not very fluent Mandarin. Every tourist can become her honorary son-in-law there. For a hundred dollars (Taiwan currency), she can take a photo with you as a souvenir. Now, these two princesses are completely unlike the Gaoshan people. When guests come, they dress up and take photos with the guests. After the photos are taken, they take off their native clothes, put on Han clothing, and also have their hair permed and wear high-heeled leather shoes. They look like a modern lady. Her income from taking photos every day averages two or three thousand Taiwan dollars, so it is obvious that she has transformed from the ruling class into the bourgeoisie!

The life of the Gaoshan people is still more difficult than that of ordinary people. They usually eat coarse vegetables and brown rice, or even porridge. They only eat a little rice noodles during the New Year, which shows how difficult their lives are. The main reasons are, of course, the low level of production and the backwardness of culture. In the past, they were a large tribe of more than 4,000 people, but later, because of the difficult living conditions, they moved out. Now, there are only more than 200 people left. There are a total of more than 140,000 Gaoshan people in Taiwan. Those who hide in the mountains still live their primitive lives, and those who have contact with the outside world are gradually assimilated. They can speak Taiwanese, wear Han clothing, and engage in agriculture as a profession, and their lives are relatively prosperous. Schools have also been widely established within their areas to educate them. They are all new citizens of the country. I hope that the country will send more ethnologists to their place to investigate so as to improve their lives.

### The Eve of 317: The Vigilance We Should Have

— Ding Jiwan

The day after tomorrow is the National Doctors' Day that deserves our vigilance. Looking back on the past, the enthusiastic situation of the National Doctors' community striving for status and petitioning is still vivid in our minds. However, in recent years, with the successive internal and external troubles, the entire society has fallen into an abnormal state. National doctors and national medicine have also escaped this example with difficulty. Worries and hardships do not allow us to be optimistic.

Every year when 317 comes, we inevitably commemorate it, but we must not ignore the true meaning of the commemoration. Every year when we commemorate, we reflect on whether we have made significant progress and great achievements. Given that the future of national medicine is facing numerous thorns, we must not be discouraged. As long as we are willing to work hard and eliminate the current difficulties, the only goal should be how to promote the unique essence of Eastern medicine and develop its bright future. This is what Jiwan sincerely hopes for. 3/15

### Prolonged Menstruation and Metrorrhagia

— Shen Zhongli

Curettage as a Cause

Prolonged menstruation refers to continuous and unceasing menstrual bleeding, dripping and unclean, occurring in small amounts. Metrorrhagia refers to a sudden and profuse menstrual flow, like a tidal wave breaking through a dam, but also caused by overexertion and internal injury, leading to sudden congestion. It is not uncommon to see cases where prolonged menstruation initially occurs, followed by metrorrhagia. Western medicine pathology often attributes it to uterine congestion, initially caused by inflammation of the uterine lining. Western medicine, to prevent its spread, sometimes performs curettage. According to patients' accounts, after multiple curettage procedures, profuse or continuous bleeding often occurs, or after the bleeding stops, it suddenly returns uncontrollably after a period of time. Even hemostatic agents are ineffective. This is likely related to the weakened uterine lining caused by curettage, which makes it prone to bleeding. If it is a case of chronic endometritis, simple anti-inflammatory vaginal washes should suffice. Curettage is more harmful than beneficial. It is like prescribing dispersing and invigorating remedies when traditional Chinese medicine calls for tonifying and astringing agents. A disconnect in diagnosis leads to ineffective treatment. The different treatments for these conditions are outlined below for the reader's reference.

"Prolonged Menstruation" can occur before or after menstruation, recurring every few days, with dark-colored blood containing small clots, or pale red blood, accompanied by leucorrhea. It can also be caused by emotional upset and anger during menstruation, affecting the liver Qi, manifested as abdominal distension, headache, and constipation. These conditions are all related to imbalance of the Chong meridian (ovarian inflammation), but the medication used varies depending on whether the condition is deficient or excessive. For excessive conditions, blood-activating and Qi-regulating herbs, supplemented with heat-clearing agents, are appropriate. For deficient conditions, blood-tonifying and astringent herbs are necessary, along with attention to rest.

"Metrorrhagia" is not always due to deficiency and blood loss. Deficient and excessive patterns must be differentiated. Deficient patterns are often due to the inability of the Chong and Ren meridians to control the blood, manifested as aversion to cold, pale complexion, palpitations, and lower back pain. Treatment should focus on Qi-tonifying and blood-astringing methods. If there is also liver Yang rising, manifested as a pale complexion with red lips, flushed cheeks, and a red tongue, then Yin-nourishing and heat-clearing herbs should be added. Excessive patterns often involve internal obstruction due to retained blood stasis, preventing new blood from returning to the meridians. Treatment should focus on hemostatic and blood-activating methods. The use of appropriate medication based on the condition is invariably effective.

### Scrofula and Carbuncles

— Zhu Renkang

What Are the Differences? How Are They Treated?

Scrofula and carbuncles are both external diseases, but their onset speed and symptoms are different. The severity and difficulty of treatment also vary. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between them.

First, let's discuss "carbuncles." They develop quickly, with redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Early treatment with external plasters and internal heat-clearing and swelling-reducing medications can often lead to resolution. In more severe cases, the skin becomes tense and pus forms in about a week. Surgical incision and drainage should be performed immediately. After the pus is drained, the swelling subsides, the pain stops, and the fever subsides. The wound heals and closes quickly.

This type of carbuncle is more common, such as "cervical carbuncles" in the neck, "arm carbuncles" in the arms, and "leg carbuncles" in the legs. They are all easily treated. "Scrofula," on the other hand, is very different. It develops very slowly, starting as a very small, hard nodule under the skin. There is no redness or pain. Because the onset is not acute, it is often ignored and left untreated. Over time, it gradually enlarges and, when it ruptures, it does not discharge pus, but a thin, yellowish fluid mixed with caseous material. The wound is depressed and, if not treated properly, it takes a long time to heal. Examples include "scrofula" in the neck and "wandering phlegm" (commonly known as "scrofulous abscesses") that can occur throughout the body. These are all surgical tuberculosis conditions. Patients are often weak and require the patient treatment of an experienced doctor, with attention to nutritional support, to achieve a cure.

There are also milder cases of phlegm nodules, such as "wind phlegm" and "monkey phlegm" that occur in the neck. The initial symptoms are similar to scrofula, but they start with pain and easily suppurate if not dispersed. They are also easily treated.

### Stroke and Hypertension

— Xu Yiqian

At this time of spring awakening, the number of stroke patients is noticeably increasing. This is because liver Yang rises in the spring, and for those with kidney Yin deficiency, the deficient Yang disturbs the upper part of the body, causing the brain to lose its master, which is what Western medicine calls hypertension. Pathologically, it is actually caused by arteriosclerosis. This condition occurs suddenly, and those over the age of fifty, with declining vitality, often regard it as a warning sign.

The incidence of stroke is no less in Western countries than in China. Iodides, calcium, ice packs, and bloodletting are commonly used for treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine often uses seaweed, kelp, arisaema, calamus, antelope horn, and rhinoceros horn, with significant success. For prevention, attention should be paid to daily care. Rejuvenation pills are often taken. The author has used Return to Heaven Rejuvenation Pills with even more certain effect. Among the main ingredients are rhinoceros horn, which strengthens the heart and stops bleeding, and is especially suitable for emergency treatment of those who have already suffered a stroke (these pills are available at Hong Ji Tang in Ti Lan Qiao).

### Contentment Within

— Jing Wen

Pessimism and hedonism are two extreme views of life, but neither can be said to be a sound philosophy. Here, we will discuss hedonism.

The purpose of hedonism is undoubtedly to pursue happiness and joy, so it is sometimes called optimism. Those who embrace the "drink today, for tomorrow we die" attitude also consider themselves optimists. However, true optimists and hedonists are different. True optimists must have the ability to accept adversity and adapt to circumstances. They do not seek happiness and joy at all costs. Although optimists do not crave progress, their view of life is closer to nature.

Hedonism, which seeks only pleasure and happiness, is different. This type of person believes that happiness can be "found" and happiness can be pursued. At its worst, they even think that "joining the crowd" and "seeking thrills" are ways to find pleasure. For example, when going to the movies, many people try every means to get a ticket, even if it means struggling to get one. As for whether the film is worth the effort, they don't even bother to ask. Drinking must be done to the point of intoxication, and gambling must continue all night long in order to be stimulating and pleasurable.

But a true optimist would never do that. The basic attitude of an optimist is to do things when the mood strikes and to be content with what comes. They would never join the crowd to watch a movie, they would never argue with others about drinking, and even gambling, the most stimulating of activities, would have its limits. They don't engage in worrying thoughts, but they are not so foolish as to be unable to distinguish right from wrong. Their so-called optimism is simply the natural philosophy encompassed by the four words "contentment within."

Recently, I saw these words in the filler column of a Western magazine: "Happiness cannot be pursued, but only understood and inspired." It also says: "In pursuing a distorted utopia, people often overlook the simple beauty and happiness in life. In pursuing the fleeting rainbow of material things, we lose the opportunity to appreciate the splendor of the spirit." These words truly express the attitude towards life held by a true optimist.

The meaning of joy and happiness originally has a greater spiritual component than a material one. A person who is hungry, cold, or suffering from illness cannot be said to have any happiness or joy, but it can be asserted that happiness and joy cannot be obtained solely through material life. Although the poor generally suffer, the rich are not necessarily happy. This is not an "Ah Q" mentality. A universally prosperous society naturally contributes greatly to human happiness and joyful living. For example, if society is prosperous, everyone is well-dressed and well-fed, and everything is pleasing to the eye, then everyone will naturally be happy and reduce many external responses of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. But even if there were such a paradise on earth, individuals would not necessarily react in the same way.

Because happiness and joy have no definite boundaries, and although material life has some influence on them, it is not a decisive influence. The decisive influence is a person's spiritual perspective, which is each individual's attitude towards life. The natural world has no such thing as happiness or unhappiness, we don't need to "pursue" them at all. The feeling of happiness depends entirely on the degree of connection between our hearts and the natural world. Happiness gained by force is only a fleeting stimulus.

To conclude this article, I will quote a few words from Thomas Edison, which were also quoted in the filler column: "We only know one ten-thousandth of anything in the world." Therefore, we should open our minds to all beautiful things, let our hearts absorb life as much as possible, and extend our hands, which have only been in contact with filth, to the stars in the sky.

But I must add one sentence: Everything must be free of artificiality. Because only those who can experience "contentment within" in the natural world can obtain true joy and true happiness.

### Unemployment Insurance

— Chao Ran

Insurance companies are springing up everywhere nowadays, and their businesses are diverse and varied. However, the strangest insurance deal is probably one done with insurance companies in England and France.

In 1925, King Prajadhipok of Siam ascended the throne. Seeing the unstable political situation, he took out a large "unemployment insurance" policy with British and French insurance companies. Sure enough, he was forced to abdicate in 1935, and relied on this settlement to enjoy the rest of his years until his death in 1941. According to insurance industry sources, King Prajadhipok is the only head of state in history to insure himself against abdication.

### The Greatness of the World

— Le

Thomas Jefferson, the first Secretary of State of the United States, had a total of only five staff members in the Department of State during his tenure, but at that time the Department of State only had to deal with four foreign countries. Now, under the leadership of Marshall, the total number of employees in the Department of State has reached 18,500, but the number of countries that have diplomatic relations with the United States has also increased to 61.

After World War II, more than 58% of the U.S. troops stationed in Germany were under the age of twenty.

### Whispers Before the Orchid

— Ping Zhai

Returning from the city, my wife and children were out. The curtains were quiet, but filled with the faint fragrance of a few pots of orchids. Outside the window, the faint sunlight was gradually setting in the west, and the pigeons were still strolling leisurely, and I suddenly felt that I had stolen a moment of peace in the bustling world.

Suddenly I remembered that the word "orchid" is often seen in Western literature. For example, in Wilde's plays, whenever he describes a boudoir, he often mentions casually, "There are beautiful orchids on the table"; sometimes, he simply says: "Boudoir, orchids, perfume." As if the reader should be responsible for other imaginings. In Wilde's dreams, orchids add nobility, warmth, and a faint fragrance to the ivory palace.

I gently stroked the dark green, graceful leaves, and thought of a painter who called himself "the laziest man in the world." He painted orchids with the brush of Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, with caution in his ease, famous for his elegance and beauty. But what about the orchids that my hand is now stroking? How do they compare to those exquisitely framed paintings? Those countless leaves may not be beautiful, but they are far from the perfect and natural composition of the paintings. I couldn't help but move the pot to a different position. No, I couldn't place it to my satisfaction.

To place it in the most appropriate way, I would probably have to use scissors? But why! On second thought, some say that Zhong Yao's and Wang Xizhi's calligraphy ultimately fell short, precisely because they had a bit of "scissors skills" in mind before they put their pens down? I couldn't help but smile.

I also laugh at myself. People with money buy this and that, and they always listen for news when they have time - or listen to rumors if there is no news, and then rush to buy this and that. Everyone jumps into the car and wishes they could get to the market immediately to make a deal. They talk business all day long, talk business while eating, and talk business on the phone even when they get home at night. Tomorrow, they jump out of bed and rush to the market again, it's business, business, business. And I'm still wandering in front of the orchids, thinking of Wilde and Zhong Yao and Wang Xizhi, isn't that absurd!

So, I happily poured wine and punished myself with a large goblet.

### Happy Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (98)

As Qi Wan spoke, she patted the edge of the bed and said, "Please sit down!" Dao Yun did not sit down, but squatted in front of the bed and said, "I said, please don't be offended, Miss Gu, I... I... I hope to cooperate thoroughly with Miss Gu." Qi Wan said: "Of course, cooperation must be thorough, how can you only do half of it and then stop." Dao Yun said: "That's not what I mean, I mean to cooperate for life, I'm being presumptuous to say this, but I do have this hope, because a career must have two people who are like-minded and have shared interests in order to do it thoroughly." Qi Wan said: "That's for sure." Dao Yun said: "I'm in the film industry, Miss Gu is in the Peking Opera industry, we don't get angry, we both have considerable experience. We will definitely have considerable results when we cooperate, that's for sure." Qi Wan said: "Yes, that's what I think too." Dao Yun said: "I... I have another extravagant wish, since I saw Miss Gu, I've had a deep impression in my mind, now fate brings us together and we meet in the hospital, and we get along well, we are very compatible, I would like to form a couple with each other, it will be of great hope for our future careers." As he spoke, he was squatting in front of the bed, and after saying that sentence, he knelt straight in front of the bed to propose marriage. Qi Wan, seeing that he was coming too suddenly, hurriedly said: "Get up! If the nurses see it, wouldn't they laugh!" Dao Yun said: "No! Miss Gu! Promise me!" Qi Wan said: "Get up first, let me consider it!" Dao Yun stood up. Qi Wan said: "Please go out first, let me think carefully." Dao Yun, seeing that Qi Wan was asking him to leave, was afraid that this matter would become deadlocked again, and said, "Can I come back in half an hour?" Qi Wan nodded with a smile. Dao Yun said: "This matter is related to my life's fortune, I hope Miss Gu won't disappoint me!" Qi Wan still nodded with a smile, watched Dao Yun leave, lay on the pillow, and sighed slightly. Her mind, after this stimulation, was very chaotic. She calmed herself down and thought carefully. She and Zhu Zhai could not be reunited, and Dao Yun's appearance was no less than Zhu Zhai's. His future seemed to have more development than Zhu Zhai's. She could not gain a foothold in Beiping, and going to the south would give her a mental comfort. Now that she had this opportunity, she should not miss it. When Qi Wan thought of this, she felt that there was only the reason to agree, and no reason to refuse.

### Silence

— Man Ru

Someone said: "Silence is golden." But can the value of silence be compared to gold? The value of gold is not fixed, it is limited. Silence is forever priceless.

When you face a great building, or a magnificent landscape, you are silent. Because you feel that all verbal praise is superfluous, enough to destroy your appreciation. Only in silence can you fully appreciate this greatness or magnificence in detail and with endless aftertaste.

When you suddenly meet a friend you have been dreaming of for many years, you can't speak - you are silent. Don't you have many things to tell him? So much to say to him? Suddenly meeting is such a rare opportunity. However, you are silent. Because you feel that your emotions at this time cannot be expressed in words. Everything you say is bound to be far from what you want to express. So, you are silent. Will the other person think your silence is abrupt and inhumane? No, definitely not. Because he can't speak either, he is also silent. Silence is better than words!

When you are discriminated against by the world and feel the coldness of human feelings and unhappiness, will you go around looking for people to talk to? Will you eliminate your unhappiness by venting? No, this is useless, and sometimes dangerous. You must be silent. Only in silence can you think carefully, discover your own mistakes, forgive the badness of others, rekindle your confidence in the world, and increase your enjoyment of life. This is the right and healthy thing to do. Only in silence can you get it.

Silence can increase a person's interest in life and cultivate a person's temperament. Its value is indeed infinite, and cannot be expressed in words. Maybe I have said too much. I only hope that my words will not reduce your estimate of the value of silence. Let us carefully savor the value of silence in silence.

### Sea Red Mansion Poetry Records

— Xu Banmeng

Self-Mockery

I laugh at myself, drifting across the sea,
My chest filled with clouds and thunder so free,
Living on after battles leave elders behind,
Warm thoughts fade like sparks in electric light.
My livelihood drifts with the ebb and flow,
My poetic heart lingers with the moon's glow,
Don't hate the thinness of human grace,
Heaven's eye stares, revealing time and space.

Frost and snow cover desolate towns,
Who slays the Yellow Sea whale with bare hands?
People leave ruined temples, grass grows still,
The moon sets on Penglai, a great river's chill.
Though strangely impoverished, poems I embrace,
Though old, I still boast a clear vision's trace,
Accustomed to foreign lands' bleak stay,
We see all kinds of monsters, sending life away.

The Sea of People

The sea of people flows, slapping the ground,
The setting sun is silent, descending down,
Green hills bury the bones of heroes all,
White hair drifts, hermits answer the call.
Crying birds seem to weep for flowers shed,
I often drown my sorrows with wine instead.
A hundred years, a fleeting Lu Sheng dream,
One dream of Handan, no longer it would seem!

After Reciting

Leisurely, my high-pitched verses done,
The white sun departs, brilliantly it's spun,
My homeland still in flames of war,
The empty river now frosted with snow and more.
Waking to the rooster, fearing year's end,
Digging for rats, lamenting times, it would contend,
Wanting to ask what age this might be,
Sadness overwhelms, breaking my heart, you see.

### The Art of Advertising

— Lei Hong

Mr. Hardman of Connecticut owned a farm. He wanted to sell a portion of the farm's assets, so he placed an advertisement in the classified section of the New York Times for three consecutive Sundays, but there was very little response, which disappointed him greatly.

Hardman decided to study his advertisement from the perspective of an advertiser. After analysis, he found that the psychological aspect of attracting customers' attention when selling agricultural products had not been achieved. So he decided to rewrite the advertisement and reverse the focus.

It turned out that the farm's neighbor was a famous movie star, whom we will call Joe Blanc's villa for the sake of this story. Hardman understood the value of the farm's location, but he couldn't think of a proper way to promote it, both to take advantage of the fame of the big star and to avoid being sued by Mr. Blanc.

Later, he came up with a subtle advertising narrative. He began by describing the farm, and then gave people who were interested in the farm a way to identify the location:

"After getting off the train, take bus number 16 and get off at Jones Road. Then you can inquire about the location of Joe Blanc's villa - the farm is next door to the villa."

As soon as the advertisement was published, it received twenty-eight inquiries and was sold within three days.

### On Prohibiting Dancing

— Zhou Yizhi

As the saying goes: "Strange things happen every year, but this year there are more than ever." Who would have thought that frail dancers would engage in brawls and storm the government office, leaving the dignified Social Affairs Bureau in disarray? Isn't this a strange phenomenon?

However, this is a social problem concerning the lifeline of more than 200,000 workers in Shanghai. Driven by survival fears, they acted rashly and resorted to this desperate measure, which has its reasons.

Although this issue has been raised for discussion in the recent City Council meeting and a resolution has been passed, it has not been finally resolved, and its future development is still worth noting. I think the government's reasons for prohibiting dancing are nothing more than the following: (1) Some senior government officials, due to subjective views, dislike dancing, so they use their administrative authority to implement the ban. (2) The Savings Movement Committee of the Executive Yuan suggested that the government ban all commercial dance halls nationwide during the period of suppressing the rebellion, hence the resolution of the Executive Yuan. (3) Perhaps due to the remarks of one or two foreigners criticizing that China is fighting at the front and dancing at the rear, the government took steps to ban dancing based on this.

Regarding the first point, we believe that the government should absolutely not handle a complex matter concerning the lives of the people based on the personal preferences of a few officials. A country claiming to be ruled by law should not do so. Regarding the second point, in terms of saving, we believe that the country has reached such a state of poverty and exhaustion that there are too many things that should be saved. For example, state-owned institutions, because they have money in hand, tend to spend it arbitrarily. If we really want to save, there are too many things that can be saved, too many to list. Saving by targeting dancing as the first priority, thus causing serious problems in the lives of tens of thousands of people, feels almost cruel. Regarding the third point, the words of one or two foreigners are a symbolic representation of China's current situation, and do not necessarily mean that dancing should be prohibited. We cannot take them out of context. Moreover, since the ban on dancing in Shanghai became a big uproar, foreigners have been confused. They don't understand why China wants to ban dancing. This proves that our previous reasoning is correct.

Mr. Zeshi, in his short article "My Opinion on the Ban on Dancing" in "Free Talk," prioritizes saving gasoline and suggests that the mayor should stop using cars for a week, and all agencies should stop using stoves or heating for two weeks. This is true saving and greatly benefits the country, because these things are used less and less, and cannot be reused after being used. The money in people's pockets is different. When dance patrons use it, dancers and dance hall staff get it. The total amount will not be short by a penny. Even though they trade and return, each gets what they need, and it does not harm the country at all. We think these words are also very pertinent.

All dance halls are licensed by the government and pay taxes in the same way as other businesses. Therefore, the status of dance halls is the same as that of hotels, restaurants, theaters, and cinemas. That is to say, the existence of dance halls is legal. To take a step back, even in terms of things harmful to society, dancing cannot be ranked first. Comparing dancing with things like prostitution and gambling, which is more harmful? According to the current Criminal Law, gambling, theft, opium, fraud, intimidation, etc., are all crimes, and dancing has never been included in criminal behavior. Even if the government is really determined to ban dancing, the most legitimate step should be to first ask the Legislative Yuan to pass a separate law banning dancing, or to include "dancing is a crime" in the Criminal Law. Then there will be a strong legal basis. Unfortunately, the government does not do this. With a simple order from the Executive Yuan, it deprives tens of thousands of people of their right to survival, which is quite regrettable.

The Shanghai Dance Hall Industry Association, some time ago, requested the government to withdraw the ban on dancing based on the Constitution. We deeply sympathize with them. All modern intellectuals should support justice and leave a way for people who make a living by dancing to survive.

Under the current economic situation, the result of banning dancing will inevitably force good women into prostitution, and dancers will only have one way out: to become prostitutes. Is adding this large group of prostitutes to society an evolution of society? Furthermore, regarding dancers themselves and dance industry workers, we have not heard the government give them any clear instructions and methods for changing careers. If they only use empty rhetoric and vaguely charge the dance hall owners with all future responsibilities, I am afraid that these bosses will not be able to turn stone into gold, and the problem will still be very serious.

Finally, we would like to emphasize two points: (1) All actions of the government must be in accordance with the law. If orders are used to replace laws, it will only increase chaos. Especially at the beginning of constitutional rule, it is even more important not to be the first to act illegally. (2) We must not be content to fall behind and only open reverse gears.

Social Services

### Fundraising Shortfall: Hoping for Generous Donations from All Sectors

The Qingxia Orphaned, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund, sponsored by this newspaper, received a total of thirteen applications for the twentieth time. Among them, those with incomplete procedures were temporarily postponed, and after investigation, nine applications were approved. In addition to sending special letters of notification, the list is also published below. It is hoped that the applicants will affix their original seals to the attached receipts after receiving the notification letters and come to the office to collect the funds:

Name　Approved Amount

Zhang Peng　700,000 yuan

Wang Yimin　700,000 yuan

Wu Shujiang　800,000 yuan

Jiang Chenshi　700,000 yuan

Name　Approved Amount

Liu Zi　　1,000,000 yuan

Liu Denghua 700,000 yuan

Xu Wenhua　1,000,000 yuan

Ling Chahua　800,000 yuan

In addition, due to the surge in the number of applications for this fund, the original fund is not enough to cover the expenses. It is hoped that generous people from the sea will generously donate to provide timely assistance to the suffering compatriots who are orphans, widows, poor, sick, and destitute, and to express human compassion.

Recently, Huaming Tobacco Company has been soliciting donations for the Qingxia Relief Fund and Poor Women's Maternity Assistance Fund during its nightly broadcast program on China Cultural Radio's "Air Bookstore." It has already collected a considerable amount. In addition to receiving it, this office would like to express its utmost gratitude on behalf of countless suffering compatriots.
