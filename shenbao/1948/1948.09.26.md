### The Legislative Yuan's Grain Policy Committee Discussed the Changchun Military Grain Coupon Issue Yesterday, Li Tang, Chen Liang, and Wang Fuzhou Explained the Reasons for Issuance

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's Grain Policy Committee held a plenary meeting at 9:40 AM on the 25th to discuss the issue of issuing military grain coupons in Changchun. More than 20 committee members attended, with Chen Zifeng chairing the meeting. Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang, Vice Minister of Grain Chen Liang, and Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance Wang Fuzhou were also present. The Vice Minister of Education first gave a brief explanation of the issuance and use of military grain coupons in Changchun. Vice Minister Chen then reported on the situation of raising military and civilian food supplies in Changchun, stating that the government has been working hard to transport grain to Changchun, but due to the difficulties of transportation, the insufficient tonnage of airplanes, and limited grain deliveries, the efforts have not been as ideal as hoped. Subsequently, committee members Yan Menghua, Hou Tingdu, Pi Dezhong, and others spoke one after another, saying that the issuance of military grain coupons violated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, and in fact isolated Changchun in terms of finance and economy. Changchun citizens are inevitably still subject to high prices and military and political expenses, and relatives inside the pass have no way to remit money for relief, which is unfair and unreasonable. The committee members also fiercely attacked the special classes who had previously forced the Changchun Central Bank to issue promissory notes, hoard grain, and illegally profit from large remittances into the pass, and demanded accountability. At this point, Director Wang explained the reason for the issuance of military grain coupons, saying that the promissory notes issued by the Changchun Central Bank had reached 70 trillion Northeast circulating notes. If all were to be recovered, it would require 230 million gold yuan. The total amount of gold yuan issued nationwide is only 500 million yuan. To ensure the stability of the national finance and maintain the value and credit of the gold yuan, the government, after much consideration, decided to issue military grain coupons in Changchun as a bargaining chip for transactions. The success of this measure depends on two points: first, whether it can be recovered. The salaries of public servants and soldiers are mostly remitted into the pass, which can recover a considerable amount; second, whether it can raise enough grain. The military and political grain authorities are working hard to find ways. After Wang's explanation, the committee members still expressed doubts about whether the military grain coupons would again be forced into circulation and experience malignant inflation, and about the transportation and supply of grain and materials. They all agreed that a good plan should be devised quickly. Finally, Vice Minister Li emphasized that Changchun today is an extraordinary period in an extraordinary region, and its extraordinary measures cannot be considered with ordinary concepts. The amount of promissory notes issued by the Changchun Central Bank a month ago was 40 trillion, and it has increased by more than 30 trillion in the past month. At its highest, it issued 1.8 trillion in one day. The amount issued in this one place in one month is twice the total amount issued nationwide in the past ten years. This cannot continue. All 2 billion yuan of gold yuan issued nationwide can only last a few months if placed entirely in Changchun. Moreover, military grain still needs to be purchased, and grain prices must continue to rise. The government has repeatedly studied the matter and ultimately believes that a commodity-based currency is the only feasible solution, hence this special measure that combines legal and factual considerations. The government is now actively working to transport grain and materials, and hopes that the committee members will pay attention to the facts and assist the government in solving the problem. The meeting was adjourned at 12:30. The meeting will continue in the afternoon to discuss the committee's procedural rules and other matters. The case regarding grain policy and the handling of corruption by grain officials was not reviewed due to time constraints and will be discussed at the next committee meeting, with responsible officials from the Ministry of Grain invited to attend and answer questions.

If they have not been taken back before the expiration of the exchange deadline, the custodian may exchange them on behalf of the depositors in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code regarding things without management. The Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for circulation to all levels of courts for information.

### Weekly Forum: Currency Reform and Prices

— Duan Yishan

Since the government promulgated four measures on emergency divisions of financial economy, writing and announcing currency reform, domestic economists and experts have made commentaries. Different opinions were presented, and no consensus was reached. The author, standing as a citizen of the country, calmly and objectively analyzes and studies, and still feels that he cannot but speak his mind. After analysis and research, the author makes proactive suggestions in order to solicit corrections from the enlightened.

Based on the four important measures and the speech delivered by Finance Minister Wang, I deeply feel that the major reform measures lack an overall central policy. I will elaborate as follows:

The government, considering the vicious inflation, the more severe depreciation of legal tender, the continued rise in prices, and the weakening confidence of the people in legal tender, deemed it necessary to fundamentally change the old and establish a new currency system that can win the trust of the people. Therefore, it decided to issue Gold Yuan notes, limited to 2 billion yuan, with 40% backed by gold, silver, and foreign currency, and 60% backed by other assets, and established a Supervisory Committee for Issuance Reserves to publicly inspect and report. The original purpose was to win the trust of the people, and to use currency reform as a starting point to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihoods, while controlling gold, silver, and foreign currency, and balancing domestic and international payments were the main means. The intention seemed very thorough, and the consideration was also very mature. However, considering the domestic and international economic and political situation, and the principles of economics, the current state of affairs, the relevant conditions for consolidating the currency system do not seem to be fully coordinated. But the economic phenomena manifested in the market are very natural. How long can the use of political power for control, and the use of the people's patriotism, ultimately be maintained? From the perspective of the people, of course, we can only pray with optimism, hoping that prices can truly be frozen and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. However, if the exchange rate between legal tender and the new currency is 3 million to 1, and all other factors remain unchanged, then in practice, it may be no different from issuing large denominations. Moreover, although the original legal tender has depreciated, the unit of 10,000 yuan can still be used as a minimum means of transaction. Now, with the new currency, the minimum unit is one cent, equivalent to 30,000 yuan in legal tender. In terms of daily life applications, it can be said that prices have already risen by 300%. This is the most obvious phenomenon, and it can be understood without academic research.

(Three) The Financial and Economic Control Measures stipulate that all prices are frozen at the market prices of August, and are not allowed to rise. Wages and salaries are calculated according to the August index, and are not allowed to exceed. This is indeed correct. However, all donations, fees, and the prices of state-run enterprises are calculated according to the pre-war standards, according to the silver dollar exchange rate. One pre-war silver dollar is equivalent to two new currency yuan. If the prices of state-run enterprises and national taxes are not frozen, then according to the regulations, they will inevitably rise by 100% (according to the price on August 19). From the perspective of financial policy, this can increase the national treasury revenue, but from the perspective of stabilizing prices, it directly conflicts with the interests of the people. Is there a potential to lead to price increases? This is a major loophole in the economic reform measures. However, if prices are to be stabilized, and state-run enterprises and transportation utilities are not allowed to adjust prices, and taxes are not adjusted, then the national treasury's burden remains the same, and revenue has not increased. How can revenue and expenditure be balanced? Therefore, regarding this point, if technical changes are not made during implementation, there may be obstacles to implementation.

(Three) The issuance of new currency, from the start of currency exchange to the deadline, from the 19th of August to the 19th of November, is a long period of three months. During this period, the new currency and the old currency are used simultaneously, and the amount of currency will be more inflated, and the floating assets will be more abundant. According to Fisher's quantity theory of money, and the recent increase in the velocity of legal tender, this is enough to prove and warn. Even if the control measures are strict, floating assets cannot be manipulated, and unscrupulous merchants cannot use their tricks, the unnatural result of economic activity will gradually evolve into a stagnant market and the phenomenon of hiding daily necessities.

(Four) The new currency is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 4 to 1, which is about half of the original amount (approximately 8 million legal tender) of the exchange certificate (approximately 12 million legal tender). Imported raw materials and imported goods will naturally increase in price due to the increase in cost in the future. Due to the increase in foreign exchange, the prices of some foreign goods and some manufactured goods that require foreign raw materials will be affected, then the regulation to freeze prices on August 19 will eventually have to be adjusted. Exports and overseas remittances may increase as a result. As for how to reasonably utilize the gold and foreign exchange converted, how to guide a large amount of floating assets into the right track, and how to effectively control, register, and manage the foreign exchange assets deposited abroad by the people in legal terms, the results of the foreign exchange after offsetting remain to be studied before factual proof can be obtained.

Based on the above four points, it can be seen that the authorities may not have given deep consideration to the economic reform measures this time. The financial authorities are brave, but there are doubts as to whether their wisdom and judgment are thorough and accurate. In particular, there are many contradictions in the decision-making process, either overly acknowledging reality (for example, raising the US dollar exchange rate to 12 million legal tender), or overly disregarding reality (for example, setting the legal tender public debt at 27,000), lacking an overall supreme principle that protects the interests of the people. From this, the foundation for winning popular support and establishing credit is established, expressing a fresh start with the people, and earnestly rebuilding currency credibility, increasing currency value, thereby stabilizing prices, and securing people's livelihoods. Therefore, if remedies are not made quickly, it may be difficult to achieve the desired ideal effect.

Two

The government is urgently implementing currency reform this time, and the financial authorities have repeatedly stated that in order to achieve the goals of stabilizing prices and securing people's livelihoods, and thus stabilizing currency values, it is possible to have a near-balanced budget of receipts and expenditures; and it is hoped that a near-balanced budget of receipts and expenditures will again stabilize currency values. This argument is theoretically not unreasonable. However, based on the current facts, the only way the government implements to stabilize prices is to freeze the prices at "August 19", and rigidly enforce price limits, without any other skills! This method was also promoted in the past during the Anti-Japanese War, from the capital Chongqing to major cities, and the result was from price limits to negotiated prices, and no success was ever seen. At present, in China's environment, there is probably not much difference in production and transportation compared to the past, and the basis of currency reform is only built on rigidly restricting prices and freezing them at the market prices of August 19. Assuming that the price limit policy is fortunately 100% successful, then in principle, it will be implemented after returning to the pre-war standard, and the state of price stability will be shaken.

In addition, in order to achieve a balance in government revenues and expenditures, the government is effectively rectifying tax sources, appropriately increasing existing taxes, and adjusting according to pre-war standards, in order to increase tax revenue. On the income side, it is estimated that the revenue will be 480 million in Gold Yuan for customs duties, 700 million for commodity taxes, 380 million for direct taxes, 320 million for salt taxes, and 200 million in total for other taxes and the surplus income from state-owned enterprises, etc. The sale of surplus materials and industry is approximately 400 million, totaling 2.46 billion; the expenditure is approximately 3.6 billion, and the budget deficit after offsetting revenue and expenditure is still short of 1.14 billion, accounting for approximately 30% of the expenditure, and more than 50% of the Gold Yuan issuance amount. It is planned to use US aid and issue Gold Yuan public debt to compensate for this shortfall, and the huge military expenditure has not yet been included. Looking at the income estimates, the direct taxes related to the social equalization policy only account for 300 million, and the rest are indirect taxes that can be passed on, which are all sufficient to affect prices. The spirit seems very contradictory, and it is not enough to match the economic policies of cutting with a broadax. The author believes that unless the government's estimate is a feint to the east and attack the west, and there is actually an international loan plan that can be used as a backing, otherwise this plan may not be able to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices and maintaining currency value to produce a reciprocal effect.

Three

The purpose of economic reform is to reform the currency system, increase currency value, and stabilize prices, and then maintain currency value by stabilizing prices, which has a chain effect. The success of currency reform depends on whether prices are stable after the issuance of new currency. The highest authorities encouraged the people with "Only success is allowed, no failure is allowed," so it can be seen that the currency system and prices are complementary and interconnected. If prices can be stabilized, it will be the greatest success of the currency system. If the new currency system is successful, prices will be more stable, and its impact on the entire economic and political future is significant. The objective environment is like this, and the new currency system, which is congenitally deficient and born prematurely, is implemented with self-contradictory methods. So, how should we quickly find ways to improve technically, carry out remedies, and make postnatal adjustments? The author believes that attention should be paid to the following principles:

(1) Tax rectification should start with direct taxes with progressive high tax rates, and less adjustment of indirect taxes, so as to avoid increasing the burden on consumers and causing price instability, thereby affecting currency value. (For example, the universal increase of salt taxes and customs duties for convenience is the most unacceptable)

(2) Promote our country's virtue of frugality, learn from the effects of Hungary's efforts to save money after currency reform, and put it into practice. From top to bottom, create a spontaneous atmosphere of frugality. First, tighten; second, tighten; and third, still tighten. The following methods are described separately:

(A) Government personnel, starting from senior government officials, should tighten their belts as much as possible, save some of the materials they enjoy, especially exportable materials, in order to increase exports and earn foreign exchange.

(B) Government agencies should strive to tighten their belts, improve efficiency, and improve administrative organization. State-owned enterprises should strive to reduce expenditures and increase revenue, and under the principle of never adjusting prices, strive for self-sufficiency, maintain balance, and actively produce in order to enrich materials.

(C) Those in the upper class with leadership positions should promote frugality, set an example, establish a good style, eliminate banquets, automatically reduce food and clothing, and equalize living standards. Develop a frugal atmosphere from top to bottom, especially the large cities in the Beijing and Shanghai areas should be designated as demonstration areas. In a negative way, levy heavy luxury taxes according to progressive tax rates, in order to enrich the national treasury's income.

(3) Effectively implement the following three-balance policies, rectify taxes in order to increase revenue; vigorously practice economy to reduce expenditure. Then, in conjunction with the balance policy, control the relevant points and lines of the capital, in order to promote the strict control of economic policies. If the key points are grasped, the government authorities' financial policies will be implemented in an orderly manner, and the balance between revenue and expenditure can be gradually achieved.

(Zi) Balance financial revenue and expenditure:

A. Actively consolidate public debt, maintain credit, prepare to issue Gold Yuan public debt, enrich the national treasury, and absorb floating assets.

B. Rectify taxes, increase progressive direct taxes, strictly collect taxes, and implement equalization of wealth.

C. In order to win currency credibility and increase currency value, strictly limit issuance, and reduce the amount of issuance within the possible range according to the limited amount of Gold Yuan issuance.

(Chou) Balance international payments:

A. After the issuance of the new currency system, the increase in foreign exchange prices is sufficient to encourage exports, increase the number of exports, earn foreign exchange, and learn to achieve a surplus.

B. Restrict the import of non-essential goods, and in a gentle way, impose restrictions by imposing import taxes. The nature of the goods should be distinguished, and restrictions should be actively and passively imposed to prevent loopholes.

C. Weighing the needs of domestic light and heavy industry production raw materials, the government should differentiate between urgency, directly purchase and store as quickly as possible from foreign manufacturers and domestic producing areas, and equitably and averagely supply domestic factories for production and manufacturing needs.

(Yin) Balance the supply and demand of materials

A. Stabilize prices, and coordinate with comprehensive (national major cities, to be called comprehensive) economic controls, and fundamentally achieve price stability.

B. Inspect warehouses, reasonably handle, and thoroughly eliminate hoarding and speculation.

C. Reduce businesses and absolutely prohibit future illegal operations and off-site transactions.

D. Encourage floating assets to flow into legitimate channels and strengthen production work.

E. Effectively sell US-aid surplus goods to meet real needs.

F. Sell state-owned enterprises, the government should be sincere, and gradually sell all small units in separate small units.

G. Control daily necessities and implement a quota distribution system, so that those without purchase certificates are absolutely not allowed to purchase; at the same time, promote cooperation between production and sales to eliminate exploitation by middlemen.

H. Restrict consumption and levy heavy taxes on luxury goods and large consumers, imposing restrictions by imposing taxes. If the government can adopt the above-mentioned remedial measures and respond with the greatest determination, it is believed that maintaining it for three to six months will lay the foundation for currency value. Then prices can be stabilized, people's livelihoods can be roughly secured, and the balance between financial revenue and expenditure can be gradually achieved, and the new currency system can also be expected to be successful.

### Ministry of Finance Officials Talk About the Reasons for Salt Tax Adjustment; Denies the Claim That Salt Administration Agencies Cannot Cover Expenditures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Recently, there have been many criticisms of the salt administration agencies. A reporter specifically interviewed relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

(Question) It is reported that the salt administration agencies' tax revenue does not cover expenditures, so the tax rate was adjusted, resulting in higher salt prices and increased burden on the people. What is the actual situation?

(Answer) The increase in the salt tax collection rate this time is purely for balancing the national treasury revenue and expenditure, so as to facilitate the implementation of currency reform. According to the new tax rate calculation, the annual salt tax revenue is approximately 300 million in Gold Yuan, which is all transferred to the national treasury in accordance with the Public Treasury Law, and the salt administration agencies cannot arbitrarily use it. As for the expenses of the salt administration agencies, in the first half of this year, when the food salt tax rate was 450,000 legal tender per dan, and the half-year revenue was more than 8.8 trillion legal tender, the expenses for the management part were more than 800 billion legal tender, accounting for approximately 9% of the tax revenue, and the expenses for the tax police part were more than 1 trillion legal tender, accounting for approximately 14% of the tax revenue. After the tax change this time, the salt tax revenue budget for the second half of this year is more than 100 million in Gold Yuan (of which July and August were calculated at the old tax rate converted into Gold Yuan). The management part's expenses budget for the same period is more than 5.4 million Gold Yuan, accounting for approximately 5%, and the tax police part's expenses budget is approximately 10 million Gold Yuan, accounting for slightly more than 10%.

(Question) It is reported that the salt administration agencies have nearly 100,000 administrative personnel, and the organization is huge. Is this true?

(Answer) Combining all levels of salt administration agencies nationwide, there are currently 960 units, with a total of 13,269 officials and laborers, far from the rumored 100,000 people. Looking back at the period when the salt monopoly was implemented during the war, the area was smaller than it is now, and the salt administration agencies had reached 1,567 units, with 28,231 workers. Even after the restoration in 1946, the salt administration agencies still had 1,408 units, with 15,339 employees. It can be seen that they are gradually being reduced. The current need for such a large number of agencies and personnel is actually due to the unrest in the region, and the difficulty of both production and transportation. It is necessary to strictly manage the region so that supply and demand correspond, and salt prices are stable. Once the suppression and construction are completed, the salt administration personnel can be concentrated in the mining areas, and reductions can be made as much as possible.

(Question) The salt tax rate has been changed to 8 Gold Yuan per dan. From the perspective of the average pre-war tax rate, is it too high?

(Answer) The pre-war standard that is generally referred to now mostly refers to the first half of 1937. At that time, the national salt tax rate averaged 6 national currency yuan per city dan (equivalent to 12 Gold Yuan), so the current rate of 8 Gold Yuan per city dan is actually only two-thirds of the pre-war average rate. Moreover, this 8 yuan tax rate is only levied on sea salt and pond salt. The tax rate for well salt, earth salt, and gypsum salt produced in the interior is only 5 yuan and 6 jiao per city dan, so the national average tax rate is still less than 8 yuan. Also, each person consumes at most 1 city jin of salt per month, and the salt tax burden is at most 8 fen in Gold Yuan, which does not seem heavy.

### Wei Daoming Returns to Taiwan; It is Said That All Important Policies in Taiwan Province are Discussed and Resolved with the Central Government

[Report from this newspaper, Taipei, 25th] Chairman Wei returned to Taiwan at around 12:00 noon on the 25th, and met with reporters at the hotel. Mr. Wei said: During his half-month stay in Beijing, all the issues that Taiwan Province should request instructions on have been discussed and resolved with the relevant departments of the Central Government. To name a few important ones: (1) The Central Government has agreed to allocate 100,000 to 150,000 tons of fertilizer for the next year, and the details of the transaction are still under discussion. (2) The salaries of public servants and teachers in Taiwan will be adjusted from September, and the amount will be determined after research by the Finance Department. (3) The foreign exchange assets of Taiwan Commercial Bank should be declared to the Taiwan Bank. (4) The exchange rate between Taiwan currency and Gold Yuan remains unchanged, and the increase in the issuance of Taiwan currency will not affect its value. (5) A strong price control agency will be established next week, based on the August 19 price limit, but some commodities can be negotiated if necessary. When asked by reporters whether he had met with Ambassador Stuart, Mr. Wei said he had not visited.

### Economic Control of Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei Enters Fundamental Stage; Beiping Municipal Government Orders Manufacturers to Register Raw Materials

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Economic control of Beiping, Tianjin, and Hebei has entered a fundamental stage. To address the food supply problem, surplus deposits from banks will be used to provide low-interest loans to grain merchants for purchases from rural areas. The government will guarantee their legal profits and, when necessary, purchase and directly distribute the grain. This simultaneously resolves the difficulty of banks having more deposits than loans. It is tentatively decided that the National Bank will provide three-fifths of the loans, and other banks will provide two-fifths. Taking Beiping as an example, the initial goal is to procure 60 million catties, the monthly consumption for the city's two million residents, with each person consuming an average of one catty per day. The Hebei Provincial Government will be requested to assist. Wen Chongxin, Director of the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau, and Yao Zihe, Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Government, have been summoned by Zhang Lisheng to take the plan to Tianjin tomorrow morning and report on the reactions following the major inspection in Beiping. Various inspection teams will go to the suburbs tomorrow to investigate the sources of grain and meat. The Beiping Municipal Government decided at an economic meeting this afternoon to order all manufacturers to register raw materials exceeding three months' consumption. Retail daily necessities must be stamped by the relevant trade association, indicating the price limit. Merchants have requested the establishment of a price protection committee, which is still pending approval from the central government. However, price negotiation has already begun.

### Taiwan and Hong Kong Conduct Trade Negotiations in Taiwan

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 25th] Mr. C. B. Burgess, Director of Commerce and Supplies Department of the Hong Kong Government, was invited by Zhao Peihong, Chairman of the Taiwan Commodity Adjustment Committee, to represent the Hong Kong Government in Taiwan to discuss trade matters. Several rounds of talks have already been held. The Hong Kong Government hopes that Taiwan Province will supply coke and establish a regular trade agreement. Taiwan Province hopes to obtain power machinery, medicines, and other manufactured goods from Hong Kong. Both parties are still negotiating and a decision should be made soon. Mr. Burgess visited the coke mines in the Keelung area this morning and paid a visit to Chairman Wei this afternoon.

### Guangzhou Economic Control Office Stipulates; Cotton Yarn Is Forbidden from Exporting

Market Prices Have Returned to Normal

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The Guangzhou Economic Control Office recently reiterated its ban, stipulating regulations for the transport and sale of cotton yarn. It is strictly forbidden to transport and sell to Hong Kong and Macau for export. For domestic transport and sales, transport by water to Zhanjiang, Haikou, and various coastal ports requires certification from the Cotton Yarn Association, confirming that it is not for export and approved by the Economic Control Office, before transportation can commence. According to Mr. Huo Binshu, an instructor, market prices in Guangzhou have returned to normal. Only the price of paper is difficult to resolve to the satisfaction of both merchants and consumers due to transportation costs from the producing areas. Regarding the issue of floating capital flowing south, he believes that it currently has no adverse impact on the market.

### Vyshinsky Repeats Old Tune; Condemns U.S. Preparations for War Against the Soviet Union; Advocates Disarmament and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

[United Press, Paris, 25th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky today bluntly accused the United States of planning to wage war against the Soviet Union. On the third day of the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky launched the most serious attack in the history of the United Nations against any country, saying that one major power is paying attention to planning for war against another country. Vyshinsky specifically urged the United Nations to recommend that the five powers "reduce their existing naval, land, and air forces by one-third within one year" and prohibit atomic weapons. He reiterated the old cliché that the United States is promoting Western military blocs and supporting West Germany in order to launch another war. Vyshinsky also greatly criticized the Marshall Plan, saying that "all actions of the United States are simultaneously making various military preparations, frantically rearming, and planning to attack the Soviet Union and new democratic countries." The Soviet Union loves peace, but the United States' preparations for war against the Soviet Union are based on atomic warfare. He claimed that the recent changes in U.S. foreign policy have been extremely drastic, shifting from peaceful diplomacy to a "policy of expanding territory and dominating the world." Before Vyshinsky's speech, the Soviet side predicted that his words would be like a "bomb," but they had no effect. His motions are as follows: (1) The five powers "should reduce their existing naval, land, and air forces by one-third within one year in order to achieve disarmament." (2) Determine that atomic weapons are weapons of aggression rather than national defense and must be prohibited. (3) "Establish an international control bureau within the Security Council mechanism to monitor and manage the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons." (Note: The Soviet Union has veto power in the Security Council). Vyshinsky's motives greatly surprised Western countries, and his failure to mention the Berlin crisis was also surprising. Many people thought that Vyshinsky would demand the early withdrawal of the occupying forces of the four powers in Germany, but he never mentioned the German issue.

Vyshinsky claimed that the United States' goal for atomic energy policy within the United Nations is to enable the United States to produce atomic bombs without restriction in the future. He briefly described U.S. foreign policy as follows: "Openly supporting the most reactionary imperial and fascist regimes or groups in certain countries, systematically providing them with money and military equipment to resist the democratic and liberation movements in those countries, organizing military alliances or blocs, building new naval, land, and air bases, and expanding and rebuilding old bases established during the war based on the latest military technical needs, endlessly promoting war against the Soviet Union and Eastern European democratic countries, crazily preparing for war, worshiping the atomic bomb, and believing that this can escape the crises facing the capitalist world; these are the characteristics of the current U.S. foreign policy. As for the Soviet Union, it continues to adopt a peaceful policy." As soon as Vyshinsky finished his speech, applause erupted in the audience, but there was only one instance of applause interrupting his speech during the 25-minute speech. Vyshinsky was the speaker who received the warmest applause from the audience at this session of the General Assembly.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] U.S. Representative Austin criticized Vyshinsky's speech on the 25th as "clichéd." Regarding the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, Austin said, "This is a reiteration of the Soviet Union's proposals from past meetings." French Foreign Minister Schumann said that Vyshinsky's speech was "not only interesting but simply sensational." He said that the General Assembly should launch technical discussions as soon as possible based on Vyshinsky's disarmament proposals. Schumann also said that the discussions could produce many useful results.

### UN General Assembly Passes Agenda; Soviet Proposal Vetoed by Overwhelming Majority

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] The issue of Korean independence, which Foreign Minister Wang actively advocated in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this morning, was retained by a vote of 47 (including China) to 7, despite the Soviet Union's proposal to submit a motion to the General Assembly, and the Soviet Union's proposal failed.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly on the 24th rejected the Soviet Union's attempt to remove seven issues from the agenda. All but one of these seven issues are directly or indirectly related to the Soviet Union's diplomatic actions, and most of them are closely related to the Cold War between East and West. The General Assembly voted to include the 68 issues approved by the Joint Committee on the agenda. Soviet Representative Malik "insisted" on removing these seven issues, but the Soviet Union and its satellite countries were defeated by overwhelming majorities in seven votes. The seven issues opposed by Malik and the votes were as follows:

(1) The issue of admitting seven countries, including Italy, to the United Nations was passed by a vote of 29 to 16 with 10 abstentions. (2) The Greek issue was passed by a vote of 44 to 6. (3) The Korean issue was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (4) The issue of amending the veto power of the five powers was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (5) The issue of extending the "Small General Assembly" was passed by a vote of 46 to 6. (6) The issue of long-term international cooperation was passed by a vote of 47 to 6. (7) The immigration case of Soviet wives of foreign diplomatic personnel was passed by a vote of 30 to 7. The issue of the abuse of Indians in South Africa will continue to be considered by the Joint Committee. In addition, the General Assembly also passed six issues proposed by the Soviet bloc for inclusion on the agenda, which were not opposed by the United States and other Western countries. Soviet Representative Malik said that the Western bloc's insistence on discussing issues such as Greece and Korea is an attempt to destroy the United Nations.

### Bulgaria Applies to Join the United Nations; The United States Reiterates Its Opposition

[French News Agency, Paris, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie received a telegram from Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov, reiterating Bulgaria's request to join the United Nations.

[French News Agency, Washington, 24th] The U.S. State Department sent a memorandum to Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov, refuting his claim that the United States opposed Bulgaria's entry into the United Nations. The U.S. said that according to the U.S., the Bulgarian government is now placing its people in slave labor camps, prisons, torture, and death, so the U.S. government believes that Bulgaria has not fulfilled the qualities stated in the treaty and cannot join the United Nations as a member.

### UN Budget Surplus; Lie Submits Report

[United Press, Paris, 25th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie reported to the first meeting of the General Assembly's Budgetary Administrative Committee on the 25th that there should be a large surplus in the 1948 budget. He said that the savings could be "used to offset expenditures for unforeseen matters in the 1948 budget." The chairman of the committee is Canada's Bruce, who also elected Ukraine's Jagan on the 25th.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] It is reported that the United States will ask the General Assembly to set a maximum limit on the costs of the United Nations and make a "symbolic reduction" in the amount that the United States will bear in the next year. According to the UN budget officials, the United States will still bear 39.89% of the UN's annual expenditure, estimated by Secretary-General Lie to be $33,469,000, which is $1,355,000 less than the amount paid by the United States this year. The U.S. delegation also agreed that the U.S. should bear the maximum amount of UN expenses until the economic situation in other parts of the world improves, but demanded that the amount be "symbolically reduced" so that the burden of any member state of the United Nations does not exceed one-third of the UN's annual expenses.

### Soviet Aircraft Formation Flies Over Berlin; US Lodges Serious Protest; Live Anti-Aircraft Artillery Drills Not Conducted

[United Press Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union blatantly tore up the Four-Power aviation safety regulations on the 25th, directly informing the British and Americans that Soviet military aircraft would fly in formation over the Berlin occupation zones. This was the second such act in two days, apparently intended to threaten the Western airlift. On the 24th, Soviet anti-aircraft guns fired at fighter planes at the end of one of the three air corridors. The United States has lodged a serious written protest against the formation flights.

The Soviet note stated that Soviet aircraft would operate along visual routes. A US military officer said that this statement included everything from above 1,000 feet. "As long as the weather is clear and we can see the planes, there is no danger, but formation flying is a direct violation of the aviation safety agreement. The Soviet Union deliberately disregards and denies all Four-Power recognized aviation regulations that the Soviet side signed.

[United Press Berlin, 24th] On the 24th, the Soviet side issued a notice stating that it would conduct anti-aircraft artillery drills along the Berlin air corridors. However, no drills took place at that time, and officials did not pay attention to the warning, regarding it as Soviet psychological warfare. The Soviet authorities informed the British that the Soviet Union would conduct live anti-aircraft artillery drills near the Buckeburg air corridor, which connects the British occupation zone with Berlin, at 6:00 AM standard time. The American side is also currently using this corridor.

### The Soviet Union Responds to the New Note from the UK, US, and France

The ambassador refused to disclose the content of the letter, saying only: "The content is entirely about a new issue that you will not be able to guess."

[United Press, Washington, 24th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith telegraphed on the 24th that he would be staying for "a week or ten days." The organization said that Smith was taking advantage of the lack of a deadline for the Moscow negotiations to come here for private discussions.

### Soviet Ambassador to the US, Panyushkin, Suggests: Increase Japan's Peacetime Industry; Supervised by Strong Nations to Prevent the Revival of War Potential

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Soviet Embassy in the US announced on the 24th that the Soviet Union has suggested that Japan's industry could be revived without restrictions for "several years" under the control of various strong nations in order to prevent Japan from building a new military structure. This suggestion was made in the Far Eastern Commission on the 23rd. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin stated the Soviet Union's position: "If Japan is not allowed to revive its war industry and militarism, then the increase in Japan's industrial development itself is not a cause for concern."

Panyushkin continued, stating that according to the Soviet suggestion, Japan's industrial development "will expand the possibility of Japanese exports, will help strengthen Japan's economic independence, and will reduce the degree to which Japan's national finances depend on foreign factors." The supervision of Japan's industrial recovery "should be carried out by nations that are most concerned with preventing Japan from launching new aggression." This supervisory organization should be "included in the peace treaty with Japan." Panyushkin also stated that at the beginning, it must be decided what kind of industry should be developed in order to prevent the revival of war potential. But "it must be remembered that Japan must satisfy the legitimate compensation demands of the nations that suffered from Japanese aggression. The Soviet government believes there is no reason to limit Japan's future industry. Japan's industry should have as its sole purpose satisfying the peacetime needs of the Japanese people. If we proceed from this single correct basis, then the soundness of the demand to limit Japan's peacetime industrial development will be self-evident."

### Stalin Personally Presides Over Meeting of Top Eastern European Leaders; A Joint Declaration May Be Issued After the Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 24th] Well-informed Romanian sources confirm that Stalin recently held a meeting in Crimea with Czech President Gottwald, Romanian Foreign Minister Mrs. Pauker, and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] It is generally believed here that the secret meeting of Eastern European government leaders currently taking place somewhere in Crimea was convened by Stalin. The Soviet bloc may be indicating to the Western powers that the bloc can also unite when necessary. It is expected that the meeting may issue a joint statement on the Berlin issue. It is reported that the political situation in Eastern European countries is not stable, and the Soviet Union may want to ensure complete control in the event of an international crisis. The Soviet Union will also consider some form of economic aid to match the Western European countries receiving Marshall Aid.

### Panyushkin's Suggestion Seems to Be for Concluding a Peace Treaty with Japan

US and Eastern US Officials Are Deeply Surprised

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] US officials were deeply surprised on the 25th by the Soviet proposal to unconditionally restore Japanese industry. One senior official said: "If such a proposal is sincere," then the US side would welcome it, but many parties maintain a cautious attitude. Soviet Ambassador to the US Panyushkin made this suggestion during the Far Eastern Commission meeting on the 23rd. The general feeling is undoubtedly one of excitement about the Soviet suggestion. One US official pointed out: "This suggestion will get closer to the practical question," he said: This practical question is concluding a peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet attitude expressed by Panyushkin is at least more encouraging than in the past. The Soviet statement indicates that the Soviet Union supports an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, which the United States has long called for and China also supports.

### Western European Union Defense Conference to Be Held Tomorrow in Paris

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 25th Broadcast: According to British officials, the defense ministers of the five Western Union countries are scheduled to meet in Paris on the 27th to discuss military issues such as the five-nation joint defense.

### Burma Declares National Martial Law

The Government Still Fails to Control All Battlefields

[Agence France-Presse, Rangoon, 24th] Burmese President Sao Shwe Thaik announced a national state of emergency today. Although government forces won in Prome this week, the occupation of Myaungmya by Karen rebels proves that the government still fails to control military operations in many parts of Burma. Government forces are currently fighting communist forces in the Arakan and Rangoon regions, and enemy attacks are becoming more frequent. Recently, a major local riot occurred in Sittwe, causing considerable unease to the government.

### France Brewing New Labor Strike; Insisting on the Original Demand for Wage Increases

[United Press, Paris, 24th] French Prime Minister Queuille had to abandon his plan to deliver a national broadcast speech on the evening of the 24th, calling for an end to the labor strike, because the radio station was on strike.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] A new labor strike broke out in France on the evening of the 24th, plunging Queuille's new cabinet into a dangerous situation. It is estimated that 5 million workers will hold a two-hour general strike on the 24th, indicating a warning from organized labor with enormous power in a showdown. At the same time, miners and heavy industry workers are also threatening to launch a general strike to paralyze the country's industry.

This strike occurred after the government decided to increase wages by 15% to appease the labor unions. Communist and non-Communist labor unions, threatening strikes, demanded wage increases to cope with rising living costs, with each labor union demanding a 33% pay raise. Queuille initially raised wages by 10% and claimed that exceeding this amount would cause inflation. On the evening of the 24th, Queuille made further concessions, agreeing to raise wages to 15%, but the labor unions remained dissatisfied.

### Analysis of Burma's National Policy

— Xu Siren

Burma's national policy after independence is indeed puzzling. Based on the fifteen-point leftist political program announced by Prime Minister Thakin Nu on May 26th of this year, it can be said to be extremely left-leaning. The content advocates: immediately establishing political and economic ties with the Soviet Union, confiscating the enterprises of major companies, confiscating the land of major landlords, carrying out social revolution, etc. However, Foreign Minister U Tin Tut (Editor's note: U was seriously injured by a bomb attack on September 18th and died) repeatedly stated when clarifying Burma's national policy that Burma's national policy has absolutely no communist tendencies. The reason why Burma's national policy is so erratic is, on the one hand, to adapt to the international environment, and on the other hand, it can be said to be due to the lack of coordination among the personnel within the current provisional government. Because the ruling party, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, is a combination of various parties, and its members are extremely complex. The leaders of the various parties each have their own thoughts and beliefs, and therefore each has their own主張. Simply put, the current provisional government can be divided into three factions: pro-British, neutral, and pro-Marxist-Leninist. U Tin Tut and others are pro-British, Thakin Nu is neutral, and the young members of the Socialist Party are pro-Marxist-Leninist. The Socialist Party members also have different dreams from the Burmese communists and are incompatible with each other. Because of these complex reasons, a complex national policy has emerged. After independence, in order to replenish the sick body that had suffered more than sixty years of exploitation, the provisional government put forward a grand goal of reviving the people's livelihood. Because Burma is an agricultural country, reviving the people's livelihood naturally requires reforming the land policy. Therefore, all political parties have "land to the tiller" as a prerequisite for their party's doctrine. In order to adapt to this objective environment, the provisional government, despite its complex members, cannot but choose the path of socialism. According to Articles 7 and 8 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement, British enterprises in Burma still retain special privileges. (Article 7 of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement: (A) All contracts entered into by Burma with British subjects and British commercial firms before the implementation of the Burmese Union Constitution shall continue to be valid, and the Burmese government shall be liable for all obligations under such contracts. (B) All property and interests owned by British subjects or authorities before the implementation of the Burmese Union Constitution, or their contracts with Burma, shall continue to exist and be valid; the Burmese provisional government or any successor government shall recognize such property rights, etc. Article 8: The governments of the United Kingdom and Burma have decided to sign commercial and navigation treaties satisfactory to both parties as soon as possible. Before such regulations are established for two years, all current business or occupations and their interests of British subjects shall remain as before.) This time, the Burmese provisional government, on the one hand, to avoid giving the Burmese communists a pretext for attack, and on the other hand, to nationalize enterprises to assist in the realization of people's livelihood, resolutely nationalized major British enterprises in Burma, such as the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, and promulgated regulations that foreigners in Burma could not transfer or mortgage real estate, and that all land would be nationalized. All of these actions by the Burmese provisional government appear to be heading towards the road of communism. Coupled with Thakin Nu's anti-British and pro-Soviet speech on June 9th, and the above-mentioned leftist alliance political program, it is even more perceived that Burma is already implementing red policies. Thakin Nu publicly declared at the mass meeting on June 9th that, no matter what, the government would do its best to implement the recently drafted leftist alliance political program. If the Anglo-Burmese Agreement hindered the leftist political program, we would rather abandon the agreement and preserve the political program; if we had the strength, we could even declare war on Britain. However, if you simply use these things to infer Burma's national policy, then you are wrong, because equally many facts show that Burma is not leaning left, and Thakin Nu's leftist alliance political program is nothing more than empty talk. After Thakin Nu made pro-Soviet remarks, Foreign Minister U Tin Tut immediately followed with a solemn statement, saying that Burma's national policy absolutely does not tend to communism, and at the same time repeatedly assured that Burma's foreign policy would not change in the slightest, and that Burma would always abide by the spirit of the Anglo-Burmese Agreement. Other facts, such as U Tin Tut's resignation from the post of Foreign Minister, joining the army to suppress the communists, and the government's irreconcilable position with the Burmese communists, can all serve as clear evidence that Burma does not want to lean left. Having talked about the problem here, the reporter might as well analyze Burma's contradictory national policy. As mentioned above, the personnel within the Burmese provisional government are divided into three factions. Socialist Party members do intend to make Burma red, but they cannot cooperate with the Burmese communists due to issues of power. Therefore, although the doctrine is communism, they are in fact anti-communist. Socialist Party members, on the one hand, implement their own doctrine, and on the other hand, adapt to the environment and compete with the Burmese communists. Therefore, these people have done things that make people feel that Burma is implementing red policies. Thakin Nu is a neutral figure and should not have agreed with these people. The reason why Thakin Nu agreed, according to the reporter's personal observation, is quite worthy of sympathy. Burma needs construction after independence. Burma, which has no economic foundation, must rely on the assistance of Britain and the United States to engage in construction. The intelligent Thakin Nu will not fail to understand this key decision. However, it is impossible to cope with the current situation without uniting the Freedom League, especially since the Burmese communists are using the opportunity of the bankruptcy of the rural areas in Burma after the war to entice farmers with the utopian sweet taste of the public system. Ba Maw and other opposition parties are also eyeing the throne covetously. The above-mentioned pro-socialist party members also have the power to influence the government in the provisional government. Under the principle of "first secure the domestic front and then resist foreign aggression," Thakin Nu had to compromise, and his difficulties were well understood by the people of the country.

As for Foreign Minister U Tin Tut, who was called "British-run" by the Burmese communists, felt that he was in a difficult situation, so he resolutely decided to resign. Communism is the mortal enemy of those who are currently following the British and American route. Although some members of the Socialist Party are also following the "muddy road," the stakes for these people can be said to be much lighter than for the Burmese communists, not to mention that they are considered to be their own people. Therefore, U Tin Tut shifted the target of struggle to the Burmese communists. After resigning as Foreign Minister, he immediately transferred to the military and personally went to the front line to command the suppression of the communists. Although U's transfer to the military was opposed by some (including Socialist Party members), it was approved by Thakin Nu without any setbacks, and he was granted the rank of colonel. From this point, it can be seen that the pro-British faction is not completely without a foothold in the government. Later, U Tin Tut and his wife flew to London, and still issued a statement in the name of Foreign Minister, saying, "Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu and the Burmese government have decided to take constitutional means to safeguard the recently gained independence. We believe that any threat to the implementation of the constitution—such as the current actions of the Burmese communists—we will do our best to crush it. The Burmese army and police are now shouldering this important task. They are extremely loyal to the government, and with the support of the Burmese government and most people, the government will be able to quell the Burmese communists and restore security and order in a short period of time without any difficulty. Burma's policy is to maintain the friendship of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the democratic countries of Western Europe, while developing its political and economic scope. Therefore, Burma also intends to establish relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. The Union of Burma does not oppose communism, but the current government has no intention of implementing communism. As for the promotion of communism, that is entirely the matter of the Burmese communists and has nothing to do with the current government. The Burmese government is determined to faithfully implement the Anglo-Burmese Agreement." Is Burma's national policy really like what U Tin Tut said? Although this is still questionable, the reporter dares to say for sure that U Tin Tut's national policy declaration is fair. (Sent from Rangoon on August 30th)

### Strengthening the Communication between Economic Control Agencies in Various Regions; Yu Hongjun Goes to Beijing to Submit Specific Measures; Finished Product Prices Can Be Adjusted If There Is a Reason

[Report from this newspaper] Shanghai Regional Supervisor Yu Hongjun took the night train to Beijing yesterday and will submit specific measures to the central government to strengthen the communication between economic control agencies in Shanghai and other regions. Yesterday, the Supervisor's Office released a review of its work over the past week, stating that the prices of goods in the city have been maintained at the "August 19th" levels, and the prices of many daily necessities are even below the price limits. In order to achieve long-term price stability, the production conditions and raw material stocks of factories are currently being investigated, and plans are being made to increase production. In addition, Supervisor Jiang met with the responsible persons of various factories to exchange opinions. The focus of the talks was the issue of raw materials. Factories that purchase raw materials from outside the country are allowed to import them, and imported raw materials are allowed to be freely supplied to the market after reporting. Domestic raw materials will be purchased from the place of origin by the Central Bank in conjunction with various industry associations, and part of the funds can be advanced by the Central Bank. Because the prices of raw materials from other places are high, which may affect manufacturing costs, if there are legitimate reasons and facts, the prices of finished products can be appropriately adjusted without affecting the overall price limit situation. In addition, some factories are currently experiencing reductions in working hours and shutdowns. The reason for this is not the lack of raw materials, but the unreasonable distribution of raw materials. For example, the knitting industry has reduced production because it cannot obtain fine yarn. Some of these problems have been resolved, and unified measures are being drafted. The office is currently handling the crackdown on hoarding and inventory registration and hopes that the industrial and commercial sectors can cooperate. In order to increase production, it is strictly stipulated that workers must not strike or slack off, and employers must not close factories or dismiss workers.

The situation in the small vegetable markets this week has been more chaotic and will be rectified starting next week. Relevant agencies have now established a special committee to handle this matter in order to normalize the supply of vegetables.

Li had lunch at the No. 17 Factory and, after the meal, addressed all the employees of the company, mainly focusing on three points: (1) China's history and culture are more ancient than those of other countries, but the reason why we are still behind others is due to the backwardness of industry. I sincerely hope that everyone will work hard to catch up. (2) All major national affairs cannot be solved solely through politics but must also start with the establishment of industry and agriculture. Once clothing and food are resolved, most problems will also be resolved, but this still requires everyone's efforts.

### General Manager of New Jianrong Trading Company's Residence Found to Contain Large Quantities of Wool Yarn, Family Moved to Hong Kong, Goods Sealed, Deputy Manager Summoned to Explain the Situation

[Report from our newspaper] At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, the Changshu District Police Department received a tip that a large quantity of wool yarn and wool underwear was hoarded in Room 201, No. 1, Lane 345, Yongjia Road. The section chief ordered Zeng Peide, a section member in charge, to lead personnel to investigate. It was learned that the residence belonged to Zheng Guang, a citizen who was the General Manager of New Jianrong Import and Export Company located at Room B-11, No. 11 Nanjing Road. The family had recently moved to Hong Kong, and the company's affairs were temporarily managed by the Deputy Manager, Zeng Cheng. The residence was only left with an employee, Ye Ruikun, to guard it. The police officers saw that the rooms on the second floor were locked, so they, together with the local Bao chief and the guard Ye Ruikun, opened them one by one. In one of the rooms, they found 3,000 pounds of coarse wool yarn, 200 dozen wool underwear, and four packages of wool sweater material. The room was sealed, and a staff member was sent to New Jianrong Trading Company to summon the Deputy Manager, Zeng Cheng. According to Zeng, New Jianrong Trading Company was solely owned by General Manager Zheng Guang. He had only started working at the company in August 1947. The materials in question were imported before he joined the company. The wool underwear material was imported at the end of October 1946, weighing a total of 7,771 pounds. In 1947, General Manager Zheng Guang handled the material and had a manufacturer knit several hundred dozen wool underwear. A portion was sold, and the rest was stored in the Yongjia Road residence. The coarse wool yarn was imported in mid-June 1947, weighing a total of 4,988 pounds. Except for 1,100 pounds that were sold, the rest was moved out of the warehouse six months ago and stored at home to save on warehouse rent and insurance fees. After investigation, Zeng Cheng and Ye Ruikun seemed to have nothing to do with the case and were released on bail. The goods stored in the residence had not been sold for years, suggesting that they were hoarded for speculation. They were sealed and reported to the authorities for handling.

### Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Industrial Representatives to Discuss Ways to Resolve Raw Material Difficulties

[Report from our newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened more than 20 industrial representatives, including Hu Xiyuan, Hong Nianzu, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, and Cai Xintao, yesterday morning to discuss ways to resolve the current raw material problems facing various factories. The attendees presented many difficulties, and the following points were agreed upon: (1) The ongoing registration of raw materials for factories is difficult because many industrial products require dozens of raw materials. If each one needs to be registered, it will be extremely difficult. Therefore, the registration will be limited to important raw materials, and other subsidiary raw materials will not need to be registered. (2) Each industry should list the names of the raw materials it needs, estimate how much is needed in three months, how much is currently in stock, and how much is still lacking, and report the quantities to the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) Measures to solve the shortage of raw materials: (a) If the raw materials have already been purchased and stored outside Shanghai but cannot be transported to Shanghai, they can be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating their current location. The authorities will be responsible for sending a telegram to the local government to provide proof and find a way to transport them out. (b) If the raw materials have not yet been purchased from outside, they can inform the government where they can be purchased, and the government will provide a certificate to allow them to purchase the materials and ask the local government to assist in facilitating the purchase. (c) If the raw materials are available from Shanghai merchants but they are hoarding them and unwilling to sell, they only need to inform the government. The government is currently handling inventory registration. If it is found that they do have the raw materials, they will be ordered to sell them. (d) If the raw materials are lacking in the country and must be purchased from abroad, they can report to the Social Affairs Bureau and request the assistance of the Materials Adjustment Committee in procuring them.

### A New Force is Generated: The Youth Service Corps is Established, Ready for a Life-or-Death Struggle with Corrupt Merchants and Officials

[Our Dispatch] The Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps, organized by the 6th Reconnaissance and Construction Brigade, was formally established yesterday. The Corps Commander is concurrently held by Wang Sheng, Commander of the Reconnaissance and Construction Brigade, with Chen Zhijing and Yang Chengyao as Deputy Commanders. The 14,000 members will be divided into twenty brigades starting today for training, and are expected to begin work in a week.

He continued, "The Youth Service Corps is the leader's revolutionary dare-to-die team. We can tell the President with relief that his loyal followers have been organized, and a new force has grown. We are determined to dedicate everything to the country, the people, and the leader, and strive to eliminate and suppress the Communist Party, which is an evil group, as well as the corrupt merchants and officials, who are a corrupt group." When Wang's speech reached key points, applause thundered through the ranks. This was followed by the oath-taking and flag-awarding ceremony, and Jiang Jingguo was invited to give a speech.

Jiang Jingguo Encourages Members: Do Not Be Arrogant, Do Not Be Discouraged, Do Not Compromise

Supervisor Jiang began by saying: "The establishment of the Youth Service Corps demonstrates the emergence of a new force in Shanghai. I hope that the youth will create a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, seek national survival, national unity, and rescue the people from suffering." He then encouraged the members to maintain a clean and upright character, not to be arrogant or discouraged, never to compromise halfway, and to have the spirit of great compassion and great kindness to relieve suffering and rescue those in need, as well as the spirit of loyalty to the country. Jiang pointed out that Shanghai is a society where people eat people, where "there is reason if there are gold bars," and the poor and suffering are abandoned. Now that the autumn wind has risen, he hoped that the members would not only assist the government in eliminating corrupt merchants, but also engage in practical work, launching a large-scale winter relief campaign to save the poor, help needy students, and seek stability for Shanghai. Finally, Jiang shouted "Long live the Shanghai Youth, long live, long live, long live!" In conclusion, after Jiang's speech, Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zongjian was invited to speak, and member representative Wu Shimo gave a reply speech.

### Reviewing the Municipal Government's Policy Report: The Participating Group Makes Final Revisions, Guiding Idle Capital to Build Houses, Actively Solving the Housing Shortage

In order to review the policy report submitted by the Municipal Government at the seventh general meeting of the Municipal Council, the "Policy Report Review Committee" was previously designated by the conveners of various groups. After preliminary discussions and opinions on the city's administrative facilities, Chairman Zhao Yangxiong held another meeting yesterday afternoon to make final revisions to the proposed policy report opinions, which will be sent to the municipal government for handling. In yesterday's group meeting, the emphasis was still placed on adopting the principle of focusing on municipal facilities in this city, gradually clarifying the current situation, and when business expenses are not sufficient, it is especially necessary to reduce personnel and avoid extravagance, so as not to waste the sweat and blood of the citizens. The most important revision in yesterday's meeting was the housing rental issue in the land administration section. This section also stated in the original draft opinion: "The housing shortage in this city is the most serious in the country. Even if the central government intends to formulate a unified rent method and implement it nationwide, it is difficult to predict whether it can be integrated. At present, the monetary system has been reformed, and the issue of rent adjustment is attracting the attention of the entire society. Municipal authorities should continue to study how to make it reasonable." However, most of the review committee members present still believed that the words "continue to study" might be used as an excuse to increase rents, which would have a significant impact on the livelihood of citizens. Finally, it was unanimously decided to delete this section in its entirety, and the Land Administration Bureau was asked to pay attention to guiding idle capital to build houses, and effectively promote how to open up real estate mortgages so that real estate can implement currency funds and actively solve the housing shortage.

In addition, the group advocated: (1) Autonomous administration: sound mediation institutions should be established, household registration administration should be unified, and the work of the self-defense force and conscription should be accelerated. (2) Police administration: in addition to strengthening the investigation and arrest of bandits, strictly prohibiting evil parties, and appeasing refugees, it is also necessary to strengthen traffic management and enrich traffic equipment. (3) Social affairs: we should earnestly and strictly control rice prices, dredge sources, and absolutely not exceed the limited price. At the same time, we should comprehensively plan and promote the entire relief undertaking, and ask the Civil Affairs Commission to appropriately relax the quantity of rice distribution to the poor. (4) Finance: we should pay more attention to the integrity of tax officials to eliminate embezzlement and enrich tax revenue. In addition to reorganizing reasonable and good tax sources, we must also try our best to save unnecessary expenses. (5) Public works: the maintenance of major roads should still be funded extensively and the repair work should be carried out. Together with the flood prevention committee, the drainage project should be promoted to solve the road water problem. (6) Public utilities: we sincerely hope to buy time, quickly solve the problem of drinking water for citizens in Shanghai West and Pudong, and urge various power companies to strengthen contact and find ways to improve power supply efficiency. At the same time, we sincerely hope to promote the formal establishment of the public transportation company within this year in accordance with the resolution of the conference to promote the development of public transportation. (7) Education: In addition to hoping to continue to add national schools to meet actual needs, we must also strengthen the equipment of municipal primary and secondary schools, and pay special attention to adding vocational schools. (8) Hygiene: we should strengthen epidemic prevention and health facilities, and order a large number of B.C.G. medical products to expand the anti-tuberculosis campaign.

Researching Local Autonomy Regulations: Three Supplementary Items are Decided

The Municipal Council's Local Autonomy Law Research Committee also convened a meeting yesterday, chaired by Tong Xingbai. During the meeting, the seventh item of the seventh conference, submitted by the speaker, was discussed: When the Legislative Yuan is currently deliberating on the local autonomy regulations, the council should provide opinions and ask for adoption. After careful research, it was decided to supplement three opinions, as follows: 1. The provincial and county councils have the right to propose the removal of the provincial and county chiefs, which should be included in the election and recall law. 2. Items 29 and 46 of the Legislative Yuan's draft provincial and county autonomy regulations, in addition to the original plan for items 1, 2, and 3, the reasons listed in item 4 should be approved by the provincial and county councils. 3. The number of directly-controlled municipal councilors elected from the region shall be at least fifty. If the population exceeds one million, one councilor shall be added for every additional 50,000 people. The number of councilors elected from professional groups shall not exceed one-third of the councilors elected from the region. The number of women's groups shall be determined separately. The above three items are incorporated into the seventh item of the seventh message and sent to the Legislative Yuan for adoption. The speaker is also asked to arrange for local legislators to be received, and to urge them to work together to strive for the Legislative Yuan.

### Fragrant Osmanthus Fills Nanshan: Manjuelong is Filled with Autumn Colors and Flavors

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 24th] Osmanthus trees are found everywhere in China, but Hangzhou probably has the most. In the Jin Dynasty, there was a Manjuelong in Hangzhou, where many osmanthus trees were planted. At that time, many scholars in the Manjue Temple also gathered there in autumn. Later, the osmanthus trees were cultivated more and more each year. When people in Hangzhou get married, they all make osmanthus candy to give to guests, which is still the case today. This is because the osmanthus season coincides with the full moon and fragrant flowers, taking the meaning of sweetness and harmony. The Manjue Temple area has been expanded into the Manjue District, which is a general area for the people of Hangzhou. At that time, osmanthus trees lined the road, so it was commonly known as "Manjia Lane." Later, some literati and scholars believed that the location was right on the way to the Yixia Ridge and should not be called "Lane," so the name was changed to "Manjuelong."

Autumn Fragrant Kingdom: Many Osmanthus Trees are Planted

This year's osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong, in line with the unprecedented Zhejiang tide after the victory, also bloomed greatly. Mr. and Mrs. Chen Bulei, together with Mr. Wang Fuqing, Mr. Zhou Peiqin, and Mr. and Mrs. Chen Xunian, General Manager of this newspaper, after watching the Haining tide, toured the Nanshan area of Manjuelong with reporters. They felt that if Nanshan could be well cultivated, it could become the "Autumn Fragrant Kingdom."

On the 19th of the lunar calendar, after watching the Haining tide, we returned to Hangzhou. The next morning, we drove from the lakeside along the highway to Manjuelong, first passing by the Stone House Cave. As soon as we arrived at the entrance of the Stone House Cave, a burst of osmanthus fragrance wafted towards us, and the monks came to greet us, saying that there was osmanthus tea inside. Entering, we saw a few osmanthus branches in full bloom. Running to the cave, a new white paper was written on a wooden advertising sign, saying "This cave specializes in homemade osmanthus candy, osmanthus chestnuts, osmanthus flour soup, osmanthus lotus root powder, osmanthus tea," and so on.

Fragrant Breath in the Mountain Path

After exiting the Stone House Cave and climbing along the mountain road, although this road is usually a mountain path, small cars and jeeps can pass, but now, after walking less than fifty steps, several small cars are already parked in front. Abandoning the car, we climbed along the path, and a breath of fragrance floated from outside the clouds. A few steps ahead, we arrived at the Osmanthus Hall. The Osmanthus Hall is the Osmanthus Forest. Tea tables and chairs are placed under the forest, where you can taste tea and eat. On the trees in the forest, the three characters "Osmanthus Hall" are painted on a wooden board. This is the Manjuelong, a transformation from the desolation, dirt, chaos, and dispersion of spring and summer. As soon as you enter the Osmanthus Hall, someone will ask if you want "osmanthus tea," "osmanthus..." and so on. There are people selling freshly peeled osmanthus chestnuts next to the benches. We bought some to taste, and they did have the fragrance of osmanthus. In this forest, it is like entering the "Autumn Fragrant Kingdom," rich and fragrant, making people want to be intoxicated. Unfortunately, the villagers do not know how to cultivate, and those that have been cut down cannot be replanted. They also do not remove weeds, kill insects, or fertilize in spring, summer, and winter, allowing them to grow naturally. Therefore, there are no longer five thousand plants, far less than the prosperity before the Anti-Japanese War.

Arriving at Shuile Cave, there are still people selling osmanthus chestnut soup, etc. After leaving Shuile Cave, we climbed Yixia Cave. The fragrance of osmanthus wafted from the nose all the way. I think the open space in front of the cave can also be planted with osmanthus trees.

Yixia Cave Turns to Yangmei Ridge

From Yixia Cave, we turned to Yangmei Ridge to the Li'an Temple. There was still the fragrance of osmanthus along the way. Some people call it "Osmanthus Village." There are two or three osmanthus trees by the road, as huge as umbrellas, with golden osmanthus falling all over the ground, and the fragrance is pungent. The mountain ridges on both sides of the road are all barren mountains. Arriving at Li'an Temple, the top of the pagoda has now collapsed, and there is no nanmu branch left. The temple is very large, but the candlesticks and incense burners are full of dust. There are only two lay people in the temple, and no monks at all.

After leaving Li'an Temple, we went to Jiuxi Tea Plantation, where the voices of people were noisy, and there was no empty space.

We also went to Yunlou. The trees and bamboo were almost completely cut down by the enemy during the war, but now they are gradually becoming shaded again. The huge trees on both sides have several hugs, and the dense shade covers the path, making it a clear and beautiful place. Arriving at Yunxi Temple, part of Qilu University has moved here. Mr. Bu Xiao expressed sympathy for these hundreds of students. We smelled the fragrance of osmanthus again in Yunxi.

Returning from Yunxi, passing by the Six Harmonies Pagoda, the Qiantang River Bridge, we arrived at the Hupao Temple. There are several osmanthus trees in front of the Hupao Spring in the temple, and the fragrance overflows outside the courtyard. The monks said that this golden osmanthus tree is five hundred years old. This place also sells osmanthus candy and the like, and there are many tourists.

Brief Thoughts on the Nanshan Tour

This day trip to Nanshan can be said to have been immersed in the fragrance of osmanthus, but the osmanthus trees are not as many as before the victory, and empty spaces and barren mountains can be seen everywhere, which inevitably makes tourists feel regret. Since the Nanshan Osmanthus has such an appeal, it is not necessary to extensively plant osmanthus trees in the Manjue long area, and the three characters Osmanthus 桂花應刻於石板刻于石板,应 should be engraved on stone slabs and permanently placed next to the forest. Manjuelong should still set up a "Manjue Temple". The Nanshan road leading to Yixia Cave, Yangmei Ridge, Jiuxi Tea Plantation, Hupao and other places should be widely planted with osmanthus flowers, bamboo branches and pine trees, so that the wasteland will become a green field and the barren land will become a fragrant land.

### The Case of the Regiment Commander's Wife Being Raped: The Hospital Authorities Offer an Explanation, The Victim Attempted Suicide Several Times Out of Shame and Anger

[Our Dispatch from Hankou on the 25th] The case of the regiment commander's wife being raped, which is under investigation, has caused a dispute outside the case due to the hospital authorities' protection. The hospital is based on: (1) Although there were torn and dirty clothes at the scene of the incident, there were no other traces of rape. (2) The nurses on duty and the patients in the neighboring room did not hear any sound. (3) The victim's genitals only had four abrasions on the labia minora. (4) The victim's vagina only contained soil skin cells and no sperm. (5) The rapist, Ling Zhi, has a beautiful wife in the hospital and would not do such a beastly thing. The hospital believes that this case may be consensual sex, not rape. However, this unfounded speculation has encountered strong rebuttals. (A) The date of the incident was the 9th of this month, but the hospital's examination was delayed until the 11th, which has obviously lost its accuracy. (B) Since the victim's mouth was sealed with cotton, and the rapist implemented it behind closed doors in the middle of the night, of course no one could hear the sound. (C) Ling Zhi, one of the rapists, is a doctor in the hospital, and it is inevitable that he will be biased. (D) The hospital once forced the rapists to compensate 200 million yuan to cover up the matter, which is clearly an attempt to cover up. (E) If it is consensual sex, there is no reason for there to be six people involved in the affair. Therefore, public opinion here is full of sarcasm and ridicule, dismissing it as unfounded. Even the military judge in charge of the case stated that this explanation can only be used as a reference and is not enough to affect the judgment. According to Regiment Commander Lou, his wife is loyal and has attempted suicide several times out of shame and anger after being victimized. He is eager for the authorities to deal with it strictly to save the innocent.

Another report: The three military judges in charge of the case will go to the hospital again for investigation. It is reported that the case has entered the decision-making stage.

### The Hankou Collective Rape Case: The Court Recognizes the Wedding March as an Unsolved Mystery

[Our Dispatch from Hankou on the 25th] The Jingming Building collective rape case, which has been rumored in Wuhan for a long time, has been under long-term investigation by the court. The court believes that the attendees of the dance party may not have been from respectable families, and whether the obscene behavior was the result of rape is questionable. In addition, since no victim has made an accusation, and no one has been able to identify who the foreign perpetrators are, the court cannot prosecute, and the case has become an unsolved mystery. The court has truthfully replied to the police station and the municipal government.

### The Case of Killing the Wang Brothers: The Murderer Overturns His Old Confession, Saying That the Killing Was in Self-Defense

[Our Dispatch from Lanzhou on the 19th] The murderer You Shoufang, who killed four of the Wang brothers and caused one death, was escorted to the Local Court Prosecutor's Office. The victims Wang Wenxuan, Wang Wenzhong, Wang Wenyi, and others, who could not wait, filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the court at the beginning of the month. After the court accepted the case, it opened an investigation court on the 9th of this month. The murderer You Shoufang overturned all the confessions he had made to the Criminal Police Team. He claimed that his motive for killing was because Wang Wenxuan owed him a lot of money. On the evening of the 8th of last month, he went to Wang's house to collect the debt. Wang Wenxuan and his four brothers not only refused to pay, but also plotted to push him into the well to kill him. When he went out to urinate, Wang Wenxuan stabbed him with a triangular scraper. Out of self-defense, he seized the murder weapon and injured four people. After reading the newspaper the next day, he learned that Wang Wenli had died of serious injuries, so he came to the city to surrender and was arrested by the Criminal Police Team. He did not confess anything about Wang's wife, Hu Qizhen. The judge then interrogated Wang Wenxuan, who claimed that You Shoufang wanted to borrow 300 million yuan without success and held a grudge. You Shoufang intended to kill his four brothers. The two sides held different views, and the case was obviously complicated. The Prosecutor's Office has now collected evidence and filed a public prosecution on the 18th for murder. The Criminal Court has scheduled another hearing.

Wuhu

[Our Dispatch] Wuhu's rice industry is developing separately. After the establishment of the food market by the transportation and rice store industries, the rice mill, stack, chime workshop, and miscellaneous grain industries are unwilling to be controlled by the industry and are planning another food market. At the general election meeting of the General Labor Union on the 24th, Wuhu Speaker Chen Zhuofu criticized the high commission of rice merchants, which caused buyers not to come, and it was definitely not caused by the workers' efforts to raise prices. Note: Wushi rice commission food store draws 8.3%, rice store draws 3.4%.

Dinghai

[Central News Agency] Xu Xiaoyu, Wang Rongxuan, and other bandit gangs have been disrupting public security on the Dinghai ocean surface, forcing fishermen to buy flag photos and bandit films, and extorting huge sums of money. All coastal fishermen who do not obey will be brutally killed, their bodies will be thrown into the sea, and their fishing boats and fish goods will be stolen and distributed. They are extremely rampant. On the 24th, according to fishermen in Shenjiamen, the bandits' nest, Donghuo Mountain Cave, has been permanently secured after the naval forces of the First Military Region, under the personal command of Vice Commander Zhang Huifang, carried out a clearance operation.

### Striving to Build the Homeland: People of Hainan Support Provincial Status Measures

— Special Correspondent Chen Meiqing

[Haikou Dispatch, September 21] The Legislative Yuan has finally passed the resolution to make Hainan a province. This is like a long-awaited rain to the people of Hainan Island, and the joy is beyond words. The newspaper carrying this news was immediately sold out, and citizens scrambled to read it. The heavy shadow that had shrouded their faces, which had long been etched with sorrow, dissipated, and a bright and promising future unfolded before their eyes.

They admire Taiwan. They hope that Hainan Island can also "transform" into a second Taiwan, becoming a prosperous and stable paradise in China, allowing their tired bodies and minds, which have suffered from more than 20 years of banditry and more than seven years of Japanese occupation, to finally rest, and allowing them to develop the resources of this treasure island when they have restored their full strength. They are watching the banditry spread day by day, traffic is blocked, nine out of ten villages and households are empty, and production is sharply reduced. Lingshui County, once known as a land of fish and rice, is now under intense attack and in imminent danger. They are watching the factories left by the enemy, emitting black smoke, some shut down, some dismantled, some "seized," and large quantities of useful materials "dismembered" and disappeared without a trace. They are watching the planned development of the Yinggehai salt fields, with an annual output of 7.5 to 10 million dan, being strangled. They are watching all the construction plans being all thunder and little rain, and in the end, even turning into a wisp of smoke.

They are watching the withering and dilapidation of their homeland, but have nowhere to turn for redress.

Therefore, the joy they feel about Hainan becoming a province is not simply the honor of becoming a province, but the hope that a sound provincial government with concentrated talent will rebuild the dilapidated homeland.

The reporter interviewed people from all walks of life and sought their opinions. Everyone unanimously refuted those so-called "conditionalists," who said things like "Hainan is not yet ready to become a province," or "Before a reasonable solution to the provincial government's finances is found, rashly changing to provincial status will be harmful and not beneficial." These are all unnecessary worries. "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half." As long as we are determined, work hard, and struggle, things will eventually succeed. In particular, Hainan becoming a province is related to the immediate happiness of more than two million people on the island, so of course they absolutely support all government measures.

Regarding the solution to the problem of provincial government finances, some people advocate that the central government subsidize a portion, a portion be levied from the local area, and another portion be borne by assigning the Leizhou Peninsula to the jurisdiction of Hainan Province to pay taxes. In this way, after a few years, the banditry on Qiongzhou Island will be completely eliminated, large and small industries will be established, agriculture will be improved, commerce will flourish, transportation will be smooth, and education will be universal, so that everyone has clothes to wear, everyone has food to eat, everyone has a house to live in, everyone has work to do, and everyone has books to read. Wouldn't all the current difficulties be completely solved?

Hainan Island is now on the verge of "change," just as the ancients said: "Poverty leads to change, and change leads to progress."

### The Import and Export Control Committee Decides on Three Methods: Preparing to Open Up Foreign Exchange with Self-Provided Funds

[Report from this newspaper] The Import and Export Control Committee is actively working on the matter of opening up the import of production equipment with self-provided foreign exchange. The committee decided on three methods the day before yesterday: (1) Measures for applying for the import clearance of foreign orders for which payments have already been made; (2) Methods for the Central Bank to pay foreign currency and foreign exchange deposits, and related implementation techniques for imports; (3) Measures for overseas Chinese investment in domestic production enterprises to apply for imports. After consultation and revision, the above three methods have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, the opening of foreign exchange with self-provided funds can be realized.

[Report from this newspaper] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that according to Article 9 of the Measures for the Payment of Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange Deposits promulgated by the Executive Yuan on August 26, "Foreign currency and foreign exchange depositors who have any of the following uses may apply to the original deposit bank for payment of their deposits with the original deposit certificate and approved supporting documents: (1) Those who have been approved by the Ministry of Education to study abroad themselves, their spouses, or their children; (2) Industrial and commercial enterprises or industrial and commercial groups that have been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to send personnel abroad for business negotiations or inspections as needed; (3) Those whose own, spouse, or direct relatives continue to reside abroad and whose original retained amount is insufficient for expenses, and who have been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after being forwarded by the local embassy or consulate; (4) Those whose own, spouse, or direct relatives suffer from serious illnesses and must go abroad for treatment, and who have been approved by the Ministry of Health; (5) Other necessary and legitimate uses approved by the Ministry of Finance." In order to facilitate the application procedures for foreign currency and foreign exchange depositors, the bank is now sending telegrams to the Ministries of Education, Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, and Health to request that they quickly formulate and announce the review standards and detailed measures for the above items (1), (2), (3), and (4) in order to provide a basis for compliance.

### No Increase in Arrivals, Sluggish Trading: Rice Prices Unchanged; Flour Market Still Closed Yesterday

Rice prices have seen little fluctuation, but trading is still not smooth. Arrivals have not increased, and exports are not high. High-quality Indica rice is priced at 18.2 yuan, while Japonica rice is rarely available on the market, and high-quality rice is even more scarce. Therefore, although prices are stable, transactions are few. The prices in the two markets are unchanged from the previous day. Registered arrivals were 1,499 shi in the South Market and 1,842 shi in the North Market, totaling 3,341 shi.

Flour: Still closed. Because the market held a general meeting of all members yesterday to elect the management director, etc., transactions could not be carried out, the supply was very small, and there were few sellers. There were also no transactions in bran.

Grains: Firm and expensive, trading is increasingly light due to the scarcity of sellers. The supply of soybeans is very small, and Adzuki beans and kidney beans are available in small quantities. Corn continues to be absorbed by Northern merchants and is still traded at limited prices. Red sorghum is firm and sellers are scarce. Yuan wheat from out-of-town merchants is being sold off, rising by 3-4 jiao. Peas are being taken by Northern merchants, rising by 2 jiao. Sesame is flat and weak, and shelled peanuts are available in small quantities.

Residual Oil: Continues to decline, being locked up is narrow, local demand is very weak, resulting in sluggish sales. Soybean oil fell to 48.5 yuan at the close due to a large amount of bulk goods. Rapeseed oil also fell by 2 yuan to close at 45 yuan. Stocks of raw oil are scarce and uniquely firm. Small cart sesame oil also fell by 9 jiao. Soybean cake is supplied by the factory separately, 100 pieces per household, priced at 4.6 yuan.

### Oil Merchants Register Inventory

The Shanghai Oil Business Association, in order to comply with the order to register the inventory of the industry, specially issued an urgent notice yesterday, instructing all members to register all inventory, whether in the store, warehouse, or factory, by 12:00 noon on the 28th of this month, so as to report it on time.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Strict Prohibition of Overdrafts by Banks and Money Shops

[Report from this newspaper] The Audit Department of the Central Bank recently sent a circular to all branches, stating that since the implementation of the use of bills as currency, banks and money shops have often entered into temporary overdraft contracts with customers as a disguised form of bill use. In order to implement government orders, this temporary overdraft should be strictly prohibited. It has also been reported that there are many customers of banks and money shops who open accounts in their personal names.

### Collecting Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency: No Extension of Deadline

Overdue possession will result in confiscation or punishment

### Spokesman for the Ministry of Education Issues Statement: Hopes Displaced Students Will Return to School Quickly: The Eight Temporary Secondary Schools and Combined Secondary Schools Are Sufficient to Accommodate

[Nanjing Dispatch, September 25] A spokesman for the Ministry of Education recently issued a statement on the arrangements for the resettlement and resumption of studies for students from the displaced areas of Shandong and Henan provinces, as well as the progress made. It stated: Students from the bandit-controlled areas of Shandong and Henan provinces have been affected by the banditry and have come south to gather in the capital, numbering tens of thousands. At the request of local authorities, the Ministry of Education has established temporary secondary schools and combined secondary schools in the Jiangnan area to accommodate and resettle them. However, the students came in a hurry and their numbers are increasing daily. As of recently, nearly 20,000 people have arrived in Beijing. Temporary secondary schools and combined secondary schools have been selected in the Beijing-Shanghai area and the two provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and are combined with the Zhongyuan Temporary Secondary School previously established in Henan, which can accommodate more than 20,000 people in total. Since the beginning of this month, the principals of various schools in Shandong and Henan provinces have led the students to return to school one after another. The students in Beijing can be evacuated completely before the 28th. The students who came to Beijing this time were unwilling to be coerced by the bandits and traveled a long and difficult journey to return. Their aspirations and experiences are worthy of sympathy. The government is concerned about the students' studies and has made every effort to provide relief and resettlement. However, in the past month, students in Beijing have repeatedly gathered to cause trouble, which has seriously affected social security and is regrettable. Currently, the banditry is rampant and the country is in difficulty. It is hoped that the students will strictly abide by order, cherish their time, and quickly go to the designated locations to resume classes. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and comfort to the students who have come to seek refuge from various places, and assist the government in guiding their emotions, so that it will be easier to stabilize order and avoid causing trouble.

### Hao Gengsheng Lectures to Primary and Secondary School Teachers on Physical Education in British and American Elementary Schools; Britain Emphasizes Physical Education Teachers

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Gymnasium invited Inspector Hao Gengsheng to lecture on physical education in British and American elementary schools. Over 700 physical education teachers from municipal private primary and secondary schools and enthusiasts of physical education attended the lecture. Prior to the lecture, the Electro-Education Group installed a sound system, and the sound was clear and audible. Director Shao gave a speech first, followed by Mr. Hao's lecture. The main points are as follows:

Britain and the United States attach great importance to physical education, especially children's physical education, which is the most important stage of life and the foundation for cultivating adults. The outstanding performance of Britain and the United States in the World Games is entirely due to the facilities for children's health education. Children's health requires good nutrition and sleep, and appropriate exercise. Elementary school physical education is the most important training for children's education, that is, the cultivation of general physical fitness should start from the elementary school curriculum. Although Britain's economic situation is far inferior to that of the United States, it pays great attention to children's physical education. (1) Although Britain does not have perfect equipment, it has vast grounds and makes full use of them to give children ample opportunities to be active. (2) Britain can use the environment and equipment, even a table and a rope, as tools for children's activities. (3) Emphasis is placed on children's games and sports, and grouping methods are established to ensure widespread activity. (4) Adding movies or slides to physical education games and activities is more effective. (5) Attention is paid to the school's sanitary environment, and there are appropriate places for exercise and rest. (6) Attention is paid to the growth and development of children's bodies, and children's physical fitness and good habits are checked.

Britain now has the slogan "A good system is important, but a good teacher is more important than a system." Therefore, Britain has a universal and strict physical education teacher test. All physical education teachers must participate in this test and take pride in achieving excellent results. This also increases the opportunity for physical education teachers to continue their studies. Women's education is highly valued. Although it is mainly for good mothers, the improvement of the level of physical education in elementary schools should be attributed to women's education.

Because of its abundant resources, American elementary schools have widely developed physical education, and there are many things to learn from. Finally, it is hoped that the physical education community will take responsibility for children's physical education and continue to work hard in difficult circumstances. It is believed that elementary school physical education in our country will have a bright future.

The venue is still Jin Yuan Park: (1) Huaguang Blue vs. Jijia, both of which are energetic youth teams, (2) Donghua vs. Jingwu, (3) Tede vs. Zhichao. The latter two matches are exciting, as Donghua is strong and Jingwu is known for its hard work, which will pose a considerable threat to Donghua. The schedule for today is as follows:

Huaguang Blue vs. Jijia (Group A2) 3:30 PM

Donghua vs. Jingwu (Group A3) 4:30 PM

Tede vs. Zhichao (Group A4) 5:30 PM

### Is the Wife Scary?

— Qinling

After reading Mr. Xu Qinwen's article "The Wife's Scary" published in the 19th issue of this journal, I was filled with emotions and wrote a few words to defend the wife class.

Mr. Qinwen's original intention was only to highlight the difficulties of life by contrasting it with the sorrow of the husband; however, is it not also the wife's sorrow that the wife is thus considered scary?

An old classmate, Miss Ding—now she should be called Mrs. Ma—often writes to complain that three children are wearing her down. Before the victory, she lived in the countryside of Shapingba, Chongqing, carrying water, climbing mud, eating the tomatoes and potatoes she planted herself, wearing patched-up cloth gowns, and thought that she could be comfortable when she arrived in Shanghai. Who knew that she only rented a front building after spending several years of savings, and her whole family was still squeezed together, and she was still constantly working all day long. The hands that used to play the piano were calloused, and the dizziness and anemia made her look nothing like the beauty she used to be. However, Mr. Ma's temper increased along with his status, and he would throw things around at the slightest provocation. If the children were noisy and he couldn't read, it was the wife's fault; if he was too late for work and missed business, it was the wife's fault; if a month's salary was not enough for half a month's expenses, it was even more the wife's fault! The couple often argued, and their relationship deteriorated considerably. In fact, Ma Guangsheng did not have affairs, did not have hobbies, went out early and returned late, and was very well-behaved. In fact, it was still an economic problem. Money was not abundant, his mood was not good, and his temper became bad. This is certainly not Mr. Ma's fault. Prices are rising every day, and he is frugal, but a month's income is still not enough to spend. How can he not be worried? But can it be said that it is the wife's fault?

Let's talk about my old friend Miss Li. Recently, I received a letter saying that she had decided to leave Peiping and return to the south. She went to Peiping to get married in the summer of the year before last. The couple were both civil servants. Last year, they had a child and hired an old nanny to take care of the house and the child. In addition to going to work, she also breastfed. As a result, the child was weak and she was exhausted. She always told us: "You will be surprised if you see me now, because I am almost half as thin as I was in Shanghai!" What is even more urgent is that she had another child this summer. She said: "We both go to work at the same time. An old nanny is unwilling to take care of two children. It is not allowed to hire two old nannies due to economic constraints. If I sit at home and take care of the children, his income alone is not enough to support the family. There is no way, so I have to return to the south and live off the ancestral property!"

Once you have a family, who doesn't want to live a happy and peaceful life? Looking angry is not a pleasant thing after all. As long as wives can work, they are willing to help their husbands share the responsibility, but although the principle is so, if there are too many children and you can't take care of one thing without neglecting the other, you have to retreat and manage the home. (In this respect, women also sacrifice themselves quite a bit.) Living in this era, couples need to endure hardship together, understand and be considerate of each other in order to overcome difficulties and get through the difficult times together, which cannot be solved by blaming and condemning each other.

Recently, family disputes have become one of the main social problems. These examples make people who are about to get married feel doubtful and fearful about "marriage." The term "wife" is indeed scary in the eyes of our women.

### New Inventions

— Mao Yi

There is a genius in New York who has invented a soup spoon with a small fan attached. The fan can cool the soup in the spoon, so that the person drinking it will not be scalded and retract their head and stick out their tongue.

A person in Spokan, Washington has invented an oyster opener and has registered a patent with the government. This new device specifically for opening oysters will emit a sound that can stimulate curious oysters to open their shells. Taking advantage of the opportunity when the shells are open, the person eating the oysters can easily dig out the oyster meat.

The U.S. Army has used sound in jungles to lure and kill mosquitoes that transmit epidemics. They created a "wolf beep" sounder, which emits a pitch similar to the sound of a female mosquito's wings flapping. The foolish male mosquitoes follow the artificial sound to mate, and as a result, become romantic ghosts who die under the sounder.

Modern women spend an astonishing amount of time in barbershops. In order to relieve women's boredom while "doing their hair," a man in California created a new type of "hair dryer" with a built-in wireless radio, which can be used to listen to music and relieve boredom at any time, making it a holy product for leisure.

Yale Townie Company has invented a "one-armed" spring latch. With this latch installed, a person returning home with both hands full does not have to put down the things in both hands when opening the door lock and turning the handle, but only needs to free one hand to open the door and enter the room.

A manufacturer has designed a new type of electric washing machine that not only washes clothes but also grates yams and freezes ice cream.

### Strange Laws in America

— Qifeng

Can you imagine? If you sing in a bar in Wisconsin, drive a crimson car in Minneapolis, eavesdrop on people in Oklahoma, or wear transparent clothes (including silk stockings) as a woman in Rhode Island, you are violating local laws!

Animals are equally protected by law. In Ohio, if you ride a male donkey, you cannot exceed six miles per hour; in North Carolina, you cannot use an elephant instead of a cow, horse, or machine to cultivate cotton fields; in Oklahoma, you cannot catch whales in inland seas; and in Pennsylvania, you cannot even kill a snake unless it bites you!

Most people think that the relationship between men and women in the United States is extremely indulgent and free, but this is not always the case. In Oregon, according to local law, a girl cannot ride in a car with a young man without the accompaniment of a guardian; in Utah, men and women can only dance during the day; and in Pennsylvania, women's underwear cannot be hung on clotheslines unless it is covered with a cloth.

Even for love affairs between men and women, the law has not been neglected in the slightest. Not many years ago, an unlucky husband was fined fifteen yuan for kissing his wife in a park in Chicago. In Georgia, kissing in public is also prohibited. The method of proposing marriage is simple, unique, and easy to implement: in Massachusetts, you only need to kiss your lover ten times to propose marriage; in Minnesota, you only need to bring some sweets and gifts, and embrace and kiss her passionately in front of your sweetheart's parents to show that you love her and want to marry her.

Once you get married, if you live in Delaware, you can say anything disrespectful or slanderous to your wife, and the law will not intervene; in Michigan, the law gives the husband the ownership of his wife's clothes, and if the wife leaves him, all of her clothes will belong to the husband.

Even more absurd and unreasonable laws are that fathers in New York cannot change their children's diapers, residents of Boston cannot raise a dog that stands more than ten inches tall; thieves in Kentucky can only be caught at night; men's beards in Indiana are considered to be sources of germs, especially men who often kiss are not allowed to keep beards; and prisoners in South Carolina must pay the police one yuan for riding in a prison car to prison!

### Catching Thieves

— Yi Yun

Late last night, the storeroom of a nearby tea shop suddenly became very noisy, interspersed with laughter, which reverberated throughout the neighborhood. Upon inquiring this morning, I learned that a thief had been caught, which was quite amusing. Because the thief had entered by breaking through the wall, the tea workers had learned about it early. So they used a very large bamboo basket (usually used to store tea leaves) and waited at the place where he had broken through. Seeing that he had pierced the wall and crawled in, they covered him with the tea basket from the head down, enclosing the thief completely in the basket, and he was captured. The noise and laughter also erupted at this time, when the tea workers were in high spirits.

I remember that in the dormitory of a certain school in the past, there was a thief who broke through the wall, which was known to the students. So they tied a rope into a circle at the entrance of the hole to wait. The thief put one foot in first, and it happened to enter the circle. The students quickly tightened the knot and tied the thief's foot, while the thief's body was still outside the wall. The students discussed ways to punish the thief. A prankster suggested removing his shoes and socks and brushing the soles of his feet with a hard brush to make him unbearable. The thief was indeed afraid of the itch. Every time he was brushed, his feet twitched and trembled, and he was in a state of embarrassment. The students also laughed loudly. Unexpectedly, the brushing became more and more rapid. The thief couldn't bear the abuse and tried his best to break free. The rope was broken, and he ran to the river. He jumped out and fell into the river with a bang. The river was deep and rapid. It is not known where this thief drifted.

### Standard American

— Fengling

The Gallup Poll, the most famous public opinion polling organization in the United States, reports that a standard American is like this.

His height is five feet nine inches, and his weight is one hundred and fifty-eight pounds. (This is the average height and weight of American men.)

Six out of ten men prefer women with black hair and black eyes.

The average height of American women is five feet four inches, and they weigh one hundred and thirty-two pounds.

Two out of every three adults (including men and women) wear glasses. One out of every five people has slightly drooping ears. One out of ten people prefers to operate with their left hand.

Americans generally have poor memories. Less than one-third can remember their car license plate number.

One out of three people refuses to get up early, and one out of five people often suffers from insomnia.

The average American goes to bed at ten o'clock and gets up at six-thirty in the morning six days a week, but on Saturday nights, he often doesn't go to bed until eleven o'clock and doesn't get up until eight o'clock on Sunday mornings.

Six out of ten American adults like to drink and smoke.

Ninety-six percent of Americans believe in God, and seventy-six percent believe that there is a soul after death.

Only four percent of the people in the United States feel unhappy with their lives; fifty-seven percent feel fairly satisfied; thirty-eight percent feel that life is extremely good and happy; but one percent feel that they don't know whether they are happy or not (translated from the September issue of Reader's Digest).

### South Society Luminary Pang Bozi

— Qian Dacheng

Pang Lezi was a leading figure in the South Society, renowned throughout Jiangnan, but slander followed, to the point where he became unacceptable in his hometown. After his death, Zhou Mengpo of Wucheng and Liu Qiji of Wujiang gathered funds to publish his collected poems and essays, but none of his fellow townsmen contributed a single penny. Mr. Xiao Tui'an wrote a biography for him, and Tui'an was also someone who did not enjoy living in his hometown.

Bozi, named Shubai, styled himself Ba'an, and was from Changshu. During the late Qing Dynasty, he and Liu Qiji and Chen Qubing organized the South Society, advocating nationalism. During the Xinhai Revolution, Panzi was a professor at St. John's University and an editor of the National Essence Journal. After Shanghai was restored, Yezi and Song Jiaoren participated in secret meetings. The uprising in Changshu was also instigated by Bozi. Bozi was young and courageous in undertaking responsibilities, advocating for the abolition of corvée labor, as corvée labor had long been a problem for the people. One day, Bozi was sipping tea in the Lake Garden when dozens or hundreds of corvée laborers, holding incense sticks with fiercely burning flames, feigned a petition and swarmed to burn his forehead, leaving it scorched and scarred. Fortunately, someone grabbed him and helped him escape over the window, thus saving him. He then went to the sea and served as the literary secretary of the Shanghai Military Governor. However, those who slandered him in his hometown did not stop. He then gave up on worldly affairs, entertaining himself with literature and wine, eventually becoming dissolute and unrestrained, and died at the young age of only thirty-three. Vice Minister Zhu Guwei edited his "Yu Cheng Cong Guan Ci Gao" (Jade Sounding Pavilion Song Lyrics), and famous scholars of the time, such as Shao Cigong, Xu Zhongke, Wu Qu'an, and Ye Sheyu, all wrote inscriptions. Liu Qiji, Wang Dezhong, and Wang Zhuanong each wrote prefaces or postscripts. His "Longchan Studio Poems" were appended to the lyrics. Rongzi's lyrics followed the style of the Southern Song Dynasty, not deviating from the styles of Baishi and Yutian, adhering to strict rules, and were deeply appreciated by Zhu Guwei. His lyric "Peach Blossom Spring Reminiscence of an Old Friend," which used the eight characters "rain threads, wind slices, misty waves, painted boat" to lead the phrases, was particularly elegant. The lyrics read: "In the misty rain, spring has no shadow; the willow threads are like a sick person. The wind cuts through the silk clothes and it's still cold; fragments of dreams awaken before the flowers. The mist faintly obscures the green, hard to recognize; the waves ripple, urging slumber. Paint the beautiful scenery of old; the boat carries the hatred of Jiangnan."

After Song Jiaoren was martyred, Lezi would shed tears every year on the anniversary of his death. He once wrote a poem lamenting him, saying: "...Gouging out the eyes still grieves for Wu Zixu; where to call back the soul and weep for three banquets? From this, I know that talent and fate are difficult to share; but let's say that kindness and hatred have been planned sparsely..." These words are extremely sorrowful. The line about talent and fate can also be used to mourn Ziye. His other works include "Lingyan Chang," "Longchan Studio Gleanings," and several surviving essays and diaries.

### Horses' Hooves and Knights

— Yue

In public places, we often see many bronze and stone statues, many of which depict famous generals on horseback. But besides admiring the style of these heroes, we rarely know that the horse's posture actually hints at the hero's fate.

Western sculptors have a commonly observed convention regarding "horses' hooves and knights":

(1) If the horse in the statue has two hind hooves on the ground and two front hooves in the air, it means that the knight who rode the horse died in battle.

(2) If the horse has three hooves on the ground and one hoof raised in the air, it indicates that the person who rode the horse was wounded in war.

(3) If the horse's four hooves are all safely on the ground, it indicates that the knight who rode this horse was not wounded in war.

These conventions are universally observed in Europe and America. However, we do not know whether Chinese sculptors follow them.

### Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands

— Wu Yong

A truly good writer will immediately draw the reader into another world, to appreciate its strange scenery and unusual objects. After reading their book, the reader feels as if they have traveled to another world and returned. This is because good writers, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, each have their own world, their own heaven and earth, their own cosmos, and their own universe.

Christianity says that God created heaven and earth and all things; truly good writers can also create heaven and earth and all things.

The writers of ancient times may be dead, but the other world they created is still preserved in their writings. Just wipe away the cobwebs and dust from its gates, and the pavilions, terraces, forests, springs, mountains, and rocks within are mostly intact.

Heaven and earth are certainly not just one; within the cobweb-covered and dust-sealed writings, many grotto-heavens and blessed lands are preserved. It is only because there is no golden scenery and no jade-like beauty that visitors are so few.

It is said that the tickets to today's grotto-heavens and blessed lands are very expensive; that is true, but they are probably not much more expensive than seeing a movie. Moreover, these grotto-heavens and blessed lands are unlike the ordinary grotto-heavens and blessed lands in the human world. Once you buy a ticket, this grotto-heaven and blessed land will belong to you for life, becoming your private kingdom. You can visit it whenever you please, day or night, according to your wishes. Even more convenient is that you can visit while sitting or lying down.

I recalled my feelings while reading Su Dongpo's poetry collection and suddenly felt this way, so I wrote it down.

### Funds Sent to Mr. Feng Zikai for His Trip to Taiwan

— Zhang Yiqu

Friends warmly gather, welcoming Master Yuhao,
Laughing and talking, eagerly joining the line.
The spring breeze graces the guests at the table,
The autumn moon illuminates the sails before the window.
Drain the bottle, no lament for the absence of fish,
Raise the chopsticks, forget the desire for meat in Yunnan (The Master is vegetarian, abstaining from meat but not fish).
Understanding the Zen, one is half drunk,
Tomorrow, crossing the sea, Meng Ke will be light.

### Drinking Alone with Crabapple Flowers at the Leisurely Retreat

— Zheng Wenwei

Don't recall before the wine cup,
Joys and sorrows are equally empty.
How pitiful the distant spring dreams,
Many thanks to the red crabapple flowers.
Breaking off a twig, new verses are formed,
Where does the wind of the crying crow come from?
Willow catkins drift easily to their end,
The setting sun slants east of the corridor again.
