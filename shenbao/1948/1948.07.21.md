[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Legislative Yuan held its third secret meeting all day on the 20th, chaired by Sun Ke, with over 400 members in attendance.

The original draft stipulated a tax of four yuan per dan of edible salt based on pre-war currency value, adjusted according to the wholesale price index. The review opinion resolved to retain the current rate. However, during the meeting on the 20th, Chen Kewen, Zou Shuwen, and others advocated for the passage of the original proposal, arguing that it would provide ample revenue for the national treasury with a minimal burden on each person. This was met with strong opposition from Chen Mingxian, Yue Shuyou, Xu Pan'yun, Xie Chengyu, and others, who believed that increasing the salt tax would universally increase the burden on the general public, amounting to a poll tax. They argued that the state should increase revenue by focusing on wealthier individuals. After the debate, it was put to a vote, and only 94 members (out of 314 present) supported the Executive Yuan's original proposal.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The customs import tariff will be thoroughly revised and implemented by the Ministry of Finance as soon as legislative procedures are completed. Except for the tariff rates stipulated in the Geneva Agreement passed by the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference and the reduction rates agreed to by our country, all of which will be observed, the tariff rates on essential items for economic construction and daily necessities for the people will not be increased. In addition, most of the tariff item numbers (672 items) have been revised. For luxury goods, non-essential items for the general public, or those that can already be produced in large quantities domestically, and for the sake of protecting industry, import tariff rates will be increased based on their use, degree of processing, and relationship with domestic goods (whether they are competing products), with an average increase of one to three times the current tariff rates. The highest rates are for alcohol and tobacco, at 200 percent. For steamships, however, a tax exemption was decided upon as an incentive due to insufficient domestic tonnage. Diesel fuel, being a necessary commodity for domestic use, will maintain the current tax rate of 18 percent.

### The Survival of Economic Control Agencies

Economic control agencies, under various names, have flourished for a time. Some are national in scope, while others are limited to a corner; some are permanent in nature, while others are temporarily established. Changes in names and personnel, and shifts in organization and scope, are especially rapid and overwhelming. What is the ultimate benefit to the country and the people, and what is the extent of the remedy for the current economic situation? The facts are right in front of us, and it seems there is no need for much inference. Take the Financial Management Bureau as an example. In Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, many of the people originally in charge have also resigned one after another, turning their heads and ignoring the situation. What is the reason? It is worth pondering.

During wartime, military and economic matters were equally important. The topic was too broad, and many people who held doubts had to maintain a solemn attitude and wait for developments. However, since the victory, the economic situation has deteriorated rapidly, to the point where the more it is controlled, the worse it becomes, almost mirroring the "the more suppressed, the more expensive" phenomenon during the Anti-Japanese War. Moreover, some unscrupulous officials, taking advantage of their positions, engaged in corruption and extortion, further creating a negative impression. What is even more peculiar is that even institutions that are not primarily responsible are joining in the excitement and claiming to be economic control agencies, exercising their powers. As a result, the so-called control agencies have become even more complex and incomprehensible, and calls and proposals to abolish these types of control agencies have finally erupted in the Legislative Yuan.

In all fairness, it is worth exploring whether a laissez-faire policy can be fully adopted during this extraordinary period. In particular, most opinions believe that implementing management is still necessary for exchange rate policy and foreign trade policy. However, economic control, whether domestic or foreign, is nothing more than to shorten the long and make up for the short, and to seek the highest efficiency. The means may be similar to negative ones, but the intention is always positive. In terms of the meaning of control, it may be necessary to impose considerable restrictions on the economic behavior of a certain part or a certain period, but in terms of the entire business, the focus is ultimately on supporting, promoting, and developing in a planned manner, rather than simply restricting, suppressing, and deliberately antagonizing industrial and commercial enterprises, ultimately causing harm to the country and the people. Therefore, economic control, also known as planned economy, is obviously different from blindly or maliciously destroying industrial and commercial enterprises, and even more different from those means of profiteering and self-enrichment that have other effects!

Based on the above reasons, whether or not this type of control agency should be abolished, the key is whether past and existing facts can prove that it is beneficial to the country; that is to say, whether these agencies are blindly or deliberately destroying the economy, or whether they are promoting it in a planned manner. If it is said that they are promoting it in a planned manner, do their words and deeds match? Are there any achievements that can be shared with others? Is there anyone, especially some executors, who is taking advantage of it and only realizing their side effects?

Superficially, any institution has its reasons for existence; superficially, any institution also has its window dressing to cover up. However, window dressing is, after all, window dressing. In reality, they have made the national economy so chaotic! Don't you see the control of foreign exchange? Those who have their own foreign exchange, regardless of whether they are prepared to import machines or necessities or luxuries, are blindly shut out of the country; overseas Chinese funds are all flowing to Hong Kong because of the unrealistic exchange rate. In terms of trade control, exports cannot be promoted, and foreign raw materials cannot be imported due to the lack of foreign exchange, but they turn a blind eye to the smuggling of many domestic products and the smuggling of a large number of purely consumable goods and luxury goods. As for the control of yarn and cloth, despite shouting the slogans of consignment spinning and weaving, unified purchase and unified sales, the factories are afraid of the shortage of raw materials and are preparing to reduce work. Some of the ordered machines and spindles have been forced to change their unloading in Hong Kong, adding 200,000 spindles to the yarn factory in Hong Kong. In terms of controlling prices and currency, the more you control floating capital, the more it increases, the more you control interest rates, the higher they become, and the more you control prices and wages, the higher they become. In terms of controlling power and fuel, public utilities increase several times a month, the black market for coal is rampant, and coal stocks are piling up in the production areas, but they are restricted by control and cannot be automatically transported and sold, let alone regulated and channeled. There are countless such examples. Since the beginning of last year, the Executive Yuan has changed hands three times, but the control effect is getting worse and worse. We really don't know where their control effectiveness lies? We can't bear to say: under the cover of chanting beautiful slogans of control, to what extent do they want to mess up the national economy and people's lives before they can be considered successful!

The strangest thing is that whenever a control target is identified, a control agency must be set up, and the central department must send its own personnel to set it up in various places, especially in Shanghai, which is more obviously their focus. We don't know what the use of local governments is for the state to set up officials? But leaving aside the local government, we don't know whether these central agencies can really perform their tasks independently? As everyone knows, economic control must be national in scope, that is, it must be implemented across the board. If one place is controlled and another place is not, if they are not closely linked to each other, and if they contradict each other, there will inevitably be many drawbacks and many confusions! Recently, Shanghai strictly inspected warehouses, which seemed to be thunderous, and many food rice were transported to Wuxi, which is a prominent example. However, even if the central agency tries its best to promote it, how can it be established everywhere? If it cannot be set up in a timely manner, how can it promote the whole country and achieve the goal of comprehensive implementation? Let's take the control of finance as an example. Gold and silver shops in various places are operating as usual, but Shanghai is still blindly controlled, and it is not allowed to operate. Also, buying and selling gold notes is said to be illegal, but Xiamen, Guangzhou, and other ports are openly operating. I don't know if there is a Gold Management Bureau there? In many provinces in the interior, silver dollars and copper coins are openly used. In rural areas, food rice is used as wages, rent, and price standards, especially popular in the countryside. Why doesn't the Gold Management Bureau care about such open violations of the state's monetary regulations? Does the Ministry of Finance know? Knowing it and deliberately condoning it, it is really a case of opening one's eyes and closing one's eyes. Then why bother to get energetic in Shanghai and insist that Shanghai have 10,000 or so cunning merchants who are guilty of unforgivable crimes?

In short, to control the economy, we must first establish clear policies, implement overall planning, and carefully adjust the dosage in order to achieve overall promotion. This is the meaning of control. We must never stop and start suddenly, or do things according to our whims, nor should we be incomplete or superficial. In particular, we must not want to suppress and stabilize prices on the one hand, and raise discount rates on the other. The policy is contradictory and cannot be justified. All personnel and appropriation-related actions must be completely eliminated without any personal opinions, and then we can talk about planning and development. As for the implementing agency, the local government should be utilized in advance. If it is not absolutely necessary, it is not appropriate to create new names and set up redundant staff, which will increase the burden on the national treasury. In particular, personnel who enforce control should not talk about control without pure character! It is not yet known whether the Legislative Yuan's proposal to abolish this type of agency will be passed, and it is recommended that the department in charge does not need to panic because of this. Moreover, if the current control is really worthy of being continued, it is not necessarily a necessary condition to maintain the original corrupt and incompetent agency across the board!

### Hainan Island Development Plan; Guangdong's Nine District Commissioner's Offices Have Completed the Draft; Yulin Will Be Built into a Modern Military Port

[Our Newspaper, Haikou, 20th] It is reported that the development of Hainan Island's resources is imperative. Government officials and American experts have come to Hainan one after another to conduct preliminary investigations. In addition to organizing and studying important data, they have also ordered the nine district commissioner's offices to conduct detailed investigations of various local specialties and draft development plans. The draft plan has now been compiled and printed, and submitted to American aid experts for reference. The content includes iron ore, water conservancy, fishing, salt, sugar, and agriculture. If successful implementation is achieved, the entire Guangdong economic construction problem will also benefit significantly. According to a certain official here, the construction funds for Hainan Island may account for one-fifth of the total U.S. aid construction funds. The plan to build Yulin in the south of the island into a modern military port is also said to be implemented simultaneously. In addition to being able to berth 10,000-ton large warships, its surrounding area is also extremely rich in iron ore, fishing, and salt. The county where it is located, Yaxian, has always been praised as the treasure trove of southern China. In addition to having an airport, it is also the only place on Hainan Island with a railway. Unfortunately, our country's strength has not been able to achieve this quickly. This great and extremely difficult plan depends on the United States to promote it. Recently, it has been rumored that Hainanese merchants in Hong Kong have issued a declaration protesting the United States' use of Hainan Island, which refers to this. According to well-placed sources, Hainan Island urgently needs to be developed, and the protest does not represent public opinion.

### US Aid Cotton; 91,000 Bales Arrive in Shanghai

After Lang explained in detail that Taiwan's increased production depends entirely on transportation, it was approved that US aid for transportation would focus on the Guangdong-Hankou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Taiwan Railway lines, with the allocation amount determined according to the proportion of the length of the lines. Lang reported to Chairman Wei at 10 o'clock, and Wei expressed his gratification.

Recently, 200 tons of pulp and 170 tons of sulfur have been shipped from Shanghai, which is enough for three to four months of use. After the old generator is repaired, it can generate 800 kilowatts per day, which can be used to supplement the insufficient power supply in northern Hebei. According to the person in charge of the factory, under the current situation, the monthly paper production can exceed 500 tons, an increase of 200 tons compared to before.

### Xiamen Uncovers Arms Case; Appears to be Someone Harboring Leaks

[Our Newspaper, Xiamen, 19th] Yesterday, the Military Police Corps uncovered a large number of arms in the luggage of overseas passengers on the passenger ship Zhi Shadan Ni.

The three suspects are from Jinjiang and Tongan. The case has now been reported to higher authorities for processing.

### Tang Huisun Returns to Beijing to Discuss Land Reform in North China

Strengthening Implementation Will Be Effective

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Tang Huisun, Political Deputy of the Ministry of Land Affairs, went to North China for inspection and interviewed Director, General Commander Fu, and exchanged views on land reform. He told reporters: During this inspection in North China, all localities enthusiastically promoted land reform. Shanxi implemented the integration of soldiers and farmers. The goal is "Those who cultivate the land have land to plant." All cultivated land is divided into "portions" by the government and distributed to national soldiers for cultivation. Landlords still retain ownership, but the government controls the distribution rights, so that farmers can obtain the right to use the land. This policy has indeed been thoroughly implemented in Shanxi and has been quite effective. It is worth emulating in other provinces. For the implementation of land reform in the jurisdiction of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, General Commander Chuan has drafted measures, which generally follow the provisions of the Regulations on the Disposal of Land in the Pacification Zone promulgated by the Central Government. A further step is to levy a land price donation, which is levied progressively according to the amount of compensation that should be received based on the area of land requisitioned. I have discussed the implementation measures with General Commander Chuan in detail, and I hope that they can be implemented soon. As for the measures adopted by Commissioner Wang Fenghan of the Tenth District of Hebei, the main purpose is to protect tenant farmers and increase the burden on landlords, so that they give up the land. According to observations in various parts of North China, there is an urgent need to implement land reform. If the local authorities are truly responsible and strengthen implementation, the results will be considerable.

### Heavy Rain in Beijing Causes Disaster; Over 15,000 Mu of Flooded Land

### Our Country's Private Offers to Sell Goods, Allied Headquarters Accepts 26 Cases, Proposal to Exchange Coal for Japanese Timber Rejected

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The trade section of our delegation to Japan announced on the afternoon of the 20th that the Allied Headquarters had accepted all of the items offered for sale by private Chinese traders through our delegation before July 12th, with a total value of approximately US$500,000.

The reasons given were twofold: (1) Japan must do everything possible to protect its forests to avoid floods. (2) Japan's timber needs are three times its domestic production. To achieve its goal of producing 36 million tons of coal in this fiscal year, Japan still needs to import mining timber from abroad.

### Temporary School Buildings for Northeastern Universities Have Been Found in Beiping and Tianjin, "July 5th" Investigation Committee to be Established Today

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 20th] The North China剿匪總司令部 (剿匪總司令部 was a military organization tasked with suppressing Communist insurgents) convened a meeting today with the persons in charge of temporary schools for Northeastern universities, with Qin Fengchuan, chairman of the Cultural and Educational Committee, presiding. They discussed issues such as school buildings, student registration, the temporary middle school and temporary university system, and the "July 5th" incident. The comprehensive conclusions were: (1) Without resolving the issue of school buildings, nothing can proceed. The resolved cases are: the temporary middle school in Beiping will be located at Huang Temple, and the temporary middle school in Tianjin will be located at the Yamato School. The cram school will be located at the Tianjin Racecourse. There is still no site for the temporary university. (2) Determine the student status of unregistered schools so that they can be assigned to schools after cram school. The specific instructions from the Ministry of Education are still pending. There are great hidden worries about this issue, as many are demanding unconditional admission. (3) The temporary university system still needs to be considered. Most support the old recommendations of Mr. 維特. (4) The "July 5th" incident should be resolved quickly. (5) National universities do not agree with the Ministry of Education's directive to admit unqualified students. (6) The quota for temporary middle schools is 1,000 people, which is too far from the actual number of 5,000. It should be relaxed. (7) Please transmit a telegram from Fu Zuoyi to the Ministry of Education to help resolve the problem.

[Another Dispatch] Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education, telegraphed the persons in charge of Northeastern universities on the 20th, hoping that they would quickly find housing and begin classes. Also, registration for temporary middle schools will begin on the 26th.

[Another Dispatch] Letters of appointment for the members of the "July 5th" incident investigation committee were sent out by the剿匪總司令部 today, hoping they would begin their work immediately.

### Handling the Aftermath of the Kunming Student Unrest, Students with Serious Criminal Suspicions to be Dealt with by the Special Criminal Court

Summer Camp to be Established Soon

Students under the age of fifteen will be returned to their parents for discipline, and those over fifteen will enter summer camp for re-education. From now on, the three parties of family, school, and government will work together to take responsibility for rectifying the academic atmosphere and promoting the withdrawal of politics from schools. (2) Liu Yingshi, the counselor of the Ministry of Education, expressed two points at the faculty meeting of Yunnan University: (A) Uphold the spirit of professors governing the university, strengthen administrative organization, and improve administrative efficiency. (B) Regarding students' ideological issues, cultivate truly democratic minds.

### Taiwan Provincial Assembly Requests Central Government to Demand Return of "Green Tiger Flag" from Japan, Japanese Officials Say It Was Destroyed by Fire

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] It is reported that the "Green Tiger Flag", which was looted from Taiwan by Japan fifty-three years ago, was destroyed by fire while being stored in the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry. The flag was once the national flag of the Republic of Taiwan, established in 1895 by Chinese patriots who opposed the annexation of Taiwan by the Japanese Empire. They resisted the Japanese invaders for six months before being defeated. The Taiwan Provincial Assembly recently requested the central government to demand the return of the "Green Tiger Flag," which has historical value to Taiwan. However, officials at the Japanese Imperial Household Ministry here doubt that the flag still exists. They believe that the flag was destroyed by fire after Japan surrendered.

### Ships Transporting Grain Leaving Chongqing Must First Report to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Chongqing Pacification Commissioner's Office Formulates Measures

### Socialist Party Opposes Increasing National Defense Expenditures, French Schuman Cabinet Falls, President Summons Leaders of Various Parties to Discuss Cabinet Formation

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The National Assembly passed an amendment proposed by the Socialist Party to reduce the national defense budget by 12 billion francs by a vote of 297 to 214. After a vote of no confidence in the Schuman cabinet, the Schuman cabinet resigned at midnight last night. President Auriol has begun consultations with the leaders of various parties to find a new prime minister. Auriol, according to precedent, first met with Thorez, the leader of the Communist Party, the largest party in the Assembly, and Duclos, the leader of the Communist Party members' group. It is generally believed that this consultation is a formality before forming a cabinet and is not given much importance. It is believed that the Communist Party will not be mandated to form a cabinet, or even re-enter the cabinet. President Auriol is deeply dissatisfied with the Socialist Party's forcing the government to collapse amid international tensions. Before the national defense budget bill was voted on by the National Assembly, seven Socialist cabinet members had already submitted their resignations to Prime Minister Schuman, refusing to compromise on the amendment to reduce national defense spending. It is generally believed that the organization of a new cabinet will be very difficult. The newspaper believes that it will still accommodate members of the Socialist Party, but it is not absolutely impossible to organize a center-right cabinet without accommodating the Socialist Party. Possible candidates for prime minister are Radical Party member Marie, People's Republican Party member Bidault, Minister of Interior Mollet of the Socialist Party, Vice President of the National Assembly Lettrgues, and former Prime Minister Ramadier. Auriol is unlikely to find a suitable prime minister candidate and mandate them to form a cabinet before Wednesday, and the new prime minister must also obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly before forming a cabinet, so the formation of the new cabinet will be a week later. Before its establishment, the Schuman cabinet will continue to serve temporarily.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French cabinet crisis has reached an impasse because President Auriol has failed to find a suitable prime minister candidate. After meeting with the leaders of various parties this morning, Auriol admitted that the prospect of finding a suitable prime minister candidate is still far away. Observers predict that if President Auriol still fails to find someone to form a cabinet within the next 24 hours, he may have to use the mechanism of holding a general election. The main reason for the impasse is that the major parties in parliament have roughly equal strengths, and no party is willing to make appropriate concessions to cooperate in organizing a new middle-of-the-road government. At the same time, General de Gaulle also gave a speech, pointing out that the past government's mismanagement of the country cannot allow incompetent governments to govern again. He also said that the French People's Movement is willing to obtain the power to govern, and such power must be granted by the people. De Gaulle's intention is to demand a general election so that his People's Movement has a chance to win. Some people believe that the appearance of de Gaulle may force the Socialist Party and the Radical Party to agree to make concessions and organize a new coalition cabinet to avoid holding a general election.

### Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Decide to Adopt Delaying Tactics Towards the Soviet Union, Bidault Returns Home Early from The Hague

[United Press, The Hague, 20th] The Western European Union's five-nation foreign ministers meeting today believed that the situation in Germany was extremely serious and decided to adopt delaying tactics towards the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, The Hague, 20th] The collapse of the French Schuman government was like a wake-up call to the Western European Union meeting. French Foreign Minister Bidault is scheduled to return home tonight, and other foreign ministers agreed to cancel the final formal meeting in the afternoon. The five foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg privately discussed the problems caused by the French political crisis this morning. The French crisis affected the foundation of the main issues discussed, namely the defense of Western Europe. However, a major Western European country actually announced the dissolution of the government because parliament opposed increasing national defense equipment.

It is reported that the United States has warned the five Western European countries that the establishment of the US military aid plan may take several years. The communique of the Western European meeting closing on the 20th will only lightly mention the two important issues of the German issue and US military aid. Regarding the Berlin issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin listened to the other four foreign ministers' calls against a showdown with the Soviet Union. Bidault and the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg especially opposed the bold attempt to use force to open the blockade. They strongly advocated restoring four-power negotiations with all efforts.

[Reuters, The Hague, 20th] The five foreign ministers of the Western European Union continued the second day, also the last day, of the Western European Union Advisory Committee meeting at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 20th. Foreign Secretary Bevin also held a separate three-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Bidault in advance, which almost reviewed the general international situation. According to the spokesperson of the Advisory Committee meeting, a communique will be issued after the end of this meeting. Although secrecy has been strictly maintained since the start of this meeting, people close to the five-nation delegations said that the atmosphere at the meeting was very harmonious. Good progress has been made in the discussion of the German issue, and an agreement is expected to be reached on the next action to be taken. Some observers also predict that a new note may be submitted to Moscow soon. The Dutch government hosted a banquet for the five-nation delegations in the Trêveszaal Hall of the Dutch Parliament last night.

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 20th] Regardless of the collapse of the French cabinet, the five-nation foreign ministers meeting here continued to study various political issues this morning. Economic and social issues will be handed over to a special committee for study, and the committee will draft a bill to be submitted to the plenary session for approval. Bidault plans to draft a European covenant based on the ideal of federalism today, which will include the following two points: (1) Establishing a committee to study the customs union issue of the Brussels Treaty countries; (2) Establishing a European Parliament composed of the parliaments of various countries.

### Stalin Dispatches Doctors to Visit Togliatti

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 19th] It is reported that Stalin has dispatched two Soviet doctors to visit Togliatti's injuries. The Italian Communist Party attaches great importance to Stalin's concern. The trial of the assassin who attacked Togliatti has been announced postponed because Togliatti himself is currently unable to appear in court to testify.

### British MP Suggests Promoting Five-Power Conference, Government Refuses

[Associated Press, London, 19th] The British government today rejected a suggestion in the House of Commons to seek a five-power conference with China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France to address the urgent international situation and ensure peace. Labor MP Warbey called on Britain to "stand in a position to represent the joint actions of the United Nations organization to maintain international peace and security" and proposed convening a five-power conference. Warbey said that this move is in line with Article 106 of the United Nations Charter. That article stipulates that if the major powers cannot establish an international peacekeeping force in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter, the five powers may conduct consultations. Deputy Foreign Secretary Mayhew replied, "No, sir." He continued, "We do not now need to express our desire for peace, we have not forgotten Article 106 of the Charter, but if we cannot achieve cooperation in Article 43 of the Charter, then invoking Article 106 is superfluous."

### Soviet Bull-Type Fighter Performs Threateningly, British Occupation Authorities File Protest

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] A Soviet Yak fighter plane flew at low altitude over the Gatow airport in the British sector of Berlin yesterday. The British side has formally protested to the Soviets today that this action violates aviation rules.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] A squadron of Soviet "Plow Bull" fighter planes flew here from the Soviet-occupied area today and performed fancy maneuvers at Gatow Airport. According to the British military authorities, the Soviet Command had notified the four-power aviation control station in advance that Soviet planes would fly to Berlin, but did not interfere with the Western countries' airlift operations. There are two reports about the actions of Soviet planes over the British military base. According to the US military authorities, the squadron of Soviet planes totaled twelve, two of which swooped down and quickly rose up, passing "under the belly" of a US C54 transport plane flying there. The Soviet and British airports are only about six miles apart. The British side said that eight to ten Soviet planes "circled" over Gatow Airport first, and then another flew alone next to the US transport plane, but did not make any attacking gestures.

### Soviet Union Launches Dual Offensive: Willing to Supply Berlin with Food, U.S. and Britain Expose the Intention and Resolve to Ignore It

[United Press Berlin, 20th] The Soviet Union today announced that it would supply food to residents of all districts of Berlin, which is a dual offensive against Western countries. Not only does it claim that it can supply all the food for Berlin, but it also intends to make the new Deutsche Mark issued by Western countries worthless and unusable for purchasing food.

[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The Soviet Union today adopted new measures to embarrass the Western Allies and force Britain to withdraw from Berlin. The Sokolovsky headquarters has officially announced that it will immediately allocate 100,000 tons of food and fuel ordered from Czechoslovakia and Poland to supply all districts of Berlin. Residents of all districts only need to pay with East German Marks to purchase these rations.

Political figures said that the Soviet Union's move was due to the ineffectiveness of intimidating Berlin residents, so it changed its tactics to lure the people of Berlin to accept Soviet policies with food and fuel as bait. The Western Allies are now facing a difficult problem. It is difficult for them to refuse the Soviet Union's benevolent act of helping the people of Berlin. However, if they accept it, it is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that Berlin is part of the Soviet Union and is no longer the joint responsibility of the four powers.

[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The British government issued a statement stating that the Soviet authorities' willingness to supply food and fuel to the entire city of Berlin is purely for propaganda purposes. The United States and Britain will ignore it and continue to find ways to provide supplies to West Berlin. The statement also said that West Berlin does not lack food. Since the start of the airlift, the food transported has been sufficient for application. If the Soviet Union does not cut off Berlin's transportation, the food supply to the western district is not difficult.

### British, American, and French Military Governors Hold Talks with West German Prime Minister

[Reuters Berlin, 19th] U.S. Military Governor Clay, British Military Governor Robertson, and French Military Governor Koenig held a four-hour meeting at the British Military Headquarters in Berlin today to discuss the general situation in West Germany after the prime ministers of the eleven West German states submitted counter-proposals to the London Conference on West German constitutional politics. Afterwards, Clay announced that the Berlin crisis was never mentioned in the meeting. The three governors are scheduled to meet with the prime ministers of the eleven West German states in Frankfurt on the 20th.

### Czechoslovakia Purges Army, Three Senior Generals Flee to Germany

[United Press Frankfurt, 19th] Well-informed observers predicted on the 19th that the three senior Czech generals who recently fled to Germany will reveal important aspects of the Soviet Union's European strategy. It is generally believed that these three people possess intelligence about the Soviet Union, including Czechoslovakia. These three are General Li Ska, commander-in-chief of the Czech army on the Western Front during World War II, General Van Nieck, former Minister of Defense, and General Hessel, Deputy Chief of Staff. According to military officers who accompanied the three generals to Germany, the Czech army is undergoing a purge since receiving orders from Moscow to accelerate "Sovietization." In addition, (1) Czech Army Chief of Staff Bokok has been dismissed and is under surveillance. (2) Savopolda has become a figurehead. (3) Savopolda's position is succeeded by Slansky (Secretary-General of the Czech Communist Party), who was trained in Moscow. (4) In order to purge "unreliable" officers, officer groups have been disbanded, and military police have been dispatched in serious areas. Communist militias have been organized in various villages and towns. (5) Twelve brigades of police have been stationed on the border, and another 45,000 troops have been transferred to border defense duties.

### American General Pershing Laid to Rest in Arlington with Solemn Ceremony

[United Press Washington, 19th] Marshal Pershing's state funeral was held today at Arlington National Cemetery. President Truman personally led generals and soldiers of all ranks from the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the venue to pay their respects. The ceremony was solemn and grand. The commander of the U.S. Army in World War I was laid to rest. The cemetery was covered with lush foliage and surrounded by beautiful tombs, accompanied by his former subordinates from the Philippine and European campaigns. Army chaplain Miller delivered a eulogy, saying, "Another soldier's journey has ended. Pershing was victorious in all battles during his lifetime, and now he rests in peace, awaiting the call." As the coffin was drawn by six gray horses from the Capitol to the cemetery in heavy rain, 500,000 citizens lined the streets to watch, and the procession of pallbearers stretched for a mile.

### South Korean National Assembly Holds Election: Syngman Rhee Elected President, Yi Si-yeong Elected Vice President

[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 20th] The South Korean National Assembly held its 33rd meeting today to elect the incumbent president. A total of 197 members attended, with only one absentee. The guest seats and spectator seats were full. Syngman Rhee remained in the speaker's seat and, after announcing the start of the meeting, invited representatives from the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea to report on their work. Voting began at 11 o'clock. Syngman Rhee received 180 votes, an absolute majority.

Kim Gu received 13 votes, Ahn Jae-hong received 2 votes, and one invalid ballot was cast for Dr. Philip Jaisohn because he is an American citizen and therefore considered an invalid ballot. The meeting continued in the afternoon to elect the vice president. In the first round of voting, Yi Si-yeong received 113 votes, Kim Gu received 65 votes, and Cho Man-sik received 11 votes. Because Yi Si-yeong's vote count did not exceed two-thirds, a second round of voting was held. In the second round of voting, Yi received 133 votes and was elected vice president. After being elected, Syngman Rhee told reporters: "Regarding the formation of the cabinet, it must be decided after consultation with the vice president. The prime minister will be decided first, and then the prime minister will appoint the cabinet members."

### U.S. Troops on the North Korean Border

One U.S. Soldier Killed and One Wounded Among Five

[United Press Seoul, 20th] Five U.S. soldiers were ambushed by a group of Koreans about 400 yards south of the demarcation line between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones near Kaesong on the 19th, resulting in one death and one injury. Occupation headquarters said that the group of Koreans was in U.S. territory and fled into the Soviet occupation zone after the attack, possibly one of the riot groups patrolling into the U.S. occupation zone from North Korea. This attack on U.S. troops is the first since the occupation, although several Koreans have been killed in the past at the demarcation line. A senior U.S. official said that a strongly worded protest would be lodged with the Soviet occupation authorities in Pyongyang, although the Soviet Union has not responded to previous protests regarding border incidents.

### Former Leader of Japan Progressive Party, Ken Inukai, De-Purged

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 20th] An authoritative source told a Central News Agency reporter that Ken Inukai, former leader of the Japan Progressive Party, who was once purged, will now be declared innocent. The official announcement of Ken Inukai's reinstatement is expected to be released today. Ken Inukai's return to the political arena will have a very positive impact on Japanese politics. The general public believes that Ken Inukai is one of Japan's true liberal politicians.

### Hong Kong Government Announces New Financial Measures to Prevent Escape of British Pounds

[Reuters Hong Kong, 20th] The Hong Kong government's Financial Secretary recently notified all approved banks that, effective immediately, remittances between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom exceeding 500 British pounds or its equivalent must obtain the permission of the Hong Kong Exchange Control Bureau. Banks may handle transactions without submitting them to the government for review if they find that the source of funds is indeed reliable for imports and exports, insurance premiums, reasonable travel expenses, bonuses, and interest. These restrictions are intended to prevent the use of Hong Kong's free dollar market to cheaply purchase British pounds or to allow British pound funds to escape to the United States.

### Siam's National Name Still Called Thailand

### Japanese Communist Leader Tokuda Assassinated, Kyushu Island Declares General Strike, Japanese Communist Assemblymen Protest to Government

[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Communist leaders Nosaka and Hosokawa visited Cabinet Secretary General Tomibechi on the 20th to formally protest to the government regarding the assassination attempt on Tokuda, strongly stating that this action shows that domestic armed reactionaries in Japan still exist.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 20th] Japanese Communist Party leader Sanji Nosaka (Susumu Okano) told Agence France-Presse today that after the bombing attempt on Communist leader Tokuda yesterday, local unions on Kyushu Island have already declared a general strike. Large factories in the Tokyo and Osaka areas have also held protest gatherings.

[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Japanese and Allied authorities are taking various precautions to prevent a nationwide disturbance like that in Italy from occurring due to the assassination attempt on Japanese Communist leader Tokuda. However, well-informed sources predict that a general disturbance and reaction will inevitably occur. The Japanese Communist Party has狂呼 "Ashida Cabinet Resign!" Prime Minister Ashida, who is currently traveling and lecturing in southern Honshu, only told the press that "Japan's recovery is 'extremely difficult' when extreme factions exist on both the left and right," indirectly responding to the Japanese Communist Party's accusations. He will obviously support his conservative government. A statement from the Japanese Communist Party stated: "Standing on the side of the laboring masses, we declare a resolute struggle against all reactionary underground organizations."

[United Press Saga, 20th] Koga, a 27-year-old miner who attempted to assassinate Japanese Communist leader Tokuda, told police, "I regret that I failed to kill Tokuda." He also said, "No one ordered me to carry out this task. I did it voluntarily because I firmly believe that the Communist Party is hindering Japan's true democratization. This is also why I joined the Anti-Communist Grand Alliance."

### Rumor that Soviet Tank Tactics Expert Rokossovsky Arrives in Germany, Marshal Sokolovsky Arrives in Germany

[Reuters Berlin, 19th] It is rumored here that Rokossovsky, the youngest marshal-level general in the Soviet Union who is considered the most capable strategist and tank tactics expert, has arrived in Berlin. It is rumored that he will succeed Sokolovsky as the Soviet military commander in Germany or as the commander of the Soviet Western Army. Rokossovsky was released from a Siberian concentration camp and joined the war when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. He is a courageous military strategist but not skilled in political or administrative affairs. His appointment to an important position in Germany indicates that his mission will focus on military affairs. Soviet officials have not yet confirmed the arrival of Rokossovsky in Germany or the rumor that Marshal Sokolovsky will leave office.

### Subtle Relationship Between the United States and Yugoslavia: Two Countries Sign Agreement to Resolve Financial Issues

[United Press Washington, 19th] Yugoslavia today resolved a long-standing issue with the United States in the air and on land, as a result of Tito's split with the Cominform. The Yugoslav Minister of Finance rushed from the country's capital to sign an agreement with Marshall stipulating that Yugoslavia will compensate the United States 17 million U.S. dollars for wartime and post-war losses within 45 days, including the losses of two U.S. aircraft shot down in Yugoslav territory two years ago. The United States, on the other hand, agreed to unfreeze Yugoslav gold reserves in the United States that have been frozen since 1942, and 10 million U.S. dollars of Yugoslav private property will also be unfrozen at the same time.

[United Press Washington, 19th] This move is even more meaningful as it is based on the fact that two conferences will soon be convened in Belgrade. The Yugoslav Communist Congress will be held in the Yugoslav capital on the 21st, and the Danube River Navigation Freedom Conference will be convened in the Yugoslav capital on the 29th, at which time representatives from the United States, France, and Britain will pay attention to how Tito relies on the Moscow front. This economic settlement between the United States and Yugoslavia comes immediately after Tito faces increasing economic obstruction from Soviet bloc countries.

### Atomic Bomb Missing Rumor: U.S. Navy Denies

[Reuters Washington, 20th] U.S. Navy personnel recently denied the claim made by retired Navy intelligence officer Rear Admiral Karis on a radio program yesterday that a U.S. warship carrying an atomic bomb went missing en route when the Pacific War was about to end. The statement said that no naval vessel carrying an atomic bomb has ever gone missing. Sachs said that the ship went missing while sailing to Tinian Island, a naval base in the Mariana Islands.

### Syria and Iraq Refuse Ceasefire: Fighting Rekindled in North and South of Holy Land, Bernadotte Arrives on Rhodes

[Reuters News Agency, 19th] An official declaration was issued here announcing that Iraq and Syria have refused the ceasefire in Palestine. Iraq and Syria both voted against the ceasefire resolution in Palestine, and also opposed accepting the ceasefire at the Arab League Political Committee meeting held in Lebanon.

The declaration continued: Due to the refusal of the ceasefire by Iraq and Syria, the Syrian and Iraqi troops in northern and central Palestine will continue to actively participate in the war to liberate the Holy Land, and the political leaders of the two countries will continue to urge other Arab comrades to take similar actions.

[Reuters London, 20th] Amid mutual accusations of ceasefire violations between Jews and Arabs, fighting continued on the 20th in both the northern and southern ends of the Holy Land. An Israeli spokesman said that Syrian troops continued to attack in the northeastern corner of the Holy Land, but the Damascus Gazette pointed out that Jewish troops were the first to violate the ceasefire and attack El Azi. The Foreign Jordanian Corps said that Jewish troops violated the ceasefire in Jerusalem and attacked the Miar Shulin district in the northern end of Jerusalem for as long as ninety minutes. The Israeli Gazette reiterated that Iraqi troops also attacked north of Jenin after the ceasefire, and Egyptian troops on the southern front also repeatedly attempted to cut off the transportation line between Tel Aviv and the Negev district after the ceasefire. Jewish sources also said that except for Jerusalem, there were no United Nations observers in other conflict areas. An Iraqi gazette admitted that Iraqi troops were fighting north of Jenin, claiming to have occupied the town of Rasun. About eighty Jewish soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle.

[Reuters Rhodes, 19th] United Nations Palestine mediator Count Bernadotte returned to his headquarters on Rhodes on the 19th from New York. He told reporters that he would immediately take action to determine the extent to which Syrian and Iraqi troops have disobeyed the ceasefire order. Bernadotte also confirmed that he had brought a final solution and would submit it to both the Jewish and Arab sides soon.

### Shanghai No. 9 Factory 37 Workers Indicted by Special Criminal Court: Yang Guangming and Others Strike and Riot in Violation of the National Mobilization Law, Constituting Crimes Endangering the State

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Guangming and 37 other workers from Shanghai No. 9 Factory on Macau Road in this city, on the grounds of demanding salary advances, rations, preferential treatment, etc., without legal mediation by the competent authorities and disregarding government bans, gathered crowds to strike on February 2 this year, committing violence and assaults, attempting to escalate the situation and disrupt public order. After being arrested and interrogated by the Shanghai Police Department, they were sent to the Special Criminal Court for investigation. The court has now completed its investigation and has filed a public prosecution against the detained defendants Yang Guangming, Yang Changmin (Yang Genbao, aka Xiao Genbao), Wang Zhongliang, Mao Helin, Qi Huaiqiong, Wu Baoliang, Shen Shixing, Xu Xingsheng, Peng Zhigong, Miao Xinggen, Wang Xiaodi, Fei Gaogen, Fan Jinnan, Li Dongmei, Song Heming, Deng Zhiyin, Leng Tonggen, Ma Lianzhong, Sun Hanzhao, Wu Shizhen, Zhang Fuda, Gao Baozhu, Xu Diefen, Wu Xiaoma, Chen Qingquan, Wu Achang, Wang Jinsheng, Zhang Xiuying (aka Guan Miaofu), Jiang Yaochen, Xie Shengbao, Tang Chansheng, Wang Meihua, Yin Weijun, Huang Huailian, Xiao Yaqian, Xu Quanfu, and Ding Huijin, on charges of endangering the state.

The indictment states the following facts of the crime: The defendants are all workers at Shanghai No. 9 Factory, No. 140 Macau Road in this city. At a time when suppression of the rebellion is being mobilized, they did not closely cooperate with the factory management. Instead, on January 30 this year, on the grounds of demanding salary advances, rations, preferential treatment, etc., without legal mediation by the competent authorities and disregarding government bans, they openly gathered crowds to strike. Each defendant assumed important positions. In particular, the defendant Yang Guangming secretly joined a Communist Party group with the aim of causing internal strife through the introduction of Guo Chuhuai in 1935, and worked undercover among the factory's coppersmiths.

Inciting the Masses, Declaring a Strike

In January of this year, he introduced the defendant Wu Baoliang to join the Communist Party. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he secretly manipulated the situation. On the one hand, he volunteered, claiming to be the general representative, and went on stage to give speeches, inciting the masses and declaring a strike. The workers then stationed people to guard the four factory gates, preventing any factory employees from entering or leaving. Factory Director Wu Shihua was also detained inside. The defendants Yang Guangming, Wang Zhongliang, Mao Helin, Yang Changmin, Qi Huaiqiong, etc., were elected to present seven conditions to the factory management on February 1: (1) Each person should be given two months' salary as an advance. (2) The salary deducted on November 12 should be reissued according to this month's cost of living index. (3) The annual bonus should be 60% of the previous year's amount, calculated according to the previous year's December index, and the remaining 40% should be issued this year, calculated according to the January index. (4) There should be no restrictions on the number of days of leave for production (wages calculated for seven days, and all welfare rights should be granted). (5) Rations should be reissued as usual. (6) The monthly ration of two斗 of rice and four斗 of rice for office work should be issued as four斗 as usual. (7) In the future, any regulations issued by the factory management to control workers must be agreed upon by both labor and management. The above seven conditions were not submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. When personnel from various agencies went to persuade them to come closer to an agreement, they suddenly added two more conditions: (1) If one day of leave is taken within a week, one day of wages should be compensated. (2) Workers dismissed without cause after January of the previous year should be reinstated. Together with the previous seven conditions, there were a total of nine conditions, making it difficult for the factory management to accept, so as to continue the strike and attempt to expand the scope, affecting various factories, in order to achieve their goal of disrupting local public order.

Holding Good Workers Hostage, Not Allowing Them to Open the Iron Gates

On the one hand, they organized teams for discipline, propaganda, and liaison. The defendant Yang Changmin was appointed as the general commander of the discipline brigade, ordering workers to take on discipline duties, blocking all the factory's main roads, controlling communication equipment, and stopping traffic. Subsequently, they posted slogans attacking the capitalists and insisting on the strike, restricting entry and exit. They controlled more than 6,000 workers, using economics as a slogan to implement a political struggle. The situation was serious and became increasingly intense. In the afternoon of the same day, the factory management reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau, which sent two officials, Zhu, etc., to the factory to persuade them, but they were also detained by the workers and not allowed to leave the factory. When the military police authorities of this city heard about the situation, they believed that the situation was escalating, and on the morning of February 2, they successively selected representatives to come to the factory to seek a solution, but the defendants ordered the workers to tightly close the factory gates, refusing entry. Although they broadcast through loudspeakers, ordering representatives to negotiate, they ignored them. The stalemate continued until around 5 p.m. Some good workers inside the factory requested to leave the factory, but they were also held hostage by the defendants, who did not allow them to open the iron gates. The defendant Qi Huaiqiong composed songs, advocating unity. The defendants Leng Tonggen, Ma Lianzhong, and Sun Hanzhao used performing dramas to incite persistence in the strike. Moreover, on the roof of the dining hall to the left of the factory's third iron gate, workers who were there to support the situation filled the roof with bricks and ironware to resist the military police.

### Cinema Business Depressed: Guild Considers Voluntary Price Reduction

[Report from this newspaper] Since the price adjustment at cinemas in this city last week, although the fixed-price seats are often full, the seats for other price levels have not reached 60% occupancy each day. Except for the Grand China Theater, which is still able to maintain considerable box office due to the new film "Princess Water Lily," the business of other cinemas has been extremely poor. In order to avoid the consequence of raising ticket prices and causing losses, the guild has decided to investigate and study the actual situation of each cinema to determine whether the audience's purchasing power has decreased or whether the films themselves are not up to standard recently. It is scheduled to convene a symposium with members and Western film merchants again this week to discuss the conclusion. If deemed necessary, it may voluntarily reduce ticket prices.

### Postponement of Train Schedule Adjustment: Passengers Demand Compensation for Missed Trains

[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the Beijing-Shanghai express train has been fully equipped and has undergone short-distance test runs with satisfactory results, the Railway Bureau, as a matter of prudence, plans to conduct another full Beijing-Shanghai test run within the next day or two before deciding on the official launch date. Because the launch date of the express train has been delayed, the new train schedule, which was originally scheduled by the Transportation Department to take effect yesterday (the 20th), has also been postponed. However, since Xie Zhen, who also serves as the Director of the Transportation Department, announced the schedule and its implementation date on the 14th of this month, there has been no news of a postponement. Therefore, yesterday, a passenger named Zhang Zupei sent a letter to the Railway Bureau protesting, attaching clippings from the 15th of this newspaper and two "Victory" train tickets. He stated that after reading the news in this newspaper and confirming with the North Station information desk by telephone, he purchased "Victory" train tickets at the China Travel Service yesterday and went to the North Station to board the train according to the new schedule. Unexpectedly, the "Victory" train still departed according to the old schedule, which was one hour earlier (the old schedule was 7:00 AM, the new schedule was 8:00 AM). Therefore, he demanded compensation for his losses.

Another report: On the day the express train begins service, the prices of sleeping berth tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai night express are also expected to be adjusted on the same day, with upper berths rising to 2.5 million yuan and lower berths to 3 million yuan.

### Relying on Numbers to Commit Violent Assaults Exceeds the Norm of Strikes

The representatives of the on-site authorities believed that it was difficult to reason with the strikers and decided to cut the iron gate chain to enter and dissuade the workers, and to allow law-abiding workers to escape from the dangerous situation. While the area was being opened, the defendants Shen Shixing, Xu Xingsheng, Peng Zhigong, Miao Xinggen, Fan Jinan, Wang Xiaodi, Fei Gaogen, Li Dongmei, Song Heming, Deng Ziyin, etc., threw iron tools and bricks from high places, used fire hoses to spray water, dragged security officers and police officers standing at the iron gate into the crowd and beat them, preventing them from taking action. Many police officers were injured, the situation deteriorated, and the order was extremely chaotic. The Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters personally witnessed this situation at the factory and believed that the workers were recklessly committing violent assaults, which exceeded the norm of strikes and could not be resolved through reasoning. He had no choice but to order security vehicles to risk entering and suppress the situation, and the workers' arrogance was finally quelled. In the chaos, several police officers and workers were injured or killed. The perpetrators were identified and arrested and transferred to the Shanghai Police Bureau for interrogation before being transferred to the court.

### Legal Articles Constituting Crimes

### Boatman Arrested and Handed Over for Failing to Report Finding Drugs

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Port Management Committee's Investigation and Security Team received a report that a boatman, Wang Youfa, found a coffee-colored iron can on the river surface near Donggou on the afternoon of the 27th of last month. After opening and inspecting it, he discovered that it was top-quality Indian opium, weighing a total of twelve taels and five maces. Wang then concealed the matter without reporting it. It was later learned that the drugs had been thrown from a foreign ship that had sailed from Calcutta to Shanghai on the same day. Before the ship entered port, customs had received intelligence that the ship's crew was smuggling large quantities of opium, so the anti-smuggling unit dispatched a speedboat to monitor the ship, causing the drug smugglers to become nervous and throw the drugs into the river. The Port Management Committee transferred the case to the Municipal Police Bureau for handling. Director Yu approved the case to be thoroughly investigated by Chen Jinsheng, the section chief of the Criminal Investigation Section. Wang Youfa and other suspects, including Zhang Zhenrong, Xia Maomao, Sun Zonghua, and Chen Kouzi, were arrested and interrogated.

At the same time, the confessions of the various suspects were also largely consistent.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zheng Shaohua, Wang Pei, and Song Siyan, three plainclothes police officers from the Longhua Sub-Bureau of the Police Bureau, were ordered by the section chief to search the home of Shen Fengkun, the dance hostess manager at the Xianle Ballroom, for drugs. They found a set of drug paraphernalia and a small amount of ash and arrested Shen Fengkun and Shen's wife, Zhong Feifei. Shen then asked Wu Songshan, a friend of Wang Pei, to intercede with the police, and they agreed on a bribe of 1.5 billion yuan to release Shen's wife and conceal the ash. Shen did not have the cash and used four diamond rings as collateral, agreeing to redeem them at Wu Songshan's home at 9 Wangting Road between 8:00 and 9:00 PM on the 13th of this month. On the 12th, Shen redeemed three diamond rings with a gold bracelet and three gold rings, weighing a total of one tael and nine qian and two fen. She was unable to redeem the remaining ring and, feeling resentful, reported the police to the Songshan Sub-Bureau for extortion. The Police Bureau sent officers to wait at Wu's home, and at 5:00 PM on the 15th, the three police officers arrived and were arrested. After investigation, it was determined that Xiang Shaohua and the other two had engaged in extortion, and Wu Songshan's attempt to bribe them had failed. They were transferred to the District Court yesterday for detention and investigation on the charge of corruption under special criminal law.

[Our Dispatch] The Yulin Road Police Sub-Bureau cracked a case of counterfeiting rice ration coupons yesterday, arresting two perpetrators on the spot and seizing 2,000 printed counterfeit coupons.

### The Iron-Chained Stone Figures are Gone; Incense Burned to See Off the Ignorant

[Our Dispatch] The pair of stone figures opposite the Racecourse, which were worshiped as deities by the ignorant people, were dismantled yesterday by the Public Works Bureau in conjunction with the Police Bureau and temporarily discarded in Song Park in Zhabei. The dismantling work began at around 8 a.m. The Public Works Bureau sent Ge Deming, the chief of the construction section of the construction office, and eighteen technicians to carry out the work. The Police Bureau sent more than twenty soldiers armed with live ammunition from the New City Sub-Bureau and the Security General Team to guard the area, placing a light machine gun nearby to prevent the ignorant people from interfering. The stone figure on the east side suffered the first misfortune, with a large crack in its lower part. Because its body was made of inferior bluestone, it could not withstand the vibration after being exposed to incense smoke day and night for four or five decades, and it broke apart. The eastern stone figure was lifted off its base at 10:30 a.m., and the western stone figure was not completely dismantled until the afternoon.

Dignity Lost When Suspended in the Air

The dismantling method was as follows: technicians first loosened the base feet, and then erected a horizontal wooden beam between the walls and telephone poles, installing a lifting gear (referred to by technicians as a "celestial winch"). A steel cable was looped around the stone figure's head and neck, and a thick rope was tied around the stone figure's waist, with one end attached to the iron hook of the lifting gear. As the gear turned, the stone figure, weighing more than three tons, began to shake, then was lifted into the air and laid flat on the ground. As this huge object, clangoring with iron chains, swayed in the air, although its form remained the same, its former dignity seemed to have vanished. During the dismantling, the sidewalk in front of the racecourse across the street was crowded with onlookers, and passengers in passing vehicles also craned their necks to look out, significantly affecting traffic. There were still some pious men and women carrying incense, candles, tin foil, and other offerings, but they were stopped by the police. These ignorant people then turned to Xinchang Road and kowtowed and worshiped the wall. Among the onlookers, there was much discussion, with some saying "What a sin!" and others saying "If the stone bodhisattva is effective, the people who dismantle it should immediately get a stomachache!"

Some People Requested Custody, But Were Unsuccessful

After the two stone figures were dismantled, City Councilman Zhang Zhongyuan and the movie "Bad Guy" Hong Jingling suddenly arrived, claiming to have been entrusted by the owner, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to organize a custody committee, requesting that the dismantled stone figures be moved to the Fuxing Pudu Shantang on Yanjiazhai Road, Xibaoxing Road. However, the Public Works Bureau personnel refused the request, stating that they had not received orders from their superiors, and still transported the two stone figures to Song Park. Hong and others argued in vain, claiming that they would negotiate with the municipal government to achieve their goal. Therefore, the future fate of the stone figures is still uncertain. However, last night, in front of the original site of the stone figures, there were still many ignorant men and women who believed that "although the statues are gone, the deities are still there," so they still came to worship the empty space, and the incense was even more abundant than before. Above, there were black characters "Give much peace to beloved China, and grant happiness and prosperity to the people of Shanghai." However, judging from the depth of the stone figures' power over the ignorant, what it grants to China is just a string of troubles for the municipal authorities.

### Grafting and Resurrecting a Corpse: A Major Case in Sichuan's Education Circle; Impersonating a Principal

[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 18th via airmail] Strange phenomena are constantly emerging in Sichuan's education circle. Recently, a bizarre drama of a provincial Daxian middle school principal impersonating someone else occurred. The facts have unfolded over several years, with bizarre twists and turns, truly an unprecedented strange situation in the education circle.

The current principal of Daxian Middle School in Sichuan Province, Su Ji (real name Su Peiyuan), was newly appointed by the Director of Education, Ren Juewu, at the end of last year. Su Peiyuan is originally from Fuling, Sichuan, and studied at Fuling County High School. During the War of Resistance, he worked as a clerk in a certain organization in the wartime capital. It so happened that Su Ji, from Guan County, Sichuan, who had studied in France, was working in a neighboring department. Their dormitories were located in adjacent houses. When enemy planes wreaked havoc and air raid alarms were frequent, Su Ji and his wife often went to nearby air raid shelters to hide, and thus often met Su Peiyuan, and they gradually became friendly. On one occasion, enemy planes heavily bombed the city, and a bomb hit the air raid shelter. Su Ji was unfortunately seriously wounded and died for his country. In the chaos, Su Peiyuan unintentionally picked up a leather bag. Upon inspection, he realized it belonged to Su Ji and contained all of his academic and professional credentials, which he cherished and kept for his own use. Later, Su Ji's wife often met Su Peiyuan in the air raid shelter, feeling lonely and lost. Over time, love developed, and they began living together. Peiyuan then told her about picking up the credentials. So, they plotted together for Peiyuan to use Su Ji's name. At the time, Su Ji's wife's father was holding an important position in a certain department. She delicately explained the situation to her father, who reluctantly understood and introduced her to another higher position.

After the victory, Su Ji, through his father-in-law's introduction, became a supervisor in the Ministry of Education and flew to Jinzhou, Shenyang, and other places to inspect. At the end of last year, he returned to Sichuan, carrying a letter of introduction from Minister Zhu Jiayi, and met with Ren Juewu, the Director of Education of Sichuan Province. Due to his qualifications and background, and the fact that he was from the same hometown as Ren (Ren was also from Guan County), he was appointed as the principal of Daxian Middle School in Sichuan Province by Ren. Su claimed to be from Fuling to his fellow townsmen from Fuling, and from Guan County to those from Guan County. This major case is well-known in the education circle. Recently, someone raised the issue during the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, and the Department of Education is thoroughly investigating the truth.

### Wu Jiang's Lake Fields Submerged; Motorboats Rented for Drainage

Hopes for Saving Rice

[Our Dispatch from Wuxi, 19th] The Wai Nan Ku of Wujiang, located in Taihu Lake, has been surrounded by more than 9,000 acres of lake fields in recent years. A farm has been established by the Anti-Japanese War Orphans School, and people have been recruited to cultivate it, with Zhao Anmin as the farm manager. During the recent storms, the lake fields were completely submerged, with three to four feet of water accumulated in the fields. More than a thousand farmers are currently raising the dikes. Manager Zhao sent his brother, Anbang, to Wuxi to contact the Wuxi Drainage Industry Association and arrange for it to rent 29 drainage motorboats from Wuxi, Chengxiang, Wujiang, and Yushan counties to carry out rescue operations, specifying that drainage for one hour would cost 2.4 liters of white rice per inch of pipe.

### Clearing Accumulated Grain in Changzhou

[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 19th] A total of more than 34,400 stone of accumulated grain were levied from the 35th year in our county, and more than 13,060 stone of accumulated grain were levied from the 36th year, totaling more than 47,000 stone. Except for more than 10,800 stone retained in various rural areas for safekeeping, the Accumulated Grain Storage Association only had more than 500 stone in actual storage, and the remaining approximately 30,000 stone were all in the County Land and Grain Office. The Accumulated Grain Storage Association repeatedly urged for allocation for safekeeping, but during Weng's tenure, there was no response. The County Council specially formed a clearing committee, which has now designated members to conduct thorough investigations. Furthermore, there were many instances of corruption among the officials in charge of land and grain during Weng's tenure.

### Jiyuan Theater in Jiaxing Destroyed; Two Soldiers Involved in the Incident Detained

[Our Dispatch from Jiaxing, 19th] At 11:30 p.m. on the 17th, the Jiyuan Yue Opera Theater in our county was destroyed by more than twenty members of the township defense team, who destroyed all of the tickets, scenery, lighting, and other equipment, resulting in a loss of 700 million yuan. The cause was that after the performance began that evening, four members of the Buyun National Guard team purchased three tickets to enter the theater. The ticket collector stopped them because they had purchased one less ticket. A conflict immediately broke out between the two sides. During the fight, there were minor injuries. Yang, the chief inspector of the police bureau, came out to mediate, but to no avail. After the performance ended and the audience dispersed, they proceeded to destroy the theater and fled in all directions. Upon hearing the news, the county magistrate immediately dispatched a platoon of security police to maintain order. The authorities detained two soldiers from the National Guard team responsible for the incident on the 19th. As for the theater's losses, the commander of the regimental district, Commander Lü, and the deputy chief of the National Guard team, Luo, mediated and settled the matter with a compensation of 50 million yuan.

### Strange Insects Discovered in Qianwei; Rice and Wheat All Eaten

[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 17th] The Chongshan Forest, covering more than 400 li in the Huangchang and Wangchang towns of Qianwei County, Sichuan, has recently been discovered to have a type of strange yellow-black insect resembling a caterpillar, numbering in the thousands. When first discovered, it ate all the pine needles and bark of the pine forest, spanning more than 200 li, in just a few days. It then began to devour the rice and wheat in several thousand acres of rice paddies in the area. It could not be driven away, and anyone who touched it would immediately develop redness and swelling all over their body. Those severely affected would die overnight. Currently, all the rice and wheat in the area have been eaten. Residents have moved elsewhere to avoid them. The county government has sent a letter to scientific institutions here to study and eliminate them.

### Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association Urges Prompt Allocation of Cotton to Factories

[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin, 19th] The Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Association held its second general membership meeting in Chengxiang on the 12th, stating that since the establishment of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, it had issued an order that each factory's cotton reserves should not exceed three months and that they were not allowed to freely purchase cotton. All raw materials needed by the factories were to be allocated by the committee. Since the factories complied, their cotton reserves were about to be depleted, but the committee did not provide any raw materials. Although the association has a foreign sales committee that exchanges cotton for cloth exported abroad and supplies it to the factories, it is far from meeting the actual needs. At a time when the factories lack raw materials and will be forced to shut down, in addition to applying to the Cotton Yarn Management Committee for prompt allocation of cotton to each factory to maintain operations, if the committee cannot allocate raw materials, the factories will be forced to shut down.

### Reader's Mailbox: Arranging a Marriage Leads to a Great Mistake; Has Been Gone for Thirty Years, Why Still Not Returning?

Mr. Recipient,

My late brother, Xu Jie, styled Chengjie, dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by his parents, enrolled in the Fine Arts Department of Aurora University around 1920 or 1921. After that, he never returned home. Later, correspondence gradually thinned, and after graduation, his whereabouts became uncertain. My family lives in a remote mountainous area of Guixi, Jiangxi Province, where transportation is difficult, the atmosphere is backward, and banditry is rampant. Years of fleeing made it impossible to actively search for him. Now, my elderly parents are sick with longing for him. I, Chengqiu, have come to Shanghai again, inquiring everywhere. Besides asking Aurora University, his alma mater, to investigate his whereabouts, I respectfully request your esteemed newspaper, the mouthpiece of the people, which provides extensive services to society and benefits the people, and has a good reputation, to publish this letter, so that my elder brother may see the news and return home, or that friends who know him may inform him of his whereabouts and convey the message on my behalf. If my family can be reunited because of this, this kindness and virtue will be engraved in our hearts forever and never forgotten! I respectfully wish you peace.

### The Border Area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei: The Problem of Filling the Vacuum Zone

— Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, April 18th] Since the Ministry of National Defense announced the establishment of the "Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region," under the direct command of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, the defense of southern Shaanxi has been transferred from the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters to the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters. This is of great significance in preventing Communist bandits from entering Sichuan via the Shaanxi-Hubei border.

In a previous report, "The Border Area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, the Defense of Dabashan Mountains" (published in this newspaper on April 18th), I detailed the three possible routes the Communist bandits would take to invade Sichuan: (1) from Zhenba in southern Shaanxi, through Gunlongpo, to Wanyuan; (2) from Ziyang, through Dazhu River, to Sichuan; and (3) from western Hubei, through Jixinling, to Wuxi. Since occupying Baihe and Xunyang in southern Shaanxi in April, (Note: Xunyang is now in the hands of the National Army) the bandit troops under Kong Congzhou have never abandoned their attempts to harass Ankang. If Ankang is not defended, it will be difficult for the National Army to resist the invasion of Communist bandits on the edge of Dabashan Mountains. Director Deng Xihou has repeatedly emphasized to this newspaper's reporter: "Defending Dabashan Mountains is not enough to stop the Communist bandits. Strengthening the defenses of Ankang and Hanzhong in southern Shaanxi is the only way to defend against bandits outside Sichuan." He believes that if the Communist bandits attack Wanyuan, Chengkou, and Wuxi along Dabashan Mountains, it will only be harassment. Their main force will definitely try to attack Hanzhong and occupy Guangyuan, because the main purpose of the Communist bandits' invasion of Sichuan is to seize soldiers and grain.

In response to this fact, the "Yiyang" troops, a strong force defending Dabashan Mountains, has departed from its original station to a certain place in southern Shaanxi. Although the "Yiyang" troops are described as "a force that has never fought a war" in the broadcast by Kong Bandit, those familiar with the military situation know that the Kong bandits entrenched in Yunxi and Yun County in northern Hubei, and the Tan Daopeng bandits in Baihe, have already begun to panic. Because the "Yiyang" troops are the only powerful force in the National Army that has not been depleted since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. For years, they have been stationed on the border of Sichuan and Kangding. Southern Sichuan, central Sichuan, and northeastern Sichuan are the pillars of stabilizing the southwest.

The command structure of the National Army on the Sichuan-Shaanxi border has been unified, but the border area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei is reportedly still a vacuum. For several months, the bandit gangs that fled south from Baihe Ka Shijie to Zhushan and Zhuxi in western Hubei have not been thoroughly suppressed. The stronghold of Deshengpu, which controls Liangzhu (Zhushan and Zhuxi), has been lost and regained several times by the National Army. The most tense period in Zhushan was when the Communist bandits reached Beixing Hetang, only a few tens of miles from the county seat. The 15th Pacification Zone felt the seriousness of the situation and sent Chen Yun, deputy commander of the 8th Security District, to sit in Zhushan County. If the Kong bandits are under pressure from the National Army in the Shaanxi and Hubei area, they will definitely flee to this vacuum zone in western Hubei. How to deploy the defenses of western Hubei and prevent Communist bandits from harassing eastern Sichuan is an important issue facing the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters and the 15th Pacification Zone.

### Authorities Tighten Credit and Sell Off Goods; Prices Decline Across the Board Yesterday; Market Reaction to Large Denomination Notes Improves

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of the issuance of large denomination notes. Because the relevant authorities were planning to sell off goods, resulting in tight credit and high black market interest rates, prices generally fell back. In the Chinese stock sector, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Meyer, and Xinguang, a total of thirteen varieties, plummeted due to widespread selling, all reaching their price limits. Rice, flour, oil, and grains also fell back by about 10% due to tight credit and weak buying interest. Superior rice fell to 36 million, and special superior rice fell back to 39 million. The yarn market was particularly affected by the temporary allocation of resources for the textile industry, with market prices falling by about 20% compared to the previous day. Except for a few commodities such as soap and cigarettes, the prices of daily necessities also slightly decreased. Currently, in order to stabilize the market and offset the impact of the issuance of large denomination notes, the Central Bank has decided to plan a large-scale allocation of daily necessities such as rice, sugar, and yarn to tighten credit and suppress rising prices. Yesterday, the capital inflow of national banks and bureaus exceeded 1.2 trillion. The Central Bank also stated that it currently holds 160,000 bales of cotton yarn, enough sugar for the city's needs for two months. The allocation of 5,000 bales of yarn by the textile industry yesterday could absorb 8 trillion in cash. At the same time, 2,000 boxes of rayon purchased from Italy by the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) at a cost of 1.1 million per box arrived on the 18th of this month, and rayon allocation can be resumed next week. Currently, the policy of the financial authorities seems to be to prevent a sharp rise in prices by means of selling off goods, so that it can be connected with the use of US aid in a month and a half.

### Tight Credit Intensifies; Massive Stock Sales Lead to Sharp Declines

Chinese stocks yesterday were under planned pressure from national banks, and credit was extremely tight. Even ninety-cent foreign exchange was difficult to obtain. All goods declined, with no exceptions, except for Meilin Liandi, which rose to its limit. Nine out of ten stocks suffered heavy losses.

The market still struggled to rally in the morning. Yong Yarn opened at 10,850 yuan, and stocks such as 213, 76, and Guangbang 202 were sold off, resulting in a massive slump. Although there was a slight rebound in the middle, it was of no avail. Stocks such as 60 and 16 were sold down to 10,250 yuan, and stocks such as 193 and 131 rose to 10,400 yuan, but stocks such as 180 and 121 were sold down to the limit of 10,125 yuan. No credit could be obtained. Stocks such as 54 and 134 were sold down to 9,900 yuan, below the limit, and closed. Stocks that fell to their limits included Zhabei, Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing, Meyer, Jinglun, and Zhongsi. Except for Meilin Liandi, which rose to its limit, and Tongyi, which remained flat, the rest fell by anywhere from half a percentage point to a strong percentage point.

The afternoon market continued to struggle. Yong Yarn opened high at 10,300 yuan, and stocks such as 12 and 187 rose to 10,650 yuan. After stocks such as 137, 16 and 54 rose, there was selling pressure. It was expected that the capital inflow of national banks would exceed 3 trillion, which would reverse the trend. However, stocks such as 145 and bank stocks 220, 56, and 207 were sold down to 10,250 yuan before the market stabilized. With the capital inflow of national banks exceeding 1 trillion, the situation was uncertain. Yong Yarn closed at 10,400 yuan, with the after-hours bid dropping to 10,350 yuan or lower. Compared to the morning close, Meilin still stood at the limit, Tongyi was still flat, Yong Yarn, Meyer, Xinhe, Qinxing, Lianan, Zhongsi, Commercial Press, Xinhua, all rose slightly. Hengfeng, Jingfu, Xinguang, Rongfeng, Underwear, Jinglun, Yonggong, Lianan, Guohuo, and Zhongfa all rose by half a percentage point. The unlisted stocks outside the market were more sluggish, with cultural textile stocks falling slightly by half a percentage point. The rest remained mediocre.

Government bonds also turned down yesterday. Unification C opened at 1.12 million in the morning and fell to 1 million before stabilizing slightly. Over 4 million were traded. Compared to the previous close, A and B bonds fell by 60,000 yuan, C bonds fell by 90,000 yuan, D bonds fell by 70,000 yuan, and E bonds fell by 100,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Product Prices Rise

[Report from this Newspaper] According to tea industry insiders, since the issuance of large denomination notes, the tea market in this city has once been stirred up, but it has turned peaceful due to tight credit. Currently, it has affected tea merchants in the producing areas. The asking prices are reported to be soaring, almost on par with tea prices in this city. If freight and all other fees are added, it is feared that it will exceed the market conditions in Shanghai. Therefore, the sources are gradually becoming sluggish. Looking at this situation, the industry in this city will likely follow suit and gradually increase prices.

Yesterday's tea market: Although sellers tried to push prices higher, buyers were also bearish due to the downturn in various commodities. Therefore, they watched and waited, and the process was powerless to rise. In the end, the market remained stable, and trading was not active.

### Rayon Plummets

The rayon market experienced a severe downturn yesterday, with a loss of over 400 million yuan compared to the previous day. No. 120, Jin Sanma, and Youguang had a transaction of 1.16 billion yuan per box at the opening in the morning. However, due to oversupply, prices fell steadily. The minimum spot price fell to 1.8 billion yuan. It improved slightly at the close, with an asking price of 1.9 billion yuan. Due to tight credit, the maximum profit for the day was 180 million yuan, and the initial profit was 160 million yuan. The asking price opened at 2 billion yuan in the afternoon, once rising to 2.05 billion yuan, but falling to 1.9 billion yuan at the close. Finally, the after-hours price fell to 1.86 billion yuan, resulting in a decrease of 450 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory-made yarn prices also plummeted yesterday, and trading was extremely scarce. Due to very tight credit, buyers were unable to purchase. A small amount of high-grade zero-waste was sold at 1.1 billion yuan, but the loan had a term of three or four days. There were no transactions at other levels. The asking price was about 300 million yuan lower than the previous day. The market for dried silk also declined accordingly yesterday.

### 2,000 Boxes of Italian Rayon Arrive in Shanghai

Approximately 2,000 boxes of rayon purchased by the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) from Italy have been shipped to Shanghai and are currently undergoing customs clearance and unloading procedures. Allocation will begin in early next month. It is reported that the China Industrial and Mining Corporation purchased a large quantity of rayon from Italy and will ship it to Shanghai in batches.

### China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) South China Branch Ordered to Close

### Coal Slurry Exchanged for Pit Props

China Industrial and Mining Corporation (Zhongxinju) Implements Barter Trade with Japan

### Long Positions Eager to Sell, Market Sentiment Fearful; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline Across the Board

Yesterday's cotton yarn market: Due to the large-scale sell-off by the Yarn Control Committee the previous day, the market felt the pressure of tight credit as soon as it opened. Long positions were eager to sell, and the market was full of supply. The buying interest was sluggish. The market atmosphere was further weakened by the sharp decline in cloth prices and stock prices.

42-count blue phoenix fine yarn was initially quoted at 1.65 billion yuan, but immediately fell by 170 million yuan. It once rebounded to 1.7 billion yuan in the middle. However, at 11:30, the Textile Building Company suddenly announced the sale of five types, including 20-count Jincheng, at low prices. The market was oversupplied and ended at 1.55 billion, a further decline of 270 million yuan compared to the previous day.

A total of 72 transactions were made throughout the day.

Cotton cloth market: After the issuance of large denomination notes, the authorities immediately sold off a large amount of materials in order to tighten the currency and prevent speculation. Yesterday, the Textile Building Company tendered for 12 types, including Wufu fine cloth and drill blanks. The Flower Control Committee also made special allocations of Shuangyu and Football fine cloth again. Industry insiders suffered from tight credit and were forced to sell. Market sentiment was therefore fearful, and there was a strong selling atmosphere in the market.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell by 4 million yuan as soon as the market opened. Due to oversupply, it finally closed at 44 million yuan, a sharp decline of 9 million yuan compared to the previous day. There were transactions at 1 million yuan lower after the close, and the after-hours price fell by 6 million yuan. Other drill fine twill and coarse cloth also declined sharply.

### Food Rice Market Downstream; Flour, Grains, and Cooking Oil See Decline

Yesterday's rice market was downstream due to the impact of tightening credit. In addition, with the decline in various commodities outside the industry, market sentiment was naturally weak, and buying interest was weak. The morning market fell by 1 million, and the afternoon market fell by another 1 million, for a total decrease of 2 million yuan. White short-grain rice went from 37 million to 36 million, and special high-grade short-grain rice was quoted at 39 million. Baiyuan also opened at 36 million. Coarse short-grain rice for factory use was traded at 34 million. Yesterday's arrivals totaled 4,464 shi in the north and south markets.

The old car opened at 11.7 million and gradually declined to 10.5 million at the close. Bingchuan closed at 10 million. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and all fell below the 10 million mark, each falling sharply by 3 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Broad beans and green beans fell by 3 million together. Sesame fell by 3 million. Raw peanut kernels had many plate auctions the previous day and fell sharply by 8 million.

Dayou soybean oil initially opened at 75 million and closed at 73 million. Minsheng vegetable oil was at 66 million, each declining by 7 to 8 million to 10 million yuan. Jittong raw oil retreated by 5 million and was traded at 100 million yuan. Only Xiaoche Sesame oil stood firm at the original price due to Tianjin merchants' procurement.

[Our Report] The special price rice allocation for employees of private primary and secondary schools in this city is limited to private schools that have been formally registered, according to Article 37 of the "Shanghai Municipal Rice Allocation Implementation Rules". However, when private primary schools were first allocated rice, the Civil Food Allocation Office and the Education Bureau, in order to show consideration for the low salaries and difficult lives of private school teachers, relaxed the standards and allowed all schools that had been "approved to open" to be allocated rice. This principle was followed in May and June. Now, the Education Bureau has again submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval, and the rice allocation for July will still be handled according to the methods and number of people in May and June.

### Dunhuang Painters are Busy Copying: The Thousand Buddha Caves Exhibition Hall Will Be Completed Soon; Chang Shuhong Returns to Beijing to Discuss Public Exhibition

[Our Yumen Reporter Song Lin, 19th] Today, the Thousand Buddha Caves, after several years of renovation by the National Dunhuang Research Institute, is no longer as desolate as it used to be. New caves have been discovered one after another, reaching 470 caves. In front of the caves, green willows are sprouting, and clear streams are gurgling. The "Lingyin Road" has a "Exhibition Hall" built this spring, which will be completed soon. The hall plaque is inlaid with elegant Tang brick relief patterns. The interior is Western-style, spacious and bright. Each cave is marked with a heavy number indicating the cave entrance (P, C, old numbers are listed side by side). For days, sweeping the quicksand, more than ten men and women from the research institute have been lurking in the black caves, copying murals. From the ancient grottoes, English and French songs fly out from time to time. The reporter and Duan Tiren, an assistant researcher at the institute, chatted about the art of the Mogao Grottoes. According to Yuan, "The institute has copied more than 3,000 murals from various dynasties. Director Chang Shuhong flew to Beijing the week before to discuss with the Ministry of Education the public exhibition at home and abroad, and plans to collect famous Chinese paintings from ancient and modern times to bring back for display, so as to make a comparative study with Dunhuang art. Chang's daughter, Sana, flew to Beijing with her father and is about to go to the United States to study painting. The institute has compiled the "Mogao Grottoes Atlas" and intends to print it in the United States due to difficulties in color printing. The institute now donates 50 copies of rubbings of Mogao Grottoes inscriptions every month to Dunhuang County Middle School, worth 25 million yuan, all as educational funds.

### Four Private Medical and Pharmaceutical Vocational Schools: Tongde Medical College

Overview

The college was founded in the seventh year of the Republic of China and renamed to its current name in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the school buildings were built on Xiangyin Road (now called Weidemei Road). During the war, part of the school buildings were destroyed, so classes were held in the affiliated hospital on North Zhongzheng 1st Road. Currently, it is trying to recover the original school buildings in Jiangwan for future resumption.

The college's trustees are Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Wu Zhihui, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The principal is Gu Yuqi, and there are a total of 67 faculty and staff members and 506 students. In terms of equipment, it has been relatively enriched by the receipt of post-war relief materials and the self-funded additions in recent years.

Enrollment

The college's first enrollment date is July 24th, and registration starts immediately and ends on the 22nd. The number of students to be enrolled is 50 freshmen in the first grade and transfer students in the second grade.

### Shanghai Dental Vocational School

Overview

The school is located at No. 40 Fuxing West Road (ie Bai Xiangzhong Road) and was opened by dentist Situ Bo after being approved by the Ministry of Education in July of the 35th year. There are currently 37 students in the first grade and 18 students in the second grade. The current school address is originally Principal Situ's private residence. Because the houses are not enough for use, it is planned to build a new school building on the base of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College in Jiangwan. In addition, the honorary trustees of the school are Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, and other nine people, the chairman of the board is Pan Gongzhan, and the trustees are Wu Yun, Chu, Diao Xinde, Li Handuo, and other nine people.

Enrollment

The school's study period is four years (including one year of clinical practice). This year, 50 freshmen will be enrolled in the first grade, and 10 backup students will be enrolled. Both men and women are accepted. Those with a high school diploma are eligible to apply. Registration dates are July 15th to 24th for the first time, and August 6th to 15th for the second time. The exam dates will be notified at the time of registration.

### Sino-French Pharmaceutical Vocational School

In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, and Song Wusheng, in order to promote pharmaceutical education and provide talents for China's pharmaceutical industry, obtained the sponsorship of the pharmaceutical industry and the new pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai, and then established a school of pharmacy affiliated to Sino-French University. The French ambassador to China designated No. 410 South Shaanxi Road as the school address. In that year, the application was approved and enrollment began. Later, due to the restrictions of the Ministry's regulations, the school of pharmacy was renamed "Sino-French University Pharmaceutical Vocational School", and the registration procedures were formally completed in the 21st year.

The school's teaching has always been known for its strictness. Up to now, there have been 14 graduates, but the total number is only 204, which shows the seriousness of its teaching. Among these 14 graduates, 74 are working in pharmaceutical factories, 40 are engaged in pharmaceutical administration, and the rest are distributed in major hospitals, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical education institutions, and none of them are unemployed. The school's study period is four years, and all courses are required courses. In addition to pharmaceutical law, materia medica, and English, there are also experiments, and experiments must be tested, so the actual curriculum is more burdensome than ordinary schools.

The school's annual expenses are paid monthly by Sino-French University, and instruments and specimens are donated by various factories. Before the war, the Ministry of Education subsidized the school with research funds, and the Guangxi Provincial Government also entrusted the school to train pharmacists at public expense. The government has also entrusted the school's professors to handle the compilation of the pharmacopoeia, the revision and review of pharmaceutical laws, the examination of pharmaceutical personnel, and the compilation of pharmaceutical curricula. The school has also published books such as Pharmaceutical Analysis Methods, Pharmaceutical Experiment Methods, and Toxicology Analysis Methods.

Enrollment

The school will enroll about 40 new students this year. Candidates must pay attention to English, biology, and chemistry. Because the school recently investigated that the students' grades in chemistry were the worst, and biology and English were not ideal, the standards of these subjects will be slightly raised in the entrance examination.

### Southeast Medical College

Overview

The school was founded in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The original school address was in Zhenru. It was damaged during the Anti-Japanese War and moved to Sapo Sai Road. After the victory, it purchased the house at No. 585 Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road as a school building. The current president of the school is Zhang Xiqi, director of Guanghua Eye Hospital. The school is a six-year system, and there are currently more than 400 students in grades one to six.

### London Sees Sunlight Again: World Games Athletes Excited

[Reuters, London, 20th] London saw sunlight today, and the weather was mild. World athletes from various countries, especially those from the Far East, were extremely excited. This was the first time they had seen sunlight since arriving in the UK. The athletes had no complaints, and the only regret was that they "couldn't see the sunlight". Some athletes could not train their muscles due to the lack of sunlight. Although they made full use of massage methods, they still could not avoid muscle tension. Some Indian athletes caught colds due to the cold weather. Although British athletes are used to this climate, if there is sunlight and the weather warms up, their performance is expected to be even better. According to experts, American athletes may not be able to perform as well in the British climate as they do in their own country. The opening ceremony of the World Games athletes' dormitory in Saint Holst and Besley was hosted by Land Minister Xinville today. This dormitory can accommodate 300-400 athletes from 25 countries.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th, Combined Press] The World Games delegation reception centers in Saint Holst and Besley opened today. At the opening, Land Minister Xinville said: "The reception centers we have set up this time for the World Games are not perfect, but we have done our best."

Football Schedule: To Be Rearranged

[Reuters, London, 20th] After the withdrawal of Myanmar, Hungary, Poland, Jewish Palestine, and Pakistan, the issue of rearranging the schedule for the World Games football matches, according to news from the British Football Association, will not be decided until Tuesday. Because the telegrams sent to the member countries of the International Football Association to solicit opinions are still awaiting their replies.

[British News Service, London, 19th] The 1948 World Games football matches are scheduled to be held in the first half of August at Wembley Imperial Stadium and the grounds of several football clubs near London. The prizes will be divided into three types: the championship team will receive a certificate, and the championship team members will receive a medal and a certificate.

### The Authority on 1500 Meters: World Record Holder, Sweden's Gunder Hägg's Success Story, One of the Highest Ranked Champions in the World Games

[London Correspondence from the British News Agency] Even if Sweden's lightning-fast miler Gunder Hägg never achieves the impossible feat of "running with the hare and hunting with the hounds," he has certainly progressed from being the "hare" to becoming the pursuer. His performance while pacing with Arne Andersson showcased his potential to Sweden and the world for the first time.

He joined the athletic club in Malmö at the age of twenty, already renowned for his dexterity.

Hägg originally worked as a typesetter at a newspaper in Malmö. He was also a skilled pianist and had given a modern music concert in the Swedish capital a year prior. The newspaper later transferred him to the sports department, where he now has his own sports column.

Hägg initially focused on the half-mile, but experts soon recognized that this slender pianist was better suited for the 1500 meters. Hägg had moved to Malmö and joined the athletic club at that time. As he and Hägg practiced together in the woods outside the city, those in the know began to say that this newcomer could one day become a great racer.

Hägg trained his "hare." Another famous Swedish one-mile runner, Arne Andersson, also played a part. These two men paced with Hägg several times, resulting in world records, missing the "dream mile" (four minutes) by only one second. Hägg's best time in 1944 was three minutes and fifty-five seconds for 1500 meters.

Within a season, he had leaped into the ranks of world-class athletes. In his first race of the following year, he ran the 1500 meters in three minutes and forty-seven seconds, breaking Jack Lovelock's world record but finishing second to Andersson.

While Hägg and Hägg continued to train together, preparing to break the four-minute mile record, the former "hare" suddenly found himself alone and without companions. Hägg and Andersson were both temporarily banned from competition and soon declared non-amateurs.

Hägg had gone to the United States to compete a few years earlier, and now Hägg also went, becoming the American champion. After returning to Europe, he won the European Championship in Oslo in 1946.

On July 18 of last year, he ran the 1500 meters in three minutes and forty-three seconds, precisely tying Hägg's world record. Neither he nor the second-place finisher, Lennart Strand, knew how they had run so fast. Hägg himself commented after the race: "We should be able to run a mile in under four minutes easily." After winning the Swedish Championship, Hägg was planning to take a short break but accepted an invitation to compete in Paris. Unexpectedly, he suffered his first defeat in two years, with Marcel Hansenne winning and Hägg finishing fifth.

Between Hägg and a gold medal at the World Games, there is only one obstacle: his nervousness. Before any race, even if his opponents are second-rate athletes, he is extremely anxious, like an actor making his debut. Once, he went to the starting line without wearing his vest. His friends worry that he might one day go to the starting line completely naked. (Note: Hägg holds the world record for the 1500 meters at three minutes and forty-three seconds and is one of the highest ranked champions in this year's World Games.)

### Brakes are Essential

— Pingzhai

In Shanghai, whenever people see rickshaw pullers fall, causing passengers to fall out, it is customary for everyone to gather around and laugh, never offering a helping hand. Sometimes, they even call it "fishing." If the passenger who falls is a young woman, the onlookers are especially delighted and will shout out vulgar remarks to show their wit.

If it is not a rickshaw but a pedicab that falls, there is also a kind of "witty" remark, called "dumping garbage." Thinking carefully about it, one has to admire the people who come up with these phrases—admiring them for always maintaining the world's most boring and cowardly record with such ease!

In all fairness, the roads in Shanghai are generally smooth. Although pedicabs often bump into the back of the vehicle in front of them when traffic is extremely congested, causing the person sitting in the front vehicle to feel as if they have been punched in the middle of their back, the flipping over of the vehicle, which is called "dumping garbage," is actually not very common. However, "not very common" does not mean "impossible." If you often take a pedicab from Hongkou across the bridge to the central district, you will feel the existence of this "possibility."

When taking a pedicab across the bridge, the puller jumps down as soon as he reaches the bridgehead, leaning his body and pulling the pedicab up the bridge. The way he takes each step slowly and steadily is just like the boat trackers commonly seen in the water towns of Jiangnan. If it has just rained, the bridgehead is covered in wet, shimmering water, making it even more difficult to walk. If he slips, the passenger will inevitably taste "garbage" amid the laughter of the crowd. After much hard work, the pedicab puller seems to breathe a sigh of relief when he finally reaches the middle of the bridge.

However, although the pedicab puller has "relieved his burden," the passenger absolutely cannot "feel at ease." Going down the bridge is actually more dangerous than going up. When going up the bridge, there are sometimes ragged children who give you a push, saving the puller a lot of effort. Moreover, because it is slow and steady, any danger can be stopped in time, so it is not easy to have any major problems. Going down the bridge is quite different: the puller leaps onto the vehicle and rushes straight down the bridge with lightning speed. Although he constantly makes warning shouts, the thrilling scenes are truly endless. Rushing down too fast can easily result in a head-on collision with an oncoming car or pedicab. If the handcart or rubber-wheeled cart walking slowly in front does not yield, it is especially easy to cause a terrible disaster. If you go too slowly, the pedicab rushing down behind you will follow closely. If you are slow and he is fast, the result will still be a collision.

At this time, the key to turning danger into safety depends half on the skill of the pedicab puller and half on whether the pedicab's "brakes" are effective. If the "brakes" are effective, the horse on the precipice can be reined in, and the safety of the passenger can be ensured; otherwise—there is no need to say any more.

Having said this, it is time to get to the main point. Riding a pedicab is just a metaphor.

Large banknotes have been issued. Large banknotes are needed. A few days ago, my wife wanted to prepare some winter clothes for the children, and as a result, she went to the street with a large bag of banknotes. It was both troublesome and unsightly. After buying the goods, she had to wait for the shop assistant to count the banknotes, watching him count stack after stack with impatience. For the sake of morality, she still insisted that he finish counting before leaving. The volume of a wool sweater is only one-tenth of the volume of the banknotes used to buy it. Although she felt relaxed when she came back, she could not help but feel a sense of nostalgia, thinking of the days when rice was sold for only ten yuan per dan (unit of dry measure). With this sense of nostalgia, I naturally thought of whether "future generations will look at the present as we look at the past." The government officials ride in new cars, so they certainly do not know why pedicabs "dump garbage," but the "brakes" of cars are also very important. If the "brakes" are not effective, perhaps the officials with full bellies of knowledge will be frightened. If things go wrong, our troubled country may lose an important official who was finally "approved," which would be troublesome, wouldn't it? Therefore, I say: Brakes are essential—

One banknote is five million yuan, with six zeros after the "five"! If you don't brake, watch out for "garbage"!

### Sunglasses

— Liu

The United States recently held a "Pan-American Ophthalmology Conference." Dr. Matthew from Texas presented a paper on sunglasses. He said that constantly wearing dark sunglasses can lead to a habit of needing to wear them. Whenever the light is too bright, you will feel uncomfortable without sunglasses. However, if you choose sunglasses with lighter colors, there is no harm. He specifically stated that anyone who thinks that wearing sunglasses allows them to look directly at the sun is sure to suffer. Even the best sunglasses will cause eye damage if you wear them and look at the sun, and sometimes this damage is very serious. Scientists must use specially made glasses to observe the sun and must never use sunglasses as a substitute.

### Concert in Memory of Nie Er's Death Anniversary

— Zhiwei

July 17th is the death anniversary of the late musician Nie Er. In today's music scene, which is gradually fading, even in Shanghai, where talent is relatively concentrated, there is no news of any memorial concert. Only the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association held a large-scale music and dance performance on the afternoon of the 16th, which can be considered an embellishment for the death anniversary of a generation of musicians.

That day, the weather was quite hot. The more than four hundred seats in the Youth Association's auditorium were already full before seven o'clock, but friends who loved music and dance continued to pour in. Many audience members had to stand, totaling no less than one thousand two hundred people.

The first performance was a choir performance by the association's first student choir, featuring songs such as the Suiyuan folk song "Horse Racing on the City Wall" arranged by Tian Er. The singing was melodious, giving people a sense of being in a remote and desolate border area, without losing the essence of folk songs. The second performance was Wang Fukang's baritone solo, "Homesickness Song," "Putting a Flower in Front of the Window," etc. Other performances, such as the soprano solos by Wang Zhixiang and Yang Anzhen's daughter, were also wonderful. All three dance performances were costumed, wearing frontier folk costumes. "Mountain Wasteland" was the most lively, with colorful costumes and exotic dances, winning the audience's praise. After the dance, the applause was endless, and they wanted to continue. The final performance was a one-hundred-person chorus, with a grand scene, and because the stage was not big enough to accommodate everyone, they were lined up to the bottom of the stage. They sang Nie Er's posthumous works, "The Big Road Song," "March of the Volunteers," and "Work Hard," which was popular in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War, and "Eight Years Since the Victory of the Anti-Japanese War." The singing was loud and majestic, and the accompaniment with drums, gongs, and cymbals was even more unique, inspiring and uplifting.

The meeting ended at ten o'clock. I deeply felt that in today's Shanghai, where movie ticket prices have soared to 400,000 and decadent music pervades the entire city, public school teachers with clean sleeves and pure young people who are unwilling to drift along with the tide really lack proper entertainment to regulate their spirits. Music and dance performances like this are really worth promoting.

### The Painter's Eccentricities

— Shuichan

Generally speaking, all kinds of "masters" have some eccentricities, especially calligraphers and painters. For example, Mr. You Han of Lingui—Wei Qi—has eccentricities. You Han has been selling paintings in Shanghai for many years, and everyone who has met him finds him amiable and approachable, which is definitely true. But when he is painting, it is not the same. He has painted so many paintings, and according to him, no two layouts are the same. Indeed, I have never seen two of his paintings that are the same. This certainly shows that he has boundless ideas in his mind, but he never picks up his brush unless he is inspired. Therefore, you see him chatting, smoking, and relaxing all day long, as if he has nothing to do. When inspiration suddenly comes, he puts everything down, sits upright, and wields his brush like lightning. Any friends who are "sensible" should quietly withdraw and not disturb his poetic mood, otherwise, there is a risk of being "scolded to your face." Fortunately, he always paints when it is late at night and quiet, so he will not offend "honored guests." A few old friends who know his temper well have already run away. In any case, he always paints seriously, with the idea of enduring for a thousand years.

His fees are not too expensive, but when he is happy, he will paint several pieces at once, and when he is not happy, he will not lightly put down a single stroke. He is most afraid of getting a haircut. He says that he will get sick for three days after getting a haircut, and nothing will go well. If you ask him to write calligraphy right after he gets a haircut, then you are "out of luck." Fortunately, he only gets a haircut three or four times a year, and strangely enough, his hair does not grow too long. If you want him to paint, it is best to look at the length of his hair. The longer it is, the more energetic he is, and the better he paints. One more thing, if you want him to paint quickly and well, you must have his wife urge him. Speaking of his wife, she is the famous doctor, Qian Taixi's daughter, Bo Xue and versatile. He often recites a line from Liu Yongtian's poem, called "Besides, there are crazy friends and strange companions." The word "besides" is used as a verb, referring to his surname, "strange companions" refers to his wife, and "crazy friends" is also a great calligrapher, Chen Mengjie—Yun Zhang. Originally, You Han's father was Mr. Kuang Zhoufeng—one of the four great lyricists of the late Qing Dynasty—he must have heard this line from Liu's poem since he was a child, so he quoted it appropriately. Probably without these two "crazy friends and strange companions," he would not be able to get his painting mood up. Once, I wanted to ask him to paint a fan surface, and I wanted it to be quick and good, so I changed my strategy, first visited his "crazy friend," wrote a passage of small regular script, and sent it over when he was not at home. His "strange companion" accepted it. Sure enough, in the evening, he personally brought the painted fan surface, needless to say, it was quick and good. The "crazy friend" gave him an eight-character evaluation: "It is able to create new ideas without deviating from the correct principles."

Mark Twain's Humor -- Mou Dunpei

Once, the master of humor, Mark Twain, found that there were two other people in his room on the train, one was a vice-pastor, and the other was a goods salesman. At this time, Mark Twain felt extremely tired and wanted to take a nap, but the salesman repeatedly talked loudly to the patient pastor, leisurely and contentedly, without any fatigue.

Mark Twain was so anxious that he had no choice but to walk over and say to them: "Let me ask you a question. Do you know what is the difference between a stupid person and a vice-pastor?"

"I don't know," the vice-pastor blurted out.

"I know," the salesman said triumphantly: "A pastor wears his cross on his chest, while a stupid person wears his cross on his back."

Mark Twain suddenly stood up and stared at him very sternly and said: "Do you know what is the difference between a donkey and a traveling salesman?"

"I don't know," the salesman replied.

"I don't know either!" After Mark Twain solemnly finished speaking, he quickly went back to sleep.

At this time, the vice-pastor and the salesman were puzzled by each other's questions, and they never talked loudly again. Mark Twain fell asleep peacefully.

### Poor Service

— Jinjin

A man went to a thriving restaurant in Chicago for breakfast. After the waitress handed him coffee and toast, she did not bring him the orange juice he ordered until ten minutes later. The man expressed considerable dissatisfaction.

The waitress asked: "Are you married?" The man said: "Yes—what's it to you?" The waitress said: "Well, why don't you eat breakfast at home?"

Once, the movie actor Victor McLaglen, on his way from his residence to Hollywood, stopped at a chicken shop set up by the roadside to eat. He waited for three-quarters of an hour before the waiter slowly placed the half spring chicken he ordered in front of him. McLaglen questioned him as to why it had taken so long. He replied: "We have to wait for another customer to order the same half spring chicken before we can kill the chicken and then prepare it together."

A customer was eating scallion pancakes in a snack shop in Santa Monica, California. He only took two bites before the waitress took his plate away and wiped the counter with a cloth. This person said: "Hey, I only ate two bites!"

The woman didn't even bat an eye, took out another whole scallion pancake, took two bites, and put the leftovers in the customer's plate.

Because of the general lack of awareness of the "election of queens" (such as school queens, city queens, national university queens, etc.), I briefly discussed the different interpretations of "queen" and Queen, and the errors of childish imitation of European customs. Now I associate it with the so-called "senior male actor king" and "female role king" in the acting world. This probably originated from the "Tan fans" praising Tan Xinpei (that is, Di Chu Lao Gengzi, who said "Who cares about the country's rise and fall, the whole city is fighting to say the calling of heaven," and also said "Little Calling Heaven"). During the late Qing Dynasty, he was called "Tan Baylor" because the Qing Dynasty had not yet fallen at that time, and the Manchu noble titles were talked about by the general corrupt people. "Baylor" is a Qing word, also a kind of royal title. When Tan Xinpei went to Shanghai during the Republic of China, the Manchu style had lost its luck and was out of date, and the foreign style names replaced it. The signs of "Kerosene King", "Car King", "Circus King", and "Rubber King" were all over the place, so "Baylor" was replaced by the new "King", from the banner flavor to the foreign flavor. Although this "King" is a Chinese word, it is not its old meaning, but it actually admires the King of foreign goods, just like the queen of school queens and city queens, it admires the Western Queen, and has nothing to do with the queen in the old palace.

Although "King" has this title in the past, it was most prosperous during the Zhou Dynasty and the Warring States period. At that time, there was no emperor, and even the Emperor of Zhou was just a king. "The world returns to the king," Mencius said, "King the world" (the word king is a verb, not a noun), being able to be "king" means being the supreme and the common master of the world. As the Zhou Dynasty declined, the countries that were enfeoffed invaded each other and called themselves heroes and added the title of king. This trend reached its climax with the Seven Heroes of the Warring States. When Qin annexed the six kingdoms and unified the world, he called himself "First Emperor", and the Han Dynasty followed suit. Since then, the emperor was the emperor, and "king" was a high-level title, or said to be sealed soil, or to enjoy salary in the court. As for the Manchu Qing princes and so on, they were all sealed titles but not feudalized. Officials and civilians called them "Lord King", but there was no saying of "Great King". Only in novels such as Journey to the West, the mountain elves and water monsters are called "Great King", and in Yue Fei, Niu Gao is a bandit and is called "Fair King". Other big thieves are called "Mountain King", then "Great King" is a monster, a bandit.

As European customs spread eastward, anyone who dominates in commerce and industry, or monopolizes an advantage with a unique skill, is said to be King, translated as "So-and-so King", and the name of "King" is revived, but it is different from the past. Tan Xinpei's "King" is "Ocean-style", it is "fashion", not "Beijing-style", you must know.
