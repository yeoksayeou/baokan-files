### National Assembly to Elect Vice President Today; Assembly Scheduled to Close Tomorrow Afternoon

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold the vice presidential election at its plenary session on the morning of the 23rd. During the presidium meeting on the evening of the 22nd, Dai Chuanxian was designated to chair the morning session on the 23rd. The form of the vice presidential election ballot was also approved. The ballots are made of domestic paper, printed in regular script with red ink, and exquisitely designed. One side reads "Republic of China, April 23, Year 37, Vice Presidential Election Ballot, First Session of the First National Assembly." The other side lists the names of the vice presidential candidates: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin. During the presidium meeting, Yu Xuezhong, Yu Bin, and Su Ting were designated to oversee the stamping and sealing of the ballots, with each ballot bearing the individual seals of Yu, Su, and Yu before being sealed. The sealed ballots will be publicly opened on the morning of the 23rd, and the votes will be counted immediately after the election. If no candidate receives more than half of the votes, the top three candidates will be selected first, and a second election will be held at 4:00 PM. Zhang Xiwen has been designated as the chairman for the afternoon session. If there is still no result, a third election will be held on the morning of the 24th. However, the assembly is still scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 24th. The election proceedings on the morning of the 23rd will be broadcast live by the Central Broadcasting Station starting at 10:30 AM. Seventy-five foreign guests will also be present to observe the proceedings. The method of counting votes for the vice presidential election was also discussed at the presidium meeting on the evening of the 22nd, and it was decided to change to a roll-call voting system, with the number of votes for each candidate displayed on the counting machine for each vote.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The first session of the First National Assembly, which has been in session for 25 days, is entering its final stage according to the schedule. However, it seems that both domestic and foreign observers have not lessened their close attention as the closing date of the assembly approaches, because the assembly still has the important task of electing a vice president, which will be held on the 23rd. According to the Constitution of the Republic of China, the position of Vice President is generally considered by most people to be

a position with authority but no real power. However, enlightened individuals are well aware that this seemingly powerless Vice President, in addition to fulfilling the responsibility of assisting the President during the six-year term, must also be ready to assume the President's powers under certain circumstances stipulated by the Constitution. Therefore, the importance of this responsibility is consistent with the high status of the position. According to Article 3 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the President and Vice President must be elected with a majority of the total number of representatives. Therefore, if no candidate receives more than half of the total number of representatives (the total number of National Assembly representatives in this session is 3,045, and more than half would be at least 1,523 votes) when the election results are announced at noon on the 23rd, then according to the provisions of paragraph 2 of the same article of the aforementioned Election and Recall Law, "the top three candidates with the most votes shall be re-voted to elect one." This is the second ballot. If no one still receives a majority of the votes, a "third ballot shall be held to elect one." If no one is elected, the two candidates with the most votes in the third ballot shall be re-voted, and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected. If the votes are tied, a new election shall be held, and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected.

### Assembly Continues to Pass Proposals; Calls on Compatriots at Home and Abroad to Rise Up and Suppress the Rebellion; Asks the Government to Effectively Protect Navigation Rights on Inland Rivers and Coastal Waters

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly continued to discuss proposals on the 22nd. The fifteenth plenary session was held at 9:30 AM, chaired by Li Zonghuang, representing the first group of the presidium. 1,670 representatives were present. After the secretariat reported the minutes of the fourteenth plenary session, the discussion of proposals began. The seventh review committee reported on 44 proposals related to the border areas, the first review committee reported on 145 proposals related to the constitution, and the second review committee reported on 124 proposals related to national defense. All were successfully passed in the morning according to the review opinions. During the process of passing 313 proposals rapidly in the morning, only the reports from the reporters and the chairman's announcement of "no objection" were heard. The assembly was calm and uneventful, and few representatives spoke. However, the issue of discussing permanent institutions in advance caused another wave in the meeting. A temporary motion was submitted for voting, but after two rounds of affirmative and negative votes, the proposal to change the agenda was rejected, and the meeting returned to calm after a quarter of an hour. After a ten-minute break, the discussion continued. Representative Ling Tie'an, who is blind, proposed that the President and Vice President should be inaugurated in the National Assembly Hall and take an oath to all National Assembly representatives. Since this exceeded the scope of the proposals being discussed, the chairman did not put it up for discussion and continued to announce the results of the review of the proposals, which were all passed without objection. Among the proposals were "a proposal to send a telegram to the whole country in the name of the National Assembly, calling on the people of the whole country to rise up and suppress the rebellion" and "a proposal to send a telegram in the name of this assembly to the whole country and overseas compatriots, unanimously supporting the national policy of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, and ordering the elected government to supervise and urge all military and civilian officials to rectify discipline, boost morale, and suppress the bandit rebellion within a time limit, recover lost territory, consolidate the foundation of the country, and comfort the people's expectations." Both were passed, and the telegrams were handed over to the secretariat to be drafted and then submitted to the assembly for approval. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly continued its session at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd, chaired by Hu Jing'an. Only 1,350 representatives were present, which was less than the legal quorum. A discussion session was held first, and when the number of attendees reached 1,540 at 4:25 PM, the plenary session was resumed. The review reports on foreign affairs and economic proposals from the third and fourth review committees were read and passed item by item. Only the proposal submitted by Wu Tiansheng and others to compensate overseas Chinese for the national savings bonds purchased overseas with the original currency was changed from "submitted to the government for reference" to "submitted to the government for effective implementation." The rest were passed without objection. A total of 276 proposals were passed by 5:30 PM. Then, the review report of the first review committee on permanent institutions was discussed, but no result was reached, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The proposal submitted by Zhu Keqin and others that the government shall not open up inland river navigation rights for any reason in order to safeguard navigation rights and consolidate the foundation of the country was discussed and passed in the National Assembly on the 22nd. It was resolved to submit it to the government for effective attention. The method in the proposal specifically emphasized that the government should effectively safeguard navigation rights and shall not open up inland river and coastal navigation rights without authorization for any reason in order to safeguard navigation rights. Any country's request to open up and coastal navigation rights should be rejected. If any country encroaches on our inland river and coastal navigation rights, strong negotiations should be conducted based on international law. The ships of any country shall not enter our territorial waters without authorization, otherwise, they shall be regarded as enemy ships by the naval department and coastal fortresses and forcibly restrained.

### Permanent Institutions Unresolved; Dozens of National Representatives Cause Disturbance; Meeting Chairman Hu Jing'an Nearly Attacked

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly has been discussing proposals, and over 800 cases have been passed like a raging river in the past two days. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the excitement of a small group of representatives on the podium nearly led to a fight. On the 22nd, the proposal on permanent institutions was discussed without a conclusion, and the time had expired. Chairman Hu Jing'an hastily announced the adjournment of the meeting. Dozens of representatives demanded "no objection to pass," but were not adopted. They raised their arms and shouted, swarming onto the podium to ask questions. The disturbance began. However, at this time, Chairman Hu had already left his seat and went to the back of the stage, intending to enter the presidium lounge to rest. He was dragged out of the small door in the left corner of the stage by three representatives. The representatives then gathered to criticize him, with some saying that the chairman was illegal and should not adjourn the meeting, some pointing their fingers at Hu's nose and angrily shouting, "You are not worthy of being the chairman," some scolding him in a friendly tone, and some banging on the table and shouting "Beat you." Hu originally intended to argue, but seeing that the situation was not good, he broke free and escaped to the small door in the right corner behind the stage. Led by Zhang Tingxun, a representative from Yun'nan Shun'ning who had previously served as the magistrate of Dali County, and Li Hongru, a union representative who had to work hard to attend after being a signatory representative for concession, dozens of representatives roared and chased after him, turning the entire stage into a mess. When some news reporters asked Zhang for his name, Zhang refused to answer and secretly hid his badge with his name and number in his pocket, and continued to pursue Hu. The reporters insisted on seeing his badge, and in the struggle, they tore off his badge, and only then did they know that it was Zhang Tingxun. At this time, Hu had disappeared in the meantime. Zhang then shifted his target, glared at the reporters, and nearly resorted to violence, arousing public outrage from the reporters present, who unanimously condemned him for being a disgrace to the assembly and immediately announced his name and number in public. Zhang knew he was in the wrong, and after asking for his badge back, he left the stage in embarrassment. The dispute gradually subsided, and the representatives under the stage gathered to discuss in small groups, with varying opinions. Some said that Zhang Tingxun had disgraced the assembly, some said that Hu Jing'an should be punished, and some said that the assembly staff had beaten the representatives. However, in the end, because there was no one to vent their anger on and they felt that the reporters were in the way, they had no choice. Liu Yiting then changed his mind and said, "If the issue of permanent institutions is not resolved tomorrow, I will never let him be elected." By 6:30 PM, the crowd began to disperse, and the turmoil came to an end.

### State Council Revises and Approves Supplementary Proposal for National Assembly Elections

300 Additional Representatives for Occupational and Women's Groups

Second, the General Election Office will notify the election offices in each province and the superior election offices to reissue election certificates to the National Assembly representatives who were elected after the concession to the friendly parties. However, since the elected persons have already submitted a letter of concession, they shall not attend the National Assembly with the qualification of representatives.

Third, those who are unable to attend due to legal interpretations may also be sent by the National Government to attend this National Assembly meeting if they wish to attend.

### Loan Doubts for Tea Processing and Marketing; Four Allied Banks to Provide Loans in Three Phases; Export Locations and Cased Tea Also Used as Collateral

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 363rd meeting of the board of directors of the Four Allied Banks was held at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd, with Zhang Jia'ao acting as chairman. The meeting discussed the loan methods for tea processing and marketing this year. The banks believe that the previous tea loans have been effective in promoting exports and earning foreign exchange. In addition to the 80 billion yuan for tea production loans that have already been approved in the agricultural loan program, the banks have decided to continue providing loans for tea processing and marketing and export location cased tea loans, referring to past methods, in order to encourage tea merchants to raise their own funds to purchase raw tea, promote tea exports, and protect the outlet for tea produced by tea farmers. The main points of the loan terms are as follows: (1) The total loan amount is 4.9 billion yuan, divided into three phases of loans. The standards for each phase of loans are as follows: A. Raw tea processing loan: a maximum of 3 million yuan per dan (unit of weight). B. Cased tea marketing loan: a maximum of 4 million yuan per dan, deducting the processing loan. C. Export cased tea loan: 5 million to 8 million yuan per dan, deducting the marketing loan. (2) Target: Tea merchants who have a good track record in handling tea loans and foreign exchange settlement in the past should be selected as loan targets. When each factory applies for loans in each stage, the raw tea purchased with its own funds shall not be less than 100 dan, and the cooperative shall not be less than 50 dan. (3) Term: The processing loan is one month, the marketing loan depends on the distance of the route, and the maximum shall not exceed 30 days. The export cased tea loan is also one month. (4) Interest rate: A uniform monthly interest rate of 13%, and overdue payments will be calculated at the market interest rate. (5) Method of handling collateral: If the collateral for each phase of the loan does not meet the standards or the loan is not redeemed by the due date, the lending bank shall handle it by means of public auction and use the proceeds from the auction to repay the loan principal and interest. (6) The rediscount shall be made by the lending bank to the national bank at 90% of the amount. (7) Domestic and border sales tea shall be handled in principle by handling export bills. Another report: This year's large-scale farmland water conservancy project loans in various provinces have been approved for 750 billion yuan in the agricultural loan program. In order to speed up the construction during the current dry season, the board of directors decided today to select 25 new and old projects in ten provinces, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, which have good economic value, sound engineering design, can be completed in a short period of time, have stable local order, and have sound construction institutions, and which are urgently needed to increase grain production, as well as annual maintenance projects in the three provinces of Ningxia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, for early loan processing in the first half of the year.

### National Assembly Proceedings: The Crowning Act

[Special Report from This Newspaper] According to the established agenda, the crowning act of the First National Assembly's first session was the vice-presidential election on the 23rd. Before the opening of the assembly, Li Zongren was the first to announce his open candidacy for vice-president in Beiping. Cheng Qian, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, and Mo Dehui followed suit. Then, the Democratic Socialist Party put forward Xu Fulin, so the candidate announcement board listed six names side by side. The campaigning activities, with the start of the meeting, gathered in the capital from all over. Furthermore, they entered the venue ahead of schedule from outside the venue. The use of methods varied. The propaganda offensive, the emotional appeal, and the rational persuasion were all contests and comparisons of strength. On the eve of this election, all means were used. Flyers were flying around the meeting hall, slogans were all over the streets, advertisements filled the newspapers, and various cloth banners competed for attention. The sound of the radio constantly grabbed people's attention. The several candidates, virtual and real, generally expressed a principle, which was "equal strength."

Xu Fulin: Following the reverse order of the candidate announcement, let's first talk about Xu Fulin, who has the fewest co-signers. His announcement of his candidacy was a decision of the Democratic Socialist Party, to advance as a retreat, to avoid the Democratic Socialist Party's 140 votes being torn to pieces by others pulling them in different directions, and ultimately offending people. Mr. Xu said that he had no policy speech, and the vice-president should take the president's policy as his policy; at the same time, he had not hosted any banquets. On the contrary, when he led the Democratic Socialist Party members to the reception banquet, he repeatedly hoped that others would be elected, and at the dinner on the 21st, he said to Cheng Qian in person that he would provide the greatest support when necessary.

Mo Dehui: Mo Dehui participated in the election as a social worthy. Colleagues from the Political Participation Council and fellow villagers from Northeast and North China were his basic votes. His campaign was as humble and peaceful as his usual way of doing things. He hosted banquets, but not aggressively; he had two oil portraits, but they were not too large, and the colors were not too glaring; he shook hands with people with a smile, but he did not make people feel anxious; the most interesting thing was that his campaign cigarettes were also mild and pleasant. Mr. Liu's campaign was completely Eastern, so mature and prudent, with its own hidden strengths.

Cheng Qian: The spokesperson of Cheng Qian's campaign committee once declared: "The final victory will surely belong to the least eloquent but most honest person." Cheng Songyun's sincerity and simplicity moved the general opinion of the assembly. He appealed with no faction and transcendence of impartiality. He Chengjun, Tang Shiyao, Zhao Hengti, Fan Yushui, and Yan Huatang were all active for him. In addition to giving photos to the representatives, he used his "Yangfu Garden Poetry Collection" to make friends through literature, to harmonize emotions and build relationships. It is said that he has great strength in Central China, and he can also win over most of the military representatives, but the only thing that is inconsistent with Song Lao's campaign attitude is Gong Debai's National Salvation Daily, which automatically helps the election, and aims at Sun Ke, who has a prominent reputation.

Li Zongren: Li Zongren was the first to declare an open election. This general led a think tank to carry out various activities outside the venue, and his wife, Guo Dejie, represented the full effort to canvass votes in the venue. In terms of application, Li Zongren is the most talented. His first speech in Beiping took into account all aspects. Many Mongolian representatives still cherish his promise of welfare for border compatriots. They said that he does not make promises lightly. He used the weight of all aspects to increase his reputation. The praise of the ambassadors of various countries to China, the praise of professors and scholars, and the public opinion reflected by the newspapers in Pingjing and Hong Kong and the Chinese Public Opinion Survey Association were all used to spread countless explicit and implicit flyers throughout the assembly. Southwest and North China have his basic strength, and Miao and Yi compatriots also have deep trust in his past achievements and practical spirit. The overwhelming propaganda is used to win more votes.

Yu Youren: Yu Youren appealed with "poverty." At the same time, his past history made him naturally deeply rooted and thick in the campaign, so he was cautiously considering at first, and then came out in a dignified manner. But under the influence of the crowd, the old man had to start socializing in addition to giving poems and calligraphy. In the socializing, he discovered that the good causes planted decades ago have now become a strong support. Most of the border compatriots in Xinjiang and Tibet support him, and Shaanxi, Shanghai, and vocational groups all have his basic votes. The old man flaunts his demeanor. The huge oil portrait at the entrance of the Great Hall is a masterpiece of Shanghai's well-known young painter Song Zhenggu in one day. The old man said: "When I looked at my portrait, it made me love myself more. My name and my beautiful beard are the only ones that meet the standard of vice president." He also said: "These people participating in the election are not only not my political enemies, but my 'competition friends.' If I want to compete, it is only for the complete realization of a constitution."

Sun Ke: Finally, let's look at Sun Ke, who signed and nominated first among the candidates. According to the key members of his campaign team: "In the campaign activities, emotion should occupy a very important component, but if there is already a natural and deep emotion, there is no need to campaign, otherwise it is a waste of effort. What Vice Chairman Sun is doing is to awaken reason. He wants to use his own political and academic conditions to win in this occasion where emotions should not be used at all." This is Sun Ke's route. This is clearly shown in all his publicity materials and speeches at the banquets he hosts for representatives in batches every noon. Compared with the other five representatives, no one denies that Sun Ke is a big force. In addition to the basic votes from Guangdong and overseas, from the beginning, his strategy has been to use his self-confidence to win the trust of representatives from various regions and units. On his red and green slogans, it says that he is "a pioneer of democracy, a symbol of progress, an authority on international issues, and a leader in constitution-making." Objectively speaking, no representative thinks that this kind of propaganda is an exaggeration. On the contrary, he has gains after each banquet. Naturally, this kind of prominent momentum will be envied by political enemies. The National Salvation Daily fired at him, and several offensives made him declare that he would give up being elected as a legislator, because the suspicion of trying to have both fish and bear's paw was also cited and violently criticized by political enemies. Some people say that Yu, Li, and Cheng have united; there are even rumors that Sun Ke will become the vice president of the Kuomintang. On the eve of the election vote, Sun Ke suffered repeated surprise attacks, but what he did was still to awaken reason and express his determination to run for election.

Who Wins: The situation of the six candidates is generally like this today, but everyone is still spending their minds and energy to use every minute to win victory. Sun Ke's wife, Chen Shuying, a representative, is obviously a lot thinner. She still has to attend meetings every day to listen to intelligence and refute rumors for Sun Ke. Li Zongren's wife, Guo Dejie, a representative, sprained her back the day before yesterday, and she is still deploying troops in the venue every day, giving instructions in person; she is really planning strategies, but she always says "we have no way"! Yu Shi Lao stays up late to rush to write calligraphy, Cheng Songyun publishes poetry collections in newspapers, Mo Liu Lao is still steadily playing steadily without making a sound, and Xu Fulin is still carefree and indifferent.

But as things stand now, although flyers of various colors are flying all over the meeting place, the reliable votes are still reliable, and the unreliable votes have to wait and see what happens in the moment of raising a hand and writing. The general view is that there will be no result in the first election. The question is which three candidates will enter the rematch? Who is standing on three legs? But in any case, the general trend of the world has been set, and only two or three people are starting to prepare for the second vote. In the United States, the vice president can be obtained easily, but we have to fight three or four times. (April 22 in Nanjing)

Congratulations from various countries to Chairman Chiang for being elected as the first president. The picture shows the wife showing the telegram to the chairman (taken by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan)

### Commentary: Science in China and the Soviet Union

— Hu Xiansu

——Thoughts on Returning from Attending the Central Research Institute Council Meeting

From March 25th to 27th, the 5th Congress of the 2nd Council of the National Central Research Institute was held in Nanjing. The most important task of this Congress was to elect academicians. First, at the 4th Congress in October last year, candidates for academicians were nominated. 150 people were nominated from more than 400 people submitted by various parties. They were all great Confucian scholars who have made significant contributions in mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities. After the nomination, the Academia Sinica officially announced it. Four months after the announcement, all the council members of this Congress formally elected a total of 81 people by secret ballot. After this rigorous and solemn nomination and election, the elected academicians are worthy of being the leaders of the academic community in our country today. Compared with other countries in the world, there is not much shame. Therefore, this election is an unprecedented event in the Chinese academic community.

The author is very excited to participate in this grand event, but looking at the national affairs today, I am sadly wanting to cry. Our country has no science. I remember that what I learned when I was studying as a child was still to study for the imperial examination. After the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Qing court abolished the imperial examination and established schools in 1905. Science from the West began to be taught in schools, but the schools were newly established, and the curriculum and equipment were very simple, and the teachers were especially lacking. I remember that when I went to study at the preparatory course of Peking University in the first year of Xuantong, the school hired foreign teachers at a high price to teach the courses taught in today's senior high schools. The students regarded them as gods. After a year, students were selected to study in the United States. In the first year of the Republic of China, the author also participated in this election. Since then, more and more students have gone to Europe and the United States to study. The students studying in the United States had the rise of the Science Society of China. Those who joined the association were very enthusiastic. After a few years, many students who returned to China taught at universities in the North and South Valleys, and Peking University and Southeast University were the most famous. Tsinghua School monopolized sending students to study in the United States. During this period, scientific research has gradually sprouted. The earliest established scientific research institutions were the Geological Survey led by Mr. Ding Wenjiang and Mr. Weng Wenhao. Mr. Bing Zhi and the author founded the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China in Nanjing. The professors of the science departments of various universities also competed to lead students to engage in research. In a few years, the foundation of scientific research in our country was established. In 1927, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the National Government established the Central Research Institute and established various research institutes. With this academic institution to lead the country, academic research has made continuous progress. In less than ten years, Chinese scientists have made great contributions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology, biology, physiology, medicine, and agronomy, which are enough to be comparable to the advanced scientific countries in Europe and the United States. Even our country's inherent philology, linguistics, middle school, and archeology have made epoch-making contributions after being influenced by Western scientific methods. Foreign scientists who were previously regarded as unattainable have become their own colleagues. In just 30 years, there are Chinese science and Chinese scientists in the world. The history of science can record that a certain important invention is the contribution of a certain Chinese scientist. China has been able to move from an old and backward country in the 18th century to the ranks of advanced countries in the 20th century. Thinking back to the difficulties of pioneering the road in the past, there are those who cannot help but cry with joy.

The Academia Sinica has been established for 20 years, and then there was the election of academicians. Under careful preparation, these famous scholars, less than a hundred in number, won the lifelong honor recognized by the whole country, which seems to be a manifestation of the government's emphasis on science. However, at this time when the flames of war are raging and wars are raging, it is still doubtful whether the government really knows how to value science. Especially at the opening ceremony of this conference, the government officials who delivered speeches did not understand the status of the elected academicians in the world academic community. The immature speech made people feel disdain. The lack of understanding of science by those in power and the usual disregard for the progress of domestic science are also clearly revealed here. Instead, let's look at the situation of science in the Soviet Union? The Soviet Academy of Sciences (approximately equivalent to the Academia Sinica in our country) was founded by Peter the Great in 1725, taking the Royal Society of England as its model. In 1925, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union seized power and renamed it the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Since then, the government has supported it with all its strength, which is far beyond the comparison of other countries. It has the functions of both the Royal Society of England and the Science and Industry Research Institute. The scope of research includes not only science but also language, literature, philosophy, history, economics, and law. There are 139 "academicians" and 198 corresponding academicians, all of whom are academic authorities. Their election is more difficult than that of members of the Royal Society of England. Another point that is different from the Royal Society of England is that once the academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is elected, in addition to his regular salary, he can also get another 3,000 rubles per month, and the corresponding academician can get another 1,500 rubles per month. In addition to this, they can also enjoy generous clothing and food rations, and can buy supplies in special stores that are not available in ordinary stores. They can also enjoy special discounts when shopping in ordinary stores. They have cars, comfortable houses in the city for each person, and villas surrounded by orchards in the countryside. There is a magnificent sanatorium of the Academy of Sciences near Moscow, so that its academicians and their families can rest for one month to six weeks during the summer vacation. There is another equally magnificent sanatorium on the Black Sea coast. The academician of the Academy of Sciences has the right to manage the various scientific research institutes and is a government academic advisor. The Academy of Sciences manages 57 research institutes, 16 research rooms, 15 museums, 31 committees, 73 libraries, 35 research stations, and 7 academic societies. In 1945, there were a total of 4,213 people engaged in scientific work in the Academy of Sciences, 600 graduate students, technicians, research room assistants, librarians, secretaries, and accountants were not included. The library of the Academy of Sciences has a collection of more than 10 million volumes. There is a bookstore of the Academy of Sciences and a printing house of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The budget of the Academy of Sciences from 1945 to 1946 was 200 million rubles.

On June 15, 1945, the Soviet Academy of Sciences celebrated its 220th anniversary. There was a rumor about this since April, and then preparations were gradually made. The scale of its planning was rare. On the day, there were more than 1,000 representatives, including 145 academicians, 201 corresponding academicians, and 122 foreign scientists. The rest were all Soviet scientists. The opening ceremony was extremely grand, and the government's hospitality was extremely generous. The speeches, academic conferences, travel, and visits lasted for two weeks. After the commemorative meeting, the national newspapers still narrated the Academy of Sciences for several months. The Soviet Union's emphasis on science can be seen from this. It is no exaggeration to say that the Soviet Union regards science as religion. This is why the Soviet Union's science is developed, its national strength is strong, and it has jumped to become one of the two largest powers in the world in just 20 years.

Our government must not know the importance of science. Chairman Chiang repeatedly shouted during the Anti-Japanese War, "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no country." Every year on National Day, there is a Science Movement Week, and lectures are given everywhere to promote the importance of science. But our country's emphasis on science stops here. As for the actual situation, science is regarded as a luxury that has nothing to do with the fate of the country and the nation. The Central Research Institute and the research institutes of various universities have extremely exhausted funds, so that the famous scientists in our country have the sigh of heroes being useless. The treatment of scientists is not even as good as that of a government business agency worker! As a result, young scientists in our country would rather study abroad than return to China. It is heartbreaking to use Chu talents in Jin. And the dignified Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan said in his speech at the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute that after the election of academicians this time, he hoped that China's scientific research could follow foreign masters and doctors. Is it not like looking for fish from a tree if such a country wants to talk about "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no country"? Alas!

### Bandit Raids Cross the Jing River in Shaanxi, Joint Defense Deployment Completed in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Xi'an on the 22nd] According to military news, the bandit chief Peng Dehuai is currently in Yangjiapo, northeast of Gouyi, commanding the battle in the Jing River basin. The main force crossing the river is the First Column Zhang Zongxun, the Second Column Wang Zhen, and a part of the Fourth Column Wang Shitai, totaling only several thousand people. Contact has occurred in Zhaogong Town, Tiandu Town, and other places northwest of Wugong. There is no major change in Qian County. Some observers believe that the bandits are only harassing in nature. The national army is gathering in large numbers and can repel the bandits in that area within two days. In addition, the bandits besieged Luochuan for more than a month and failed to succeed. The main force of their Third Column has collapsed and fled to the northeast, and the defending army is pursuing them.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chengdu on the 22nd] The situation on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei is recently more tense. Xunyang and Baihe in southern Shaanxi have fallen.

### Military Observers Point Out: Withdrawal from Yan'an Based on Strategy

[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd] Well-informed military observers here believe that the National Army's withdrawal from Yan'an is a prelude to a combined offensive with changes on all fronts in the near future. This move has obviously broken the original plan of the Communist Party, which originally intended to use the capture of Yan'an as an excuse for its propaganda. Now the government takes the initiative to abandon Yan'an based on strategic plans, which is different from the Communist Army's capture of the city. Observers also believe that the abandonment of Yan'an is related to the government's recent strategic plan to abandon isolated strongholds. Military personnel also pointed out the following points: (1) The abandonment of Yan'an indicates that the National Army's spring offensive is about to launch. (2) The government would not have abandoned it so quickly if it was not sure that it would recapture Yan'an. (3) The government's abandonment of Yan'an was obviously not an action taken under pressure. Observers also pointed out that the National Army's occupation of Yan'an a year and a month ago was important because the area was the political center of the Communist Party, not because the area was a strategic point. If necessary, the government will still hold isolated strongholds, which can be proved by the fact that Changchun and Shenyang are still in the hands of the National Army. Based on the above reasons, observers believe that the active abandonment of Yan'an is part of a predetermined strategic plan.

### Committee on the Disposal of Sino-American Relief Supplies to End in June-July; US Representatives Hope for Price Controls

[Our dispatch] According to Chen Guangyuan, the full-time officer of the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Disposal of American Relief Supplies: The United States has provided 175,000 tons of food aid to China. As of now, 75% has arrived, and the remaining quarter is being transported to central China in succession. It is expected to arrive in China by the end of June. After all the food arrives, it can maintain the rationing in five cities until June. In addition, there is still a portion of medicine and fertilizer among the relief supplies, which will be shipped before the end of June. The committee will end its work at the end of June according to regulations.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] Mordi, the deputy director of the US delegation to the Sino-American Relief Supplies Disposal Committee, read a work report drafted by the director of the delegation, Patrick, at the Rotary Club luncheon on the 22nd. The report stated that the delegation's work will end between June and July of this year. The delegation was established based on the Sino-American Relief Agreement signed last year, aimed at handling the remaining relief supplies left in China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), mainly to use the relief food to promote the rationing system in major cities. Mr. Patrick pointed out in the article that experts believe that China should have accurate statistics on its domestically produced and imported food. Domestic war is unavoidable. In order to exert its full power, the government should strive to improve the actual use of its self-produced and imported essential necessities, supplemented by appropriate price controls, and thoroughly reorganize the distribution mechanism to modernize it in order to achieve the goal of making the best use of everything.

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th United Press] It is widely rumored in Nanjing that a US business community group is negotiating a private loan with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to purchase machinery and materials. However, bankers and businessmen from both China and the United States, as well as various trade organizations, are unaware of this.

### $1 Million in Relief Goods to Be Distributed to Children in Six Chinese Cities; International Children's Fund Discussing

[US Information Service, Success Lake, 21st dispatch] The Executive Committee of the International Children's Emergency Fund discussed a proposal on Tuesday to allocate $1 million for use in China in the coming months.

The Soviet representative, Kobysov, opposed this proposal, arguing that cities such as Harbin, Jilin, and Luoyang should also be included. However, the Chinese representative stated that these cities are outside the control area of the Chinese central government and said that as soon as these territories are recovered from the CCP, relief supplies will be transported to these places. The Executive Committee of the International Children's Emergency Fund is scheduled to continue discussing the report of the Program Committee on April 28.

[Our dispatch] London 22nd broadcast: Rome news, Pope Pius XII issued a statement today on the end of the Italian election, stating that the victory of the democratic forces in Italy has greatly enhanced the confidence of Europe and the world.

[United Press, Rome, 22nd dispatch] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi announced today that Italy has applied to join the Western European anti-communist alliance. Gasperi's announcement adds an assistant to the US, British, and French side in the "Cold War" between European democracies and communists. Only five countries, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, were originally allied with the Western European Union. Italy is the first country to apply to join. In addition to announcing its intention to participate in the Western European Union, Gasperi also hopes to revise the peace treaty. The Italian Prime Minister also promised that his new government will make major improvements to land issues.

[Reuters, London, 21st dispatch] The permanent agency of the Western European Union will discuss the issue of Italy joining the five-nation Western European Union at its first meeting in London on Saturday. London diplomatic circles believe that the victory of the anti-communist parties in Italy's election has cleared the path for Italy to join the five-nation alliance. Since the end of the war, no foreign election has interested London more than this Italian election. Churchill said at a meeting of the Conservative Party on the 21st that Italy has temporarily spared itself from Stalin's Bolshevik dictatorship by its own efforts. Italy has now regained its position as a major European power, no longer like other unfortunate countries that have to live in the same cage as behemoths.

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference that he had no knowledge of the rumor that the United States had spent $4 million on the Italian election campaign under the "X Anti-Communist Plan."

[Associated Press, Rome, 22nd dispatch] The new Italian parliament is now scheduled to convene on May 8, elect a president two days later, and then the president will appoint a prime minister to form a new cabinet. It is expected that the position of prime minister will belong to the current prime minister, Gasperi.

[Reuters, Rome, 21st dispatch] Now that the Christian Democrats have gained an advantage in the general election, Gasperi said that he will unite with other anti-communist parties to form a stronger right-wing base government. Gasperi delivered a speech today on the balcony of the Christian Democratic Party headquarters here, saying that he will serve democracy with his strength and will reach agreements with other non-communist parties on foreign policy and all matters that contribute to Italy's true restoration. Gasperi stressed that the Christian Democratic Party opposes the implementation of dictatorship by any faction and advocates adopting a foreign policy that is sufficient to cause economic cooperation with nations stronger than Italy and unity with all free and democratic peoples. Gasperi also said that the Christian Democratic Party will, based on its majority in parliament, implement the two major goals of agricultural land reform and relief for unemployment under the conditions of maintaining freedom, respecting freedom, and maintaining the absolute need for independence. Gasperi finally said, "We Catholics are willing to maintain the independence of the church, and our responsibility is to maintain respect for the Pope."

### Italian Communists Denounce Unfree Elections; Declare No Intention to Resort to Force; Future Trends of the Communist International Are Extremely Noteworthy

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd dispatch] Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti delivered a speech today to the Anglo-American press conference in Rome, pointing out that the election was full of malpractices, but declaring that the Communist Party did not intend to use force. Togliatti said that the political situation in Italy is very serious and tense. The government is in power by foreign interference, intimidation, and fraud. If we do not accept the election results, it is because we intend to use violence to expel the government that has used violence against the people, then we have no intention of doing so. The use of force, regardless of the outcome, is detrimental to the country and will eventually lead to the loss of its independence. But we will still maintain the demand for free elections so that the people can engage in elections without being interfered with by foreign wars and famine, and intimidated by the church.

[Reuters, Rome, 21st dispatch] The Milan Communist Party headquarters suddenly lost caution tonight, and a large number of police have rushed to guard it.

The fire broke out only one hour after the Milan district Communist Party leader finished a meeting at the headquarters.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd dispatch] A US official said today that the failure of the Italian Communist Party to come to power shows that the Soviet Union's attempt to expand its red control in Europe beyond the Iron Curtain has failed. International communism is now facing an important decision: whether to endure setbacks and wait for opportunities to persevere by political means, or to resort to force at this time.

In addition to requesting the British to compensate the families of the deceased Soviet airmen and the loss of the damaged Soviet aircraft, the report pointed out that after the wreckage of the Soviet aircraft fell into the British military zone, the British had changed the position of the fragmented wreckage several times. The report also advocated the regulation of new air transport methods, requiring British and American aircraft to apply for permission from the Soviet authorities one day before each flight in the air corridor between Berlin and the West to avoid unfortunate incidents. The report also said that before detailed measures to ensure the safety of air transport are in place, night flights over the corridor, or flights when the sky is cloudy and aircraft cannot be seen from the ground, should be completely prohibited.

### U.S. House Committee Submits Report: Soviet Military Production Needs Increase; Forrestal Proposes Compromise Plan for Military Expansion

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast: Washington dispatch: The committee specially established by the House of Representatives for foreign aid issues, led by Republican Congressman Herter, submitted a report to Congress today stating that the Soviet Union's capacity to produce military equipment is greater than before the war. The claim that the Soviet Union's strength is not substantial and that it cannot engage in large-scale military operations when needed is obviously inaccurate.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The House Select Committee on Foreign Aid recently issued a document stating that the Soviet Union's defense budget for 1948 was 66.2 billion rubles, which is 51% higher than in 1940.

Since Congress and the Army, Navy, and Air Force had a dispute over Forrestal's plan for 55 Air Force groups, the Senate Armed Services Committee had requested a revised plan. Air Force officials strongly advocated expanding to 70 groups, while President Truman supported Forrestal's idea. The new plan submitted by Forrestal to Congress still calls for the enactment of conscription laws for those aged 19 to 25 as soon as possible and the adoption of universal military training, but the revised part of the plan focuses on changes in the requested number of Air Force units.

### Communist Bandits Hidden in Yangshupu Power Plant; "Six Parties" Organization Cracked; Plot to Create a Dark Shanghai Exposed; Police Department Arrests Eleven People Who Confessed the Gathering and Action Details

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters announced yesterday: At the end of last month, someone put iron filings into the generator of the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which almost caused a city-wide power outage. Fortunately, it was discovered on the evening of April 1, and the company tried its best to repair it, and it was resolved. After the incident, the security authorities paid close attention and, after many investigations, finally solved the case. It was confirmed that the communist bandits attempted to destroy the city's main power generation machines, create terror, and cause hundreds of thousands of workers to lose their jobs in order to create a chaotic situation. So far, Wu Shishen, Wang Xiaohe (from Zheng County), Wu Guozhen (from Guangcheng), Tan Asi, Song Changgeng (from Huai'an), Tang Lansheng (from Shanghai), Feng Renzhong, Huang Hongdong, Shi Jingen (from Shanghai), Dai Shougen (from Yixing), Gu Rongsheng and other eleven people have been arrested. The following is an excerpt of the confessions of the main culprits in the case, Wang Xiaohe and Wu Guozhen:

Confession of Wang Xiaohe, Director of the Labor Union

Wang Xiaohe, 25 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, a worker in the third shift of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, currently a director of the Labor Union.

Question: Did you preside over the destruction of the machine with iron filings in the Yangshupu Power Plant?

Answer: It was based on the second gathering, and a person surnamed Shen told me to do it.

Question: Please state the details of the second gathering.

Answer: The first time was at Xu Zhouliang's house in Hongzhen, around March 26. There were more than ten participants. They were all dissatisfied with the Shanghai arrests of workers this time and unanimously demanded action to show it, but no resolution was reached. The second time was at Wu Shishen's house. The participants included Shen Hongsheng, Wu Shishen, Huang Hongxun, Wang Xiaohe, and Feng Renzhong. I mentioned that if we wanted to destroy the machine, we could use bombs. At that time, Huang Hongxun opposed it, thinking that it would not gain social sympathy and that we should mobilize the masses to strive for it. After the meeting, Shen Hongsheng told me that if we were to take action in the future, he would send someone to contact me and set a secret code "AA." Two days later, Shen Hongsheng sent someone to my house and asked me to find a way to put iron filings in the DC shaft. If the machine exploded, the workers would leave the factory and petition the government. Later, I found Jiang Xinggen, a worker in the canopy department, and asked him to do this. Because he was timid, he refused to do it. I then found Wu Guozhen, an oil room worker, and Zhang Shibao (a coppersmith) to do it, and they agreed. On the night of March 30, Zhang Shibao found the iron filings, and Wu Guozhen put them into the shaft. It was discovered at 10 pm on April 1 because the thing that was put in was coarse sand (i.e., iron filings), so it did not explode.

Question: In the Yangshupu Power Plant, there is a core communist organization called the "Six Parties." Who are those people?

Answer: There are Wu Shishen, Huang Hongxun, Feng Renzhong, Tan Asi, Shen Hongsheng, and myself, six people in total. We have a meal together once a week to discuss the situation in the factory, which is the responsibility of Shen Hongsheng.

Confession of Wu Guozhen, an Oil Filler

Wu Guozhen, from Yancheng, Jiangsu, 25 years old, an oil filler in the Shanghai Electric Power Company.

Question: On March 30, someone put fine sand under the DC oil cover. Wang Xiaohe said: Zhang Shibao gave you the fine sand and you put it in.

Answer: Zhang Shibao said to me: I want you to put the iron filings in. I didn't want to do this at first, but then Wang Xiaohe said to me: You are a very good child. You were very good in the old labor union in the past. Now you must do this action because the government is arresting many of our workers, and we have to show the government some color. Under his enticing words, my will wavered, so I accepted his drive. Zhang Shibao gave me a bag of iron filings and asked me to put it in four machines, but at that time I was being condemned by my conscience, so I only put it in two, and then I told them that all of them were put in. In fact, I only put in two. When I put them in, Zhang Shibao kept watch, and someone would wave his hand as a signal, and I would put it down immediately.

Question: When did Wang Xiaohe call you to join the Communist Party?

Answer: When Ouyang Zurun ran away.

Question: Where did you join?

Answer: In Huishan Park. Wang Xiaohe contacted me to join.

### Captain Wanli Arrives in Tianjin; Will Sail to Rescue Passengers Today; Bandit Side Agrees to Release Personnel and Return Goods

[Report from Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren flew from Qingdao to Peiping on the 21st and will go to Tianjin today. If he obtains permission from the authorities, he will definitely sail the Great Wall ship on the 23rd to rescue the one thousand and several hundred passengers currently stranded in the bandit area.

(2) All personnel will be released, but they must be inspected. (3) Personal luggage and goods will be returned in full, but items of military use will be detained. (4) Technical matters concerning the rescue mission. Sha also said: The safety of the passengers is not a problem. Rongcheng Bay is extremely barren and cannot provide food and accommodation for more than a thousand passengers for a long time, so the communist bandits also hope to send the passengers out of the country as soon as possible. As for the ship itself, the local authorities have indicated that they can send people to repair it, and Fumin is prepared to send people from Qingdao. Accompanying Sha are Fumin staff member Wang Yucai, passenger family representative Feng Youshen, and others, four people in total.

### Ship Captain Sha Talks About His Experience

[Report from Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren arrived in Tianjin today and said that the Wanli ship arrived near Hailu Island at 8:45 am on the 12th, a quarter of a nautical mile from Guoshi Reef.

Sha said: The Wanli has sailed this line three times, and there is no reef on the nautical chart.

### Wanli Ship Passengers Still Stranded in Rongcheng

[Report from Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] The 1,234 passengers on the Wanli ship are currently temporarily residing in villages near Rongcheng Bay on the coast of Rongcheng County, where villagers provide food and accommodation. The local area is barren and can only supply sweet potatoes and cornmeal buns. The passengers automatically form large teams, medium teams, and small teams, and the life is united. In addition to the more than 100 crew members on the ship, the maximum number of passengers was originally set at 464, and the rest did not buy tickets. According to Captain Sha Yunren's estimate, the amount of legal tender carried on the ship reached about 300 billion.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren arrived in Tianjin on the 22nd. The Great Wall ship decided to sail to Rongcheng Bay on the 23rd or 24th carrying medicine and nutritious food to rescue the stranded passengers, and representatives of the families decided to stop going there.

### Volunteers Request Advance Payment of Settlement Allowance

[Report from Our Newspaper] There are many people registering for volunteer soldiers in the districts of this city, and many of them directly go to the two Civil Affairs Bureaus and the Military Service Association to apply for registration as volunteer soldiers, requesting preferential treatment and advance payment of settlement allowance (seeking shop guarantees) before enlisting. Among them, a citizen named Li Meifu at 1160 Nanjing Road requested that the Public Utilities Bureau be asked to issue a license for a business tricycle so that his family could operate it in Shanghai, and the monthly rental income would be used to maintain household expenses, and he could serve with peace of mind. There are many similar requests. Secretary of the Military Service Association, Shu Kenan, said yesterday that volunteer soldiers in various districts should apply for registration with the local district security office to wait for enlistment. The association is assisting the military service agencies and does not handle registration matters. Regarding letters from volunteer soldiers requesting preferential treatment, they will not be replied to. However, in the future, after volunteer soldiers register and enlist, if there are any requests, they will be assisted as much as possible in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of a young woman named Wang Chailanfeng, 21 years old, from Wuxi, who was accused of fraud, has been prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office.

On the afternoon of March 29 this year, Wang and her friend Zheng Futang went to Hengtaichang Silk Shop at 956 on the same road, Shenghua Department Store at 953, and Hongtai Clothing Shop at 736 to shop. Zheng separately paid a check from Fuchang Bank dated March 30 for 9 million, 10.5 million, and 10 million each. At that time, the shops did not suspect anything because Wang was familiar to them. However, when they went to cash them the next day, all of them were returned due to insufficient funds. The victims reported to the police station and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Zheng fled after hearing the news, and Wang shirked the blame to Zheng.

Judge Cao asked Zhang, Zhang made gestures to inform Ge, and Ge then asked the defendant with gestures. The reply was also transmitted to Judge Cao in order, so the question and answer were quite difficult and time-consuming. The deaf-mute made a wave shape with both hands, which means the Huangpu River. Everything was done with striking techniques. As a result, he was sentenced to six months in prison and two years of probation in court.

Another deaf-mute defendant, Chen Huaihong, literate, was accused of stealing 2 million from a passenger on the tram on February 15.

### The Mystery of Yang Jingzhou's Disappearance: Father-in-law's Inquiry in Taiwan Yields No Results; Murder at Sea Suspected

[Our Dispatch] Yang Jingzhou, manager of the Huaxi Hollywood Candy Factory in Shanghai, accepted a position at the 61 Candy Factory in Taiwan. He mysteriously disappeared on the Minsheng Company's Minzhong Steamer on his return journey after several days. Details were published in this newspaper on the 21st. After this bizarre event occurred, the family was extremely anxious. His father-in-law, Yan Shaotang, took the Hualian Steamer to Taiwan on the 16th to inquire, returning to Shanghai on the same vessel yesterday. According to him, he returned without any useful information after two days in Taiwan. The 61 Candy Factory is managed by the Xingtai Company. The factory site is very remote. Although the scale is not small, the equipment is very dilapidated. People in the factory said that Yang Jingzhou arrived in Taiwan on April 5th and went to the factory that evening. The next day, he inspected the factory equipment and discussed sugar production plans. On the 7th, he tried to produce mercerized sugar. On the morning of the 8th, he went out to visit friends and returned late in the evening, saying around 10 p.m. that he had a fever and chills. Factory staff accompanied him to the Guting Hospital for treatment. On the 9th, he went out again and did not return that night. On the morning of the 10th, he returned after breakfast, saying he would return to Shanghai. He then left the factory and never returned, leaving behind a gray coat and a coffee-colored canvas handbag. Yang Jingzhou disappeared halfway after boarding the ship. Whether he accidentally fell into the sea or was murdered has become a perplexing case. However, in the leather bag he left on the ship, a notebook contained the phrases "I am entering the tiger's den" and "Father, Father, is there salvation or not, the great number of life and death." Furthermore, according to fellow passengers, Yang was surrounded by several people when he boarded the ship, who took his ticket away. This clearly indicates that Yang knew in advance that he was in a dangerous situation. However, Yang himself was always taciturn and studious and had no enemies. Moreover, it was his first time in Taiwan, and he had no rea       Why would anyone want to take his life? In addition to grief, his family feels at a loss and deeply hopes that the security authorities in Shanghai and Taiwan can thoroughly investigate the matter to

### Private Trade Delegation; Two Groups to Japan on Schedule

General Observation: Difficult to Develop

[Our Dispatch] The second group of private trade representatives to Japan will depart in batches on the 27th of this month and the 8th of next month. It is reported that the Allied Headquarters (GHQ) is quite unfamiliar with our country's current import and export management methods and hopes that our government can provide formal information for reference. Zeng Jiyin, a merchant representative who went to Japan previously, also made this request to relevant ministries and commissions when he went to Beijing. In the future, our country may submit a list of goods allowed for import and export to Japan to dispel the doubts of the Allied Headquarters. According to the observation of qualified personnel, the current private trade with Japan is a restricted barter arrangement, and expansion is unlikely. For example, Japanese textile machinery can be manufactured and imported into our country in large quantities, but the Allied Headquarters' condition for exchange is that our country must supply a large amount of coal and iron to enable it to continue production, just as Britain exports large quantities of Indian cotton to Japan in exchange for Japanese-made fabrics. It is currently difficult for our country to achieve this.

### Absorbing Idle Funds, Combating Speculation and Hoarding: National Treasury Bills to be Issued Soon; Director of the National Bank's Economic Research Department Comments

[Our Dispatch] With the issuance of short-term treasury bills for the 37th year imminent, Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department of the National Bank, expressed his personal observations on the significance of the bill issuance as follows: (1) In principle, short-term treasury bills absorb idle funds based on market interest rates to combat speculation and hoarding. Because hoarding entails interest losses, hoarders will suffer if the price increase rate cannot keep up with the interest rate. Therefore, the issuance of treasury bills will increase the cost burden of speculators and can shift the direction of idle funds. (2) The issuance of short-term treasury bills is different from usury. It is only a market interest rate calculated in currency. Because it can suppress speculation and hoarding, it also has the effect of stabilizing interest rates. At the same time, the current idle funds come in and out of the hands of speculators. Even if the government does not absorb them, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises cannot use them. Therefore, the argument that the government is competing with industrial and commercial enterprises for funds is specious. (3) The issuance of short-term treasury bills will not affect the deposit business of silver and money shops. Because the deposits of today's silver and money shops are all current account, and have no savings significance, those who truly save have switched to saving in the form of material goods. The issuance of short-term treasury bills will open a path for savers, but it will not affect the deposit business of silver and money shops.

[Another dispatch] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, took a flight to Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday. It is rumored that this trip is related to the issuance of short-term treasury bills. According to news from the securities industry, the procedures for issuing short-term treasury bills have been largely decided, and the timing will be next week. Brokers are prepared for trading and estimate that they may appear on the exchange at an 85% discount.

### Sales Still Sluggish, Yarn and Cloth Continue Downward Trend

Yesterday, the yarn market remained in a stalemate. Only 16-count yarns of various grades saw some sales in local stores, and prices were slightly firm. The rest of the grades continued to trade in small volumes. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix immediately fell to 230 million yuan. Although it was absorbed by the duplicating industry and briefly rose to 233 million yuan, it eventually fell back due to oversupply, closing at the opening price, down 4 million yuan. 42-count Baoguang and Shuiyue also fell by another 3-4 million yuan. 40-count and 32-count yarns of various grades all fell by a small amount, ranging from 1 million to 4 million yuan.

There were 840 purchase applications, of which 24 from manufacturers bought 1,370 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by cloth dealers.

### Spot Cotton Trading Quiet

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet because prices in producing areas were slightly high, and suppliers were scarce. There were few offers in the market, and owners were reluctant to sell. The Flower Management Committee [Hua Guan Hui] slightly increased the purchase price. Some retailers, pressured by finances, sold off slightly. Sentiment remained high, so trading was not active.

### Wool Textile Industry Association Requests Exemption from Adjusting Wool Tax

[Our report] The Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association believes that the wool goods tax has been adjusted monthly since January of this year, with the May adjustment approaching. It has sent a letter to the Goods Tax Bureau, listing two reasons, requesting a temporary exemption from the adjustment to maintain business during difficult times: (1) Woolen goods sales are sluggish in the summer, and market prices are often 30% lower than factory prices. Factories have no choice but to lower prices to maintain operations. (2) The raw material quota allocation is less than one-fifth of the actual usage, and the increase rate of raw material prices is much higher than that of finished products. Therefore, if taxes are increased again, prices will increase again, leading to even slower sales, which will affect tax revenue.

### Commercial Briefs

The areas for currency exchange for Northeast circulation currency entering customs were originally limited to Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Subsequently, in response to actual needs, Qingdao, Jinan, and Xi'an have been added. Further additions may be considered.

If Shenghui funds have legitimate purposes, there is no limit of 200 million, 1 billion, or 10 billion, but reasons and explanations must be provided for approval.

The Four Banks Joint Treasury [Si Lian Zong Chu] has stipulated a gradual adjustment method for deposit interest rates. The original deposit interest rates will be gradually adjusted, aiming to approach market interest rates after a considerable period.

For exports of frozen eggs to the UK, the China Trust Bureau has purchased the sixth batch, totaling 805 tons. The advance payment price will be determined within days. The bureau has now decided to export the first batch of 1,190 tons this year and has scheduled shipment to the UK at the end of this month.

Although the Central Trust Bureau raised the purchase price of tung oil this Monday, the market price also increased accordingly, resulting in the purchase price still being significantly different from the black market price. Therefore, oil merchants have not applied for purchases recently.

The Shanghai Financial Administration continues to conduct inspections of bank operations, but recently, the focus is on follow-up inspections, and fewer specialized inspections are being conducted.

### Methods for Increasing National Education Funding Passed by the Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministries of Finance and Education, in order to seek ways to increase revenue and prevent corruption in national education funding and to maintain it, drafted methods for consolidating and increasing local national education funding, submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan invited the Ministries of Education, Finance, Food, and Interior to hold a meeting to review and amend the methods, which were then passed at the 52nd meeting of the Executive Yuan today. The main points of the methods are recorded as follows: (1) National schools and central national schools (hereinafter referred to as national schools) should, according to law, be affiliated with the county government. Their funding should be incorporated into the county budget for unified allocation, and the county government should, in accordance with constitutional provisions and considering local actual conditions, gradually increase the funding to enrich it. (2) National schools should, in accordance with regulations, earnestly raise funds. Those that have already raised funds should complete the donation procedures within a time limit to determine ownership. (3) If the county-level finances are insufficient to cover the operating expenses of national schools, the following methods should be used to increase revenue: (A) With the resolution of the county council and the approval of the provincial government, a "grain for education" donation can be organized. The donation rate and implementation methods of the grain for education donation should be determined by the county government based on the needs of local national schools, the people's wealth, and their ability to bear the burden, and submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation, and reported to the Ministries of Finance and Education for record. This does not apply to counties and cities in the pacification zone. (B) Fifty percent of the income from public property and the income from production in townships should be allocated to the operating expenses of national schools. (C) The above two sources of income should be used for specific purposes, and the income and expenditure should be publicized, and no misappropriation is allowed. (4) When the temporary expenses of national schools are insufficient, the county government should launch a social donation to raise funds for the construction and equipment of national schools and to enrich books and instruments, based on the principle of voluntary donations from the people. (5) Each county should immediately determine special education funds in accordance with the law, and the original educational funds and properties should be earnestly consolidated, and the surplus should be included in the special fund. (6) Each locality should first increase funding for the existing number of national schools and enrich the content. After the financial resources are abundant, more schools and classes can be added. (7) After the implementation of these methods, all apportionments and various fees collected by schools in the past are uniformly prohibited.

### Hookworm Disease: An Enemy of the Countryside

— Wang Wanbai

I recently received a letter from the Suzhou Huxuguan Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant, which stated in brief: "Our plant owns mulberry fields and employs mulberry workers who specialize in cultivation. Every year during the yellow plum season, the workers enter the mulberry fields barefoot. Within a few days, their insteps become slightly swollen and unbearably itchy. After a few days, internal diseases develop, with mild fever, itchy throat, and cough. Later, their complexion gradually turns sallow, their spirits become haggard, and their physical strength becomes unsustainable, eventually leading to their inability to work. This disease is commonly known as 'mulberry leaf yellow.' In the rural areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, countless workers suffer from this disease every year. The impact on work is a minor matter, but the devastation to life is truly heartbreaking. Medical and pharmaceutical facilities in townships are very rudimentary, and treatment is naturally difficult to be effective. They want to seek medical treatment in the city, but they are unable to do so, forming a situation of helplessness and allowing it to take its natural course. I remember that in the past, you, Doctor, once gave a broadcast lecture, mentioning that when you were in charge of the church hospital in Changzhou, there were many similar diseases that were not difficult to cure. I have long admired your profound medical knowledge and rich experience, and you must have in-depth research on this disease. Therefore, I am writing to request a more detailed answer to the origin of this disease and its treatment and prevention. This is not only the happiness of our plant, but all those who have the same disease in various places will feel your boundless virtue."

According to this, the disease is actually hookworm disease, which is indeed an enemy of the countryside. It is extremely prevalent along the Yangtze River basin and the Beijing-Shanghai area. However, it is also found in many other places. Because it is quite important, in addition to broadcasting on the Gospel Radio, I have specially extracted a summary and published it in the newspaper to arouse the attention of health authorities and socially conscious people.

Pathogen The cause of this disease is the transmission of a tiny parasitic worm called hookworm. The adult worm is as thin as a thread, only a few millimeters long, and lives in the small intestine of the patient, in very large numbers, attached to the intestinal mucosa, sucking human blood. Therefore, the patient has severe anemia. The worm eggs are extremely small and can only be seen under a microscope magnified hundreds of times. The patient's feces contain as many as four or five trillion worm eggs each time, which is the source of transmission of this disease.

Transmission Hookworm eggs develop very quickly in the soil. After the larvae hatch, they can infect humans in four or five days. The route of transmission is through unclean food, which directly enters the mouth, but the number is still small. Most of the larvae in the soil invade the human body through the skin of the legs and feet, first entering the veins to the heart, then entering the lungs, and then following the trachea into the esophagus and down to the stomach and intestines, where they parasitize and suck blood. Therefore, after infection, there is first itching of the skin, followed by sore throat and fever, and finally extreme anemia. The toxins secreted by the worms also cause toxicity, leading to exhaustion and death.

Symptoms After becoming ill, the main symptoms are anemia, pale complexion, and fatigue. However, the appetite is still good, so it is also called the "eating but lazy yellow disease." Female patients gradually stop menstruating, then death is not far away. Children who suffer from this disease are physically weak, and their studies are naturally unable to cope with. Their temper is also bad, making them annoying. Morality, intelligence, and physical fitness all fail. Male and female farmers and workers who suffer from this disease can eat but cannot work, and are often ridiculed, suffering both physical and mental pain.

Treatment First, check the stool. If hookworm eggs are found, then deworming is necessary. Ordinary drugs for roundworms are ineffective. The well-known drug for treating this disease is Chenopodium oil. For the method of administration, one should first take a spoonful of Glauber's salt dissolved in four or five spoonfuls of water the night before going to bed. The next morning, abstain from food and take one capsule of Chenopodium oil containing five drops each at seven, eight, and nine o'clock, for a total of three capsules. After another two hours, take two or three spoonfuls of Glauber's salt dissolved in half a teacup of water. Then the worms will all be excreted. The shape of the worm can be slightly seen in the sunlight with the feces dissolved in water. One can only eat thin porridge at noon, and then eat normally afterwards. It is even better to take iron-containing blood tonics, or eat more pork liver, which can replenish blood. It is best to take the deworming medicine again after two weeks to eradicate the roots.

Prevention In areas where this disease is prevalent, feces should be disinfected with lime and stored in pits for a long time for composting to kill the eggs. Farm workers must wear shoes and socks to prevent skin contact with soil. After work and before eating, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly. Strict implementation will avoid infection. It is hoped that the responsible agencies will widely publicize this.

### How to Control Diphtheria

— Hua Xinren

Besides smallpox, perhaps the greatest success of human research on immunization work is to conquer diphtheria, in other words, mankind can control the infection of vicious diphtheria. Recalling history, we must praise Loeffler for first discovering the diphtheria bacillus. Later, two experts, Roux and Yersin, made further research and proved that the symptoms of diphtheria are not due to the spread of bacteria throughout the body, but because the bacteria are selected in one place; it does not spread throughout the body, but the toxins it produces are absorbed into the blood circulation. In 1892, Von. Behring's research proved that horses have natural immunity to diphtheria; why can they have immunity? Because diphtheria bacilli are inoculated into the horse's body, the horse's blood quickly produces an antitoxin, which is found in horse serum; if horse serum is injected into the body of a diphtheria patient, it can have an effect of neutralizing the toxins produced by the bacteria. Because of Behring's new invention, the mortality rate of diphtheria has dropped from 50% to less than 10%. If we treat the patient early, or the amount of antitoxin is appropriate, then the mortality rate can be reduced to about 2%. Therefore, mankind can control diphtheria, and Behring's contribution to the history of immunization is truly indelible.

How can we control vicious diphtheria? The first step is to start with the use of antitoxin until the discovery of preventive serum in 1920, that is, the mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin began to be injected into elementary school students to maintain immunity in the body. The discovery of this work is as great as Jenner's invention of cowpox. Now I would like to introduce Schiek's great achievements in diphtheria immunity.

In 1908, Schiek injected a small amount of toxin into the skin, the dose being the minimum lethal dose of diphtheria toxin of a guinea pig weighing 250 grams (M.L.D1/50), diluted with 0.1-0.2 cubic liters of saline solution, and injected into the skin of the forearm. If a red halo appears at the injection site, it is positive, proving that our body lacks antitoxin and is easily infected with diphtheria. If it is a negative reaction, it means that our body contains more than one-thirtieth of a unit of antitoxin in each milliliter of blood, which can protect us from diphtheria infection under normal circumstances. The conclusion of Schiek's experiment is to distinguish between two categories, infectious and non-infectious. Preventive injections are given to those who are infectious, and they will have immunity after a certain period of time. After 1902, the method of preparing preventive serum was gradually improved, using denatured toxin Toxoid. In fact, the principle is still the same. Using this preventive method to reduce the severity of the disease has indeed achieved the effect of "getting twice the result with half the effort." According to statistics, in New York City alone, from 1890 to 1894, when diphtheria antitoxin was not yet widely used, 134 out of every 100,000 people died of diphtheria each year; from 1900 to 1904, diphtheria antitoxin had been widely adopted, and the mortality rate of diphtheria was reduced from 58 per 100,000 people. From 1915 to 1919, everyone had a position on diphtheria antitoxin and it was widely used. During these years, the mortality rate was only 21 per 100,000 people. From 1920 to 1934, the mortality rate was only 2.2, that is, only 22 people per million died of diphtheria each year. By 1935, only nine people per million died of diphtheria in New York City. In this year, not a single person died of diphtheria in 19 cities in the United States. The result of this fact proves that the principle of immunity is that diphtheria antitoxin can only protect us from diphtheria and has nothing to do with other infectious diseases. Later, Dr. Ehrlich proposed a side chain theory for immunity.

Immunity is because immune bodies are produced in human cells (Immunebodies may have several organs, such as the spleen, liver, thyroid, etc., which are particularly powerful and active in the manufacture of this immune body; but, to date we know that the human body does not have a special organ, or a group of cells, for making immune bodies. Dr. Ehrlich only imagined that infectious bacteria or toxins come into contact with human cells, and the revived cells are stimulated, and then make a certain chemical substance to neutralize this toxin, or kill these bacteria.

### Statistics of X-ray Examination of 7,203 People

— Ding Huikang

Chinese people avoid medical treatment, which has become a common habit in society, especially for lung diseases. Looking at the X-ray examination statistics of 7,203 people in Hongcheng Sanatorium in the 36th year, it was found that more than 22% of them had tuberculosis. This phenomenon is truly regrettable! What is even more surprising is that a total of 569 people were found to have bilateral tuberculosis, accounting for nearly 8% of the total number of examinations. Most of these patients are usually unaware of it, and the symptoms are very mild; if they are not examined by X-ray, they will never know that both lungs are diseased. Therefore, X-ray diagnosis is said to be a compass for our life safety, which is not an exaggeration. This is the first. In addition, there are 195 people with heart and aortic dilation. If X-ray examination is not performed, it will not be possible to know that the most important organs of their body have undergone major pathological changes; just like sailing in the dark night, the danger is very great. If these people can be treated early, they will be able to recover their health soon. This is the second. The right lung is more likely to be diseased than the left lung. This is the third. In terms of age, young people aged 20 to 30 are often the biggest targets of tuberculosis; and especially at the age of 24, it is the most dangerous age for people to suffer from lung disease. This is the fourth. In terms of occupation, the unemployed and students are often the concentration points of tuberculosis. This is the fifth.

Conclusion: The success or failure of the prevention of tuberculosis has a great relationship with the general national health. If we think about it, almost every family and every unit, whether it is a store, a bank, or a school, must have one to several people who are affected by tuberculosis. Therefore, preventing tuberculosis is like fighting a fire, and we must not let it spread naturally; we must use effective methods to prevent it with all our strength. Especially in public places, such as schools and factories, we must implement group inspections to find out the unconscious tuberculosis one by one, which is the way to clarify the source. I remember that ten years ago, in the Federation of Universities, I tried my best to advocate that all new students entering university must undergo X-ray examination. According to the current social situation, it is a necessary measure. Last autumn, Jiaotong University admitted more than 300 new students, and after X-ray examination, it was found that seven of them had tuberculosis; once treated early, not only will their studies not be interrupted, but their personal health can be restored; and their families will invisibly reduce the occurrence of tragedies, and the society will reduce invisible infections. One move has several benefits. As for the future when they complete their studies and serve the country, it is even more of a matter. A hundred years of education, tuberculosis prevention and examination, is the preliminary foundation! (Detailed statistics are attached)

### Homeward Bound Eulogy

— Ji Yong

The title “Homeward Bound” comes from Zhang Baozhai’s “Wen Shi Tong Yi Homeward Bound” chapter:

“An honest person good at selling books, an old family rich in collecting books, an enthusiast brave enough to publish books, are all people of erudite renown who would link arms and enter the forest together… However, these people are nothing more than musical instrument makers and stone tablet craftsmen, their art having only a connection to literary refinement; having associated with many famous people, they are accustomed to hearing pure words and renowned theories, yet their chests are devoid of pearls of wisdom. Thus, their word-of-mouth hearsay and shallow knowledge of fundamentals are not difficult to discern. Scholar Zhou Changfa compared such people to being 'homeward bound,' a strange yet accurate statement… Scholars, limited in their experience and knowledge, upon encountering the arguments of the 'homeward bound,' are shocked as if by thunder splitting a mountain, leading to the mingling of fish eyes and pearls, unable to distinguish between the pure and impure. These people also appoint themselves to be so, unaware that their 'bound' originates from 'homeward'…”

This statement is correct, but inevitably somewhat harsh. People of the Qing dynasty valued narrow and deep research. As stated in the "Han Shu Yi Wen Zhi," Dongfa received instruction, but could not exhaust the classics even with white hair, which might be true. Chen Shuofu spent forty years of painstaking effort on a single book, "Shou Shi Zhuan Shu," first drafting lengthy notes, then completing a monograph. We must truly admire him, but having devoted so much time, he merely found evidence that was neither close nor far, with forced connections, to find procedures that showcased his ability to make forced connections. This time was also spent quite pitifully.

Naturally, our era has changed, our perspectives have broadened, and our views are fundamentally different from those of the ancients. However, the writings of Ma Ruichen and others at that time were indeed superior to Chen's book. Therefore, we cannot blindly worship false treasures built of hard work, which is quite obvious. However, what I want to discuss is not simply a matter of time, but that today's social environment simply does not allow us the time or possibility for such work. Even if there were such weighty works, few people would be able to digest them! It was often said that scholars of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods were influenced by literary inquisitions, forcing them to delve into minutiae. As a result, in the field of classical studies, there were the magnificent "Huang Qing Jing Jie Zheng Xu Bian" with thousands of volumes, and historical studies were even more abundant. However, in my view, we must still adhere to materialism. The main reason was the abundance of material resources and the simplicity of life at that time, especially in the rice-producing regions of Jiangnan, where everyone lived a life of extreme comfort and stability. Learning originally arises from stability, especially classical research. It is like wealthy families building houses, painting beams and carving pillars, exhausting the abilities of decoration. If people are exposed to the elements, they can only build a few thatched huts to avoid wind and rain. The ancients said that the hungry easily become food seekers, and the cold easily wear short clothes, which is the same principle. What was the scene during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras? How can it be compared to today's rice prices, commodity prices, and livelihood situations? I read Wang Longzhuang's posthumous works, which recorded the flooding during the Kangxi era, where rice prices were only a few hundred coins per dou, and he already cried out loudly, believing the world could not be peaceful! If they were born today, who knows what they would think! Chen Shuofu, Duan Mao Ying, Wang Huaizu, and other masters, if they were university professors today, would probably only be able to appeal with no results, weeping in a cow shed. "Shuo Wen Jie Zi Zhu" and "Jing Chuan Shi Ci" would probably never be completed.

According to this, being "homeward bound" today is not so bad. Taking booksellers as an example, at that time, they could still connect with refined scholars, spread rumors and gossip. Although they lacked pearls of wisdom, their tastes were not low. What about now? Beijing is a concentration of old bookstores, but aren't they all being bundled and sold as waste paper by the catty? Even if the government has allocated as much as a billion dollars to rescue these "materials," it is a drop in the bucket, with little effect. Moreover, I have personally seen many old painting shops converted to selling new books exclusively. The so-called new books are really only limited to Feng XX's love novels and XX Louzhu's chivalrous tales. How can one seek to be "homeward bound" in this way? Look at the book dealers, and then look at the educators in schools, how many can truly lead the masses with knowledge, like Peking University during the May Fourth Movement, or the Wumu Caotang and Shiwu Xuetang during the Hundred Days' Reform? Those with true ability either become high officials, start businesses, or simply go to Columbia, California, Harvard, and other universities across the Pacific to earn American dollars. Those who remain are struggling in hunger and cold. Under the heavy pressure of life, it is already extremely difficult to seek even a little “homeward bound,” let alone specialize?

There is another layer of meaning here, which is purely theoretical. Learning is broad before it is profound, which is what we call pyramid achievements. In other words, any specialization must be built on common sense. Common sense is not specialization, but the knowledge that ordinary people must have. This can also be called "homeward bound," or named the "ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign school." I feel that studying today, continuing to adhere to the "family laws" and "master laws" of the Han Confucians is definitely foolish and reckless. A bit of scientific method and scientific knowledge is essential for everyone, otherwise, they will become blind and foolish. (Wang Chong, "Lun Heng": "Knowing the present but not the past is called submersion; knowing the past but not the present is called blindness.") Even if you are a specialist in Han and Song classics, what use is it? The era of learning for the sake of learning has already passed. Although not necessarily learning leads to high rank, how can we ignore its current use? Therefore, "homeward bound" itself is undesirable, but as the foundation of specialized academic studies, we are afraid of losing it. Some people advocate that those who study literature and history do not need to know physics and chemistry, perhaps because they do not fully understand the importance of common sense. If this idea is understood, then the Chinese academic community can enter a new era.

### On Movies

— Ze Shi

It has been a long time since I watched a movie, and friends who like to meddle often inquire: “Why don’t you watch movies anymore?” Their tone is full of surprise, as if they saw me fasting.

The reason I haven't watched movies for a long time is actually just because—I have no money or I don’t understand English. But I’m not willing to say it directly, and instead search for grand and dignified reasons. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” Finally, I found a reason that is enough to write a paper about—and there are two of them.

First, people who have watched movies for a few years or hundreds of times are sorry to say that their stupidity is unsurpassed. Movies are said to be good in America, but I have a clipping from the Washington Post from ten years ago in my drawer, which is about Hollywood. It says: “We still have to praise Hollywood for some of its merits. No matter how many times a story is used, a film always has a different name.”

Second, my children over ten years old like to watch movies more than they like to read books. They are unhappy if they don’t watch a movie for a week, and they are still unhappy on Tuesdays because they can’t continue watching after watching one on Sunday. I think this child is unpromising, so I went to places with schools to inquire, with hidden worries. Hmm, it turns out that many young friends with schoolbags aged fourteen or fifteen are talking about movies and movie stars, such as "So and so, have you seen that so and so movie? It's really 'zan'!" "How could I not watch it? That protagonist is really 'ling'!" Later, on the streetcar, because I was paying attention, I often heard young men and women talking about movies.

So I paid attention to the movie advertisements in the newspaper and classified them roughly into three categories: "Female Knight Golden Silk Tiger," "Devil Knight's Bloody Record," "Little White Dragon," "King Kong," "Spy Web," "Destroy the Terrorist Bomb," "Murderer," "Haunted House," "Precious Sword Divine Whip," "Lightning Bandit," "Divine Whip Knight," etc., belong to the category of gods and monsters and martial arts; "Smuggling Beauty," "Hairpin Light Sword Shadow," "Marriage Oath," "Operation Beauty," "Mermaid," etc., belong to the category of fragrant, sensual, romantic love; the third category is literary ethics, but unfortunately, they are rare, and I can't remember a few names, so I'll omit them.

I don’t know which category young men and women like to watch the most, and I don’t know what the result will be if young men and women watch too many of these movies. I just don’t watch them myself, and I prepare more comic books for my children to watch instead of movies. First, to save money, and second, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages. In my humble opinion, the former is perhaps better than the latter.

### Public Medical System

— Yan Fu

Because of my wife's critical illness, I deeply feel the importance of a public medical system; a society that cannot guarantee a high standard of living for everyone cannot be considered how unreasonable, and a society that cannot guarantee full employment for everyone cannot fully prove how backward it is; even not being able to provide adequate medical care for the majority of people is the most tragic thing. Science has not yet progressed to the omnipotent point of "no disease cannot be cured," but after all, it is doing its best to relieve the dangers and sufferings of human pathology. If this possibility is blocked by human causes, putting patients beyond the difficulties that can be overcome, and rejecting them beyond the conditions that can be solved, then it should be the most cruel example. No wonder progressive medical scholars are loudly calling for the establishment of a public medical system. Any medical and pharmaceutical institutions that boast of "charity" and service are reaching out to ask for money, money, money from patients with or without money. People with money are blessed—it is "harder than a camel passing through the eye of a needle" for people without money to enter the hospital. This is the reality, this is the cruel reality!

It is said that the UK has already implemented a public system. The UK's national policy is absolutely incompatible with the Soviet Union's policy of bloody revolution, which shows that a public medical system does not necessarily originate from any communist heresy. We yearn for the day when the real Three People's Principles will be realized, at least patients will not be shut out of the square-shaped hospital gates—but when will the Three People's Principles be realized? Thinking about it makes me feel hopeless!

### Hoffman, the Man

— Dao Xian

Paul Hoffman, the executor of the US foreign aid bill, started his career by selling cars. He dropped out of the University of Chicago after studying for a year and went to sell cars. Selling goods is his forte. He showed his skills in the Los Angeles car market. During World War I, he served as an artilleryman for two years, then returned to Los Angeles and opened a Studebaker dealership.

In 1925, he was appointed Vice President of Studebaker, responsible for sales. In 1933, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Hoffman helped to reorganize it. In 1935, he took over as President and has remained so until now.

Hoffman does not smoke and is completely abstinent from alcohol. He is a practical person. He believes that enlightened capitalism is the world's most productive economic system.

### Book Detective

— Mao Yi

One cold morning in 1931, a pedestrian stopped in front of an old bookstore on the east side of New York. He casually picked through a pile of water-stained old books and selected one.

"How much?" he asked the shop owner.

"Five cents a book."

A deal was done. The pedestrian was Lew David Feldam, a cunning bookseller from Fifth Avenue. The book he bought for five cents was one of the rarest of the rare - the first and last collection of poems by the great poet Edgar Allan Poe, "Tamerlane and Other Poems". Feldam sold this collection for a good price of $25,000. The old shop owner was so angry when he found out that he committed suicide.

Feldam is an expert in searching for rare and precious books. He has been engaged in this work for nearly 20 years and is known as the number one book detective in the United States. This blue-eyed "bookworm" eats books, sleeps books, and dreams of books. His amazing ability to detect books makes his business extremely prosperous. Collectors, museums, libraries, schools, industrial institutions, advertising agencies, and even zoos entrust him to buy books.

The client's entrustment often leads Feldam to discover interesting historical reversals. For example, most Americans firmly believe that their Founding Father George Washington was a gentle and courteous person. However, some American historians believe that their first president was a violent, rude, and impolite person. An expert in ancient American history entrusted Feldam to collect as many documents written by Washington himself as possible. After digging through book markets in various places for several months, he finally found something written by Washington, titled: "Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior In Company and Conversation," which is enough to prove that Washington was a polite and courteous gentleman.

Feldam was originally an importer of Far Eastern jewelry. In order to find a bookseller who could increase his knowledge of jewelry, he failed, so he personally got into the pile of books, and as a result, he discovered many things that ordinary jewelers did not know, so he decided to change careers and become today's "Sherlock Holmes of the book industry."

### On Marriage Education

— Shi Wen

Recently, Shanghai University's plan to set up a course on marriage has been well received by all sectors of society. Articles discussing it have also appeared frequently in "Free Talk". However, it seems that there are still some people in society who hold a reserved attitude, even professors at Shanghai University are no exception.

In fact, the University of North Carolina in the United States set up courses on various aspects of marriage, both psychological and physiological, twenty years ago (1927). Although it was quite obstructed at the time, it achieved remarkable results, and those who opposed it could only remain silent. Recently, nearly 600 universities in the United States have courses on marriage.

### Memories

— Ping Yuan

My heart was originally calm, without waves, without raging tides. But "it" flew to hover around me, gently knocking on my heart, and singing the old songs that I had almost forgotten into my ear again and again... I couldn't refuse, so I had to allow "it" to slip into my heart "just once".

But this just once, decided the future troubles. It kept pouring out the sorrows and hatreds of the past, those that I had spent great effort to forget, and maintained the balance of my psychology, but, it sent these to my ears in a sad tone, and depicted a group of faces familiar to me to gnaw at my heart. From then on, I lost my peace.

It is it, which makes me think hard in the long nights, stare blankly in the clear days, lose my lively mood, forget the world in front of me, corrode myself—ignore the most real present, only know the past rendered extremely beautiful by my prejudiced brain...

"Memories"! This beautiful and autocratic demon king - I can't resist you, I am willing to be teased by you, but, I also know that the "past" is also accumulated from "reality", let those beautiful factors that can encourage me live in my heart; let those entanglements that make me sad stay away from me!

### Anecdotes of Zeng Mengpu (Supplement)

— Qian Dacheng

I published anecdotes about Mr. Zeng in the newspapers, and I have also seen many reports in Shanghai newspapers about his trivial matters, so I will supplement what was not prepared.

In his later years, Mr. Zeng lived in seclusion in the Xu Chou Garden (commonly known as Zeng Garden, in Jiuwanwei, Changshu), where he widely planted flowers and trees, including foreign varieties from the West, with thousands of purples and reds, as if entering a country of a hundred flowers. In summer, when lotus flowers are in full bloom, tea seats are set up all over the pool, and visitors are always full. Mr. Zeng wears a hat and holds a cane, walking and chanting in between; he expresses his feelings and forgets all honors and humiliations. Every night, he pours new Fudan tea into the calyx of the lotus flower, and cooks it the next morning to enjoy with guests, its fragrance is fragrant, elegant and also rhyme.

After Mr. Zeng passed away, Jin Songcen said that "Nie Hai Hua" was first created by him, and then continued by Mr. Zeng, so he wrote a poem for Mr. Zeng, which said: "The fate of incense is deep, but the friendship is shallow, this feeling only the night stars know." He also said: "It took a lot of words before Lu and after Wang." This is to be especially passed down by future generations of literary circles, so there is no need to rush to determine it.

After Mr. Zeng won the Juren degree in the Qing Guangxu period, he went to Beijing to take the imperial examination. According to legend, he failed because the ink on his examination paper was spilled. Mr. Zeng himself said that it was because he was sad after losing his wife, so he could not finish the exam; there was no spilling of ink on the examination paper. However, it was rumored in the village that Mr. Zeng had obtained the three words "Yuan Mi Shi" (元秘史) from Shaanxi Province, so he told his close friend, and was overheard by one person. Mr. Zeng and his close friend both failed, and the person who overheard it uniquely succeeded. This person still exists today, so I don't want to write his surname. If the rumor is true, how can we ask Elder Yangu (the author who continued "Nie Hai Hua") in the ninth heaven to prove his statement? However, Mr. Zeng has always been indifferent to fame and fortune, and has been a famous son and virtuous official all his life; in the end, he was clean and poor, burdened with debts, and immortal with literature, worthy of being a first-class writer. Lin Qinnan and Hu Shi, whose literary views are completely different, praised "Nie Hai Hua" in unison, without any different words.

### Song of the King of Trees

— Shi Shufan

Mount Xidam is the sea of ten thousand firs, where lush green clouds gather, and the sun dares not turn red. The branches and trunks are all hundreds or thousands of years old. The most ancient one is called the King of Trees, located below the Immortal Peak, next to the Old Hall of the Mountain Opening. It is large enough to be embraced seven times, comparable to the sacred tree of Alishan in Taiwan. Mr. Yu Youren inscribed a stone to protect the roots, and the ink is dripping and pleasing! When I was living in western Zhejiang, I was actually relying on the foot of the mountain, but I never climbed it for two years, because the path was dangerous and very far. In the winter of Guiwei, I was about to go to Tiantai. Mr. Yang Ling told me that the soldiers had not stopped fighting, and when would I come again? You must have a poem to record the great tree. The next day, I went with my brother Lin Ze, his wife Shi Zhongxing, and a monk, and returned after passing through the clouds and smoke and stroking it, and got several rhymes of seven-character verses. Even now, when I think about the people and events here, the sadness is hard to describe!

The "Shui Jing Zhu" records the Tianmu firs, with countless five-embraces and ten-drags. The green surges into tides for thousands of years, and the clouds do not rain and the wind does not rage. There is also the King of Trees that soars into the sky, with the lower section of the earth held by a dragon as a borer. One branch returns to the southeast with spring, and one leaf falls with frost on the country. The leaves fall and the immortals and mortals grow old one after another. Stroking it, I lament that there is no solid bark. Why ask Nuwa for refining stones? Prince Shen Seng only has tombstones! The traces of the prehistoric times are difficult to check. This mountain has this tree. I was born after ten thousand eons, and when I read it, I understand the admiration of the generals. When I was young, I casually took on the integrity of Pan and Cuo, and when I was strong, I painfully relied on Fuyu! It's not that my hometown's willows are not good, but the Weng Zhong's have sent Cai Jing to his doom. The Kuncai replaces the weapon with the fighting Hu children, and the He boat carries Sichuan to the road of life and death. Coming from the west, I lament the birds and insects, and turning to look at the mountain, I dare not write a poem. The swaying and melancholy resembles Geng Xin's sadness, and the great material is worried like Du Fu? The dim Ruo lamp is two weeks a year, and the wood spirit and poetry spirit are separated by sleep. No wonder the thunder urges by the wine bottle, and the purple dragon often carries the dream away. The fugitive's ink stains Jiangyou, and the withered vine is lazy to stay at the Immortal Peak. Should I know what age the world is now, and why not spit my lungs to Mei Ya? Sincerity and emotion can be the same, and the tree can speak and share the old man's words! I heard it, and I bowed again and tears flowed. At the fifth watch, I wrapped up the green vines. The black winter is bleak, and the crows are tired and crying, with a few residual stars breaking the dawn. The Shahan guest carries the red sleeves to follow, and the poetry official and the thin monk laboriously lead the way. One peak and two peaks pass under the feet, and one journey and two journeys rely on the void. The discussion wheel rises up quickly, chasing after the cave, and looks up to see the yin mist. The higher the steps, the smoother and harder they are. The sharp rise suddenly leads to the fall, abandoning the cane, pulling the cold, and entrusting the climbing, and the previous life has been trained to achieve the tools to overcome the victory. Before anything, the Tianmen opens, and the sea of trees is clear and icy. The sun shines on the head, and the jade dust flies, and the clustered branches of Wu Mian have not been hit by catkins. How can we make a limited magical work, and fly and carry three troops for a moment? There is more ironing of the mourning goose tears, and don't let the reed flowers cry in the wind and dew! The absurd wishes are held before the ancient times, and the lowly travels to the gods towards the wandering. Absolutely laugh at the special etiquette, and the green cover comes out of the high place to meet the cliff. It stands like a copper pillar in the barbarian corner, and the fire is not allowed to look at the Ezo. It is as bright as a brocade-clad hard crossbow, and shoots down the arrogant with a sword. The arms that take the clouds are divided into two hemispheres, and the purple condensation is fragrant and the pendants are jingling. The horizontal and vertical strips are full of patterns, and the solemn atmosphere is like a arsenal. The unicorn sings and the phoenix blows and flies, and the ghosts and monsters are terrifying. The vast giant vein runs through the Qinggang, and is it not the essence of the sun and moon? Holding the shadow to mourn the soul of the ant, the old man is about to meet the old man! The tree is also accumulated for generations and has forgotten words, silently showing the whole history of rise and fall: The east branch hates to send Xu Fu's boat, and the north branch has seen Meng Tian's garrison. The various countries in the west sea have mixed grievances and graces, and the south clothing is now attached. Since ancient times, the country has been protected by loyal hearts, and the mountains and rivers must be protected by swords and soldiers! Guide me to look at Bayu, and lie down for seven years and eat courage; Looking back, I lost my joy at the island city, and the barbarians returned with white hair and the morale was low. The hatred of the ages will be repaid in my body, and the tree will cut you open and cross the sea! Sing barefoot on the summit of Mount Fuji, and the shrine is drunk and messy. Kill the familiar and execute the especially righteous punishment, and watch the falling city and cut off its fate. At this time, my intention wants to be infatuated, and at this time, the monk official sighs many times. Although it is useless from morning to dusk, I finally pity the infatuation of praying to heaven with evidence! The temple and the wild are discussed by future generations, and Yu Ran's ink applies the beard's sentence.
