The First Session of the Legislative Yuan Will Be Extended to the End of June

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] According to Article 68 of the Constitution, the first session of the first Legislative Yuan was originally scheduled to end at the end of May. However, since the transitional government before the implementation of the Constitution only formulated the budget for the first half of the 37th year, the national budget for the second half of the year must be reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan before the end of the first session. In addition, there are still many legal cases after the implementation of the Constitution waiting to be processed. According to related sources, the first session will be extended to the end of June before it can be adjourned.

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] The president of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution was elected by 616 members at noon on the 17th. The temporary chairman of the sixth preparatory meeting, Wu Tiecheng, read the report at 12:47, as follows:

"May 17, 37th year of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan held a general meeting to elect the president, and the voting results show that Mr. Sun Ke received 558 votes."

"According to Article 2 of the 'Regulations for the Election of the President and Vice President by Legislative Yuan Members', 'The election of the President and Vice President shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan, which requires the attendance of more than one-fifth of the total number of Legislative Yuan members to be held', and Article 4, paragraph 1 stipulates that 'The election of the President and Vice President shall be based on obtaining more than half of the votes of the attendees to be elected.' The total number of Legislative Yuan members in this session is 773, one-fifth is 155, the number of attendees today is 616, and more than half is 309. Mr. Sun Ke received 558 votes, which exceeds more than half of the attendees and is elected as the President of the Legislative Yuan."

### Voting Order for Electing the President and Vice President Was Good; Both Sun and Chen Received More Than Half of the Votes

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] The sixth preparatory meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 am on the 17th, presided over by the temporary chairman Wu Tiecheng. First, the minutes of the previous preparatory meeting were approved. Then, the election of the president began. Zhu Shaolun then stated that he had not received Hu Shi's letter to him on May 6. Liu Xiaowei then submitted a written opinion stating that Chuan Xinnian was not elected as a legislator and that his election certificate had been entrusted to someone else to collect. After the temporary Secretary-General Lou Tongsun reported the voting instructions, the ballots were issued and voting began at 10:05. The members walked up to the podium in an orderly manner from the left and right, circled one person on the huge ballot, and put it into the ballot box. The order was very good. All voting was completed at 10:55. Chairman Wu officially announced a break, and the temporary secretariat prepared for counting the votes. The counting of votes began at 11:30. Lou Tongsun announced that Ni Wenya, the ballot collection supervisor, reported that 631 ballots were collected and 616 ballots were issued. Then, the ballot boxes were opened, and the votes were counted. Sun Ke took the lead all the way and finally won smoothly with an absolute majority of 558 votes.

### President Sun's Remarks: Hoping for the Participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] Sun Ke, who served as President of the Legislative Yuan for 16 years, was re-elected as the first President of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution on the 17th with the largest number of votes. This reporter recently visited Mr. Sun and asked him to express his feelings about being elected President of the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Sun said: "The Legislative Yuan was an institution that practiced democratic politics in the past, and it will follow this path in the future. Everything will be decided after discussion at the meeting." Mr. Sun's attitude and expression were very calm when he spoke. The reporter then asked him about his opinions on the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the Legislative Yuan and the future new cabinet. Mr. Sun said: "If we look at the politics of European and American countries, there are many examples of minority parties occupying a very small position in the group. The determination of political views is not determined by the number of people. Especially the number of Democratic and Youth Parties in the Legislative Yuan, even if we talk about the original negotiated number, is not a majority. Furthermore, if we increase it to 200 or 300, it is still not a majority when voting. But if one person participates, his opinion can still be expressed." Mr. Sun expressed his hope that the two parties can participate in the Legislative Yuan immediately. Finally, the reporter asked about the organization of the National Construction Society hosted by Mr. Sun. He said: "It is being actively prepared and will be formally established soon."

### Vice President Chen Expresses Pleasure About Being Elected

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] After Chen Lifu was elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, he spoke to the surrounding Chinese and foreign reporters in the auditorium at the end of the meeting. "I am very happy that I was elected with more than half of the votes in the election of the Vice President. I had no intention of running for Vice President in the past. Since the party has proposed it, I can only obey the party's decision. Some people have attacked me. For the sake of the party's unity, I am not willing to argue too much, because the party's unity is more important than voting, and the voting issue cannot affect unity." The reporter asked whether Mr. Wai Da was planning to go abroad after being elected Vice President. Mr. Chen replied: "Before I had a position, it was very free to go abroad or not. Now that I have been elected Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, I must first obtain the government's approval to go abroad." The reporter then asked if he had plans to go abroad before the election. Mr. Chen smiled and said: "I didn't even plan to run for election at first, so naturally I didn't plan to be elected or go abroad after being elected." After being elected, Mr. Chen went to the stage to shake hands with the temporary chairman Wu Tiecheng. Some legislators in the waiting area surrounded Mr. Chen and congratulated him. Mr. Chen also expressed his gratitude for the support of the legislators.

### Chairman and Wife Tour Taihu Lake; Enjoying the Beautiful Scenery and Appearing Very Content; Particularly Concerned About the Rising Prices in Wuxi

[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] The Chairman and his wife temporarily resided in the Liyuan Lakeside Villa in the suburbs on the evening of the 16th. They got up at dawn on the 17th and strolled through the gardens, enjoying the natural scenery. After a while, they had breakfast with their wife and read the Kyoto-Shanghai newspapers of the day. At 10:15, they took the "Pingxiang" yacht with their wife to cruise Taihu Lake. The minesweeper was towed by the "Xiangsheng" wheel, and the gunboat "Minghu" led the way in front. The attendants took another "Pingzong" steamboat and waited behind. The four ships were lined up in a row and slowly moved east. The weather was clear today and the lake was pleasant. After arriving at Hengyun Mountain, they abandoned the boat and climbed the mountain, walking very vigorously, straight to the Xuelang Temple and Jiangzi Pavilion on the top of the mountain. Jiangzi Pavilion is the study of Song Xiangxian Jiang Yimei. The Chairman lingered in front of the pavilion for a long time, appearing very content. The old farmer in charge of the pavilion offered fragrant tea. After gazing for a while, he changed to a rattan sedan chair and went down the mountain to return to the boat, and then wandered on the lake, enjoying the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains. He had lunch at Zhongdu Mountain Lake. At 2:40 pm, he returned to the Lakeside Villa. The nearby people heard that the Chairman had returned from a lake tour and gathered on the opposite bank across the river, wanting to see the Chairman and his wife's demeanor. The Chairman heard the report and ordered the boat to dock at the dock on the right side of the gate. He abandoned the boat and landed, nodding to the people on the opposite bank. Mrs. Chiang led the way, and the Chairman entered the gate of the Lakeside Villa to rest. The people on the opposite bank, feeling the Chairman's amiable expression, waited until late without dispersing. Last night, the Chairman and his wife lived in the Turtle Garden Lakeside Villa. Because the house was not connected to electricity in the urban area, it generated its own electricity, but the sound of the engine was disturbing and they could not sleep well. The Chairman felt that it was a pity that such a quiet and peaceful scenic area was disturbed by the noisy engine sound. He had ordered the local government to find a way to repair the circuit between the area and the urban area as soon as possible. Today, a small generator has been moved from Qitingyan, which can supply hundreds of lights. The sound of the engine is no longer disturbing. It is expected that the Chairman and his wife will be able to get a full rest tonight. Today is the late spring weather, and there is still a chill on the lake. When traveling, the Chairman wore a long robe and a black cloak, while his wife wore a western-style suit and trousers, a black spring coat, and a large straw hat woven with white grass. After visiting the scenic spots of Toutouzhu and Dushan, they returned at dusk at 8:00 pm. Also, when the Chairman went out at 5:00 pm, the Jiangsu Provincial Tenant Association sent many representatives to wait at the gate of the villa, wanting to petition the Chairman. Later, the representative Mao Fengming conveyed the intention to Deputy Adjutant Liu before leaving. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Xi at noon at 12:00 on the Qiantang ship this morning to meet with the Chairman. He resigned after a brief conversation. Tonight, the Chairman and his wife will still stay overnight in Wuxi and will return to the capital before the presidential inauguration ceremony on the 20th.

[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] After returning to Liyuan at 2:40 pm on the 17th, the Chairman received Wang Gong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, Xu Yuanruo, Magistrate of Wuxi County, Li Tiping, Speaker of the County Council, Peng, Chief of Staff of the Kyoto-Shanghai Garrison Command Wuxi Command Post, and the team leader of the 1st Gendarmerie Team during the break. The Chairman immediately inquired in detail about the situation of public security, agriculture, industry and commerce in Wuxi. At the same time, he was very concerned about the fact that the prices in Wuxi were even higher than those in Kyoto and Shanghai.

[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 17th] After arriving at Dushan at 5:50 pm, the Chairman and his wife walked up to Wan'an Chan Temple. Magistrate Xu followed. The Chairman turned his head from time to time and told him that the scenic area of Yingshan should be cultivated more, especially afforestation, and hoped that local gentry and wealthy households could donate money to launch this work. In addition, he revisited the trees that Ai Dan planted in the abbot of Chan Temple. Afterwards, he and his wife and attendants walked around the mountain for a week and returned by boat, boating on Taihu Lake. As the sun was setting in the west, the blue waves were like a mirror. The Chairman frequently held on to the railings and looked into the distance, showing his gentle and pleasant smile from time to time, appreciating the surrounding lake and mountain scenery until he returned in the evening. Also, when the Chairman went out at 5:00 pm, the Jiangsu Provincial Tenant Association sent many representatives to wait at the gate of the villa, wanting to petition the Chairman. Later, the representative Mao Fengming conveyed the intention to Deputy Adjutant Liu before leaving. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, arrived in Xi at noon at 12:00 on the Qiantang ship this morning to meet with the Chairman. He resigned after a brief conversation.

Editorial

### Stabilizing Commodity Prices Requires First Stabilizing Finance

Due to the sudden tightening of credit in the last four days of last week, commodity prices in the city have gradually fallen. Taking major commodities such as rice, oil, sugar, yarn, cloth, and soap as examples, except for the rice price which fell only slightly, the market price on the 15th was 10% to 20% lower than on the 11th. However, yesterday, the foreign exchange rate suddenly became restless, rising by 46%, with the US dollar at 474,000 yuan, a rise of 150,000 yuan; the British pound at 1,420,000 yuan, a rise of 450,000 yuan; and the Hong Kong dollar at 88,504 yuan, a rise of 28,007 yuan. Commodity prices have stabilized slightly, but finance has become unstable again. Therefore, regardless of whether commodity prices can continue to fall in the future, or how long this weak trend can last, if suppressing commodity prices relies solely on these sudden measures such as tightening credit and suppressing the securities market, without considering fundamental solutions such as restricting issuance, guiding floating capital, stabilizing foreign exchange, and supporting production, then we feel that it is not normal and not thorough enough.

The reason for this is very simple. After credit is tightened, if it can be held firmly without being released, so that the market can maintain a considerable state of stability, then under the condition of no (other) new factors, the rising trend of commodity prices may not reignite. If it is erratic, tight at times and loose at others, then the effectiveness of the temporary tightening may not be fully effective.

Although the restrictions on domestic remittances and cash transport have not been relaxed, the amount of floating capital flowing into Shanghai from various places through private smuggling and material movement is still quite considerable. Since the Northeast circulating currency was allowed to circulate, the banditry in North China and Central China has intensified, and the price increases in South China, due to excessive currency in circulation, have even exceeded Shanghai, resulting in a reverse flow of funds. Under this situation, even if the recovered legal currency is not released again and no new legal currency is issued, the credit in this city may not be able to remain tight for long; moreover, this minimum hope may not be realized in fact.

The most important condition for the development of industry and commerce is stability, and financial stability is particularly the pivot for promoting development. Because if financing, interest rates, and exchange rates change (missing character) frequently and unpredictably, then all initial gains and losses will be impossible to calculate, and one will only be running around trying to cope with daily difficulties, and there will naturally be no talk of development. If handled improperly and turnover is inflexible, then a single spark can start a prairie fire, and there is even the possibility of causing major or minor storms. Therefore, the sole function of the financial authorities lies in quietly observing the situation in advance, appropriately adjusting surpluses and deficits, in order to seek stability in the market. There is absolutely no reason to go against this, deliberately causing fluctuations in the financial market or even creating unrest.

The so-called tightening of credit is intended to suppress commodity prices, and it can also be said to be striving for stability. However, before the rise, there was no learning from the past to gradually contract as a precautionary measure, but only afterwards, rushing to make amends, implementing sudden attacks, making many industrialists and merchants caught off guard, all falling into a very difficult situation. Is this (missing character) a legitimate way to protect industry and commerce? Moreover, this kind of method has been tried repeatedly before, and it has not been able to stabilize commodity prices effectively. The issuance of short-term treasury bills was originally said to be an effective way to absorb floating capital and suppress commodity prices, but it was not used fully after assessing the situation, and it still relied on this sudden method to inflict a painful blow after the rising trend became unusually fierce; although this is indeed a gratifying move in combating speculation and (missing character) hoarding, the price is too high in the overall economic picture.

Of course, we are not trying to defend the unscrupulous merchants who stir up trouble and raise prices, but we also do not want to see legitimate industry and commerce repeatedly enduring artificial pain under this kind of blitzkrieg approach, thereby deepening their crisis. In other words, suppressing commodity prices is the heart of the people, and tightening credit is also (missing character) reasonable. However, the abundance of floating capital has been around for a long time, and it is not a sudden acute illness, nor can it be cured by temporary (missing character) measures. If the authorities are truly considering earning floating capital and suppressing commodity prices, they should set a course and work continuously from multiple directions; after the rising trend has begun, they should not stand by and let it surge endlessly, and in relatively moderate periods, they should also remove the fuel from under the cauldron and treat both the symptoms and the root causes, in order to avoid accumulation and flooding, making it impossible to control once it breaks out.

After a big rise, there will inevitably be a small correction. The rising trend has subsided slightly in the past few days, and those who tighten credit may be complacent, thinking that they have achieved immediate success. However, we believe that the general legitimate industrialists and merchants are bearing too heavy a burden, and judging from the precedents of the past few times, the so-called (missing character)-style tightening of credit has limited effectiveness. Therefore, we hope that they will go further and take sustained and planned measures, so as not to allow the rising trend and the blitzkrieg to recur, (missing character) the vitality of the industrial and commercial sector.

Now, actual sales still (missing character) move slowly, and in many (missing character) in the interior, commodity prices are still behind those in this city. In this city, many wholesale merchants are also far behind the factory prices, which proves that the recent May rising trend is indeed causally related to the loose credit. Therefore, stabilizing finance should be a major prerequisite for stabilizing commodity prices. However, a short-term, occasional, and sudden tightening is more of a disturbance than a real stabilization, not to mention the stimulus of another rise in the foreign exchange rate when commodity prices have slightly subsided and become relatively stable.

Haining

[Our Newspaper] According to the regulations of the Cocoon Collection Coordination Association and the Senate this spring, cooperative cocoon drying centers are only allowed to purchase cocoons from members. Non-member cocoons should be sold to cocoon trading companies established by silk merchants, taking into account both parties' interests, which is quite fair. There are two cocoon trading companies in Xieqiao Town, this county. Minsheng Xingji in the eastern market belongs to the cooperative cocoon drying center. Jinglun in the western market has signed a contract with Fuhua Company to collect cocoons. Unexpectedly, in this assessment, both trading companies were assigned to the cooperative cocoon drying center. The company had no choice but to terminate the contract and give up. When silkworm farmers heard about this, public sentiment was in an uproar. The Xieqiao area is vast and rich in silk production. If all cocoon trading companies in the town are monopolized by the cooperative cocoon drying center, it would not only have the suspicion of manipulation, but also the number of cocoons produced by non-member silkworm farmers in this vast area is several times more than that produced by members. With no way to sell their cocoons, they are very indignant. It is reported that local gentry and township chiefs have jointly petitioned the competent authorities to assign Jinglun back to the silk factory to collect cocoons, so that large-scale production can have an outlet, and to prevent high-quality silkworm cocoons from flowing into native silk, which violates the government's overall plan to improve silk. It is hoped that the主管者 will consider the facts, adopt public opinion, and avoid causing major disputes.

### The Throne of the North China Cement Industry

— Our Newspaper Reporter Li Shaolin

Recent Appearance of the Qixin Cement Company's Tangshan Factory

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin Air Mail] Recently, I had the opportunity to go to Tangshan and was able to visit the Qixin Cement Company's Tangshan factory, the largest cement industry in North China. This large-scale cement industry, which employs more than 3,000 workers, currently produces 500 tons per day, and the maximum production can reach 1,000 tons. The war has hindered construction, and cement has no use. There is no large sales market in North China. Although there is considerable demand in South China, there are insurmountable transportation difficulties. Various factors have caused a reduction in the production of this basic construction industry. This phenomenon is now widely reflected in light and heavy industries across the country and is an unparalleled tragedy. The people in charge of Qixin, like the directors of other industries, urgently call for stability. At the Qixin factory, there are now more than 20,000 tons of finished cement and more than 100,000 tons of clinker that has been fired and is waiting to be ground, with a total value of more than 1.2 trillion yuan at current prices. The accumulation of such a large amount of finished product is constantly increasing the difficulty of capital turnover. Recently, they have been working hard to expand the

Southeast Asian Market

hoping to find a way out.

The appearance of the cement industry in Tangshan dates back to the 15th year of Guangxu's reign. At that time, Tang Jingxing, a Cantonese, first established the Cement Factory in the area. The equipment was simple, and the technology was poor. What was especially unbelievable was that the limestone needed to make cement was transported from Guangdong. Due to high costs and poor sales, the Cement Factory closed in the 19th year of Guangxu's reign. In the 26th year of Guangxu's reign, Zhou Zhide reopened the factory and hired the German, Kunde, as the engineer. Kunde discovered that the stone mountain near the factory was entirely cement raw material, limestone. However, the factory encountered the Boxer Rebellion shortly after its opening and was suspended again. After the rebellion, the restoration continued, and in the 32nd year of Guangxu's reign, it was formally registered as the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company. In the 33rd year of Guangxu's reign, it was renamed Qixin Cement Co., Ltd. and has remained so until now. The stone mountain discovered by Kunde has been constantly excavated for decades. The stone mountain has been excavated from top to bottom into a chasm, and it is still the source of Qixin Cement.

The main raw material for making cement is limestone. It is also necessary to add red soil, yellow sand, and iron ore. Their composition must be tested and appropriately proportioned.

The manufacturing process

is not very complicated. The first step is to mix limestone, red soil or yellow sand, and iron ore and grind them. The next step is to send them to a kiln with a temperature of 1,400 degrees Celsius for heating. The final step is to mix the fired clinker with an appropriate amount of gypsum (30% to 35%), then add water and grind it into powder at a temperature below 100 degrees Celsius, which becomes widely used cement. In this industry, the technology is entirely controlled by chemical composition, and gypsum is a large consumption item. Every 500 tons of cement requires about 175 tons of gypsum. Before the war, most of the gypsum used by Qixin was purchased from Taicheng. Later, it was also purchased from Gucheng, Hubei. Now that transportation is blocked, domestic purchases cannot be made in large quantities and are almost entirely dependent on foreign countries. Qixin's raw materials and fuel supply have

great advantages.

With its own coal mine, there is never a problem with fuel. As for the main raw material, limestone, the production area is less than one mile from the factory. There is a small railway with a gauge of 18 inches running directly from the stone mountain to the factory. It is built entirely using the slope of the mountain. Empty trucks are pulled by mules and horses on the way to the mountain. Returning trucks carrying raw materials into the factory do not require any power. The first step in the factory's equipment is a powerful steel mill, which grinds the raw materials into fine powder. Next, they enter the mixing plant for blending and are then sent to a rotary kiln for heating. In the 1,400-degree rotary kiln, they are heated for 40 minutes to become gray clinker. The clinker is mixed with gypsum and then ground in a steel mill to become the finished cement. From stone grinding to finished product storage, it is a complete set of continuous equipment. The rotary kiln is the most important piece of equipment. Coal powder burns in the center, and stone powder moves around the outside for baking. The time taken from entry to exit is exactly the time required for baking. Qixin now has eight rotary kilns. The largest one produces 250 tons per day and is made in the United States. The smallest one produces 80 tons per day and was self-built by Qixin's repair shop.

In addition to Qixin, the cement industry in North China also includes the North China Cement Company and the Taiyuan Northwest Cement Company. There are also factories in Northeast China. Now, the products of the Northwest Company cannot be exported. The North China Cement Company and the Northeast factory have stopped operating under the threat of artillery fire. Only Qixin can maintain

continuous production

and is now struggling in hardship. The prosperity of the past is like a dream. Qingdao Wharf, the Jinpu Railway Yellow River Bridge, the Huai River Bridge, the Guangzhou Haizhu Bridge, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Nanjing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and the Central Stadium were all built with Qixin cement before the war. Today, it is difficult to smell the atmosphere of large-scale construction. This oldest and largest national industry is facing the danger of paralysis.

During the wartime rear, due to the lack of cement, a cement factory using gray soil instead of cement was established in Sichuan. At that time, the output was 100 barrels per day, which was regarded as a treasure. Today, this massive cement industry is being ridiculed by the turmoil of war. Is this not an irony to the nation?

### The Japanese Government Formally Announces a Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan; Increase Production to Reach Pre-War Levels; Kratt Advocates Supporting Japan so it Can Be Self-Sufficient

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: Kratt stated on the 17th in a speech to the World Association that if the United States does not indefinitely aid Japan, then it should endorse Japan's economic recovery plan to enable Japan to achieve self-sufficiency. Kratt demanded an immediate resolution of the reparations issue and an increase in Japanese exports to at least 1.4 billion yuan annually to pay for food and raw materials. He stated that otherwise, the United States must pay 400 million yuan annually to cover the occupation and supply the Japanese with food. Kratt also said that if the Far East is to prosper, the hatred and animosity caused by Japan's brutal war must be gradually abandoned. In Europe, the idea of forgiving former enemies is gradually gaining ground, and western Germany has been regarded by the countries participating in the European Recovery Plan as an integral part that should not be ignored. Kratt strongly argued that the reparations issue must be resolved quickly so that the Japanese can have something to follow.

[Reuters News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese government has just announced a five-year plan for economic recovery drafted by the Economic Stabilization Board, which aims to restore Japan's economy to pre-war levels by 1952. The plan emphasizes that Japan's economic recovery depends on the assistance of foreign capital. The current inflation will be reduced during the first half of the five-year plan without threatening economic stability. It further recognizes that Japan's current crisis is deep-rooted and not merely a superficial phenomenon. The plan's goals for stabilizing the economy are: (1) to provide the people with a reasonable standard of living, without worrying about the shortage of daily necessities; (2) Japan's exports are sufficient to cover its imports; and (3) the efficiency and productivity of labor are significantly improved. The plan also estimates that Japan's population will reach approximately 83 million by 1952. The plan also states that the factors limiting Japan's economic recovery are: (1) the supply of fuel and electricity; (2) the import of raw materials; and (3) the lack of transportation tools.

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Japanese government this morning released a draft of a five-year plan carefully formulated by officials of the Economic Stabilization Board over the past nine months. The main purpose of this plan is to restore Japanese industry to pre-war levels and the standard of living to 1934 levels. According to this plan, it is expected that exports will increase nine times by 1952, mining and manufacturing production will increase three times, and labor productivity and national income will double. Compared to the levels of the 1930-34 period, the mining and manufacturing figures will increase to 130% instead of 100%. In other words, coal production will reach 44 million tons instead of 31 million tons, group steel will be 3.14 million tons instead of 2,722,200 tons, ordinary steel will be 2.3 million tons instead of 2,195,000 tons, and cotton yarn value will be 990 million U.S. dollars instead of 1,157 million U.S. dollars. Annual exports will reach US$1,646 million, and annual imports will also reach the same figure as imports. Regarding the standard of living, the estimated food consumption unit will reach 2,111 calories per day, calculated in calories, while the pre-war figure was 2,242 calories. The main form of this five-year plan focuses on the entry of foreign capital. According to well-informed sources, the initial draft of this plan intended to import 1.6 billion U.S. dollars from the United States, but the occupation forces ordered that this huge figure should not be mentioned in the plan for fear that American public opinion would have an unfavorable reaction to it.

### US Policy Toward the Soviet Union Aims for a Balance of Power in Europe

[United Press, Washington, 16th] According to authoritative sources, the United States will continue to keep the "Open Door" that was closed to the Soviet Union last week closed until Europe restores its balance of power. The current period of excitement has passed, and US-Soviet "peace" talks have also disappeared. The following factors will become the focus of attention:

(1) The United States does not currently intend to engage in any negotiations with the Soviet Union to end the "Cold War," nor does it intend to do so for some time. (2) A balance of power in Europe cannot be restored until Western Europe is economically and politically stable, and economic and political stability requires the long-term implementation of the Marshall Plan. (3) Any negotiations with the Soviet Union at this time would only reveal that the Soviet Union holds the most power, and this is a sign of the dominance of power politics. (4) The Western powers have currently abandoned the hope of establishing a world governing body based on the principle of collective security and are eager to restore what they call a "balance of power," which in reality means the dominance of Western forces.

### French President Discusses the International Situation, Emphasizing Peace, Not Empty Words

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] French President Auriol delivered a speech today at the wine festival in Mâcon, Burgundy, calling on responsible politicians to hold frank talks to stop discussions on procedures. Cunning diplomatic notes and backstabbing, he said, have not benefited anyone's reputation or power and are particularly detrimental to peace. The sincerity of words must be measured by actions, and the best way to test the loyalty of a partner is to pay attention to whether their words and actions are consistent. Declarations of peace without concrete proposals have made people feel tired, and the terror of force continues to exist. All actions seem to be approaching the terrible danger of war. Now is the time to restore the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. Auriol, referring to the recent exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union on the situation, expressed the hope that this opportunity would prove the joy felt by the people. Referring to the Western Alliance, he said that this is a major step in establishing an orderly, free, prosperous, and secure small island. Referring to the German issue, he believes that Germany must be incorporated into a European federation on a federal basis, and the heavy industry in the Ruhr area must be jointly controlled by the countries concerned for reasonable compensation and the reconstruction of Europe.

### Wallace's Suggestions Welcomed by Soviet Newspapers

[Reuters, [City Unknown] 16th] As Soviet newspapers discuss US-Soviet relations, they welcome several suggestions made by US Third Party presidential candidate Wallace in his open letter to Stalin last week, considering Wallace's suggestions to be practical and appropriate, showing his sincerity in seeking ways to resolve differences between the two countries. The Soviet newspapers expressed approval of several points suggested by Wallace, including general disarmament, banning weapons with group destructive power, banning any country from exporting weapons to any other country, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, abandonment of military bases in other countries, withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, non-interference in China's internal affairs, increased trade, development of cultural relations, and establishment of international relief organizations. [Newspaper Name]'s commentary quoted Stalin's recent statement, "The Soviet Union and the United States can certainly cooperate with each other. If these two systems can cooperate during wartime, why can't they cooperate during peacetime?" Recently, peace remarks made by representatives of the US government have taken a pessimistic tone when assessing the international situation, thus creating a sense of war among the American people, and the international situation is deteriorating. Wallace has made other suggestions, asking the United States to restore Roosevelt's policies, and his strength comes from this. Experience shows that during the Roosevelt era, the differences between the anti-Hitler powers could be easily resolved. Wallace's concrete suggestions do not contradict the official statements of the US and Soviet government representatives, but the actions of the US government representatives repeatedly deviate from their words. The so-called resolute diplomacy of US diplomats and the so-called Cold War of newspapers are intended to force the Soviet Union to accept the United States' views on all issues. In fact, these methods cannot have any results. However, we cannot agree with Wallace's statement that the publication of the Smith-Molotov exchange of letters is a major blow to the propagandists on both the US and Soviet sides who believe that the US and the Soviet Union cannot coexist peacefully, because there have never been and will never be such propagandists in the Soviet Union.

British Foreign Minister Bevin Signs Western European Economic Cooperation Agreement

### US Anti-Communist Bill Expected to Pass the House

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Congressman Nixon, one of the drafters of the bill to ban the US Communist Party, predicted on the 17th that the House of Representatives will pass the bill with an overwhelming majority to strictly restrict the activities of the US Communist Party. Nixon also stated that Dulles, a senior Republican foreign policy advisor, and three well-known figures have endorsed the bill, and their assistance can ensure the smooth passage of the anti-communist bill in the House of Representatives, possibly on the 18th. The bill requires the US Communist Party and its affiliates to register with the Department of Justice, and if the party does not sever ties with Moscow, its officials will be subject to heavy fines or imprisonment.

### Hope Major Powers Cooperate Sincerely to Eliminate the Crisis of War; British Secretary of War Issues an Appeal at the Labour Party Annual Conference

[United Press, Scarborough, Yorkshire, 17th] The National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party held its annual conference here today, attended by more than 1,100 delegates, which is said to be the largest gathering in history. Prime Minister Attlee, Morrison, and other leaders were present. Secretary of War Shinwell, in his capacity as national chairman, delivered a speech stating that although all countries are tired of war, a new war may come. "The current suspicions and misunderstandings are multifaceted, and we must eliminate this crisis in time."

Shinwell said that it is unfortunate to hear people talk about another world war in three years. "We should declare clearly to people at home and abroad that we, as part of the labor and social movement, do not want another war. However, goodwill is not one-sided. We hope that others, that is, the veteran allies of wartime, can cooperate closely on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance." He refuted the argument that US aid would turn Europe into a slave of the United States. He said that in terms of domestic policy: (1) We cannot return to unlimited free enterprise. (2) The Labour Party does not intend to form an emergency coalition cabinet with the Conservative Party, because "We do not want to be the advisors of the Conservative Party and please the reactionaries who oppose socialism." (3) Industrial equipment should be completely reformed to improve quality and increase production. (4) The Labour Party cannot tolerate misconduct by its members, because the future of the British people and even the world is in the hands of the Labour Party.

### Stabilizing Public Utility Prices; the National Economic Council Sets Five Other Measures; the Suggestions Made by the City Council in its Reply Have Not Been Adopted

In order to fix public utility prices, the City Council previously sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan based on the opinions drafted by its special committee, requesting that the formula for calculating public utility prices be suspended from May onwards and that the subsidy system be restored. If the subsidy system cannot be restored, then the foreign exchange required for public utilities should be allowed to be settled three months in advance, and the allocation of coal at parity prices should be restored. It is now learned that after the Executive Yuan issued this case to the National Economic Council to convene representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Resources Commission, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, for joint discussion, five other remedial measures have been drafted and telegraphed to the Executive Yuan for approval. The City Council received a reply from the National Economic Council yesterday, and the five measures it drafted are as follows:

(1) Since the implementation of the public utility price calculation formula this year, it has been able to keep the prices of various public utilities on a reasonable track and increase moderately. If some base numbers in the calculation formula need to be drafted due to changes in circumstances, the local government should formulate opinions based on the actual situation and send them to the competent authority for research. If the base numbers of some public utilities are too high due to inaccurate accounting, the local government should strictly review the privately-run public utilities. Local councils can provide opinions for reference, and finally submit them to the central competent authority for approval. The state-owned or publicly-run public utilities shall be strictly reviewed by the organizers and submitted to the central competent authority for approval.

### Adjusting Exchange Rates to Adapt to Export Industry Needs: Stabilization Board Raises Exchange Rates Yesterday. U.S. Dollar Raised by 150,000 Yuan, British Pound Raised by 450,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper] The Exchange Equalization Fund adjusted the listed foreign exchange rates yesterday morning. The base rates for foreign exchange quotations by designated banks are as follows: (1) Incentive rate of 474,000 yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan; (2) British pound at 1,422,000 yuan, an increase of 450,000 yuan; (3) Indian rupee at 106,464.84 yuan, an increase of 33,691.40 yuan; (4) Hong Kong dollar at 85,504.69 yuan, an increase of 28,007.81 yuan. Service fees for designated banks have also been adjusted, with the U.S. dollar raised to 6,000 yuan and the British pound to 20,000 yuan.

According to inquiries with relevant parties: This adjustment of foreign exchange quotation is entirely to adapt to the needs of exports. However, the amount of the adjustment is far less than generally expected. Furthermore, although the market for aircraft and daily necessities was stimulated after the foreign exchange rate was raised yesterday, it remained very stable due to tight credit.

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the relationship between exchange rates and commodity prices, the reporter made a special visit to the responsible authorities yesterday. It was stated that the determination of exchange rates is decided by representatives from designated banks and members of the Stabilization Board who meet every morning at 9:00 AM for discussion, and the designated banks are notified by telephone before 9:30 AM. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible for outside rumors to know in advance.

The standard for adjusting exchange rates is, in principle, based on commodity prices. However, due to common misunderstandings about the relationship between foreign exchange quotations and commodity prices, believing that exchange rates have a stimulating effect, quotations often cannot be fully adjusted. From August 19th of last year to the present, Shanghai commodity prices have risen tenfold, while foreign exchange quotations have only risen sevenfold. As for the black market exchange rate, it has risen fifteenfold, so the Board's exchange rate lags behind general commodity prices. Therefore, the adjustment of quotations, as long as it does not exceed the black market exchange rate, cannot affect the sales of imported goods. Similarly, although exports are settled at the official rate, export commodity prices also exceed the official rate due to government purchases and export proceeds. The relationship between general domestic commodity prices and official exchange rates is very minor. Therefore, the adjustment of quotations, as long as it does not exceed general commodity prices and the black market exchange rate, will not have the effect of raising commodity prices.

### Credit Tightness Persists: Yarn and Cloth Struggle to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market initially opened with a boost from the higher U.S. dollar exchange rate, and sentiment was once encouraged. Furthermore, due to a significant drop at the end of last week, some outside traders seized the opportunity to buy at low prices. However, due to continued credit tightness and frequent allocations from spinning and construction companies, it lacked the strength to rise. After opening, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was sold off at higher prices due to tight positions among traders, falling to 285 million yuan. Towards the close, positions were covered, showing a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 292 million yuan, continuing to fall by 10 million yuan compared to the weekend. Water Moon and Jincheng also declined by 9 million to 10 million yuan. 40-count various brands also fell by 5 to 6.7 million yuan. Arbitrage transactions for 21-count Double Horse yarn were active, with retail investors pushing up the price, rebounding by 10 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns, such as 32-count and 2/16-count, rose by varying degrees of 3 to 5 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, although the foreign exchange rate was raised, the spinning and construction companies temporarily announced the opening of sales, and the credit tightness continued, and the market atmosphere was unable to rise. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened at 5.88 million yuan, and there were transactions at 5.85 million yuan. Benefiting from the foreign exchange rate, various parties scrambled to buy, and the market surged to 6.18 million yuan. Amidst the chaos, the Hankou merchants sold at higher prices, while the Shanxi merchants bought more. Dye factories had little activity, and brokers had mixed attitudes. At the close, it fell back to 5.95 million yuan, a further decrease of 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend. Finally, many retail investors cut losses, and the price even fell to 5.85 million yuan. Other fine cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and jiji cloth also declined by varying degrees of over 100,000 yuan.

Further news: The spinning and construction companies announced at 10:30 AM that they would specially allocate 35 types of cloth. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 5.94 million yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuan serge was 5.83 million yuan, Lei Feng Pagoda Yuan straight tribute was 6.3 million yuan, Jumping Fish Essence Yuan poplin was 6.2 million yuan, and Ding Ru Yi bleached cloth was 6.9 million yuan.

### The Deadline for Government Purchase of Vehicles and Tires with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange is Extended by One Month.

Regarding the handling of goods with self-provided foreign exchange but without licenses by the Central Trust of China, four items, namely, Western medicine under tariff code 481, trucks under 256A, jeeps under 256B, and tires under 644D, are subject to government purchase. According to the original plan approved by the Executive Yuan, importers should, within one month from the date of purchase acceptance, await government purchase and are not allowed to freely transport and sell the goods. In addition to being announced, it should also be specified in the priority purchase agreement signed with the original importer, and the Ministry of National Defense should be notified to designate representatives to negotiate the purchase directly with the original importer. As the time required for importers to complete customs declaration and cargo retrieval procedures often exceeds the one-month deadline after purchasing these goods, and the Ministry of National Defense must determine whether they are needed only after the goods are presented and the quality is verified, it is practically impossible to negotiate the purchase within the original deadline. It is now reported that representatives from the Ministry of National Defense have requested that the deadline be extended to meet the actual needs, that is, awaiting government purchase within two months from the date of purchase acceptance.

As the Philippines Black and White basketball team did not participate in the National Games, the team leader Sun Yifa decided to arrange several matches with local teams for observation and liaison purposes, after negotiating with this local basketball association. The first match will be against the Tianjin District World Games preliminary team at the Gymnasium at 7:30 PM tonight. There will be a women's basketball game between the Yunnan Water Quality Team and the Frontline before that. Tickets are 100,000 yuan for upstairs seats, 200,000 yuan for downstairs seats, and 400,000 yuan for reserved seats. Sales will start at 3 PM, and the Siwei Boy Scouts will be on site to maintain order.

Also, the Basketball Referees Association announced that the referees have been assigned but have not been notified. They are requested to report to the venue on time after seeing the newspaper. The service order is as follows:

Water (Women) — Frontline 6:30 PM

Wu Zibin Yu Ju

Black and White — Tianjin (Men) 7:30 PM Liu Hesheng Jin Botao

It should be noted that the Black and White team is a strong team from the Philippines. When they came to Shanghai for the first time two years ago, their performance was affected by the cold weather. They will be returning with renewed vigor this time and are sure to impress the fans. Players such as Xia Huituo, Chuan Yongxin, Ye Kexi, and Zhuang Yulan are all top-notch players in the Philippines. Their fighting strength is no less than that of Chuan Jinsheng. Although Tianjin lost for the first time yesterday, they were able to match Dagong in the first half, proving that they are not weak either. Their fast tactics are very popular with the audience. Their meeting with the Philippine players tonight is sure to be a wonderful performance.

Before the game, there will be a women's friendly match between the local Shanghai Frontline and the Yunnan Water Quality Team. The visiting team has come from afar but was not able to represent their province at the National Games, which they deeply regret. Therefore, they have decided to compete with the Shanghai women's team. They have previously played twice against Hubei and Nanjing in the National Games, winning both times, proving that they are not to be underestimated. The Frontline is a rising team in Shanghai, with good players such as National Games representatives Wang Wuhua and Zhu Min, and are the iron army among the Shanghai women's teams along with Yu Ying and Jin Zhong. They are sure to give a good performance against the visiting team, and it is difficult to predict who will win.

### National Games News: Can Circle the Earth Several Times in One Second, Few People Broadcast at the Venue, Millions Listen Quietly

[Special Report by This Newspaper] "Huang Wanzhen breaks the national record! ... Both the Malaysian and Guangzhou teams break the national record in the 200-meter relay..." The tense situation of the swimming competition is transmitted from the radio.

A few days ago, after Zhang Lilang, a famous sprinter from Taiwan, won first place in the 200-meter race, his voice came from the radio: "The result of the 200-meter race is that I came in first, very happy." However, these words were what the track and field instructor from Taiwan told him to say. He ran well, but was panting and didn't know what to say. The reporter happened to be by his side, so he knew this "inside story".

When you enter the National Games track and field stadium, you see two white pavilions erected on both sides of the west command platform, with the words "Shanghai Radio Station" and XORA painted on them. This is the hub for broadcasting sports news.

Large-scale broadcasting of sports news in China is still a pioneering effort. At the same time, not only can radio listeners in the Shanghai area listen, but it is also rebroadcast by radio stations across the country affiliated with the Central Broadcasting Corporation.

On the track and field or by the swimming pool, holding a microphone in his hand and walking around is the actor Chen Shu. Next to him is a worker carrying a box with an antenna inserted in it. This is the ultra-shortwave transmitter.

Mr. Chen Shu reports the situation he sees at the time, which is transmitted by ultra-shortwave to the telecommunications station next to the west command platform, and then sent to the Shanghai Radio Station on Daxilu Road via telephone line to be broadcast to radio listeners.

It sounds like the steps are complicated, but in fact, after the reporter comes out, you can almost immediately hear it on the radio. Because the speed of radio waves cannot be measured by ordinary standards, it can circle the earth several times in one second.

In addition to the telephone line, the telecommunications station is also equipped with a newly imported F.M. ultra-shortwave directional transmitter, which transmits a sound that will never change and will not be disturbed by noise.

This National Games broadcast is co-organized by the National Games Advertising Committee and the Shanghai Radio Station. The National Games Advertising Committee initially invited many movie stars and actors to participate in the broadcast, but due to interest and time constraints, only Chen Shu participated. The remaining reporters were all appointed by the Shanghai Radio Station itself.

The reporting work is intense, and cannot be stopped for even a second. Chen Shu rushed to the finish line of the 400-meter hurdles, and then to the javelin throwing field, going everywhere to report the situation of the competition at the time.

Whether it is the track and field stadium, the basketball court, or the swimming pool, there are reporters active there, constantly reporting the competition situation, broadcasting on 900KC and 1290KC respectively.

This kind of broadcasting work is hard, but these broadcasters are taking this opportunity to learn and open up a new path for the Chinese broadcasting industry.

### A School of "Father Education, Mother Industry": A Recent View of Nantong College

— Our Reporter Ling Songshou

For forty years, Nantong College has cultivated a large number of practical talents for China. It started from humble beginnings and has endured countless hardships. Even now, it is still in an environment full of thorns. It is dedicated to nurturing a powerful second generation for the construction of a new China and stands high on the educational pedestal of northern Jiangsu, becoming a tractor on this fertile land waiting to be developed.

Mr. Zhang Jian shouted the slogan "Father Education, Mother Industry." When his industrial foundation became stable at the end of the Guangxu reign, he successively founded three specialties: agriculture, medicine, and textiles, under his principle of "Industry is the foundation of education; education is the means to store talent for industry," forming the prototype of today's Nantong College.

Nantong College inherits the consistent tradition of decades, and it is still divided into three departments: textile, agriculture, and medicine. The separation and combination, the creation and expansion of these three departments have a page of hard struggle history.

The Department of Agriculture, founded in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, is the oldest of the three departments. Initially, it was called the Normal School of Agriculture and was part of the Tongzhou Normal School. In the first year of Xuantong, a sericulture department was added, and in the second year, it was changed to a two-level agricultural school of primary and secondary levels. The change to a university was in the eighth year of the Republic of China. In the seventeenth year, it was officially merged into Nantong College. The Department of Medicine was founded in the first year of the Republic of China, nominally as a medical specialty school. Later, the Nantong Hospital, the Obstetrics Training Center, the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Midwifery Nursing Training Class were added one after another. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Medical University. The following year, it was merged into Nantong College. Among all the departments of Nantong College, the Department of Textile is the most worthy of pride. Its predecessor, the "Textile Dyeing Training Institute," was the first textile school established in China. Through the painstaking efforts of the founder and successive administrators over the decades, the Textile Department of Nantong College has become a school in the Far East with complete equipment and excellent achievements. More than 800 students who have graduated in the past 29 sessions are all powerful cadres in the Chinese textile industry. After the victory, the China Textile Corporation, established by the government with millions of spindles seized from the enemy and puppets, had more than half of its engineering personnel from the Textile Department of Nantong College. The "Textile Dyeing Training Institute" was established in the first year of the Republic of China. By the second year, it had its own fixed school building and was renamed the Textile Specialty School. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Textile University at the same time as the Medical Department and merged into Nantong College in the following year after the renaming.

After infinite twists and turns, the three departments of textile, medicine, and agriculture were finally merged into a concrete institution of higher learning under the same name in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. However, due to various reasons, true unified management began when Mr. Yi Yitong took over as president of the college in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China.

The reorganization came to an end. Nantong College was beginning to move towards a new path. In the twenty-sixth year, the war suddenly broke out. Nantong was close to the war zone and had to suspend classes temporarily. A year later, it moved to Shanghai to resume classes. The Department of Medicine withdrew westward with the army to Hunan and merged with the Jiangsu Medical Administration College to form the Jiangsu Medical College. The Department of Medicine of Nantong College was interrupted during the War of Resistance.

Victory Returns, Rebuilding the University

After the victory, in the autumn of the thirty-fifth year, the work of restoring the school began. On the one hand, the Ministry of Education was requested to restore the Department of Medicine, and on the other hand, the two departments of textile and agriculture, which had been struggling in Shanghai for eight years, were reorganized. During this period, of course, many hardships were experienced.

The original site of Nantong College, after more than eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, suffered a lot of damage to the school buildings and equipment. However, after more than a year of intentional management by the school authorities, it has gradually returned to its former scale. When you pass Qixiu Road in the south of Nantong City and see the four buildings arranged on the east, west, north, and south sides, and the sound of reading aloud, you will surely realize how beautiful the future of Nantong College will be.

The existing three departments of Nantong College are divided into six departments: agronomy, agrochemical, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, agricultural economics (Department of Agriculture), textile engineering, and dyeing and chemical engineering (Department of Textile). The Department of Medicine is temporarily not divided into departments. There are more than 850 students in total. Most of the professors are alumni of the college. The teaching addresses for the third and fourth grades of the three departments of textile, dyeing and chemical engineering, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine are in Shanghai; the first and second grades of the two departments of textile in Tangjia Town in the south of Nantong City, and the rest are at the main campus in Nantong. The plan to move all of them to Nantong and concentrate on teaching has always been in the plan of the Nantong College authorities. However, in order to accommodate the professors, the senior grades of the three departments of dyeing and chemical engineering, textile, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine have to stay in Shanghai. As for the Department of Textile in Tangjia Town, it is purely because it is close to the Dasheng Yarn Factory. If we talk about moving back to Nantong, we will have to purchase textile machinery for students to practice, which is impossible in the current economic situation of the school.

Current Difficulties, Raising Funds

The current difficulty of Nantong College is the economic problem. The prescribed tuition fee is less than that of general private schools in Shanghai. Therefore, the tuition income for one semester is only enough to cover two months of expenses. The remaining four months of expenses must be supported by the board of directors—that is, the Dasheng Yarn Factory. Based on Mr. Zhang Jian's ideal of "Industry is the foundation of education," this was originally the original intention of Mr. Zhang Jian's management of industry. However, if the school relies solely on industry, the prosperity or decline of the school will easily change with the rise and fall of industry. When the current economy is on the verge of collapse and the industrial world is filled with depression, Nantong College should have a self-sufficient plan.

It was mentioned earlier that the three departments of agriculture, medicine, and textile were merged into Nantong College in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. In fact, the original plan of Nantong College was to be renamed Nantong University. Later, the Ministry of Education approved the registration under the name of Nantong College in the nineteenth year because the departments were not yet complete. For the past twenty years, every teacher and student of Nantong College has been thinking about this issue. After the restoration, the school began to surge again with the frenzy of this change to a university. Of course, after the change to a university, many places will gain a lot of convenience. However, at the beginning of the restoration, under the conditions of all aspects, it is indeed difficult to add departments.

In fact, whether to change to a university or not is a matter of form. Today, Nantong College's responsibility and mission to cultivate the next generation of talents and strive for the construction of a new China are no less than those of any university in the country. The area where Nantong College is located is the Yangtze River Delta. In the middle of this area, there are millions of acres of arable land that are still stagnant in the era of manual cultivation and need to be improved; there are hundreds of miles of coastal areas that are still barren land and need to be propagated. It is also a most standard cotton-producing area, and once the coastal area is developed, the increase in cotton production is an inevitable fact, so in terms of textiles, it is also the most ideal research object.

Focus Education, Store Talent for National Construction

Mr. Zhang Jian's ideal of founding Nantong College is to hope that education and industry will be coordinated, with the development of the rich resources of northern Jiangsu as the focus. Nantong College, especially the Department of Textile, has had a glorious history. In the future process of national construction, Nantong College will certainly take the establishment of an academic center in the northern Jiangsu region as its highest goal. This is in line with the current government's two policies of university decentralization and focus education.

The war is not over, and national construction is difficult. The countryside is depressed, and China needs agricultural talents. The textile industry is immature, and everything has just started. China needs textile talents. President Zhang Yuanyang said: "Nantong College has the creative spirit and excellent tradition of the founder in the innate, and looking forward to the future, there is a major mission in the cause." These few words are exactly where the spirit of thousands of students in Nantong College today is placed.

### Burke on Democracy

— Liren

The National Assembly has closed, and the President and Vice President have also been elected. Regardless of how the commentators feel about the first assembly, it is formally the beginning of democratic politics. The question now is the question of substance, the question of content, and the question of spirit. What is the spirit of democratic politics? How can we conform to this spirit? This is what we must discuss. The British scholar Ernest Barker is an authority in political science. His views on democratic politics are worthy of our attention.

Barker believes that democratic politics is primarily a politics of free discussion. Democracy itself "is a disposition and habit of free discussion of ideas." Without this disposition and habit, there will be no democratic politics. The government is a government of free discussion, and the people are a people of free discussion. All political reforms seek conclusions through free discussion. This discussion is free, tolerant, and reasonable.

The expression of free discussion, from the perspective of democratic politics, is expressed through political institutions such as political parties, electoral colleges, parliaments, and cabinets. These political institutions are necessary; otherwise, the effectiveness of free discussion cannot be expressed. Therefore, Barker said: "When a group of free people freely think about their different ideas, freely express themselves in different political parties, freely debate in a freely elected parliament, and in such a parliament, each party and faction—the government and the opposition, the cabinet and the anti-cabinet—freely compromise through free consultation and cooperation, this, I believe, is the highest form of democratic politics." This passage expresses the essentials of democratic politics: first, there must be free people; second, there must be free thought; third, there must be political parties that are freely organized and freely joined; fourth, there must be a freely elected parliament; fifth, there must be the possibility of free debate. Without these freedoms, this is not democratic politics. For example, if there are political parties, but the political parties do not allow people to freely organize and freely join, it is the same as having no political parties. Or if there is a parliament, but the parliament is not freely elected, it is also the same as having no parliament. Everything must be based on freedom. Without freedom, there is no democracy.

However, the disposition and habit of free discussion need to be cultivated, need to be trained, and, in short, need education to be created. Therefore, Barker believes that democratic politics, in addition to the above-mentioned political institutions, also needs other non-political institutions. Various clubs, labor unions, social groups, rural organizations, churches, schools, etc., can be said to be organs for training people to discuss freely. The disposition and habit of free discussion must first be cultivated in these organs. A major purpose of education is to cultivate this habit of free discussion. When people have this habit of free discussion, then the government may be a government of free discussion.

Finally, Barker believes that democratic politics emphasizes means rather than ends. This is the main difference between democratic politics and dictatorial politics. Dictatorial politics can be said to emphasize ends, a politics that chooses means for the sake of ends. In the name of achieving a certain end, all means of oppressing the people can be adopted. In this way, no matter how noble the end, from the perspective of means, it is always dictatorial. Dictatorship is only expressed in means, never in ends. The end claimed by any dictator, which is also the surface end (the inner end is difficult to know), is bound to be noble. Is there any difference between this end itself and the end claimed by democratic politics? For example, saying: seeking the welfare of the people, this is what dictators like to say. Can we say that this end is wrong? Can we say that this end is not also the end of democratic politics? When we consider the end as an end, we cannot distinguish between democracy and dictatorship. What we can distinguish is the means. If the means are wrong, or the means are dictatorial, we can only say that it is dictatorial politics. The politics of ancient wise rulers and virtuous ministers had noble ends, undeniably, and in practice, it may have been beneficial to the people, or it may have been praised by the people, but the means were autocratic, and we can only say that it was dictatorial politics. Ends are achieved through means. If the means are improper, although a certain end can be achieved, it often destroys other ends. The ancients said that killing one innocent person to gain the world is not something to be done, which is to emphasize the meaning of means. Modern democratic politics distinguishes itself from dictators in its emphasis on means. Therefore, Barker believes that free democratic politics "pays more attention to the methods of government than to its ends—more attention to the process of government than to its goals."

The above are a few of Barker's opinions on democratic politics. The author believes that these opinions are very valuable. If the country's policies, whether domestic or foreign, do not have room for free discussion or do not allow the circulation of dissenting opinions, do not allow the opposition party to raise objections, then this kind of politics must not be democratic politics. Whatever politics, democratic or economic, if this condition is not met, it is not democratic. This is what anyone talking about democracy should pay attention to.

In short, Lao Tzu's view of life can be summed up in one sentence: understanding the Way and abiding by the Way. Things and self are both manifestations of the Way in action. Things and self both come from the Way. Although their forms are different, their essence is the same. Forms are separated by time and space, with distinctions between self and other. The Way is one and only one. Its expression and circulation in people and things transcends time and space without distinction. Form is a "vessel," referring to the trunk and limbs of humans, and the solid, substantial form of things. What people and things share from the Way to become human or thing is called "virtue" (de). Virtue is the Way within people or things, using their trunk and limbs, and their solid, substantial form, as vessels, to manifest its function. Understanding the Way lies in breaking the limits of time and space, dissolving the distinctions between people, things, self, and others, connecting to the one root of the Way, and recognizing the common source of all existence. Abiding by the Way means that, based on the common source of all existence, each preserves its virtue, each remains in its place, without invading or harming each other, coexisting in the process of transformation. In the process of transformation, things have formation and destruction, and people have birth and death. Formation, destruction, birth, and death are merely the ripples and undulations in the great flow of transformation. The expression and circulation of the Way is transformation. Transformation often depends on the force of opposition and complementation, so formation, destruction, birth, and death are also events of opposition and complementation, natural and inevitable. The birth, death, formation, and destruction of people and things do not harm the constancy of the essence of the Way, just as the uneven undulations of waves do not diminish the wholeness of the sea. Understanding this, then birth is not to be rejoiced and death is not to be hated. Not rejoicing in birth and hating death means that birth and death are one. When birth and death are one, there is no impediment to establishing oneself and conducting oneself. Being content with fate and enjoying life to the fullest. Recognizing the common source of all existence, dissolving the distinction between self and others, preserving virtue, and abiding by one's place without harming each other means that people and things are equal. When people and things are equal, there is a way to accommodate and interact with others. Establishing oneself and conducting oneself with contentment, treating others with accommodation and harmony, then human feelings will be harmonious and the principles of things will be smooth, and the world can reach perfect order.

The birth, death, formation, and destruction of people and things, the constant flow of all transformations, are the Way acting as transformation. It is hoped that in this ever-changing state, there is an unchanging and constant force, which is opposition and complementation. In opposition and complementation, the opposite does not always remain the opposite, and what is opposed does not always remain the opposed. They rise and fall, and replace each other. In the midst of rising and falling, no person, thing, or event remains constant and unchanging. What remains constant and unchanging is only the essence of the Way, and the path of its expression and circulation (the force of opposition and complementation). The essence of the Way, and the path of its expression and circulation, are both natural and inevitable. Understanding this, abiding by this, following this, then in establishing oneself, conducting oneself, and treating others, there is no partiality, no love or hate. Thus, there is no need for benevolence, no need for what is advantageous or disadvantageous, no need for righteousness, no need for what is noble or base, thick or thin, no need for rituals, no need for creation or action, no need for wisdom. Therefore, it is said that benevolence, righteousness, rituals, and wisdom are the excrescences of the Way and virtue, not what those who uphold the Way and preserve its essence would take.

Only Lao Tzu's view of life: in establishing oneself and conducting oneself, it treats birth and death as one and enjoys life contentedly, so the inner self is always sufficient (sufficient in the Way) and does not rely on external seeking. In treating others, it equalizes people and things and dissolves the distinction between self and others, so wisdom is always inwardly focused, and it despises those who pursue the superficial learning of things. Now, what is sought externally is the means of sustaining life. It is only because one rejoices in life and hates death that one seeks the means of sustaining life. If birth and death are neither rejoiced nor hated, then one does not rush to seek life and avoid death, and what need is there for the means of sustaining life? Therefore, one does not seek it. If people do not seek the means of sustaining life, then the world will have abundant wealth, with nothing to be used for contention. Equalizing people and things and dissolving the distinction between self and others means that I and things are of the same essence (the same essence) without distinction between host and guest. I am things, the host is the guest, understanding my essence is understanding the essence of things, knowing the host is knowing the guest. Thus, "all things are complete in me, reflect on oneself and be sincere" without the need to pursue things as learning. This is why wisdom is inwardly focused, with nothing to overflow externally. Moreover, the distinction between subject and object is what modern people call the hinge of reason. Subject and object mean that one takes oneself as the "knower" and things as the "known." The knower observes the known, just as the host faces the guest. The host and guest are distinguished into two. Lao Tzu dissolves the distinction between people and things, so the view of host and guest is not distinguished. When the view of host and guest is not distinguished, the use of reason cannot arise. From this, it can be said that Lao Tzu opposes what modern people call reason, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Although Lao Tzu has his own use of wisdom, what is that use for? It is only to embody and recognize the essence of the Way in oneself. "Embodying and recognizing" means using the essence to illuminate the essence, not taking the essence as the "known" and seeking to know it. Lao Tzu calls embodiment and recognition "mysterious contemplation" (xuan lan). "Mysterious" (xuan) means suspended, referring to the essence of the Way. The essence of the Way is suspended and does not cling to things, for clinging to things creates distinction. When it is suspended, it is one. Using the suspended Way to contemplate the essence of the Way reveals that the essence of the Way is one. Seeing the essence of the Way as one dissolves the ego-attachment, for my essence of the Way is the same as the essence of the Way in people and things. However, the Way encompasses both essence and function. Essence is for function, and function is for seeing essence. The two depend on and require each other, and cannot be separated. However, essence is hidden and function is manifest. The task of understanding the Way lies only in recognizing the essence through its function. The flow of all transformations, like people's thoughts and actions, and things' movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, are all the expression of the essence of the Way. Therefore, the task of understanding the Way lies only in examining the traces of people's thoughts and actions, movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, in the midst of the flow of all transformations, in order to see the common source of people and things, and that their thoughts and actions, movement, stillness, formation, and destruction, are all the expression and circulation of this essence. Then the fact of embodiment and recognition is the task of essence and experience. Experience is for recognition, and recognition exists in the midst of experience. Recognition and experience are two and one, one and two. "Recognition" (ren) means "knowing," and "experience" (yan) means "doing." From this, the unity of knowing and doing can be seen. In the language of the Book of Changes, the matter of embodiment and experience is carried out only in the midst of establishing oneself, conducting oneself, and treating others. When the experience is true, then the recognition is thorough, just as when the action is skilled, then the knowledge is detailed. This is the task of using function (the function of the Way) to illuminate the essence (the essence of the Way).

Using function to illuminate essence means that the essence is not empty or silent. Illuminating essence to attain function means that function is not lost or chaotic. Essence is constant, function is change. Essence is stillness, function is movement. Knowing the constant and preserving stillness, then one can handle change without confusion, respond to change without yielding. The trace of change reveals the constancy of essence, the exterior moves while the interior remains still, the body labors while the heart is at ease. This is the highest attainment of cultivation. Therefore, it is said that Lao Tzu's view of life can be summed up in one sentence: understanding the Way and abiding by the Way. Understanding the Way and abiding by the Way means knowing the constant and preserving stillness. Knowing the constant allows one to respond to change, preserving stillness allows one to control movement. Change attains its place, movement accords with its appropriateness. Establishing oneself and conducting oneself are always upright, and treating others is always beneficial.

### Professor Whitehead: On Chinese Science

— Zuoyu

The British philosopher Professor A.N. Whitehead recently passed away, and this magazine had an article commemorating him. He had never been to China, so he is not as well-known in China as Dewey and Russell. However, he had a considerable understanding of Chinese culture, especially a deep understanding of the reasons for the underdevelopment of Chinese science.

In his book "Science and the Modern World," Whitehead mentioned Chinese culture. He said: "The special balance of mind required for science has only occasionally and irregularly been discovered in many great cultures, and has produced very weak results. For example, the more we know about Chinese art, Chinese literature, and Chinese philosophy of life, the more we admire the peaks reached by this culture. For thousands of years, many keen-minded and learned people in China have devoted their lives to research. Considering the length of history and the size of the population, China constitutes the broadest culture the world has ever seen. We have no reason to doubt the inherent ability of individual Chinese to conduct scientific research. But Chinese science is actually insignificant. We also have no reason to believe that if China were left to its own devices, it would produce any scientific progress." In this passage, Whitehead's revelation is that the Chinese have the spirit to study and also have the inner ability to study science, but the reason why Chinese science is underdeveloped is that the Chinese lack a certain mind or mentality required for science. Whitehead further explained the reasons why the Chinese lack this mentality in another book.

In his book "The Function of Reason," Whitehead also talked about the reasons for the underdevelopment of Chinese science. He believed that what science needs most is "speculation." However, this speculation is speculation controlled by method, not uncontrolled speculation. We can say that what science needs is speculation and method, not just speculation. The Greeks were rich in speculation, and the Chinese were also rich in speculation. But the speculation of the Greeks produced science, while the speculation of the Chinese could not produce science. What is the reason? This is because the speculation of the Greeks was controlled by method, and they knew to pay attention to observation and facts, so it could produce important results. On the contrary, the speculation of the Chinese was not controlled by method, and their speculation was like an unbridled horse, running arbitrarily. As a result, the speculation turned into fantasy or delusion, and produced no results. The speculation of the Greeks was genuine speculation, while the speculation of the Chinese was mostly fantasy or delusion. The difference is that one knows to pay attention to method and has methodological awareness, while the other does not know to pay attention to method and has no methodological awareness. Method is an element of science. The mentality required for science is the mentality of methodological awareness. The cultivation of this mentality lies in training with method. The training of method is the main way to create the mentality required for science. If China wants to seek scientific progress, it must pay attention to method. (The above is not the original language of Whitehead's book, but the author's extrapolation based on Whitehead's meaning). I don't think anyone can deny Whitehead's point of view.

Traditional scholars in our country do not pay attention to method, or at least they have no methodological awareness. This is the main reason for the underdevelopment of science in our country. Now, scientists in our country know the importance of method in words, but they do not regard method as a discipline and study it. Therefore, there is no course on method in science and engineering colleges. The author believes that this is still the tradition of neglecting method.

### Bosanquet on the Imperfect Self

— Zhiru

(2) The simple self is a naive, simple self without contaminated habits. This virtue is the basis for his ability to do good, so in principle it cannot be said that he is bad, or it can even be said that he is good. However, he lacks experience, so he does not have the ability to deal with the world and lead a highly civilized life, which is his defective imperfection. But a simple self that does not know anything may be good, and a very knowledgeable heart may be evil. So the simple self can be compared to an article that only has basic principles but no detailed theories, rigorous systems, or rich content.

(3) The bad self. The above two kinds of self do not yet have a firm and clear individuality, so there is neither a significant and positive consistency with the infinite or absolute, or the whole, nor a clear and positive conflict. At the same time, there is neither harmonious and elegant content within, nor contradictory and base mechanisms. So it cannot be said that they are perfect, nor can it be said that they are qualitatively evil. The so-called bad self is different from them, because the bad self can have a firm character, consistent behavior, rich knowledge, and deep understanding. Viewed individually, he is a very complete individual, he has his own style, which can arouse people's admiration, he has his theory and proposition. If you acknowledge his theory and proposition, you may acknowledge that he is good. But if you go beyond his individual stance, stand at a higher level, and look at him with a broader perspective, you will find that he is in conflict with the whole and is a truly bad person who cannot be tolerated by mankind. Therefore, the badness of a bad person is not that he personally has no merit, but that he is in conflict and incompatible with good—the whole. This kind of self is like an article that has a reason and is logically consistent, but cannot be compatible with the entire experience, so the whole is false. (To be continued)

### Forbidden Words from the Academy (22)

— Zhang Qiyun

Western Philosophers on North China (Middle)

Comparing China and Europe, one immediately notices significant differences. China's land area is slightly larger than the entire continent of Europe. Foreigners often overlook this point when discussing China. It's crucial to understand that China isn't like a single European country but is equivalent to the whole of Europe. China is currently divided into approximately thirty provinces, while Europe is divided into around thirty countries. Their territories are distinct, with fortified borders, frequent disputes, and deepened animosities after the recent Great War. In the past, during the Roman Empire, Europe showed some tendency toward unification. However, it has failed to unify since the fall of Rome. What is the reason for this? Today, Europe is merely a geographical term, whereas China is a single nation with a shared language and culture. Although it has experienced repeated wars over thousands of years, China has consistently relied on its inherent culture to establish a nation-state. R.H. Tawney, a professor at the University of London, stated, "Based on my travels, I deeply feel that China is not just a geographical unit but possesses a vibrant national character." China's unity is, in fact, the natural result of its unique culture undergoing long-term development.

The late Lord Northcliffe, owner of The Times of London, once expressed his impressions of traveling in America, saying, "Foreigners traveling in America find its scenery and style to be uniformly consistent. Observing from the outside, it's nearly impossible to distinguish which state or city one is in. The breakfast menus, the hairstyles of girls, and so on, are all uniform throughout the country. The people's appearances and manners are strikingly similar to each other. Only the Chinese people also share this sense of unified style." Lord Northcliffe visited China in 1921 and wrote to his family from Beijing, "Everyone says that being with the Japanese feels uncomfortable, but when one gets to know Chinese scholars, one feels a sense of camaraderie. I share this sentiment. This is because the national characteristics of China and Britain are quite similar." Lord Northcliffe's words may seem like a truism, but they contain deep meaning, because he is talking about something that most people know, so it feels plain and unremarkable.

During President Lincoln's term in the United States, Anson Burlingame was appointed as the U.S. envoy to China. After serving as minister to Beijing for six years, he, as an American, received a commission from China to serve as its envoy to Western countries. Burlingame arrived in the United States in 1868, and that year, various circles in Boston hosted a banquet to welcome the Chinese envoy and his entourage. Ralph Waldo Emerson delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the hosts, expressing his admiration for China. The point he particularly emphasized was the importance of education in the Chinese political system. Emerson believed that Confucius's personality could serve as a model for human endeavor. Great figures are those who can put the highest morality into practice, and morality is the life force of the universe.

Confucianism regards self-cultivation as paramount. Only by working on self-reliance and self-achievement can one attain spiritual dignity. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University, once said, "The physical, intellectual, and mental strength of the individual is the driving force behind any true culture." The central concept of Confucius's educational philosophy is the completion of personality, and those who possess the three virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage are called "gentlemen." Only gentlemen can become statesmen, and only gentlemen can become good and benevolent global citizens.

Confucius said, "Governance is about rectitude," and rectitude is used not only to govern the state but also to bring peace to the world. Rectitude is the key to solving domestic and international problems. Emerson once gave a speech praising President Lincoln's emancipation of slaves. He believed that Lincoln's actions aligned with the great principles of Confucianism. Emerson believed that the teachings of Confucius could serve as a yardstick for measuring modern history. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, drew inspiration from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on the surface, but in fact, the concept of civil governance in China has deep roots in its inherent philosophy. The current global war is caused by some extreme ideas since the nineteenth century. The connection between cause and effect is clear. We should pay as much attention to these ideas that can cause war as to the war itself. In our view, extreme ideas are the most powerful weapon. Isaiah Bowman, president of Johns Hopkins University, said, "There are two ways to ensure world peace: one is the doctrine of human rights, and the other is the combined strength of nations upholding justice. If humanity is not free, it will become slaves." China has always adhered to the policy of being kind and friendly to its neighbors, and this is not merely empty talk but is often put into practice.

Free Discussion

### Opening the Skylight

— Jingwen

I believe everyone still remembers that in the period shortly after the war, American goods "flooded" Shanghai. A pound of Klim milk powder sold for only 1,500 yuan per can, and glass handbags, straps, combs, and nylon stockings were only tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. A gold-plated Parker pen was only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Parker ink, which now costs 300,000 yuan per bottle, was readily available on the streets at that time, costing only 500 to 600 yuan per bottle at its cheapest.

Based on the income of the average wage earner at that time, it certainly cannot be said to have been very cheap, but at least Klim milk powder and glass products were still within the purchasing power of the general public. And those slightly moldy chocolate candies were in the hands of everyone, more popular than the cheap squeezed ice that cost 500 yuan per stick.

But around this period, a group of politicians and economists, so-called representatives of "national capitalists," came out and argued that the influx of foreign goods not only depleted foreign exchange reserves but also threatened the survival of "national industries." Therefore, they advocated that the import of foreign goods should first be limited to production tools and raw materials that the country could not manufacture. As a result, Florida oranges were the first to be targeted, followed by luxury goods such as nylon, lipstick, and face powder. As for milk powder and canned food, they could only enter the black market due to foreign exchange restrictions.

From the perspective of developing "national industries," all these measures were naturally beyond reproach, because international trade cannot only involve imports without exports. If a country is poor and still spends huge amounts of foreign exchange on importing unnecessary luxury goods, it is tantamount to promoting national economic suicide. Although Florida oranges and Klim milk powder are delicious and nourishing, for a country that still relies on foreign aid for rice and flour, it is ultimately too much.

Going back to the basics, everyone naturally hoped that our so-called "national capitalists" and "national industries" could take advantage of the government's restrictions on imported goods to make a great effort, at least to allow the common people to wear cheap cloth clothes and eat a bowl of cheap rice. To put it bluntly, the common people have long been so hungry that there is not even a drop of oil left in their stomachs. For example, some places had the kindness of the UNRRA to distribute milk powder, providing milk powder to the poor in disaster areas like tea on a familiar road. However, they either vomited after eating it or suffered from diarrhea (this is not fabricated by the author; "Life" magazine once published photos and texts about this). This also shows that we are not yet blessed to enjoy such "supplements." If we can have a mouthful of rice, everyone will feel that the world is at peace.

However, recently, we suddenly heard our "national capitalists" hiding in Hong Kong, which cannot yet be considered our "national" territory, shouting loudly about the "crisis" of "national industries." However, this time it is not about American goods related to "foreign exchange" but about goods from the East. It is said that the markets in Guangzhou are now flooded with Japanese goods, and their low prices and wide variety have forced our "relocated" "national" capitalists to cry out in alarm.

If it were not for this outcry, we would not have known that the so-called "national capitalists" had already moved to Hong Kong, a colony of the British Empire. Of course, we have also seen news of "capital moving south" in the newspapers, but given the size of China, some people have long divided our country into regions such as "North China," "Central China," and "South China," so there is nothing wrong with capital moving south. However, although Hong Kong also belongs to "South China," it cannot be said to be "national" after all, so how much of the "national" capital's move south is for the sake of "national industries" is something that everyone understands even if I don't say it.

Anyone with a little knowledge of economics naturally knows that capitalism, at a certain stage of its development, does have a very strong national character. However, today, "where the profit lies" is synonymous with "capitalism." In pursuit of profit, whether something is national or not is no longer a consideration. To speak plainly, the black market American goods and large-scale Japanese smuggling that are flooding the markets now cannot be done by anyone who does not have strong capital. Because everyone knows that the profits from smuggling far exceed the profits from legitimate production, is the so-called southward movement of national capital not actually for the convenience of smuggling over there?

Writing to this point, I cannot help but yearn for the era of 1,500 yuan per can of Klim milk powder, and I can only sneer at the cries of crisis from the "national" industry! If there is no cheap cloth to wear and cheap food to eat, why should I care about the "national capitalists" who are shouting about the crisis of "national industries" in foreign colonies!

### Celebrities and Beds

— Ding Ling

The great poet Milton loved to compose poems in bed, going to bed every evening to write poetry. Later, when he became completely blind, he would have dinner at eight o'clock every night, smoke for a while, drink a glass of water, and then go to sleep. While lying in bed, his poetic inspiration would surge, and his daughters or secretaries would record his dictation, which is how he completed the great "Paradise Lost."

The English philosopher and mathematician Thomas Hobbes spent most of his life in bed. He liked to draw mathematical diagrams on his clean white sheets, without which he could not work or fall asleep.

The French philosopher René Descartes spent a lot of time in bed due to his weak health, pondering deeply in bed and completing his immortal masterpiece.

Voltaire's sharp articles showed his extraordinary intellect, and his great works were also cultivated from bed. His thoughts would surge while he slept, completing his drafts, which he would then write down early the next morning.

The British literary eccentric Dr. Samuel Johnson was a lifelong heavy sleeper, although he tried to change it many times without success.

Louis XVI slept in 413 beds in his short life.

Charles Dickens insisted that his bed must face north, so when he slept away from home, he always carried a compass with him to arrange his bed.

### Cave-Dwelling Rome

— Zhang Huangshi

Because of the lack of housing, the people of Rome are now living in the ancient times of "cave-dwelling and wilderness lodging."

Italy suffered considerable damage during the war. Refugees gathered in Rome in order to make a living. After the war ended, veterans returned home one after another, but the authorities did not have the ability to arrange for them, so many of them turned to banditry in order to survive. The more educated people found other jobs.

Because all of Italy was suffering from hardship, their opportunities were very limited. So those who could not find legitimate jobs for a while flocked to Rome and engaged in speculative businesses.

The population of Rome is now double what it was before the war, but the housing is limited. As a result, cellars, air-raid shelters, under eaves, beside large trees, dry riverbeds, memorial towers, and the foot of arches have become temporary residences.

But what about the rich? They still live comfortably in the midst of the housing shortage, with apartments, villas, gardens, and all kinds of sanitary facilities.

Judging by the housing situation alone, Rome is a paradise, but it is also a hell.

### The Mystery of Zhang Nanpi Killing His Wife in a Fit of Rage

— Zheng Yimei

In my book "Records of Personal Objects," I wrote: "Zhang Zhidong of Nanpi and his wife were deeply devoted to each other. After they had a son, one evening, they suddenly had an argument over the child. Zhang Nanpi, in a fit of rage, accidentally kicked his wife down. He rushed to help her up, but she was unconscious, with blood flowing from her nose. By the time a doctor was called, it was too late, and she died the next day. So he bought a coffin and buried her with all the proper rites, transporting the coffin back to his hometown. Her brother, Zixiang, wanted to launch a punitive expedition, but fortunately, Zixiang was a student of Zhang Nanpi's respected father. Out of respect for his teacher, he was reluctant to cause trouble, so he demanded that the funeral be lavish. Zhang Nanpi's respected father agreed, and a lawsuit was averted. However, Zhang Nanpi did not dare to go home for more than a year, as he was very ashamed to face Zixiang. Later, Zhang Nanpi's respected father arranged for him to marry a Miss Gao in preparation for remarriage. Zhang Nanpi still felt uneasy about it, thinking that although it was not forbidden by custom and did not violate reason, it seemed difficult to justify his feelings. So he postponed it until three years later before finally completing the marriage, and he often missed his former wife and remained uneasy for a long time." Jing Meijiu, a famous figure in the Nanshe literary society, saw my work and said that it was indeed true, and he also said that Zhang Nanpi was an official in Shanxi. One day, he personally tried a case in which the principal offender was a woman. As soon as she came to court, Zhang Nanpi suddenly fainted. The officials were shocked and quickly helped him inside. He only woke up after a while. It turned out that the woman in the main crime was the criminal woman, whose appearance was very similar to the wife he had killed. Zhang Nanpi's nerves were suddenly stimulated, and he could not help but fall to the ground. Unexpectedly, I recently received a letter from Jiang Shiyao in Guangzhou, which said: "Sir, you are knowledgeable and have extraordinary insight, which I have always admired. Your book "Records of Personal Objects" is precious and valuable and can indeed be used for historical records. However, because there are so many descriptions, it is inevitable that there are some rumors that are not true. For example, the article in the book about Zhang Nanpi killing his wife in a fit of rage is suspected of being untrue. I have a great interest in studying the life stories of people who have made slight achievements in various aspects of China in the past hundred years. Therefore, I have collected many biographies and chronologies of related figures. According to the records, Zhang Wenxiang married Shi in the fourth year of Xianfeng. In the sixth year of Xianfeng, Zhang Ying, the respected father of Wenxiang, died in Guiyang. In the same year, his brother-in-law Shi Jun died in Duyun. In the fourth year of Tongzhi, his wife Shi died in Beijing. In that year, Wenxiang graduated and was ranked first class. In the sixth year of Tongzhi, he served as the deputy examiner of the Zhejiang provincial examination. After the death of his wife Shi, Wenxiang remarried Tang, and there was no marriage with a Miss Gao. The book said that after Nanpi killed his wife, his brother-in-law wanted to launch a punitive expedition, which was tactfully blocked by Nanpi's respected father. If Nanpi's family had not had the shelter of adults, then the son would have been imprisoned, how could he have been able to learn and advance in officialdom. According to the years, they do not match: (1) Nanpi's first wife, Shi, died ten years after her father and brother-in-law; (2) Nanpi only served as an examiner in Zhejiang after the death of his father, so how could there be any words about learning and advancing in officialdom in his family. All this proves that this is a fabrication. Sir, you have heard rumors from others and did not have time to check Nanpi's chronology and biography, which led to this error, but it does not affect your wide learning." According to what I have seen in the published letters of Zhang Zhidong, it is said that he reported to his father, all of which are detailed in the family letters and are not fabricated. However, Jiang Jun's account based on the chronology and biography is also reliable, so one is false and one is true, and one of them must be true. Could the published letters of Zhang Zhidong be forged? It is very confusing and incomprehensible.

### Small Talk Among Flowers

— Liuyun

Boiling cranes and burning zithers are ancient metaphors for spoiling the scenery, just as shouting on a pine-covered path or drying underwear under flowers is equally embarrassing! Now, if you try to set foot in a park, you will often see sugarcane residue all over the ground, which is offensive to the eye and unbearable. Song Ruozhai, a lay Buddhist, had a manifesto in his hall with four subjects: "Flowers Should Be Praised," "Flowers Resent Jealousy," "Flowers Receive Honors," and "Flowers Suffer Humiliation," totaling fifty-eight articles. He posted it in the hall so that visitors would be warned and enlightened, and his love for flowers was evident in his writing. He was truly a refined and thoughtful person.

Flowers, with the cultivation of the seasons and human effort, become increasingly beautiful. They are also praised by their owners and immortalized by famous writers, further enhancing their honor. The two subjects of "Flowers Should Be Praised" and "Flowers Receive Honors" will not be repeated here. Only the articles on "Flowers Resent Jealousy" and "Flowers Suffer Humiliation" will be presented to enlighten the vulgar and so-called "refined-yet-vulgar" gentlemen of the world.

(1) "Flowers Resent Jealousy": In wind, continuous rain, scorching sun, bitter cold, ugly women, vulgar people, crows, bad poems, discussing current affairs, discussing official positions, shouting on flower paths, unfurling scarlet curtains in front of flowers, appreciating flowers with drums and gongs, composing poems with tableware and messengers.

(2) "Flowers Suffer Humiliation": Vulgar people plucking and breaking them, stingy owners, planting them in rich people's gardens and giving them obscene names, coiling and knotting them into screens, appreciating flowers with vulgar prostitutes, planting them under the windows of mediocre monks, inserting them into bottles in restaurants and wine shops, having dog feces under the trees, drying clothes on the branches, painting blue paper screens with powder, growing in vulgar alleys and ditches.

In recent times, with the development of science and the advancement of gardening, human power can rival nature, and clever ideas compete with natural creations. Wind, continuous rain, scorching sun, and bitter cold can all be avoided by artificial means. However, it is easy to change the natural environment, but it is difficult to cure the vulgarity of mankind, which is lamentable.

### Ornamentation Notes

— Bentian

As far back as three thousand years ago, Egyptian women were already deliberately dressing up. A blue-green peacock-shaped stone pendant and a tightly closed small gold-threaded box were excavated from a pyramid. These were all the belongings of Queen Sobekneferu of ancient Egypt. The hand box was just over two inches long and contained a small spoon, probably for scooping rouge, and a pair of delicate tweezers for removing eyebrows.

In Africa, different tribes have different decorations. Women of the Fulata tribe wrap their fingers and toes with flower leaves to create a beautiful and dazzling purple color. They also dye their hair blue, paint their teeth blue, yellow, and purple, and apply antimony sulfide to their eyelids.

Women of the Hottentot tribe, in order to be considered beautiful by their men, smear their bodies with butter, kerosene, and a fragrant leaf, creating a strange smell and strange color to attract men.

African natives are fond of tattoos. They scar their bodies with lines, fill the wounds with soil, and form raised scars, which they consider beautiful. Some natives also paint their bodies with white paint to highlight their brown-black skin. Still others paint their bodies with antelope blood and cover their hair with mica powder for decoration.

In one area of Australia, only men can use cosmetics, and women are only allowed to decorate their faces, otherwise it is against the law. Warriors decorate their skin with red, yellow, white, and blue dyes, so merchants can make huge profits by selling pigments at high prices. Conversely, in New Zealand, cosmetics are exclusively for women, and they dye their noses with pigments.

On the islands of the South Pacific, natives use needles sharpened from human bones to pierce various patterns on their bodies. They embed a blue pigment made of coconut ash and water into the skin. Often, people die because they cannot bear the inhumane carving. Tattoos are also popular among Mexican natives. In addition, some of them file their teeth into sharp shapes, while others drill into them and fill them with jade and silk gems.

American Indians paint their bodies with dyes, especially when going hunting or preparing for war.

Egyptian priests burned incense to fumigate the body. This incense was made from a mixture of several spices and used to coat the body to protect the skin.

Zhao Jianqiu (Chunnian) of Wujin and Dong Shoujing (Kang) were from the same hometown, passed the provincial examination together, held office together, lived in the same residence, and had a very deep friendship. Zhao's wife, Ms. Lu Tonghua, was a talented woman from Changzhou. She wrote "Qingsheng Pavilion Lyrics" and had it printed into a large and exquisite book. Dong Kang wrote the preface for it, saying: "Kang was in Beijing and lived with Jianqiu in the old residence of Pan Wengong (Wengin) in Mishi Hutong. I often heard Ms. Lu sing new songs, and flowers bloomed beautifully. Chun Ting's happiness and longevity complemented my research, and Gao Zhai's joy continued my records of epigraphy. (There is a plaque in the living room that says "Happiness and Longevity Courtyard" and a plaque in the study that says "Pangxi Zhai," both of which are Pan Gong's old relics.) Jianqiu is a talented scholar, elegant and refined. He loves and cherishes his virtuous wife, and people praise them, saying that they are no less than Wei Gong and Zhong Ji, or Hanshan and Qingzi." The middle section says: "Ms. Lu is influenced by fragrant customs and draws from worldly learning. She is skilled in writing and has long been proficient in literature. She also dabbles in slow and soft tunes. In addition, she understands the six scripts and is particularly good at seal script. In the late spring, the green shade is sparse. In the deep autumn, the yellow flowers make people thin. She is as talented as Yutai in poetry and loves the music of Jinlian. She has made a pact to retreat together in joy, and she looks like a fairy." He elegantly and meticulously portrays the friendship between Dong and Zhao, the harmony of Zhao and Lu, and the clear talents and beautiful writings of Ms. Lu, which also shows the extraordinary talent of old Dong's writing.

Dong and Zhao both passed the provincial examination in the year of Wuzi, but Zhao passed the imperial examination several years later. Dong passed the palace examination in the year of Jichou, while Zhao only passed the provincial examination in the year of Wuxu. However, in the year of Jichou, Zhao had already passed the examination to become a drafter, while Dong was a judge in the Ministry of Justice. Although they were not in the same yamen, they were both officials in Beijing. Zhao had been in the cabinet for many years and had been recommended to be a prefect. After passing the imperial examination, he was appointed to his original position and assigned to Jiangxi, where he served as the acting prefect of Ruizhou. At the end of the Guangxu reign, he was promoted by Tang Wenzhi to walk in the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, and then served as a member of the National Assembly. Dong was promoted to judge and then to senior judge in the Supreme Court. Both of them were qualified for the position of a high-ranking official in Beijing. After the Republic of China, Zhao served as a counselor in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and as the vice minister of finance, never leaving the fields of industry and economy. Although he was in retirement for twenty years, he was still able to maintain his livelihood. Dong served as a specially appointed official in the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Justice for the longest time. He also served as the minister of finance for a very short period of time. During the period of Japanese occupation, Zhao was able to live in seclusion and preserve himself. Because he had no card to sell, Wang Kemin and others, although old friends, troubled him with positions such as director and secretary-general. Zhao naturally did not accept, and he only enjoyed poetry and wine with old friends of the same generation. I and Dong and Zhao were both friends of the Wuzi year. I was often invited by old man Jianqiu to drink in Pangxi Zhai. Old Dong lived in Xizhuan Hutong, which was only one alley away from Zhao's Mishi Hutong, very close to each other, but even at Zhao's place, Dong was rarely seen, which shows that he lived in seclusion and rarely went out, and had his own difficult reasons to say that he was old and sick. Zhao Jian died in the thirty-first year of the Republic of China at the age of seventy-five. The night before, he went to the theater and drank alone in a small restaurant. When he returned, he slept soundly all night. The next noon, there was still no sound from him. The family thought he had gotten up late, but when they checked on him, he had already passed away without any illness. He can be called a man of complete happiness.
