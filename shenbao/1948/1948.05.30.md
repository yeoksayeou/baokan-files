### Weng Wenhao Takes Office at the Executive Yuan, Announces Li Weiguo and Liang Yingwen as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, List of Ministers to be Announced Today

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Weng Wenhao, the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, took office at the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 29th, and announced Li Weiguo and Liang Yingwen as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, respectively. As for the complete list of Cabinet members, it could not be announced as scheduled due to the unresolved issues of the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in the Cabinet. However, Weng's nomination by the President was approved by the Legislative Yuan last Monday, so Weng first took office at the Yuan to handle handover matters. This morning, Weng only notified the Executive Yuan by phone and did not make any other preparations. Before 2:30 PM, Gan Naiguang and Pu Xuefeng, the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, went to Weng's official residence on Langya Road to greet him. Soon after, Weng, accompanied by the newly appointed Secretary-General Li Weiguo and Gan and Pu, went to the Executive Yuan. Wang Yunwu, the former Vice-Premier of the Executive Yuan, welcomed him at the Yuan. After arriving at the Yuan, Weng immediately convened a meeting with senior counselors and secretaries of the Executive Yuan, and introduced the newly appointed Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General, and encouraged the original staff of various ministries to continue working with peace of mind. Weng then announced the appointments of Zhou Daxun, Zhang Xiong, and Huang Xian as counselors, and Xu Zhaoji, Xu Zicheng, and Chen Hanping as senior secretaries. Counselor Zhou Daxun will be in charge of confidential documents, and Secretary Xu Zhaoji will concurrently serve as Director of the First Division. Weng then left the Yuan, and the handover procedures are being handled by Li Weiguo, Liang Yingwen, and Gan Naiguang. Furthermore, news of Weng's taking office today was known to few in advance, so not many people came to offer congratulations in time. Vice-Minister Liu Shishun and Education Minister Hang Liwu arrived one after another. Weng also paid his first visit to the President at 9:30 PM to report on matters. It is also learned that Weng has decided to appoint Pu Xuefeng as a councilor of the Executive Yuan. According to Pu, he is willing to serve the Executive Yuan wholeheartedly and does not need to hold any title. However, this decision is unlikely to change.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The list of candidates for heads of various ministries of the new Executive Yuan may be announced on the 30th. As of the evening of the 29th, except for the candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, all have been decided. It was previously rumored that the Ministers of Education, Social Affairs, and Interior Affairs would be changed. It is now learned that Weng has earnestly retained them, and they will remain in their original positions. It was previously decided to invite Jiang Tingfu to serve as Minister of Finance, but Jiang has telegraphed his refusal. Weng has re-consulted with Wang Yunwu to head the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the position of Vice-Premier, it will still be held by Gu Mengyu. Although Gu had previously declined, Weng personally carried a letter from the President when he went to Shanghai on the 27th, sincerely inviting Gu to take the position. It is now open that Gu will take the night train to Nanjing on the 29th. As of the evening of the 29th, although no telegram of acceptance had been received in Nanjing, it is widely believed that Gu's arrival in Nanjing would be to accept the sincere invitation of the President and Premier Weng.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Military News Agency reports: He Yingqin visited Bai Chongxi at 10:00 AM on the 29th and left after talking for about an hour.

### Xu Fulin Responds to Premier Weng: The Democratic Socialist Party Will Not Join the Cabinet; the Youth Party's Opinion is Given to Lei Zhen to Take to Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Democratic Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the new Cabinet under the Constitution, and there is no need to retain the original quota for political councilors. Xu Fulin has directly replied to Weng Wenhao with this opinion. Weng hopes to continue cooperation and retain the quota. Xu and Yang Junming came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. Xu said that the issue of legislators must be reasonably resolved, but participation in the new Cabinet is unrelated to this. Even if the issue of legislators is resolved, they do not intend to participate in the Executive Yuan, because there are many difficulties in the current political situation, and participation will not improve it. It is better not to participate. The supervisors of the Democratic Socialist Party will also not report for duty for the time being. As for senior advisors and Grand Justices, they can still be considered.

[Our Dispatch] Mo Dehui arrived in Shanghai yesterday and immediately visited Zhang Junli at Fan Garden, hoping to break the current deadlock of the Democratic Socialist Party. However, it is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on resolving the issue of legislators before discussing participation in the Executive Yuan. Yesterday noon, the Standing Committee of the party invited Lei Zhen to a banquet, and exchanged views during the banquet. Lei strongly urged the party to nominate political councilors to participate in the new Cabinet, even if they cannot participate in ministries, but no new suggestions were put forward.

Also, the Youth Party issued a statement last night, stating that whether the party will participate in the new Cabinet still depends on the resolution of the issue of legislators. As of the end of the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 29th, there was no decision on whether to participate or not. The party's official opinion has been submitted to Lei Zhen, and Lei returned to Nanjing by night on the 29th to report.

[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 29th] Mo Dehui arrived in Hangzhou on the evening of the 29th for sightseeing.

[Central News Agency, This City] Political Councilor Lei Zhen negotiated with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Shanghai yesterday on the issue of legislator quotas and participation in the new Executive Yuan. In the morning, Lei visited the responsible persons of the Youth Party for detailed talks. At noon, the Democratic Socialist Party hosted a banquet for Lei to express their attitude. It is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party still adheres to its past position on the issue of legislators, demanding that it be resolved according to the original agreement. The party also expressed to Lei its determination not to participate in the new Executive Yuan, but public opinion organizations such as the provincial, municipal, and county councils will continue to participate. Although a few issues of the elected supervisors of the party remain to be resolved, there will be no problem for the party to participate in the Control Yuan.

### Yu Youren Does Not Participate in the Control Yuan Presidential Election

Fourteen More Supervisors Report for Duty

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Fourteen more supervisors reported for duty on the 29th for the first Control Yuan under the Constitution, including Cao Haosen, Chen Fangxian, Yan Zhuang, Yang Hu, and Jin Weixi, bringing the total to fifty-six. The Preparatory Committee's regular meeting on the 29th was not held and was rescheduled for 9:00 AM on the 31st. All subordinate departments will submit specific reports and conduct reviews.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] I recently met with President Yu Youren and inquired about his views on the Control Yuan under the Constitution. President Yu believes that the establishment of the Control Yuan under the Constitution marks the formal launch of the Five-Power Constitution from experimentation. This will surely have a great inspiration in the world's political system. The supervisors of this Control Yuan were mostly elected separately from various places, gathering elites from all over the country. The establishment of the new Control Yuan will surely be able to fully exercise its powers and provide significant assistance to the new political situation. As for himself, he has long resigned as a member of the Control Yuan. After the establishment of this new Control Yuan, he will not only not participate in the election of the new president, but will absolutely not seek any position. This opinion has been repeatedly expressed publicly recently, and I hope that all sectors of society will understand.

The elite troops of the National Army, the Zhou Division, the Yu Division, the Huang Division, and the Wang Division, are divided into northern and southern corps. After the northern Qiu Regiment captured Funing, the Zhou Division occupied the west bank of Tongyanggang on the 28th, confronting the bandits across the river. The bandits stubbornly defending this area are parts of the Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns of Teng Zhi. The bandit chieftain Guan Wenwei's headquarters is stationed in Hede Town, only 40 li away from the bandit's nest.

### Lapham Will Arrive in Shanghai This Week; Stilman Leads the Industrial Group to Accompany Him; Zhang Jia'ao Serves as a Standing Committee Member of the US Aid Application Committee

It is also reported that the House of Representatives is scheduled to deal with the foreign aid appropriation issue on June 3rd.

[Our Dispatch] After Zhang Jia'ao resigned as Governor of the Central Bank, rumors spread that he would actually preside over the application of US aid. Our reporter specifically waited for Zhang yesterday to inquire about the matter. Zhang said, "I am assisting in planning the application of US aid as a standing member of the US Aid Application Committee. The standing committee members were originally the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, and Mr. Miao Yuntai. I have resigned from my position at the Central Bank, but I am still employed as a standing member, and I will do my best as a citizen." Regarding the application of US aid, Zhang emphasized the US view, which emphasizes the combination of self-help and mutual assistance. In this way, the increase in US aid can stabilize prices and stabilize the entire economy. For example, the United States is helping us with food today and also hopes that our country will increase its own production to maintain and expand today's rationing system. The supply of US cotton also expects that our country can increase the production of yarn and cloth, which can be exported in exchange for more raw materials. These two examples can summarize the rest. As for the cash obtained from the sale of materials, with the consent of the United States, it can also be used to subsidize finance and reduce issuance. However, based on the principle of self-help, our country should also increase tax revenue at the same time to cooperate. Zhang finally stated that in order to make US aid effective in stabilizing our country's economy, we must promote the atmosphere of hard work and thrift.

Approximately more than 20 million US dollars can be obtained for repairing part of the Yuehan Railway. When Song was in Nanjing, rumors spread that a special agency would be established to construct South China. He specifically denied this and said that construction in Guangdong Province is already actively underway. For example, the Huangpu Port project has been approved by the central government for 300 billion yuan and self-raised 200 billion yuan and has already started construction. The funds for the highway parallel to the Yuehan Railway have also been secured. The provincial government is now planning to use US loans to install a complete provincial telephone system. A reporter asked him about his opinion on Weng Wenhao's long Executive Yuan. He said that he is currently serving in the local government and should not criticize the central government, but he believes that the new cabinet will have a new policy on finance and stabilizing prices. In addition, regarding the import and export control system, he advocated that imports should be relaxed. As for the issue of exports, the difficulties can be easily solved if the entire currency system problem is resolved. As for the serious issue of the soaring rice prices in Shantou, he said that more than 3,000 bags of rice have been transported to Shantou for relief, and rationing can be implemented there before June 10, at which time rice prices are expected to stabilize.

### A Major Battle Unfolds Around the Periphery of Chengde; Reports of the National Army Abandoning Luanping are Inaccurate; It is Rumored that Fu Zuoyi Has Not Left Beiping; Shangguan Yunxiang Goes to the Ping-Gu Line to Supervise the Troops

[Our Chengde Dispatch, 29th] The battle lines have been drawn on the outskirts of Chengde, with the vanguard troops of the surrounding bandits beginning to launch probing attacks. On the afternoon of the 28th, contact occurred in the areas of Dongbeitougou southeast of the city, Xiaban Village, and Guangyuanling west of the city. The defending troops bravely fought back, engaging in artillery battles for two hours. The bandits, unable to withstand the attacks, temporarily retreated.

Approximately 10,000 troops from the main force of the Eighth Column of bandits have infiltrated Cangzi, ten kilometers east of Chengde.

Reports that Fu Zuoyi went to the Ping-Gu line on the 28th to supervise the troops are inaccurate. He spent the entire day in Beiping meeting with various parties. The spokesman for the Bandit Suppression Headquarters stated that the so-called "Commander Fu De" is likely a misunderstanding of "Deputy Commander" Shangguan Yunxiang.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 29th] Reports of abandoning Luanping after the loss of Longhua are inaccurate. According to reliable statistics, the bandits suffered over 10,000 casualties in the battle of Longhua. Furthermore, the morale here is stable, and prices are gradually stabilizing.

### The Problem of Refugee Resettlement in Sanmen Bay

— Chen Shenxiu

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, seeking to provide relief to refugees from all directions arriving in Shanghai, proposed transferring refugees to reclaim and develop Sanmen Bay; it is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs will also support this. Utilizing the surplus labor of refugees to develop national resources, while simultaneously resolving the refugees' livelihood issues, is an extremely wise move. I recall that when the August 13th Incident first erupted, refugees poured into the Shanghai concessions. The former Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Director Pan, together with charitable organizations such as the Renji Shantang, established the Refugee Resettlement Association, providing funds to approximately one thousand refugees to relocate to Jiangxi for reclamation. The results were acceptable, and they still reside in the Gan-Nan area today. This demonstrates that resettlement is a legitimate solution. Currently, Shanghai's capacity to accommodate refugees seems to have reached saturation. Beggars can be seen everywhere on the streets, which is truly a disgrace to the government! If timely resettlement can be implemented, it would not only be a great act of benevolence towards the refugees but also a current need for the Shanghai municipality. The Bureau of Social Affairs is currently widely gathering information on refugee resettlement. Any reclamation plans that can utilize land and the refugees' own labor to solve their livelihoods and achieve the purpose of relief, without consuming large amounts of financial and material resources, are being collected and studied; their destinations are naturally not limited to Sanmen Bay.

Sanmen Bay is one of the coastal bays in Zhejiang, extending from Shipu (a fishing port in the industrial plan) in Xiangshan Port in the north to Kui Pu in the south, and connecting to Taizhou Bay at the mouth of the Ling River. To its east lie the Zhoushan Islands. Dinghai Shenjiamen, famous for its fish market, and Putuoshan, a Buddhist holy site, are part of the Zhoushan Islands. Sanmen Bay uses Shipu as its outlet and Haiyou as its center, with approximately 500 kilometers of coastline facing the sea to the southeast. The voyage from Ningbo to Shipu takes six hours, and the steamboat ride from Shipu to Haiyou also takes several hours.

South of Shipu lies Nantian Island, the only large island in Sanmen Bay. Nantian was a restricted area during the Qing Dynasty. A civilizing commission was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and a county was established at the beginning of the Republic, named Nantian County. The coasts of Sanmen Bay were under the jurisdiction of Ninghai County and Linhai County. In July 1940 (Republic Year 29), the Zhejiang Provincial Government established Sanmen County, with Haiyou Town as the temporary county seat, abolishing Nantian County, making it a district of Sanmen County. Sanmen County has jurisdiction over the southeastern part of the former Ninghai County, the northeastern part of Linhai County, and the original area of Nantian County, including the entire Sanmen Bay bay and the coastal land. From then on, the geographical Sanmen Bay and the administrative region of Sanmen County became one. In the past, Sanmen Bay was divided between Nantian, Ninghai, and Linhai counties, making it difficult to coordinate policies and causing variations in progress. Therefore, the establishment of Sanmen County is an important step in developing Sanmen Bay.

Sanmen County has a population of 150,000 (156,840 in 1944), with over half relying on the sea for their livelihoods. The benefits of fishing and salt also account for half of the county's total income. Residents say: "Seeking from the mountains is not as good as seeking from the sea." Every year, during the fishing season, five to six hundred pairs of fishing boats go out to sea to fish, with each pair catching forty to fifty dan of fish each time. The salt fields are mostly located in Jiantiao and Fengpu (South Bay), producing 100,000 dan of salt annually.

As mentioned earlier, Sanmen Bay uses Shipu as its sea outlet and Haiyou as its center. Haiyou is currently the seat of Sanmen County and is connected to Shipu by steamboat, which can transfer to Ningbo and Shanghai. By land, from Haiyou, one can reach Fenghua and Ningbo via Ninghai, or Xinchang, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou via Tiantai, all within a day's journey after the highways are repaired. Major roads and telephones within the county connect to important towns such as Tingpang and Jiantiao. The entire county of Sanmen has approximately 200,000 mu of cultivated land, mainly used for rice cultivation. Ramie and jute are planted on the mountains, and cotton is planted on the newly reclaimed land along the dikes. However, the most noteworthy is the tidal flat, which is the focus of developing Sanmen Bay. The county of Sanmen has over 5,000 mu of tidal flats, including 8,000 mu of Danantian tidal flat, 50,000 mu of Shepan tidal flat, 10,000 mu of Maotou tidal flat, 15,000 mu of Zhengyu tidal flat, 6,000 mu of Laoren Yan tidal flat, 5,000 mu of Jiankangtang tidal flat, and 5,000 mu of Yu'ao tidal flat. The total accumulation of tidal flats, barren mountains, and wastelands in the county exceeds 1.1 million mu. The Zhejiang Province has had a coastal surveying team conduct on-site measurements. Other Daidong birds lay eggs on stones (building materials), which are very salty and can be transported to Shanghai for construction needs.

The economic geography of Sanmen Bay is briefly described above. The area of cultivated land is only one-fifth of the total area, while the benefits of fishing and salt are inexhaustible, as the saying goes, "Ten years of seeking from the mountains is like an instant of taking from the sea." The future of developing Sanmen Bay should be very promising. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan, regarding the construction of a port in Shipu and the development of Sanmen Bay, indeed has foresight, and it is easy to follow and absolutely achievable.

Among the bays and islands along Sanmen Bay, Nantian Island, which has been developed for the past thirty years since the Republic and was formerly the seat of Nantian County and is now the Nantian District of Sanmen County, can be considered relatively mature. Nantian is surrounded by the sea on all sides, with a population of 23,298 (1944). The island has both northern and southern fishing mountains. Throughout the county, whether on the coast or in the mountains, most are barren and bare, while in Nantian District, there are lush forests and bamboo groves on the mountains, and fishing boats are connected at the sea mouth. The residents enjoy both mountain delicacies and seafood, which is unmatched by other coastal lifestyles. This point must be observed from the development history of Sanmen Bay. Nantian was a restricted area during the Qing Dynasty, and a civilizing commission was not established until shortly before the Republic. At that time, the coast of Sanmen Bay was sparsely populated. One reason was that the local residents were not numerous, and another reason was that the coast of Sanmen Bay was the border area of counties such as Ninghai, and the land at the corner of the coast was not paid much attention to. Nantian Island, however, was established as a county after the Republic and gradually prospered. However, the ratio of the productive population to the land's productivity in Nantian District is still insufficient. The 8,000 mu of tidal flat listed above (Danantian tidal flat) are waiting to be developed.

For forty years, the possible ways to advocate the development of Sanmen Bay and the future development of Sanmen Bay have been nothing more than (1) building a military port, (2) building a fishing port, (3) building a city, and (4) agricultural reclamation.

The possibility of building a military port in Sanmen started with Italy's attempt to lease it as a military port during the Guangxu years. Geographically, Sanmen Bay is backed by high mountains on the northwest side of the land, and the bay can avoid wind. Its position is south of 30 degrees north latitude, making it a natural ice-free port. According to the Genxu Marine Survey Report, very deep draft giant ships can be moored. The Eastern Great Port in the Industrial Plan seems to have been intended to replace Shanghai before the unequal Treaty of Nanjing was abolished. Now, the importance of the Eastern Great Port has diminished, but the importance of building ports in Xiangshan Port and Sanmen Bay has increased. The agricultural products along the coast of Sanmen are sufficient to supply the needs of a naval base, and the Haiyou River can be used to generate hydroelectric power to supply electricity, which is sufficient as a condition for a naval base.

Building a fishing port in Sanmen Bay was originally set in the Industrial Plan. The conditions for constructing a fishing port are nothing more than convenient transportation and sales, improved fishing gear, and equipment for fish processing plants and ice-making plants, and the most important thing is abundant fishery production. According to old fishermen in Sanmen Bay, during the fishing season in Sanmen Bay, only three to four tenths of the fish species are caught by fishing boats. If new-style fishing boats can be used, the output can be greatly increased. As for the transportation and sales of fishery products, there is no problem, but the processing and refrigeration equipment is very expensive, and the general public has low knowledge, so the improvement of fisheries and the lives of fishermen is not progressing.

The theory of building a city in Sanmen has also been advocated for many years. The author believes that there is little hope of building a commercial city in Sanmen Bay. Because Sanmen Bay is bordered by the sea on three sides in terms of topography. As far as seaports are concerned, there are Ningbo in the north, and Wenzhou and Taizhou in the south, which are sufficient for the import and export of goods along the coast of eastern Zhejiang. The counties of Tiantai and Xianju, which are adjacent to Sanmen Bay, are both impoverished areas. West of Xianju, Dongyang and Yiwu already belong to the scope of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, so there is no need for Sanmen Bay to be a seaport. Even if the planned Sanyi Railway (Sanmen to Yiwu) is completed, the commercial status of Sanmen cannot replace Shanghai. Precisely because of this, the possibility and necessity of building the Sanyi Railway are also greatly reduced.

The greatest possibility for developing Sanmen Bay is still agricultural reclamation. Agricultural reclamation can resettle the majority of farmers who do not have specialized technical knowledge. There is also a considerable amount of land available for agricultural reclamation in Sanmen, and it is easier to start with agricultural reclamation. Agricultural reclamation must have land, capital, and labor, but given the current social instability, the government's authority is still needed to address security issues. Some of the land in Sanmen Bay is privately owned and has already been cultivated; some has already been claimed by the people but not yet developed; and some is still a tidal flat and needs to be embanked and freshened. Therefore, there must be some reorganization and clearing in terms of land rights and land distribution. In terms of labor, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is natural to utilize the labor of refugees while solving their livelihoods. However, the reclamation of wasteland is certainly a difficult road, without any support. Refugees relying on the city can temporarily survive, but whether the beaches and wastelands, with the tides coming and going, will make the refugees retreat depends on the government's orders. Whether the government can make arrangements and issue calls beforehand seems to be an important issue for resettlement. Therefore, land strength, financial strength, authority, human strength, and military strength can be said to be the prerequisites for resettlement.

Last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration cooperated to reclaim the wasteland on the shores of Mushan Lake in Yuyao, and organized a reclamation committee to take charge. A total of 3,700 mu of wasteland was reclaimed. It is estimated that there will be a harvest this autumn. These 3,700 mu of land have been allocated to 133 farm households, with an average of approximately 20 mu per household. The average yield per mu is two shi of rice (calculated for newly reclaimed land), equivalent to one shi of rice. Twenty mu is equivalent to twenty shi of rice, which can feed an average family of five. How much manpower and financial resources were spent on the reclamation of Mushan Lake? According to reports, 88 tons of work-relief flour from the RRA and 2,000 shi of rice from Yuyao County were spent, using eight traction machines over the course of a year. This is a very practical example. In terms of national wealth, it is beneficial in the coming years; if the current cost and benefit is calculated, this reclamation seems to be a loss. To develop Sanmen Bay, the government must lead, take a broad and long-term view, spare no effort, set up agencies, and use talent before it can be calculated on a schedule. If it is still viewed from the general perspective of seeking profit from capital, then it is safe to say that after fifty years, it will still be the Sanmen Bay of fifty years ago. Objectively speaking, moving to Sanmen is a very urgent need at present; to achieve this need, it itself requires many conditions, and even more, it requires the government and society to be determined to do it.

### Authorities Investigating the Burning Car Incident in Taipei; Compensation for the Deceased Awaits Discussion

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 29th] The tragedy of the burning car that occurred yesterday on the Xindian River Iron Bridge, originally named Showa Bridge, in the suburbs of Taipei City, is of great concern to Chairman Wei. He specifically instructed Li Yizhong, the Director of the Social Affairs Department, to visit the injured at the Railway Hospital and Taipei Hospital this morning and provide emergency relief. Regarding the exact number of casualties, according to the Railway Bureau, 23 people were burned to death, 16 died from injuries, and 48 are hospitalized. However, the three passenger cars carried approximately 240 passengers. In addition to the 87 dead and injured who have been accounted for, the whereabouts of the remaining 100-plus people are unknown. According to the Railway Bureau, they have all safely returned home. However, more than 100 family members gathered in the accident area and in front of the two hospitals today, all inquiring about news and the whereabouts of those missing. The reporter will go to the scene again this afternoon to inspect it. Dismembered limbs, wrecked cars, and ashes are everywhere, making it impossible to accurately count the number of casualties. Residents downstream have seen the bodies of passengers who fell into the river floating by, but it has been impossible to retrieve them. Regarding the issue of responsibility, the provincial authorities have begun investigating the cause of the fire. According to the injured, they heard a loud bang at the time and smelled burning celluloid, which was clearly caused by the ignition of camphor powder. As for the fact that the car stopped on top of the bridge, making it difficult for passengers to escape, the Railway Bureau stated that it was caused by the burning of the wind nest, making it impossible to drive. In terms of the aftermath, in addition to the emergency relief from the Provincial Government, the Railway Bureau has set up an inquiry office to allow family members to inquire and register missing injured persons and to bear medical expenses. Coffins will be provided for the deceased first, and the issue of compensation is still awaiting discussion.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Wei recently approved the allocation of 7 million yuan to the Railway Bureau as relief funds for the passengers in distress. The Railway Bureau has also decided to donate approximately 15 million yuan, one day's earnings of all employees on the line, as relief funds.

[Our Ningbo Dispatch, 29th] Four hundred traitorous bandits gathered at Shangwanggang in the Siming Mountain area on the morning of the 28th. Upon receiving the report, the Zhejiang Security Brigade dispatched troops to suppress them. The two sides encountered each other and engaged in fierce fighting. The Zhejiang Security Team used howitzers to bombard the bandits. At that time, the bandits occupied the high ground and had a favorable position. The security team soldiers crawled forward, charging upwards five or six times. They charged up the mountain, and the bandits, unable to withstand the attack, retreated towards Duozigang. The soldiers followed and pursued, and the bandits retreated to Xiawoshan. Because the soldiers were chasing closely, the bandits fought like cornered beasts. The fierce battle had not stopped by late at night. The casualties on both sides were heavy and are currently being investigated. It was the fiercest battle since the bandit suppression in Siming Mountain.

### The Mystery of Yang Mei's Abstinence from Food; Chongqing Medical Circles Hold a Forum; A Heated Debate Occurs; Yang Mei Also Attends as a Listener

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the mystery of Yang Mei's abstinence from food, the Chongqing medical community held a debate with Director Li Zhiyu of the Health Bureau at 4:00 PM this afternoon. An Longzhang, the chairman of the Chongqing Physicians' Association, and Han Mingju, a famous doctor who studied in Germany, have always believed that the Health Bureau's observation methods are not rigorous enough, and they cannot conclude that she has not eaten in the past nine years simply because Yang has not eaten for nineteen days. Huang Yuecong, the director of the Wuhan Liao Yi Hospital, cited the names and times of people who did not eat in history, and stated that short-term fasting can treat epilepsy. Li replied that Yang Mei has not been found to have engaged in any fraudulent behavior. At the time of constitutional rule, only this method can be used for preliminary observation, because the Health Bureau has no reason to force her to enter the hospital. Zhen Maoguang, the director of the Army Hospital, emphasized that it is necessary to research to the end, otherwise it is a disgrace to the scientific community, and science is changing with each passing day. Even if Yang Mei has not eaten for three months, there is no need to worry about overturning science.

Dr. Peng Guangqin firmly stated that science needs to observe facts and draw conclusions from the facts. There is no need to be too curious about Yang Mei. It does not have to be that she does not eat at all to have value. Since she has no habit of eating, this abnormal behavior is worth studying. Furthermore, Hu Xianhua, the director who has been in charge of Yang Mei's observation for the past twenty days, reported Yang Mei's characteristics for the past nineteen days: (1) Her weight has decreased imperceptibly. (2) Her oral temperature is 92 degrees Fahrenheit on cloudy days and 96 degrees Fahrenheit on sunny days, changing with the climate. (3) The first urination contains abnormal substances such as urea, oxygen, etc., such as excess Creatinine. The most interested participant in the meeting was Yang Mei, who arrived at the venue at 4:30 PM to listen and left after sitting for five minutes. She was generous and had no habit of closing her mouth. The scientists respected this fair-skinned, big-eyed girl. When she was listening at the venue, the speakers automatically changed their address to "Miss Yang".

### Eight Labor Heroes in Taiwan Province Receive Award Banners

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The recently completed Danajiaodong Dike in Tainan and the Beinan Dike in Taitung, Taiwan Province, can be considered models of cooperation between the government and the people in Taiwan Province. Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming presented award banners to eight "Labor Heroes" with outstanding work achievements at a meeting in Taitung yesterday. He also ordered the county government to provide compensation for the two head of cattle that died due to overwork.

### Testing Yang Mei Should Be Divided Into Three Stages: Interview with the Director of Yuzhong Central Hospital

[Another Telegram] Although the Health Bureau has proven that Yang Mei does not eat, skepticism remains due to the lack of participation of scientists in the observation. Hu Xianwen, the director of Central Hospital during the last ten days, spoke frankly to our reporter about dividing the testing of Yang Mei into three stages: (1) Whether Yang Mei truly does not eat. (2) The different characteristics between Yang Mei after not eating and ordinary people and professional fasters. (3) Why Yang Mei does not eat. Stages (1) and (2) can be carried out simultaneously. Due to objections from the guardian, Zhuo Songdai, only a preliminary 21-day observation of not eating has been conducted. To date, he guarantees with his reputation that Yang Mei has not eaten or defecated. He frankly stated that the existing records of pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, etc., are of little value, and the scales in the Municipal Hospital are also unreliable, with the spring scales being heavy in the front and light in the back. He weighed twice at the same time, and the difference was two kilograms. Therefore, whether Yang Mei's weight has decreased is still questionable. Hu expressed opposition to Zhuo's insistence on sending Yang Mei back to the Jiulongpo Health Bureau to have another nurse continue the observation after 21 days. According to what he knows, Yang Mei is not interested in returning to Zhuo's residence, and rumors that Yang Mei is dissatisfied with the strict surveillance by the nurses are Zhuo's false statements to the outside world. He concluded by saying that if Zhuo insists on his own opinion, he will publish the details to the public after Yang Mei leaves the Municipal Hospital. Hu graduated from Xiangya Medical College and studied in India during the war. He is a famous internist in Chongqing. In addition, Gu Bingliang of the Information Bureau came to Chongqing to photograph Yang Mei, and will fly to Nanjing tomorrow to report.

### Hankou Dock Workers' Union Director Detained for Bribing with Bird's Nest and Gold Bracelets

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 29th] The dispute between Hejiadun and Dazhimen docks in Hankou, which has been mixed for more than a year, has recently caused a shocking bribery case. According to the representatives of Hejiadun, Gu Qiyin, the director of the dock workers' union, and the representatives of Dazhimen workers, bribed the heads of various institutions with 80,000 silver dollars and some gold bars, respectively, in order to protect themselves. The Bureau Chief Ren of the Police Bureau, who was also identified as one of the targets of the bribery, also frankly admitted that Yin had indeed bribed him with a pair of gold bracelets and a box of bird's nests, but he had sternly refused to accept them and had already returned them through someone. As a result, Mayor Xu and the heads of various institutions were even more shocked and wanted to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to clear their names. Ruan Qi, the commander of the garrison, even ordered the arrest of the bribers and dealt with them according to law, in order to clarify the truth. According to reports, this case has been noisy for a long time, and the Control Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense have both started investigations. The public generally praises Bureau Chief Ren's integrity and courage to reveal the truth.

### Marshall Accuses the Soviet Union of Malicious Propaganda: Obstructing US Efforts for Peace: The Foundation of US-Soviet Negotiations Was Destroyed

[Reuters Portland, Oregon, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall gave a speech to the Federation of Women's Associations here on the 28th, accusing the Soviet government of deliberately and maliciously engaging in propaganda campaigns to obstruct the United States' efforts to launch negotiations in good faith to resolve world problems. He said that if the Soviet government could abandon certain practices and actions that have plunged the world into unrest and disorder, it could create a new atmosphere in the international community, and the United States government would never ignore it. Marshall also told the American people that the European people are now afraid that the United States is unreliable, and deeply fear that the United States will change its will and abandon the European recovery plan. But he also said that since the beginning of this year, good progress has been made in obtaining peace and security and restoring world prosperity. He believes that if the United States continues its firm policy, it will be able to solve the worst difficulties and establish a perfect foundation for peace. He is convinced that only this firm path can save the status of democracy. When Marshall mentioned the enthusiastic discussions in the United States regarding the recent exchange of documents between the United States and the Soviet Union, he pointed out that those engaged in these discussions have ignored the fact that the Soviet government is launching a deliberate and malicious propaganda offensive against the United States to undermine the United States' efforts to find a basis for negotiations to resolve world problems in good faith. It should be noted that the recent statements made by Foreign Minister Molotov and Premier Stalin, which have specific purposes, are intended to gain propaganda benefits and make the United States, that is, the world, distort the United States' sincerity in seeking understanding. The United States government must maintain its consistent principles of action. The United States government must not take actions that may be effective for a while but damage the integrity of the United States' future policies, and at the same time hopes that the American people will not be deceived by propaganda actions that do not reveal the facts. The methods of modern totalitarian propaganda create the impression that actions that do not represent the true situation or success are possible. Past negotiations have failed to achieve the cooperation needed to stabilize the world situation and develop a basis for peace. There is now a strong demand in the United States for agreements to eliminate the fear of war and restore normalcy. Therefore, any statements that lack practical action and are insincere are met with outrage. He believes that no one is more determined than him to obtain peace and security and restore world prosperity. However, in his capacity as Secretary of State, he must not allow the United States to be driven by temporary emotions and accept obligations or actions that threaten its future. The fear in Europe is actually due to a misunderstanding of the way American policies are developing. Today's world is in a state of deep unrest. The unfortunate people of the world already know that their interests cannot be compared with those of other nations. If they are not given some hope, they may not be able to avoid a frenzy, because this unrest will be the ideal environment for those who advocate violence to operate.

### Jiang Tingfu's Speech Describes the Situation in China

[United Press Portland, Oregon, 28th] Dr. Jiang Tingfu, China's representative to the United Nations Security Council, said in a speech to the Portland City Association today that although the situation in China is similar to that of Russia in 1917, the Chinese people are fond of individual freedom, so he believes that China will not become a communist country. He said, "In terms of territory, population, illiteracy, lack of democratic experience and extreme poverty, Russia in 1917 and China in 1948 are very similar."

In addition, both countries have an intellectual class studying abroad and different foreign ideas, many of which are not suitable for China." Jiang said that the biggest difference between the two countries is that the Chinese love individual freedom and that China has no large landlords. He declared that the Chinese people living under communist rule are afraid of communism like snakes and scorpions, and millions of people often flee from the communist areas to the National Army areas, and no one flees in the opposite direction. Jiang said that due to the difficulty of implementing rationing and direct taxes, it is difficult to control China's inflation. He said, "It seems impossible to ration goods consumed on the spot, and land owners and bank deposits in China often use multiple names to open accounts, so direct taxes are also almost impossible to implement. One person can own countless seals, so the true owner of land deposits cannot be revealed."

### Soviet Union Violates Agreements 37 Times

This document was submitted by the government at the request of 31 senators.

### Wallace Condemns US Anti-Communist Bill

[United Press Washington, 29th] Henry Wallace, the presidential candidate of the Third Party, testified in the Senate Judiciary Committee today, condemning the anti-communist bill as a "declaration of war" against American rights, and said that if the bill becomes law, the Third Party does not intend to obey. Wallace also said that this measure undermines the basic guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. He denounced the anti-communist bill passed by the House of Representatives as "full of falsehoods," and although it claims to prevent autocracy, it "makes the United States Attorney General the dictator of every organization in the country." Wallace claimed that he and his party advocated US-Soviet "peace talks," so they are at risk of being fined and imprisoned under the bill. Wallace reiterated that the target of the anti-communist bill is not communism but democracy.

### Berlin Allied Military Government to Cease to Exist

Yesterday's Meeting Ended Unhappily

[United Press Berlin, 29th] In an atmosphere of East-West hostility, the four-power Berlin military government ended unhappily after meeting for 15 hours. Signs indicate that the four-power military government will soon cease to exist.

[Reuters Berlin, 29th] The Berlin Four-Power Joint Command met at 10:00 am Berlin time on the 28th and ended at 1:15 am on the 29th, lasting 15 hours and 15 minutes. The only agreement reached was to agree to suspend the meeting for lunch at noon and to suspend it for tea and snacks in the afternoon. All items on the agenda were removed from the agenda because no agreement was reached. During the discussion, British representative Major General Herbert once accused the Soviet representative of deliberately circling and not being sincere in the discussion. He also pointed out that the Soviet side requisitioned labor and used it to mine uranium in Saxony. He also said that production in the Soviet zone has declined sharply, and taxes are heavy, with each person paying 450 marks in taxes, while each person in the Western zone only pays 270 marks. The total tax revenue in the Soviet zone is 8 billion marks, and 6 billion pounds are requisitioned by the Soviet authorities for compensation, occupation fees, and other expenses. US representative General Hollett also said that 45% of the industrial production in the Soviet zone of Berlin is produced for the benefit of the Soviet Union. According to the Berlin Four-Power Joint Command, it is the only four-power institution still operating in Berlin. The Four-Power Allied Control Council has been suspended since the Soviet representative withdrew from the meeting on March 20.

### After the Surrender of Jewish Forces in the Old City of Jerusalem, Arab Forces Continue to Besiege the New City: Jewish and Arab Forces Engage in a Decisive Battle in Latrun

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 29th] Following the capture of the Old City of Jerusalem, the Arab Legion, led by the King of Transjordan, has besieged the New City of Jerusalem and is bombarding Jewish strongholds with mortars and heavy artillery.

Another part of the Arab forces is advancing towards the Latrun area on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, completely isolating the Jewish forces in Jerusalem and preventing essential supplies from reaching the Jewish defenders. Arab tanks, mortars, and reinforcements are continuously entering the Latrun area. At the same time, Egyptian aircraft are bombing Jewish concentration areas in Hulda and Shaar Hagai, four miles west of the area. It appears that the Transjordanian forces are adopting the same tactics that won them the victory in the Old City of Jerusalem to attack the New City, namely cutting off outside aid and attacking internally until surrender. Arab officials claim that among the 2,500 Jews who surrendered in the Old City, 500 were combatants and 2,000 were women and children. The 500 combatants were transported by truck to a prisoner-of-war camp near Amman on the evening of the 25th, while the women and children are being detained by relief organizations.

[United Press International, Hulda, 29th] On the 29th, Israeli forces, using an entire armored brigade and air force, are confronting the Arab Legion in Latrun, striving to open the Jerusalem highway lifeline and reinforce the Israeli defenders in the New City of Jerusalem. Every mortar, field gun, armored vehicle, and aircraft under Israeli command has been rushed to the front line to strengthen the Israeli offensive. The elite troops of King Abdullah's Arab Legion are now firmly defending Latrun, having been ordered to hold the highway and not be overrun by the Jewish reinforcements attempting to relieve the siege of the New City of Jerusalem. All indications now suggest that the Arab Legion, trained by the British, and the Jewish veterans of the British Army will soon engage in the first armored battle of the Palestine war on the Shephelah plain. The battlefield is located on the eastern edge of the Shephelah plain, about eight miles southeast of Rehovot. The commander of the Jewish forces at the front is a former high-ranking British military officer.

### The Security Council Will Vote on Three Resolutions on the Holy Land Proposed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and France; Our Representative Supports the British Proposal for a One-Month Truce

[Report from this Newspaper] Lake Success, New York, 29th Broadcast: Soviet Representative Gromyko today launched another major attack in the Security Council against the policies of other countries regarding Palestine, strongly advocating the adoption of the Soviet proposal for strong United Nations intervention in the situation in the Holy Land. Gromyko pointed out that the American proposal violates the resolutions of the General Assembly and is therefore illegal if adopted. British Representative Jebb retorted, calling Gromyko's accusations malicious insults. Both the British and Soviet proposals are unlikely to pass. The Security Council has decided to first put the Soviet proposal to a vote.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The Security Council is scheduled to resume discussion of the Palestine issue on the 29th to find ways to halt the fighting there. There are three draft resolutions pending discussion by the Security Council: one is the British resolution, which calls for a four-week truce and prohibits the import of any weapons or armaments into Palestine; one is the Soviet resolution, which calls for the Security Council to order both sides in the Palestine conflict to cease fire within 36 hours, otherwise, it will recognize that the situation there has already disrupted peace and implement sanctions in accordance with the Charter; and one is the French resolution, which calls for the United Nations to implement sanctions if the ceasefire order cannot be implemented.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Security Council will vote on the Palestine issue on the 29th. The Soviet proposal currently has only five votes of the necessary seven-vote majority. As for the two votes from Belgium and Argentina that could enable the Soviet proposal to pass, it is rumored that they are still hesitating before the final vote. United Nations officials believe that even if the Soviet proposal can obtain seven votes, it will not guarantee that Britain will not use its veto power.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] When the Security Council resumed discussion of the British and Soviet resolutions on Palestine on the 28th, the opinions of the representatives were quite divergent. China and Canada both supported the British proposal for a one-month truce. American officials in Washington stated that the British proposal could serve as a basis for improving British-American relations. They also said that the Soviet proposal, which calls for the Security Council to take coercive action, is unlikely to be passed by the Security Council. The United States will still vote in favor of the British proposal at that time. Ukrainian Representative Tarasenko pointed out that the British resolution clearly favors one side against the other.

### Bevin Does Not Wish to Argue About the Holy Land Issue

Britain Denies It Is Studying New Methods

[Reuters, London, 29th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in an address to the Women's Labor League, stated that he has not participated in the verbal debates about Palestine in the United States and elsewhere because he is working to find opinions that he believes will ultimately lead to a resolution of the Palestine issue. He pointed out that considerable progress has been made in efforts to develop peace and coordination around the world. He then said: "Even in war-torn Palestine, people are eager for a resolution to the problem." Referring to economic issues, he said that with the assistance of the Marshall Plan, Britain and other countries will easily be able to restore production and living standards to pre-war levels, which is what everyone deeply hopes for.

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Foreign Office recently denied rumors that the British government is studying new methods to resolve the Palestine issue, which will be submitted to the United States government. The spokesman believes that United Nations-appointed Palestine mediator Bernadotte will easily facilitate negotiations between the Jews and Arabs.

### French Prime Minister Faces Another Crisis: Requests a Vote of Confidence on the Dismissal of Civil Servants

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schuman, who is seeking a vote of confidence from the parliament for the bill to allow the government to dismiss 150,000 civil servants, is facing a dangerous new threat. This new crisis arose because Prime Minister Schuman and Minister of Health Madame Chabouis of the Popular Republican Movement signed an order some days ago that indirectly allowed national public funds to subsidize children in church schools. Schuman and Madame Chabouis did not consult with the Socialist and Radical Party cabinet members before signing the order. It is heard that the Socialist Party intends to demand the revocation of the order as a condition for voting confidence in Schuman. The Popular Republican Movement is now working behind the scenes, hoping to pass the vote of confidence next Tuesday. If he unfortunately fails to gain a vote of confidence, Schuman, who has threatened to resign six times in just seven months in office, will have to step down.

### The National Party in South Africa Takes Power: Britain Feels Deeply Uneasy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] After the leader of the South African National Party, Malan, defeated Smuts in the general election and is about to form a new cabinet, he will also be invited to attend the Commonwealth conference with Smuts. Britain may not be able to remain neutral on the South African issue, as every Commonwealth country maintains close ties with London. Malan's victory has caused extreme anxiety in British political circles, as the party is known for being anti-British, anti-black, anti-Jewish, and pro-Nazi.

### The Soviet Union Develops Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands: Establishes Collective Farms and Fishing Grounds

### To Adapt to Atomic Warfare: The United States Plans to Train New Troops; Research on Fluid Tactics in the Far East Zone Completed

[Reuters, Camberley, Surrey, 29th] Senior officers of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force held a week-long "paper exercise" at the Staff College here to study the "design and execution of fluid tactics in the Far East theater of war." After the exercise, Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, gave a speech to reporters, discussing his views on reforming the British Army after the war. He believes that a true state of preparedness is more necessary now than ever before. He pointed out that the post-war army must be composed of three parts: the regular army, the national guard, and trained equipment troops. A regular army and local equipment troops alone are not sufficient to meet the challenges of modern warfare. The post-war army must undergo fundamental reforms to establish a superior national army that can be sent to the front lines at any time. In addition, an air defense organization must be established as soon as possible to cope with air threats.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on Aid to China (Part 5)

China's Self-Help Measures and Guarantees

To ensure that foreign aid is effective, the Chinese government itself must be able to determine its policies to enable China to gain strength and stability. A government that cares for the interests of the people is less susceptible to external forces. Therefore, when taking favorable action on the issue of aid to China, the committee was deeply impressed by the statement made by Premier Chang Chun in Nanjing on January 28, 1948.

Conclusion

In the committee's opinion, the National Government of China, under the twenty years of arduous leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has become our common ally to cope with threats to international peace and security and communist aggression. The further assistance approved by our government demonstrates the United States' concern for China's independence and integrity, the welfare of the Chinese people, and the stability and peace of the Far East.

Appendix

Analysis of the Aid to China Bill and Relevant Provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948:

Section 2: This section outlines the objectives of the proposed bill and the methods of providing aid to China. The objectives of this bill are to assist China in alleviating human suffering, preventing economic deterioration, and enabling the Chinese people to have the opportunity to initiate self-help measures to rebuild the foundation for economic stability. This assistance is based on the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948. These provisions are consistent with the objectives of this bill, and the objectives of the bill do not mean that China must comply with the common plan for European recovery in order to obtain aid to China under the bill. Aid to China will be based on the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948 that are relevant to the objectives of this bill and the situation in China. The methods and scope of assistance are the same as those for countries participating in the European recovery plan. Therefore, the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act will apply to China, irrespective of the objectives of that act, but only in relation to the objectives of this bill.

Section 3: Item (A) of the section on the Aid to China Bill authorizes the appropriation to the President of an amount not exceeding $3 million, which may be utilized within one year from the date of the bill's implementation, to comply with the various objectives to which the Economic Recovery Act can be applied, without regard to the various provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 1948. The funds appropriated under this item may be used to assist China by way of grants, thereby promoting the various objectives of this bill. The procedure to be followed is that which the President considers sufficient to promote these objectives.

Section 4: This section stipulates that an agreement must be signed with China, including China's provision of guarantees to the United States. These guarantees, after consultation between the Secretary of State and the Economic Cooperation Administrator, may be considered necessary for the implementation of the various provisions of this bill, as well as for improving commercial relations with China (including giving American financial enterprises equal opportunities).

It is expected that when negotiating this part of the agreement, to make the funds allocated under Item (O) of Section 3 of this bill available to assist China, the Executive Branch should proceed in accordance with Section 15 (B) of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, to the extent applicable to China, but without being subject to all its restrictions. For example, matters included in paragraphs 5 to 8 of Section 15 (B) of Senate Bill 2202, as passed by the Senate, are expected to be applicable to China only after the text of these paragraphs has been slightly revised. As for paragraphs 1 to 8 of that bill, they may be applicable to China after varying degrees of revision, but some parts of them must be revised to the point of being completely rewritten.

Section 5: This section authorizes the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance funds, not exceeding a total of $5000, in order to implement the various provisions of this bill, pending the disbursement of funds under Item 3 of this bill. (End)

### Tentative Plan for Western European Highway Network Prepared

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The State Department recently revealed that the Inland Transport Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which met in Geneva in April, has prepared a tentative plan for the establishment of a Western European highway network. Participants in the meeting included France, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the British and American zones in Germany. The plan envisions the construction of interconnected highway lines from Scandinavia south to Italy and from the Atlantic coast to Hungary, with the proposed highway lines passing through the "Iron Curtain" at four points in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. However, the State Department explained that although the highway lines passed by countries that did not participate in the Geneva conference were also proposed at the meeting, no action will be taken to incorporate the highways of these countries into the international highway network until agreements have been reached with these governments. The State Department also said that many existing autobahns in Germany and Italy will be incorporated into this system, and efforts will be made to reduce border crossing restrictions in the countries through which the international highway network passes to facilitate the transport of passenger cars and trucks.

### Trial of the Social Affairs Bureau Riot Case Concluded: Sentence to be Pronounced on June 3rd; Lawyers Vigorously Attack: Improper Application of Regulations; Defendants Kneel and Plead for Bail

[Report from this Newspaper] The debate hearing for the case of the dancers and dance hall workers who rioted at the Social Affairs Bureau was held in the Special Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. At around 2:00 PM, Judge Wang Zhennan, Judges Sun Tiqian and Xu Naikun, and Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats. Thirty-seven defendants in custody and thirty-two defendants released on bail were brought before the court. Those released on bail stood on the right side of the court, while those in custody stood on the left side of the court. The attorneys appearing for the defense included Chen Tingrui, Zhou Yizhi, Ma Junshuo, Fu Kuangshuo, Zhang Guangzong, Zhu Wende, Huang Zengjie, Tao Ran, Xia Xintang, Shi Zhuoren, and female attorneys Zhang Hongwei, Li Suzhen, and Hua Xizhen, totaling sixteen. After the lawyers presented their defenses on behalf of the defendants, the hearing concluded at 5:30 PM. The court announced that the sentence in the case would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on June 3rd.

Yesterday, the central focus of the debate was the lawyers' strong legal challenge to the police bureau's application of Article 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, deeming it improper to refer the defendants to the Special Criminal Court for processing.

Attorney Zhou Yizhi first provided a general explanation of the defense's arguments, stating in brief: "The formation of this case is due to the serious unemployment problem. After the ban on dancing, tens of thousands of people will inevitably fall into unemployment. Driven by the pressure of livelihood, they had to resort to petitioning. Furthermore, there is fundamentally no reason for the ban on dancing. (1) Dancing has long obtained legitimate business status. Now, a mere order deprives people of their right to work and survive, and there are no good methods for them to transition to other jobs. It seems that the administrative authorities lacked deep consideration when issuing this order. (2) Some say that the ban on dancing is for the sake of thrift, but there are many things that should be saved. The government does not choose the most important things to save on and instead bans dancing first, which is truly neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial. (3) Taking a step back, even if dancing should be banned, it must go through legal procedures. The Legislative Yuan should first formulate a law banning dancing, pass it, and then implement it step by step, which would be legal and reasonable. Moreover, Article 155 of the Constitution states that the government should protect the people's occupations. Now, causing those with occupations to become unemployed is also a violation of the Constitution. The proximate cause of this case is that the Social Affairs Bureau did not follow the regulations to draw lots on the afternoon of January 31st, but instead drew lots in the morning, thus the Social Affairs Bureau had already lost faith with the people first. It is even more improper for the police bureau to refer this case under Article 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security. Upon investigation, what is included in Article 7 is Item 7 of Paragraph 1 of Article 3 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits: 'Intending to disrupt public order by arson, flooding, or other methods of destroying public offices or military equipment.' To apply such a severe article to a group of pitiful people who are petitioning for their livelihood is truly making a mountain out of a molehill and using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Request that the court declare the defendants not guilty or transfer the case to the District Court for handling. Also, the defendants in custody have been detained for more than four months, and their suffering has reached the extreme. Please grant bail."

Male and Female Defendants Weep Uncontrollably

When Attorney Zhou spoke with fervor, the defendants in custody wept uncontrollably. Even the male defendants, who do not easily shed tears, sobbed.

Subsequently, Attorney Chen Tingrui also argued, pointing out the impropriety of the police bureau's application of the Regulations for the Punishment of Offenses Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. He also stated: "The police bureau took three months to investigate before sending the case to your court. However, after examining the case, there is no human or material evidence, direct or indirect evidence. As a result, the police bureau also felt that this matter was inappropriate. They then used the female student Jin Ying as an excuse, believing that there must be someone instigating behind the scenes. However, after investigation, Jin Ying had no communist suspicions, and the police bureau released her on bail. To release Jin Ying, who is believed to be the instigator, on bail, while the thirty-seven defendants who are believed to be instigated are still detained is utterly unreasonable."

### It is Difficult for One or Two People to Bear Responsibility for the Actions of Thousands

He continued to list various factors, both remote and proximate, that led to the incident, saying that exacerbating the matter was definitely not the fault of the chairman of the labor union. To make one or two people responsible for the actions of thousands of people is not legally sound. Finally, he also criticized the police bureau, saying: "During the detention of the defendants in the police bureau, their families applied to the District Court for a habeas corpus petition. On March 4th, the District Court issued a writ of habeas corpus, but the police bureau ignored it. It is not known how to explain their extra-legal behavior."

### Tang Zongjie Did Not Take Action

Attorney Fu Kuanglin argued: "Regarding the part of the defendant Tang Zongjie, upon investigation, the Joint Office of Dance Industry is an organization jointly formed by five units. The defendant has only one-fifth of the responsibility, and there are a total of fifty people in the presidium. The defendant has only one-fiftieth of the responsibility. The police bureau's investigation report also contains the words 'Tang Zongjie dissuaded the other dancers from acting rashly.' Since he dissuaded, he must not have taken action, which can be determined. Secondly, regarding the point of whether Tang is a member of the Communist Party, Tang is a loyal worker of the Kuomintang Youth League, and there is already a letter proving this. This point also falls apart."

Attorney Hua Xizhen also defended Tang Zongjie, requesting that the entry of the word 'Tang' in the record book be authenticated, as the handwriting is inconsistent and clearly added later. Attorney Ma Junshuo stated: "According to the police bureau's investigation report, the defendants Zha Ruiyong, Su Jinsheng, and Yu Jinbao were merely tidying up things and cannot be said to be robbery. How can the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and the Emergency Punishment Law be used?"

### "Pockmarked Face" Creates Great Laughter

Attorney Huang Zengmu defended the pockmarked dance hall girl Tan Pei'e: "The pockmarked face that beat the Social Affairs Bureau is not the pockmarked face of the defendant. According to reports, the pockmarked dance hall girl who beat the Social Affairs Bureau had a slightly pockmarked face and wore a red Shanghai cheongsam. The defendant is very severely pockmarked and does not like to be in the limelight, so she dresses simply and never wears red clothes. From this, it can be known that this pockmarked face is not that pockmarked face. The pockmarked face that beat the Social Affairs Bureau slipped away long ago." Attorney Huang said "pockmarked face" a dozen times in a row, causing great laughter in the court. He also brought Tan Pei'e forward, and Judge Wang examined her carefully.

The remaining Zhang Hongwei, Li Suzhen, and others also defended the defendants on their behalf. After the lawyers finished their arguments, Judge Wang asked the defendants if they had any opinions. Zhu Lin, the first person transferred by the police bureau, raised his hand, stating that he had not instigated anything, and knelt down to request bail. The remaining thirty-six defendants also knelt down together to request bail, creating a chorus of voices. The defendants' families in the audience also cried loudly. Judge Wang quickly said: "Speak properly, everyone stand up." Subsequently, he announced that the sentence in the case would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on June 3rd. Bail was not granted to the defendants in custody, and they were returned to detention. The court adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Identity of Over a Hundred People Suspect in West Guangfu Road Census

[Report from this Newspaper] The police bureau dispatched a large number of census police officers yesterday, led by Census Section Chief Wu Yan, along with New Jing Branch Chief Zhang Shixiong, to conduct a surprise census on West Guangfu Road in a blitz style. The area is adjacent to Xin Jing, Da Chang, Zhenru, and Zhabei and has always been known as a "no-man's land." Refugees, beggars, bandits usually come and go, forming a breeding ground for crime. As a result of the surprise inspection, it was found that most of them had not registered their household and that the identities of more than 100 people were suspicious. In addition to ordering those who had not registered their household to register quickly, the police bureau took those whose identities were suspicious back to the bureau for interrogation.

### Police Monitor and Prohibit Worship of Stone Statues; Pious Men and Women Curse the Bureau Chief

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, because the incense offerings to a pair of stone statues in front of the racecourse have become increasingly popular recently, greatly obstructing the appearance of the city and traffic, started yesterday to send two police officers to stand guard in front of the two statues to prevent ignorant people from going to burn incense and worship. The general believers were unable to approach the "spirits" and were greatly frustrated. Some even vented their anger on Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, privately talking hatefully, saying: "Yu Shuping has cut off the incense offerings to the bodhisattvas. The bureau chief will soon be unable to continue in his position." Their words are quite laughable.

### 西園寺外電車停頓 肇事五士兵被捕

[By our reporter] Yesterday at approximately 4:50 PM, an English-owned No. 324 trolley bus, number nineteen, was passing by the Nicheng Bridge on Beijing Road when it encountered a red light. Suddenly, four soldiers insisted on boarding the bus. Wang Guoyou, ticket seller number 2507, stated that it was inconvenient to open the door at that location and requested they board across the street in front of the Sino-French Pharmacy. The soldiers were displeased. When the light turned green and the bus began to move, the four soldiers rushed to board. After getting on, they scolded Wang, slapped his face, and threatened to beat him again when the bus passed their unit on the return trip. The four men rode for two stops and then got off. When the bus reached the Kunming Road terminal, Wang informed Yang QiHuai, the ticket seller on the No. 390 bus in front, that he feared trouble on the return trip. Following a suggestion, Wang and another ticket seller, Huang Guangqing, switched buses, so Wang ended up on the No. 390 bus. Not long after, that trolley bus turned around and arrived at the Xiyuan Temple gate on Chengdu Road (where new recruits were stationed). Sure enough, it was surrounded by dozens of soldiers, who dragged Wang off the bus and beat him. Soon after, the No. 324 bus also arrived, and the soldiers attacked Huang Guangqing and Yang QiHuai, taking Yang inside the Xiyuan Temple. At this moment, a No. 16 trolley bus from Caojiadu arrived, and the driver, Wang Zhenren, tried to escape, but was caught by the soldiers. By this time, over a hundred No. 16, No. 18 trolley bus, and No. 123 streetcar drivers and ticket sellers had heard the news and rushed to the scene, their emotions running high as they planned to storm the Xiyuan Temple to rescue their captured colleagues. Just as the situation was becoming critical, the military police, the Flying Fortress unit, the Deputy Chiefs Zhao Peijin and Ding Zhenduo of the Xincheng Branch Bureau, Section Chief Hao, and Zhang, the Captain of the Traffic Brigade, arrived with police officers to mediate. As a result, after Director Zhao and Section Chief Hao, along with Zhang Fengyuan, the Major Deputy Battalion Commander of the Supplementary Regiment's Second Battalion, and Qiu Changjiang, the Chairman of the Trolley Bus Workers' Union, went to the military unit to confer with Platoon Leader Chen, Platoon Leader Chen agreed to hand over soldier Zhao Wenxuan, who was involved in the incident, to Director Zhao to be taken back to the Xincheng Police Station. At the same time, Wang Zhenren and Yang QiHuai were released. Subsequently, based on Zhao Wenxuan's testimony, it was learned that other assailants were in the troop unit at the Baobentang Church on Changsha Road. The injured were taken to identify them, and Cui Qinglin, Liu Weiguo, Du Lanchen, and Wang Xiangdao were arrested and taken to the Xincheng Branch Bureau. Wang Guoyou, Huang Guangqing, Wang Zhenren, and Yang QiHuai, who were injured, were rushed to the hospital. By 8:30 PM, the disturbance had gradually subsided and traffic was restored. The five offending soldiers were transferred to the Police Department that night for further investigation.

### Over a Thousand Yellow Birds Engage in a Fierce Battle: Grand Gathering at Chunfeng Deyilou This Morning; "Ever-Victorious General" Returns to the Battlefield

[By our reporter] This city's annual Yellow Bird Competition will commence at 9:00 AM this morning at the Chunfeng Deyilou teahouse in the Old City of Nanshi. Over a thousand yellow birds will participate, representing over sixty units from various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Last year's champion, the "Ever-Victorious General," has now been transferred from its former owner, Wang Daji, to a certain bird-raising expert in Dongxinqiao. It will make an appearance today to try to reclaim the championship. The event is organized by the Shicun Society, founded by Jiang Futian and others, aiming to promote leisurely cultivation of character and demonstrate that "even small birds possess martial ambition; how can men be without aspirations?" The atmosphere surrounding the event is as intense as a large-scale sports meet. The yellow bird contestants must be numbered. They are divided into "new" and "old" (those born last year are considered new birds, while those born before last year are old birds; they compete in separate categories, akin to boxing matches). Eight rules are prominently displayed: "New and old birds do not fight each other; do not regret any oversight," "Those who bite the crotch, tail, or peck feathers should promptly withdraw after self-inspection," "If one only flips and doesn't fight, it should be considered a retreat from the battlefield," "If one accidentally slips and falls, the competition must continue," "Minor adjustments to the silk are permissible, but do not make independent modifications," "Do not stop arbitrarily; follow the referee's instructions," "Be careful not to let the bird escape when dismantling the cage, to avoid mutual blame," "If the silk tangles in the cage, the referee will kindly separate them." Four types of prizes are displayed: exquisite tea sets, sandalwood bone fans, red and yellow flower tickets, and silver shields in brocade boxes. The competitions are organized by county, with the names announced before the birds enter. If a bird ranks highly, the county's escorts will consider it a supreme honor for their region. Following the competition, another exciting event will take place: the Suzhou "Guwu Huangdao Joint Society" has notified the organizers, planning a Shanghai-Suzhou battle on June 7th at the Suquan Teahouse in Suzhou, with a challenge stating: "We have prepared a small amount of rent, enough for ten cages. Please bring your new and old healthy birds, and we will await your arrival to seize the championship."

### Disaster Victims on Yanping Road Petition After Being Prevented from Building Shelters

[By our reporter] On the night of April 18th, a major fire broke out in the 31st Bao (neighborhood) of Yanping Road, affecting 1,863 households, mostly refugees from northern Jiangsu who had come to Shanghai. These disaster victims recently pooled their resources to build grass shelters on the site of the fire. However, the landlord, Renji Real Estate Company, intervened and, in conjunction with the police bureau, prohibited the construction. This led to clashes and bloodshed with the police, resulting in injuries on both sides. Yesterday afternoon, representatives were selected and marched to the Social Affairs Bureau to request that they ask the police bureau to allow the construction of shelters to resolve the housing problem. Section Chief Yuan and Section Chief Sun of the Ninth Section received them and stated that this matter was not under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau and could not be resolved. They advised the representatives to seek mediation from Wu Zhongda, the district head of the Jiangning District, and negotiate a proper resolution with the landlord. The petitioning disaster victims accepted the advice and left around 5:00 PM.

### 慘 淚洒特刑庭

### Tragedy: Tears Shed in the Special Criminal Court

Yunzhong Girls' School solemnly clarified that there was no student named Jin Ying among their students. The court also confirmed that her identity was incorrect. It turned out that Jin Ying had deceived her mother, pretending to study but actually roaming about. Yesterday, she was questioned in court and burst into tears.

"Yangzi" You Lingling and "Gaoshiman" Feng Aina, one claiming to be sixteen and the other seventeen, were several years younger than their IDs indicated. Both said they reported younger ages so they could become dance hostesses. The judge asked whether You was a Rooster and Feng a Mandrill, and after calculating, said, "Unsuitable, unsuitable!"

According to regulations, a defendant can only be defended by three lawyers, but some had as many as seven. After discussion, it was said they were "largely the same," "on the same front," and the first three lawyers were selected in order.

Lawyer Yao successfully defended "Faraway" Yang Lili, arguing that her husband had died only a year ago, leaving behind a one-year-old girl, and she secretly went out to dance hostessing every night. This incident was a complete injustice. Yang covered her face with a handkerchief and sobbed.

Lawyer Zhou Yizhi was granted permission to make a general defense together with Lawyer Chen Junrui. Zhou's demeanor was calm, and his words were meticulous. The defendants in custody were moved to tears three times, and the families in the audience also wept.

Chen Junrui said that banning dancing was "retrogressive, outdated, ignorant, and corrupt."

The defendants in custody rubbed medicated oil and took Bajiao pills. Hong Xiaoping felt particularly unwell and nearly fainted.

Female lawyers are rarely seen in court, but today there were Hua Xizhen and Zhang Hongwei. Hua was the most eloquent, with a forceful tone and a Wu dialect accent. To prove Tang Zongjie innocent, she demanded the interrogation of witnesses and argued with the court until she was red-faced.

Zhang Guangzong stood up to defend, holding a Parker 51 fountain pen to emphasize his gestures: "These ignorant defendants should be given reformatory education. Furthermore, they have been detained for four months, which is already too long." At the point of emotional intensity, the defendants in custody began to sob again.

Lou Yunmei said, "I know the presiding judge's character very well. If we follow the indictment, these poor souls could be sentenced to more than ten years in prison, and I'm afraid he couldn't bring himself to do it!" It was a plea to "spare their lives." Judge Wang waved his hand repeatedly, saying, "These words are unnecessary."

Judge Wang wrote down the phone number for a certain investigation, 74520, but mistakenly dipped his pencil in ink. Realizing the mistake, he quickly "corrected" it.

Lawyer Zhu Wende, who argued that "dancing can cure frostbite," arrived late and also made an impassioned defense. After the arguments were completed, Master Zhu, the manager of "Saint Tarlac," raised his hand to speak, making a poignant statement: "Hu Yunyuan's brother died, but he doesn't know. My son also died a few days ago. The separation of flesh and blood is too tragic." After speaking, he wept bitterly, and all the defendants in custody knelt and cried, moving the surrounding audience to tears.

After leaving the courtroom, Hong Xiaoping and Wang Min held Lawyer Hua Xizhen's hand tightly, crying so hard they couldn't lift their heads. Many lawyers repeatedly urged the defendants in custody to be patient and not be sad.

The thirty-seven defendants have been detained for four months: brother dies, but [defendant] doesn't know, son dies, [defendant] father is in prison

The Zhongjian warship immediately ordered them to stop using signal lights. However, all four Japanese fishing boats were cunning and did not comply, instead accelerating and scattering in different directions. The Zhongjian warship also accelerated in pursuit, and after a chase of over ten nautical miles, finally captured one of them. The other three disappeared in the darkness. The captured fishing boat is named "Jingxian Maru" and has thirteen Japanese fishermen on board. They were escorted back to Shanghai by the Zhongjian warship last night.

### Two-Month Treasury Bills to be Officially Listed Starting Tomorrow; Settlement Procedures Divided into Two Types, A and B

[By our reporter] The Central Bank authorities recently announced that they have decided to issue a new type of treasury bill with a term of two months. These treasury bills will be listed on the stock exchange tomorrow. The face value categorization of these bills is the same as that of the one-month treasury bills. The current issuance covers the period from the end of this month, i.e., from May 31st to July 31st. When listed on the stock exchange, they will be divided into two categories, A and B. Category A involves trading on the same day and settlement by noon the next day. Category B involves trading on the same day and settlement on the third day. The discount rate will be adjusted at any time based on market conditions.

The Short-Term Treasury Bill Discount Rate Committee originally established by the Central Bank has now been renamed the Open Market Committee due to the listing of treasury bills. Its regular work involves determining the discount rate for one-month treasury bills, the issuance policy for two-month treasury bills, and the general trading policy for treasury bills.

Also reported: Since the issuance of short-term treasury bills, 2.5 trillion yuan has been sold in Shanghai alone as of yesterday. Starting June 1st, it has been decided to expand sales to five other cities: Nanjing, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. The sales agencies in Shanghai will be the Central Bank, as well as other Central Bank branches and municipal banks starting June 1st. Sales in other cities will temporarily be handled solely by the Central Bank branches.

Also reported: Mr. Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, held a press conference at 6:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the bank, and Mr. Gu Shanchang, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, were also present.

No trading has yet occurred within the market, and external prices have dropped by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, transactions were not numerous.

White yuan remains steady at 8 million, white粳 is priced at 6.8 million, thin稻 matches white粳 in price, early 稻 is at 6.6 million, and sheep秈 also falls to 6.7 million yuan.

Flour declined due to the imminent arrival of new wheat. Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi have already fallen, causing merchants to feel uneasy and rush to sell. The morning market was the weakest. Old vehicle spot trading was at 2.05 million, but the central market stabilized as the price of flour sold by the Central Trust Bureau increased by 30,000 to 2.03 million delivered, marking the start of stability. Old vehicles ultimately closed at 2.09 million, while military vessels also rose after an initial dip, closing at 2.08 million, each showing a minor increase of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Red Bee, Jian Cheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all fell by 50,000. Bran declined by 100,000. Wheat mills had weak demand, opening at 2.9 million original issue.

Sales of miscellaneous grains turned sluggish. As the reported price of rice decreased, public sentiment waned, and the market declined. Soybean oil factories and merchant guilds reduced their purchases. Cargo owners felt unable to maintain support, and prices ultimately fell. Hankou summer soybeans closed at 3.3 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Corn fell by 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum retreated by 150,000. Green beans also remained sluggish. New Qing beans were still offered at 2.95 million. New Yuan wheat weakened. Sesame remained flat and soft. Raw peanuts had thin inventories and stood firm at 500,000 yuan.

Edible oil declined. The drop in all grains led to a selling trend. Demand within the street also decreased, with retail investors selling but not buying. Bean oil initially declined sharply. The lowest price for Shun Yu bean oil opened at 14.2 million yuan. The market later rebounded, with Da You bean oil closing at 14.8 million yuan, ultimately reporting a slight drop of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

### External Trading of Rice Will Be Subject to Prohibition Measures

Yesterday was the last day the government implemented the policy of selling 6,000 dan of rice daily. Whether the government will continue to sell rice next week and at what price will be decided by Mayor Wu.

Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, responded to reporters' inquiries yesterday regarding the effectiveness of the rice selling and price limit policies over the past week. He stated: "The surge in rice prices has been suppressed, which is the greatest effect. However, general rice merchants indicate that the result of rice selling and price limits has created off-market trading and reduced the source of rice."

According to Chief Ji: "Although off-market prices are high, the government's allocated rice is abundant, so not many off-market transactions are completed. The authorities are paying close attention to this and will have new measures to prohibit it."

Regarding the reduction in source areas due to allocated rice, Ji stated that there is no problem because the current city rice supply is not lacking. The government supply exceeds demand, and it is not necessary to rely entirely on supply areas.

[Another report] The allocation price for household rice for the next month will be decided at a meeting tomorrow afternoon. It is reported that the mayor has discussed with the Americans and requested that the original price of 3.5 million for this month be maintained.

### Bearish Forces Apply Frequent Pressure: The State of Chinese Stocks Remains Weak

Yesterday, Chinese stocks generally dampened public sentiment. Despite discussions of currency reform, there was a widespread feeling that multiples were too high.

### Central Trust Bureau Publicly Auctions Japanese Bartered Woolens

The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the government's barter trade with Japan, imported 310,000 yards of woolens last year. Originally intended to cooperate with the government's price stabilization policy to supply market needs, the Woolen Textile Industry Association suggested reselling the goods abroad. Therefore, the goods were temporarily stored in bonded warehouses without customs declaration while reporting to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to request handling methods.

The Executive Yuan convened relevant agencies to thoroughly review the case and ordered the Central Trust Bureau to sell it on the domestic market. Now, the Central Trust Bureau has complied with the order and completed customs clearance.

### Public Sentiment Is Weak and Discouraged: The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Is Flat and Weak

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market appeared mixed. Replicating manufacturers still absorbed 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn. The opening price immediately jumped by 3 million yuan. Subsequently, as the interest of both local and nonlocal merchant groups waned, it ultimately closed at 316 million yuan, still a slight increase of 1 million yuan from the previous day. The attitudes of various parties towards brands such as Shui Yue Jin Cheng and 40-count yarn varied, and the market price fluctuated.

21-count Shuang Ma yarn also initially rose by 2 million yuan. Later, due to the inverted pricing in nonlocal markets and the impact of the inability to use same-day checks from June 1, public sentiment weakened. Counter groups and retailers sold, resulting in a decline of 7 million yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count, 16-count, and 32-count yarns, etc., all declined by varying amounts, from 1 million to 2 million to 6 million to 7 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw continued arrivals of northbound floating capital. Merchants from Xuzhou and Bengbu continued to buy strongly, dye factories also absorbed slightly, and companies traded back and forth. The market trend hovered firmly.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped up 50,000 upon opening. Money was loose on the market. Rumors spread of currency reform, and retail investors vigorously pushed up prices, driving the price even higher to 7.16 million yuan. Subsequently, there was mutual selling to lock in profits, and due to restrictions on the use of bank same-day checks from June 1, public sentiment waned, and everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, Dragon Head fine cloth ultimately retreated to 7.09 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan from the previous day. Brands such as Wu Fu, Blue Chicken, and Cai Qiu also continued to rise by 10,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 yuan. In addition, fine twill, coarse cloth, khaki, etc., sold well, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Shilin cloth also remained relatively popular.

### Zhejiang Province Silk: Production Gradually Increases

The annual output of fresh cocoons exceeds 1 million dan, earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the country.

During the Anti-Japanese War, silk areas were devastated by the enemy, suffering heavy losses.

### Resolved to Use US Aid: National Banks Decide to Continue Tightening Credit

Today's warning is similar to the previous one. A spokesperson for the Siamese Ministry of Education also said: The Siamese government intends to restrict the number of schools for overseas Chinese in Bangkok and other provinces because the number is "too many." However, how the ministry will solve the education problem of thousands of overseas Chinese children after the schools are closed, he has not said anything about. Neutral people here said: The schools run by overseas Chinese can reduce a large number of illiterates for Siam. Therefore, in the campaign to eradicate illiteracy, it is still a task of the UN Educational Organization. Siam's closure of a large number of established educational institutions is indeed not advisable.

### Fudan University Henan Students Seeking Justice for Deceased Classmate Wang Huiwan: Accuse Zhongshan Hospital of Neglect of Duty and Disregarding Human Life

[Our report] Wang Huiwan, a first-year student in the Statistics Department of Fudan University, died in Zhongshan Hospital on the 24th of this month. The Henan Students Association of the school recently accused the hospital of "neglect of duty and disregard for human life" and issued an indictment to all sectors. It is said that Wang was 23 years old, from Neixiang, Henan, with excellent academic performance and a strong physique. In the early spring, he occasionally had a cough. After being diagnosed and treated by the school doctor, he said it was a cold, and taking aspirin was ineffective. He was admitted to the Army Hospital for treatment on May 5, and then transferred to Zhongshan Hospital, and his condition improved slightly. However, on the 13th of this month, Gong Sheng suddenly sent a letter from the hospital saying that the hospital refused to continue giving medicine because the medical expenses paid had been exhausted. On the 15th and 17th, he sent letters one after another, stating the same as before, and said that the illness had deteriorated due to the interruption of medicine. By the morning of the 24th, the school received a telegram from the hospital saying that Wang Sheng had passed away. The indictment stated at the end: The hospital is obligated to diagnose and treat patients. Even if Wang's treatment was due to overdue medical expenses, as the hospital said, how could it sit back and watch without saving him and let him die? It is obviously unreasonable and seems to be a crime of intentional homicide. After investigation, Wang Sheng had prepaid 10 million yuan in medical expenses in accordance with regulations when he was first admitted to the hospital (with receipts), and had been approved by the Student Relief Association to bear Wang Sheng's medical expenses, but the hospital claimed that it only received 5 million yuan until it finally confirmed the full amount of payment (the remaining amount of more than 3 million yuan was refunded during the settlement). From this, it can be proved that Wang Sheng's death was indeed due to the hospital's negligence, which led to the interruption of medicine and a grievance. The association is scheduled to hold a memorial service at the school at 8 am today, and then invite reporters to report and prepare to file a lawsuit to seek justice for the deceased.

### Mayor's Cup Football Semifinals: Qingbai Eliminates Railway, 1-0 in Penalty Kicks

In the Mayor's Cup football semifinals, Qingbai defeated Railway 1-0 yesterday to win the right to the final, which will be scheduled to compete with Donghua for the championship. Qingbai and Railway were evenly matched, and the fierce battle was unprecedented. Neither team was able to score. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Railway's Yue Renxiao was penalized with a penalty kick, which Qingbai used to secure the victory. Due to the importance of yesterday's game and the tense situation, there were inevitable fouls. The audience numbered three to four thousand, and Yiyuan was quite lively. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Lu Shunde.

Railway Misses Opportunity

The game started at 4:00 PM, with Qingbai taking advantage of the favorable wind and kicking off first, with high morale. However, the absence of Ao Qixiang and the late arrival of Fei Chunhua inevitably affected their strength. After six minutes, Jiang Qing committed a foul, and Wu Binghao took a free kick. Qin Bigao saved the ball but dropped it. Lin Dianyi rushed up like a shot and kicked it, hitting Qin Bigao and bouncing out. It was a great pity that Railway missed this opportunity, otherwise, the situation might have changed. After fifteen minutes, Xiao Luo got the ball and shot hard from 20 yards out, but Liao Xiong turned it into a corner kick. Soon after, Xiao Gao darted to the right wing and crossed the ball, but Xiao Luo kicked it wide.

Qingbai's Fierce Attack

At this time, Qingbai launched a fierce attack in Railway's penalty area. However, they lacked luck and failed to score. Xiao Gu dribbled through the middle and passed to Xiao Gao, who kicked it wide. Again, Afu passed to Jin Lusheng, who dribbled and shot wide. After 26 minutes, Jin and Luo rode side by side and passed the ball into the middle. Xiao Gao raised his foot to shoot, but it was blocked by the dense formation. Xiao Gu penetrated again and lobbed the ball in front of the goal, but Liao Xiong jumped out and caught it. Then, Xiao Luo passed to Jin Lusheng, who cut in along the sideline, but Liao rushed out and turned it into a corner kick.

Penalty Kick

After 38 minutes, Yue Renxiao fouled Xiao Gao in the penalty area, committing a serious foul. Xiao Luo took the penalty kick and scored low, establishing the victory. Railway lost this goal and never recovered. Railway lost ground again, and Jiang Qing kissed the ball with his hand outside the penalty area. Xiao Ziwen took the shot, and the landing point was excellent, but Lu Qingxiang headed it just outside the goal. The first half ended.

Strange Whistles Sound

After changing sides, Qingbai replaced Yin Qingbing with Fei Chunhua and Liu Tiyin, while Railway replaced Xu Shengyuan and Wu Binghao with Fei Chunlin and Qu Xigen. The two armies fought again. After five minutes, Yue Renxiao kicked Jiang Qing and was sent off by Zhang Le. Railway had to fight with ten men. In an instant, Xiao Fei penetrated along the sideline and hooked the ball to the center. Afu headed it wide. At this time, countless silver whistles were heard on the sidelines, disrupting the order of the game. The game was suspended for a moment. After the game was restarted, Xiao Luo and Lusheng failed to score twice, and the whistles sounded again on the sidelines, echoing each other. Zhang Le could not bear it any longer and decided not to officiate anymore. He was replaced by Lu Shunde, and the vacant position of linesman was taken over by Wang Chongye. After 19 minutes, Xiao Luo hooked the ball, Xiao Fei caught it and passed it again, but Liu Tiyin hesitated slightly, and it all vanished into thin air.

Railway Counterattacks

Railway was eager to reverse the situation and committed numerous fouls. After 29 minutes, Wu Jiabang committed a handball, and Afu took a free kick. The ball shot out like an arrow, heading straight for the net, but Liao Xiong deflected it into a corner kick. After 34 minutes, Xiao Gao intercepted the ball, dribbled a few times, and suddenly shot from 15 yards out, but Liao Xiong慌 rushed to save it. A minute later, Xiao Fei cut in and shot at the goal, but the ball hit the post and bounced out. Xiao Gao caught up and shot again, but it went high and out. After that, Xiao Fei cut in and kicked it out of bounds, Jin Lusheng passed it beautifully, Xiao Luo hooked the ball, but Xiao Gao missed. As time ran out, Railway lost by one goal and returned in regret.

### Longdong—The Huge Millstone

Since this spring, the wind and rain in the northwest have been dark and ominous. The entire military situation has gone from tight to relaxed, from northern Shaanxi to western Guanzhong, and then to eastern Longdong. This huge millstone has caused infinite changes in the existence and comparison of strength in the northwest.

Initially, the Communist bandits believed that they had completed a major "victory" in the Yichuan Campaign. This fluke "victory" misled the Communist bandits' minds and was taken as proof that they would inevitably win. As a result, their style changed drastically, from being secretive to being bold. They no longer used mobile warfare, but boldly attempted to use their main force to attack the main force of the National Army, in order to control Guanzhong, isolate Xi'an, and threaten the Northwest.

The Communist bandits' boldness was finally shattered! With the close cooperation of the Guanzhong Corps and the Longdong Corps, and with the unified attack of the National Army's land and air forces, the Communist bandits suffered huge and heavy blows. First, they were defeated and fled to Lingshan, and then they were defeated in Yongshou. Their morale was almost completely lost. When the National Army's Ma Jiyuan Division attacked Tunzi Town, all the Communist bandits fled and dared not take any action. In their haste, they left behind all their heavy weapons. The National Army created a brilliant record here.

In total, the results of the National Army's victory in this campaign were as follows: The Communist bandits suffered 27,800 casualties, and more than 6,500 people were captured. The headquarters of the Communist bandits' First, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, and seven brigade headquarters, were all smashed. Rifles, machine guns, and radio stations were also captured in large numbers.

### Elementary School Students Save Money to Help Refugee Children

Letter from the children of the Central National School in Situan Town, Fengxian

To the Editor: We saw the May 11th crystal with a group of second-grade class A children from the Municipal Nancang National School appealing for refugee children and donating money to create a start. It really makes us 120,000 points of admiration! The teacher told us about this and posted the newspaper in the classroom, asking us what our feelings were. We were deeply moved! Therefore, we unhesitatingly launched a Save-to-Aid-Refugee-Children campaign, from Friday of this week to Monday of this week. The entire class of students donated 580,000 yuan, which the teacher topped off to 600,000 yuan. The teacher also paid the postage. Although the amount is very small, we are sending this small number, which is pitiful, out of sympathy for our refugee friends and in response to Nancang School's righteous act of saving to help refugees!

We are praying for our refugee friends, hoping that everyone will unite and respond, and universally launch this Save-to-Aid movement. Then, the so-called accumulation of sand into a tower, the gathering of armpits into fur, this broad collective power will surely be considerable. We hope that you can forward the donation on our behalf. How grateful we are to you, sir!

Sincerely, all the elementary students in the fifth and sixth grades of the Central National School in Situan Town, Fengxian County

(Editor's note) This amount has been transferred to the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association for appropriate allocation.

### Culture and Politics

— Wu Yong

On the 29th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement this year, Mr. Hu Shi said the following to reporters: "The May Fourth Movement was a new thought, new culture movement, not a political movement at the time. At that time, we felt that if we wanted to promote new culture and new ideas, we had to establish a new foundation on a non-political basis, so our proposition at that time was not to engage in politics for twenty years... We tried our best to avoid politics at that time, but politics not only could not leave us, but on the contrary, it came to force us, so that the May Fourth Movement slowly became a political movement... Later, the political nature became extraordinarily strengthened, which may be good, may be bad, I don't want to comment, but the meaning of culture has slowly weakened. I personally feel that this politicized movement was too early, because the strength was really not enough. For the past twenty-nine years, I personally have always felt that the foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and ideas, and efforts should be made from the cultural aspect..."

Regarding this speech, under the current situation, people's reactions are probably still not consistent. My personal reaction to this speech, in short, is—

The biggest problem in China today lies in the chaotic mess, which makes people feel that "there is no way to start." The formation of this phenomenon is due to the lack of attention to efficiency in handling affairs; and the development of the habit of not paying attention to efficiency is due to the lack of a scientific spirit to formulate plans in advance, even if there are plans, and even if the plans are in line with scientific principles, but afterwards they are unwilling to do it in an orderly manner; this is because the people who handle affairs are not adequately educated, and this is also due to the lack of a new cultural foundation. A Westerner once said that there are many disputes in our country that, if they were in the United States, could be resolved in less than a month, but in China they would become a prairie fire, which would be unmanageable. This is because the United States already has that kind of cultural foundation, while China does not.

The biggest issues facing the country at present are naturally suppressing the rebellion and the economy. However, today, some people not only do not have the determination to solve these two problems, but also use these two problems as a shield to pursue their own selfish interests; even more people are using them as a shield for the "doing-nothing politics" of sitting and waiting for death. "During the suppression period, we have no choice but to do this." "Under the current economic situation, what else can we do!" We can hear such arguments everywhere. They are pushing all the responsibility onto these two major problems. This reminds us of the old tune of "in times of emergency" and "everything should be simplified" or "everything should be postponed" before the war. We might as well ask: Do we really and sincerely use the scientific spirit to do things practically? If we carry out things in an orderly manner according to a scientific plan, even under the shroud of these two major problems, the situation would not be so bad. To be honest, the reason why these two problems are so serious today is still due to the habit of "pulling the wool over people's eyes."

So, today, the word "politics" has become synonymous with "mess."

Moreover, this kind of political atmosphere has even spread to some groups that call themselves "culture" and "education." It has always been thought that in order to seek the rule of the country, it is most important to cultivate a good social atmosphere. "If the superiors have a preference, the inferiors will have it in excess." This means that the atmosphere must be cultivated from top to bottom. However, in democratic countries, it is the people who have a preference, and the superiors have no choice but to follow it, which is from bottom to top. From bottom to top, it is itself a good atmosphere. However, the situation in our country is not the same. Instead, the bad political atmosphere is spreading downwards, and the good atmosphere that those groups calling themselves "culture" and "education" should have has not extended upwards. In other words, China's culture is built on the foundation of politics, forming an upside-down pyramid.

This is still because our new cultural foundation is not solid enough and not broad enough. So, Mr. Hu said: "If we want to promote new culture and new ideas, we must establish a new foundation on a non-political basis... The foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and ideas."

Obviously, this new cultural foundation cannot be rushed to completion with brute force. But we cannot use this as an excuse to return to the old path of waiting for death with our hands tied. Today, with the implementation of the constitution, the government has appointed Mr. Weng Wenhao, a scholar and intellectual, to preside over state affairs. We hope that this is the beginning of building a new cultural foundation.

### Sunday's Troubles

— Chen Ye

On Sunday, Miss Zhang, Mr. Wang, and Mrs. Li were waiting for the tram at the North Sichuan Road terminus.

There were many people at the terminus, half of them soldiers and the other half young women and men. The women were all showing their arms and wearing various kinds of white leather shoes. It was a Sunday with beautiful sunshine.

A tram arrived, exactly the one that Miss Zhang and her companions wanted to take. However, because there were so many people, everyone swarmed on board, and it was immediately packed. Then came a No. 11 tram, which also took some people.

Miss Zhang and her friends wanted to go to a certain theater to see a film called something-or-other. Mrs. Li also had a child with her. Therefore, they wanted to wait for a relatively empty tram. After the No. 11 tram left, the number of people at the terminus had thinned out a bit, but after about five minutes without a tram arriving, the number of people waiting for the tram increased again. Seeing that the situation was not good, they tried to hail rickshaws. "×× Theater!" "Eighteen thousand!" the rickshaw puller said, making a gesture.

The tram did not come for a long time. Mr. Wang also hailed a rickshaw. The rickshaw puller wanted him to pay twenty thousand. Mr. Wang hesitated for a moment and replied, "Ten thousand!" The rickshaw puller got on the rickshaw and said as he walked, "Eighteen thousand is the least." He seemed completely indifferent and dismissive, and Mr. Wang was simply a little angry.

A tram arrived, and the child started to cry. Mrs. Li was unhappy and wanted to give up the idea of seeing the film. After a slight hesitation, the tram was already packed. Mr. Wang shouted, "Rickshaw! Rickshaw!" A rickshaw passed by and, hearing that they were going to the × theater, said it was too far and left without looking back. Mr. Wang's mood for going to the theater was gone, and the troubles accumulated in life all surged into his heart. He just urged everyone to go home.

Not being able to get on the tram and not being able to see the film, how do you know it's not a blessing? Or even if you get to the cinema, you might not be able to buy tickets. Or the film might not be as good as expected. Although the plot of the film can push away the troubles of reality, you will soon have to return to the worries of life, to the cage of reality. Unluckily, it starts to rain when you come back, and the rickshaw pullers' "gouging" is even more terrible. The people selling evening newspapers hand the newspaper to you: "Prices have risen again." The already unpleasant mood is deepened by another layer...

### On Eating in the Old Capital (Part 1)

— Chen Yixian

Guang He Ju's Pan Fish and Jiang Tofu

Guang He Ju is located in the northern half of Jiejie Hutong, outside Xuanwumen. Since the Ming Dynasty, the southern city has been the place where scholar-officials resided. Banquets with literature and wine often took place in Guang He Ju. Therefore, the store has many couplets and poems written by famous people since the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. The most adorable are the handwritten menus of famous people. When I was in the Compilation and Translation Office of the Ministry of Education, I had seen them several times. The store's most famous dishes are Pan Fish and Jiang Tofu. Pan Fish is braised fish with a slightly sour and spicy taste. Jiang Tofu is made by mixing fermented soybeans, ginger rice, and other ingredients in tofu. Its deliciousness is unforgettable to this day. The names "Pan" and "Jiang" refer to the people who invented these dishes. Pan was Pan Bingnian from Fujian (a Jinshi of the Xinwei year, later the governor of Kuizhou Prefecture), the father-in-law of my friend Lin Ziyou. People mistakenly call him Pan Zuyin. Jiang was from Yiyang, Jiangxi, and an official in charge of affairs (Jiang Kanghu's father). Fermented soybeans are a local specialty. In the late Qing Dynasty, two poems题壁 widely circulated from Guang He Ju are recorded below, which are also an anecdote of the store.

Two generations in one family as Dry Fathers, joy upon joy comes from one house. According to custom, they should be called Gege (Manchu language, like Miss in Chinese). Please rest assured that they will not let down their fathers, opening a new style in the Prince Qi's residence. When Jiang Ling returns, there is an old yamen. The son plays with jade, and the father plays with tiles, dodder juxtaposed with dodder flower.

Publicly, a family of Manchus and Han Chinese, dry daughters and dry sons are all new. They should also engage in Zhu and Chen marriages, originally Yunnan and Guizhou are relatives. Oriole voices chirp as they call Father, piglets fondly cling to Mother in the morning. Who can recognize the unique charm, why do you all bother asking about the past?

This poem was written because Imperial Censor Jiang Chunlin accused in his memorial that Zhili Governor-General Chen KuiLong was Prince Qing Yikuang's dry son-in-law, and Anhui Governor Zhu Jiabao was Yikuang's son Beizi Zaizhen's dry son, etc. Later, it was found that there was no evidence, and Jiang Chunlin was ordered to return to his original yamen. The phrase Yunnan and Guizhou is because Zhu was from Yunnan and Chen was from Guizhou. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Guang He Ju closed down due to poor business, which is a great pity.

Hui Xian Tang's Shandong Cuisine

Hui Xian Tang is located at Shicha Sea outside the back door. The area is open with many trees. When lotus flowers bloom in the summer, tea sheds are lined up selling tea or watermelon and iced water, which is a popular summer resort for people in the capital. Li Xiya, the Prime Minister of the Ming Dynasty from Dongyang, lived here, and Qing scholar Shi Shan, whose literary name was Wumen, also lived here. When I was studying in the old capital, Zhang Zhidong lived in Baimi Xiejie, which was next to Shicha Sea. Scholar-officials who visited Zhidong often ate at Hui Xian Tang Restaurant. The dishes in the restaurant were no more than ordinary Shandong cuisine, but looking at the railing, there were tens of thousands of tall willows and a pool of accumulated water, making the scenery excellent. Because the famous painter Pu Xinyu's residence was very close to Shicha Sea, he would always treat his guests at Hui Xian Tang. In a certain year before 7/7, I visited my brother in the old capital. Xinyu treated me here. Those at the table were Chen Sanli, Yuan Bokui Siliang, Fu Zhixiang Yuefen, Chen Bingshu Zuren, Shen Gengmei Zhaoxin, my brother Cangqiu, and my younger brother Xunxian. After drinking, we went to Xinyu's residence (Prince Gong's Mansion) to talk about art and dispersed at midnight. The scenery is still vivid in my mind, Xinyu's garden has changed owners (now the dormitory of Fu Jen Catholic University), and I don't know if Hui Xian Tang still exists.

Wen's Lamian Noodles

There is a Fuquan Restaurant on Longfu Temple Street in the old capital. The dishes are very famous. In the past, the owner would eat at Fuquan Restaurant, while the servants and rickshaw pullers would eat at Zao Wen, because the two restaurants were very close to each other. This restaurant is famous for its Lamian noodles, also known as Cheng noodles. Duan Laosi (Duanfang's nickname, the old women in the Hutongs of the old capital passed down the saying that there was "big Rong, small Na, Duan Laosi." Rong was Rong Quan, a secretary of the Imperial Household Department, Na was Natong, who later became a Grand Councilor, and Duan rose to the position of Governor-General of Zhili.) After being dismissed from his official post, he once went to eat alone, and it became a place for scholar-officials to eat noodles. Other famous noodle shops in the old capital include "Erduoyan" on Qianmenwai Street and "Yitiaolong" in Guanyin Temple outside Qianmen. These two shops are famous for their small size.

### Strange Tales of Lightning

Once, it is said that a ball of fire rolled into a woman's bedroom, gradually rolling over and approaching the bed. It scorched the woman's hair and upper garment. The ball of fire finally hit the foot of the bed, exploded, and disappeared.

Another time, a mysterious force suddenly pulled a key out of the door lock and threw it precisely into a shoe on the floor.

A bell ringer in an English church was about to ring the bell when a strong halo suddenly appeared in the bell tower, preventing him from ringing the bell. The halo exploded in front of the altar, leaving behind a general sulfurous odor.

The above and so on, sound mysterious, but in fact, they are the pranks of lightning, a natural phenomenon with which we are most familiar. Although scientists are racking their brains to study the properties of lightning, there is still no way to fully understand the diverse tricks of lightning.

In countless instances, lightning has stripped people of their clothes, making them naked, but without harming the human body. Once, lightning melted an iron chain into an iron bar. Another time, lightning struck and killed a hunter, but the shotgun on his body did not go off.

The strangest recorded lightning prank is as follows. A person was struck by lightning and had two abbreviated letters, DD, burned onto his leg. The doctor who treated him suddenly remembered that he had a tortoiseshell money clip stolen a few days earlier, which also had those two abbreviated letters on it. Later, that person confessed that he was a petty thief, and the money clip was hidden on his body when the lightning struck.

Looking at the interesting dramas performed by lightning over the past century, it is like watching the life experience of a top magician. Lightning faded the gilding on two picture frames, but did not damage the frames or the paintings. Two women were knitting wool, when a lightning bolt suddenly caused the knitting needles to fly far away, but the two women were not injured. A pocket watch that had not been working for a long time suddenly started ticking again after being struck by lightning.

On the same day: one lightning bolt knocked a mirror hanging on the wall to the ground, but the mirror did not break; but another lightning bolt caused a nearby house to collapse. At a grand costume ball, lightning struck down a chimney, and the soot blackened the dancing men and women.

Legends about "ball" lightning are even more bizarre, and it has the habit of rolling into houses. Once, a ball of fire pushed open the door of a house outside the city. In another incident, a farmer's daughter saw a ball of fire rolling to her father's livestock pen. She went to play with it, and the ball of fire exploded, killing all the livestock in the pen, leaving the girl unharmed.

Lightning can not only kill humans, but conversely, it can also cure diseases. A deaf person regained his hearing after being struck by lightning, and a blind worker regained his sight after being struck by lightning. In another incident, lightning made paralyzed limbs move again. Madmen have been cured by being struck by lightning, which is almost the same as the modern electric therapy method for psychological disorders.

In the city of Jielanting in Peru, a beautiful girl was walking when she was suddenly struck by lightning. Although she was not harmed, she became mute.

### Lodging in Yuqian

— Shi Chongpeng

Longing for mountain life after residing in the city, serving guests chicken-pecked cloud and mist tea; the sound of gurgling streams in rocky valleys all day long, crows circling around trees in the setting sun.

Inscribed on a Painting of Cloud Sea, Presented to Abbot Wuzong

Famous mountains and ancient temples connect with vast clouds, not the mundane world but resembling immortals; the record of mist and clouds fulfills a long-held wish, Buddhism originally says it is fate.

Looking back at the Three Powers era of the Jin Dynasty, although it was said to be a three-legged stand, the judiciary was one of the state councilors, and judicial administration was a branch of state administration, no longer the balanced "incense burner legs." The Supreme Court was the highest judicial organ, so the President was specially appointed and parallel to the Ministry of Justice, while the Procuratorate General, which was established alongside the Supreme Court, was under the Ministry of Justice. The Minister of Justice and the President of the Supreme Court were highly respected and specially appointed, but they were only high-ranking officials appointed and could not "consult" with the President like the two houses of parliament, which was structurally unbalanced. However, the independence of the judiciary and the authority of the judiciary were not entirely dependent on the system, and if the President, as the head of state, was bound by the meaning of "three powers in balance" and used "consultation" frequently, it would also be inappropriate. Therefore, in my personal feeling at that time, it was not unacceptable for the "rule" of "judiciary" in the administrative system (because "rule" does not necessarily mean "subordination"), but I had doubts about the two houses of parliament, which were said to be legislative organs, surpassing equilibrium and reaching the level of the head of state. I once had a private conversation with a certain secretary-general of the House of Representatives about this. The secretary-general said that the two houses of parliament could only use "consultation" with the head of state, unless it was a monarchy where they could use "presenting" like administrative officials. I said that the State Council was parallel to the two houses of parliament, which was enough to show the status of "legislation" and "administration" being equally respected. You insist on the "President being the head of the administration," but when there are major state affairs inquiries, why do you only ask the Premier to attend and answer, and not the President? It can be seen that the explanation that the President cannot specialize in "administration" alone is known. If it is said that the use of consultation by the speakers of the two houses of parliament is to show the dignity of "parallelism," then why is there a specially designed, towering, high-backed armchair for the President north of the speaker's seat in the assembly hall? Why not move this chair to a parallel position with the speaker and use a chair of the same size and length as the speaker's chair? At this point, the secretary-general smiled and could not answer, turning to ask for my opinion.

I said that after talking for so long, it is still a matter of official document format. Since the two houses of parliament are different from administrative officials and do not want to receive "orders" or use "presenting," they must know that there is an appropriate method in the document format that is between "superior" and "inferior." In the past, purely parallel relations, such as the officials in the various ministries and courts of Beijing and the governors-general and governors of the outer provinces, used "consultation" with each other without any problem. However, in institutions led by princes and grand scholars, such as the "Grand Council" and the "Office of Foreign Affairs," the ministries and provinces had to use "consulting-presenting" to them, which was a "semi-parallel style," indicating that although they were not subordinates in terms of authority, there was still a distinction of rank in the system, which was both reasonable and sensible. The President's documents can use consultation or note verbale, like the governors-general and governors treating local gentry, each doing their duty, which would be appropriate. The secretary-general said that the Republic of China does not have the format of "consulting-presenting." I said, "Isn't 'Consultation Document' an old format?" However, we are talking about this in private. You do not have the power to revise the format, and I am not submitting a memorial either. So we laughed and talked about other things.
