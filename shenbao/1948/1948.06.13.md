### Full-Day Meeting Held at the Legislative Yuan: Continued Interrogation on Administrative Policies; Various Committee Members Actively Spoke on Military, Political, Economic, and Other Issues; Many Pointed Out that Weng's Report Was Unrealistic

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The 10th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 12th for the entire day. President Sun presided over the meeting, and the interrogation of the Administrative Yuan President Weng Wenhao's policy report continued. Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions sat silently on both sides of the podium throughout the day, carefully recording the key points. Before noon, twenty-four legislators spoke and submitted written opinions. Most of them still criticized Weng's report for lacking focus, being empty and unrealistic, and unable to cope with the current emergency situation. Wang Hansheng and Liu Bokun questioned whether the government had emergency measures to deal with the situation in the north? Liu also said that the Weng cabinet lacked personality, avoided the important and focused on the trivial, and was an administrative cabinet or even a bureaucratic cabinet. If it still did not take responsibility for the entire people, but only for a few people or one person, it would inevitably collapse. The northern crisis was actually due to the failure of diplomacy, ignoring international influence, which led to fundamental errors. In addition, the corruption of military generals naturally led to military setbacks. Since the goal is to suppress the rebellion, we must pay attention to fundamental political issues. Firm and clear diplomacy, and a clean and capable military administration are essential to win the confidence of the people and soldiers. The ruling party should take responsibility. Shao Hua questioned why local administrative officials who were bad were not replaced? Was it the people who were making trouble, or the government who was incompetent? Deng Gongxuan, Feng Junlian, and Qi Zhihou all raised the issue of when to reform the currency system. Feng Junlian requested the government to announce the amount of issuance and the method of making up for the deficit. Qi Zhihou, Yu Zheng, Xiang Jutan, Feng Junlian and others all questioned what specific measures were being taken to strengthen the military? Was the replenishment and reward and punishment of the army still only considering factions and not merit? What specific measures were there to support and train local armed forces? Qi also said that the evidence that the Soviet Union was funding the communist army was conclusive. Did the government have countermeasures? The current situation was full of internal and external troubles. Why did the government have no overall plan? Cheng Cangbo questioned why there were no figures in the special budget? Wu Hexuan said, who was responsible for national defense and military affairs, the minister or the chief of staff? Why were new people not used for the new administration? Luo Hengqing asked why the people's deposits at home and abroad were increasing? Did the government have a way to collect and use them? Jiang Yiping suggested that investigations could be carried out abroad through legal procedures, and even confiscated, to compensate for the shortcomings of diplomacy. He also criticized why the administrative policy report omitted the judicial administration item? He hoped that detailed and concrete administrative measures would be proposed along with the budget to the Legislative Yuan. Wu Zhiren questioned why personnel policies were not mentioned? How could people with notorious records like Zhang Jia'ao be reused? Jiang Yiping and Li Yu both agreed with the opinions raised by Sun Guiji on the 11th that employment was more important than relief and layoffs. Li also said that the US aid utilization committee was large and whether it would repeat the mistakes of the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration"? Huang Yuanbin said that strengthening the suppression of rebellion and stabilizing the economy were the two major tasks. The government should strive to realize the goals provided by the policy.

### The Eleventh Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow to Continue the Interrogation of Administrative Policies

In the afternoon, more than twenty people continued to speak, question, and submit written opinions. Yang Yiju, Liu Yunzhao, Zhang Daohang, Wu Wangji and others raised opinions on strengthening the military, asking whether there were measures to clarify the conscription administration. Zhang and Wu also advocated abolishing conscription and grain requisition to avoid disturbing the people. Zhang Jinjian said that the goals set in the report were very good, but did the government have the魄力 to realize them, and what was the progress of implementation? He pointed out that the failure of past administrations was due to excessive centralization of power and corruption of institutions. Did the new government have the determination to decentralize power to the local level, and could it improve and simplify the broken machinery? Liu Mingyang and Liu Shidu again questioned what measures there were to stop inflation and save the collapsing economy. Chen Zifeng said: Since it was reform, it could not be perfunctory. Could the new government still ignore incompetent central and local officials who should be punished or replaced? Zheng Yanfen believed that it was too early to criticize the administrative policy as an administrative plan or result. He raised opinions on the constitutional aspect, saying that the constitution stipulated too few local systems, and detailed implementation plans should be prepared as soon as possible, and attention should be paid to the proper conduct of elections required for various local systems. He asked when the government planned to complete the establishment of the local political system stipulated in Chapter 11 of the Constitution? Li Yunliang questioned what plans the new government had to win Japanese compensation? Was it prepared to provide loans to support private shipping? Xi Zhenduo pointed out that the administrative policy ignored the frontier administration. During the meeting, Wen Qun proposed a temporary motion, believing that under the current situation, the new administrative council, which had not yet achieved anything, should not be overly criticized. He advocated stopping the interrogation and immediately convening a full-house committee to discuss the policy for two days before deciding whether to agree to it or not. President Sun said that according to the rules of procedure, in addition to exercising the right of consent and reviewing the budget, there were no other regulations for convening a full-house committee. Most committee members also believed that the interrogation of the administrative policy report was a right conferred by the constitution and a procedure stipulated by the rules, so how could it be automatically abandoned? Moreover, the meeting was in progress, so it was not the time to propose a temporary motion. Wen's opinion was rejected. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. President Sun reported that the numbering of requests for speaking and written opinions received in the past two days reached 220. The number of oral interrogations, on-screen readings, and automatic withdrawals was 101. There were still 119. He consulted the opinions of the meeting. Except for 73 written opinions that were sent directly to the Executive Yuan for a response, the remaining 46 oral interrogations were decided to be continued at the 11th meeting on the 14th. The meeting adjourned at 6:10 PM.

### The Desired Improvements for University Entrance Examinations

— Shen Youqian

Today, the entrance examination methods of major universities in the country have many points that can be criticized. With this year drawing to a close, various universities will soon be preparing for the annual university examination. It seems not too early to discuss improvement methods at this time. The aspects of the current methods that are criticized and the possible improvements that should be examined are nothing more than the following three points: (1) Lack of organization, hence uneconomical. (2) Subjective grading, hence inaccurate. (3) Rigid materials, hence impractical. These are discussed separately below.

First, the fact that the current method is uneconomical seems to be widely known and does not need detailed proof. Every summer when universities hold entrance examinations, almost every student applies to several places in succession. Before School A has finished the examination, School B requires registration, and some even travel to different cities, which is extremely taxing and wasteful! Sometimes the examinations of two schools are on the same date, which is impossible to attend both and is infinitely regrettable. Moreover, after the results of the examination are announced, there are often a large number of those admitted who never report because they have also been admitted by other schools, and there are also those who have already reported but re-withdraw because they have been admitted by other schools. The changes and chaos never end. Before the war, the author advocated joint admission by universities. At that time, Central, Wuhan, and Zhejiang Universities jointly trialed it, and there have often been joint administrations by two or three schools since then. However, ten years have passed and there seems to be no significant progress. The possible reasons for opposing joint admissions can be considered from the perspectives of schools and students. From the school perspective, the conditions of each school are different, each has its own tradition, each has its own ideals, and each has its own needs. Independent administration allows each to act on its own without being constrained by other schools. If jointly administered, some schools are not very confident in the participation of professors from other schools in setting and grading the papers, while other schools are afraid that excellent students will preferentially choose other schools first, and therefore can only obtain second-rate students. Students, on the other hand, except for a very few who are truly excellent and have absolute confidence in the examination, most inevitably harbor a fluke mentality, thinking that taking the examination multiple times is like drawing lottery tickets multiple times, increasing the chances of winning. If it is a joint examination, it is almost like putting all eggs in one basket, which will reduce their chances of getting into school.

The possible reasons for students opposing the joint examination are not entirely without basis under the current situation where the examination results are not very accurate. This view can be dispelled as long as the method is improved and the results are entirely determined by ability and not affected by irrelevant factors. Moreover, the total number of students admitted by each university is fixed, and the ratio to the total number of high school graduates is also fixed, so whether it is joint or separate admissions, the admission frequency is actually the same. Unless separate examinations cause repeated admissions, which actually fail to meet the quota, thereby invisibly reducing the precious opportunity for advancement, if this is the case, joint examinations are entirely beneficial and without any harm to students.

It is only natural for schools to be unwilling to entrust the admissions to other schools. However, each school may still retain a part of its freedom when jointly administering the examination. For example, in addition to the common required subjects, a certain school may add special subjects. Within a subject, in addition to the common old test questions, a certain school may add special test questions. In addition to the common minimum, a tea school may add special conditions for passing standards. Individual situations such as these should not hinder overall cooperation. The universities in the United States are the most free, the least unified, and the most individualistic, but their combined University Entrance Examination Committee is very developed and handles the entrance examinations of various schools very smoothly. Chinese university educators have talked a lot about cooperation, and this is an opportunity to actually show the spirit of cooperation.

The ultimate goal of joint admissions should include all universities in the country. Since all universities in the country are following the unified procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Education, there should be no difficulties in principle for a national joint examination. However, it also requires considerable training in technology. The scope does not necessarily have to be too large at the beginning, and can be gradually merged later. Schools with relatively similar conditions can first form a joint, and representatives of each school can negotiate basic principles, such as examination subjects, examination locations, the source and distribution of funds, and then hire examination and grading committee members for each subject, and invigilation committee members for each location, and prepare to proceed separately. If any school has special subjects or test questions, it can decide on its own and still handle them in conjunction with the joint examination. When students register, they can choose schools and departments in order, starting from their first choice, without adding restrictions, and may fill up to the tenth or even the twentieth choice. The admission standards for each school do not have to be uniform and can be flexibly adjusted. Any candidate who meets the standards of the first choice school and department will be admitted according to the first choice. If the first choice does not meet the standard, then the second choice will be considered. And so on, there should be no problems. If the scale is large, a simple system must be established for registration and inspection, and there is no need to adopt the Hollerith electric tabulation method for the time being.

Second, the current method is inaccurate. This is certainly not absolute. Generally speaking, outstanding students may be admitted every time they take an examination, while inferior students may not be admitted. Therefore, the successive examination method is credible and instructive enough to distinguish between the best and the worst students. But whether or not average students are admitted, we cannot help but admit that it is not entirely determined by ability, but partly by luck. For example, students A and B graduated from a certain school. A is usually better than B, which can be determined after a long comparison, but when applying to a university, B may be admitted while A may not. Such cases are often heard. Of course, part of the reason may be the instability of the candidates themselves, such as being temporarily flustered, resulting in abnormal performance. But the inaccuracy of the examination method must bear at least part of the responsibility.

Most schools now use traditional essay-style questions, and rarely use more objective new-style questions. The biggest reason why essay-style examinations cannot be accurate is that grading lacks standards and is partly determined by various accidental factors. If the number of examination papers is not large and there is sufficient time for grading, the impact of these accidental factors can be reduced to a minimum. Unfortunately, university entrance examinations are controlled by the opposite conditions, with at least several thousand or even tens of thousands of examination papers that must be graded and completed within a few weeks. Therefore, except for math questions, which are more objective in nature, the impact of accidental factors is very serious. First, because there are many examination papers and short time, it is necessary to distribute them to several professors for grading. The professors are uneven in their strictness and have different likes and dislikes. Therefore, the scores obtained for the same examination paper can vary greatly when graded by different professors. Secondly, the standards of the same professor cannot remain unchanged throughout. The examination papers for the entrance examination are completed in one day, and the time does not allow for the modification of the graded scores. If an already graded examination paper is graded again by a professor two or three days later, unless the score assigned for the first time has left a trace on the examination paper or in memory, the two scores will inevitably be different, and the difference can sometimes be considerable. In addition, the position or grading order of an examination paper is also an important factor in determining its score. The same examination paper will appear inferior and lose a few points if placed after several particularly excellent papers, and will appear outstanding and gain a few points if placed after several particularly poor papers.

However, objective examination methods also have their weaknesses and are also criticized, but their use in entrance examinations is absolutely more beneficial than harmful. For example, we do not deny that true-false and multiple-choice questions may be guessed correctly out of thin air, and therefore are also affected by accidental factors, but when the number of questions is large enough, this impact is insignificant compared to the errors caused by the lack of grading standards. However, objective examinations should make full use of time and prepare a large number of questions, otherwise they may be even more inaccurate than traditional methods. Many years ago, I saw a university using true-false questions for the entrance examination of a certain subject, but there were only ten questions. The candidates read these ten questions, filled in ten positive or negative symbols, and the slowest did not take more than five minutes, while the stipulated examination time was two hours, which was too ridiculous. Here, it must be solemnly stated that the task of setting questions for objective examinations is very cumbersome and can never be completed with a little thought in a few minutes.

Another criticism of objective examinations is that the questions often focus excessively on trivial memories such as names of people, places, events, and dates, which are only suitable for primary school students and are insufficient for selecting university talents. This is indeed a weakness of some objective examinations, but it is not unavoidable. In fact, objective examinations are not limited to trivial items, nor are they limited to memory, and are not based on a certain level. The University Entrance Examination Committee of the United States has accumulated many years of experience and research, and has now adopted objective examinations for everything except English composition. Objective examinations can not only be applied to high school graduates, but also to university graduates without any difficulty. For example, the graduate school examinations jointly held by the four most famous universities in the United States, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia, also use entirely objective questions.

Before the war, the author tried to compile a type of objective examination material for college students and tested it in the Zhejiang University entrance examination. The effect of predicting the candidates' performance after admission was comparable to the total score of the old-style examinations in various subjects. However, the old-style examination had seven or eight subjects, with each subject taking two hours, for a total time averaging fifteen hours, while the objective examination took only ninety minutes, a ratio of ten to one. Moreover, in order to avoid repetition with the examinations in various subjects, the materials used in the objective examination were mostly outside the high school curriculum, close to intelligence tests. If the objective test questions also draw from various subjects, assuming that each one takes one hour, which is half the time of the traditional examination, its predictive power will definitely increase a lot.

Third, university entrance examinations are directly responsible for selecting talents and indirectly affect the teaching materials and teaching methods of middle schools. There is a common and fundamental problem in the current school education in China, which is that it places too much emphasis on form and knowledge, so that it neglects the practical value of knowledge. This is manifested at any time in teaching materials, teaching methods, and examinations. If university entrance examinations can avoid this problem, not only can more useful talents be selected, but it can also improve the teaching materials and teaching methods of middle schools and correct students' learning attitudes. It can be said to be a possible starting point for the improvement of Chinese education.

Regardless of the teaching of any subject, definitions and other provisions must of course be understood and able to be applied in order to be valuable. If the examination only asks about the provisions, it inevitably encourages students to memorize by rote, and those who can recite and write from memory may not be able to understand and apply them. Therefore, the test questions should force candidates to show some performance in understanding and application, so as to clearly distinguish the level of their ability.

### Amidst Famine, Relief Teams and Tractors Gather Near Shenyang

[Shenyang, 10th of this Month] In the fields approximately thirteen [units of measurement missing] from Panyang City and near Sujiadun, there were twenty-three tractors plowing the land last week in preparation for planting the last batch of sorghum. These machines were shipped by the United Relief Headquarters earlier last year. However, since the US Relief Work Team air-lifted nineteen tons of agricultural implements, such as American-made plows, harrows, and tractor parts, to this place in mid-May of this year, their effectiveness has doubled after being used in conjunction with various machines. The team previously had thirty-eight fully equipped tractors. After the plows and disc-shaped and diamond-shaped harrows of the American Relief Work Team were all unpacked and assembled, it could be expanded to eighty fully equipped tractors. Currently, the farmland near Sujiadun cultivated using tractors totals 12,000 mu or 2,000 acres. Part of this land is owned by the Shenyang Political Committee, and part is the private property of fifteen farmers. Arrived at Siba in Hangzhou at 4:00 PM on the 12th and docked. Once the tide arrives, the two ships can sail to the Nanxingqiao pier in Hangzhou and dock.

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 12th of this Month] The Qianjiang trial voyage has now been successfully completed. Zhou Nianxian, an engineer from the China Trust Bureau, said: "With this achievement under difficult conditions, future voyages should be easier." Currently, the river course is not fixed and urgently needs to be set with buoys. After buoys are also set at the Nanhui Cape, the two-section shipping centered on Zhapu will be extremely convenient, and its economic value is equal to half a railway, while the reduction in costs for merchants, the convenience of transshipment, and the benefits are incalculable. The two ships are waiting for the tide and will return to Shanghai soon. Whether or not it will be officially opened for navigation in the future remains to be decided by the Director of the China Trust Bureau.

### The Mystery of Yang Mei Cannot Be Unveiled; The Chongqing Health Bureau Is Riding a Tiger

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 12th of this Month] Yang Mei has recently become a mysterious girl attracting attention from people across the country. Her daily life and actions have become a concern for our readers across the country. Director Li Zhiyu received a letter sent by air on the 10th from Jin Zhengjing of the Hubei Department of Finance, saying that Yang Mei has not eaten for nine years, which has been confirmed by your bureau, is truly a rare wonder of the world. Yang Mei is truly a "national treasure" of China and should be housed in a clean room, provided with incense and flowers, and allowed to be admired by all. She should not be dressed in cheongsams and smeared with lipstick, turning a heavenly fairy girl into a worldly enchantress. If Yang Mei becomes vulgar and eats worldly food again, the fault of your director will not be small.

As of today, Li Zhiyu has not actively proceeded with the organization of the next step examination institution for Yang Mei. The difficulties he has encountered are that Yang Sen is interested in this matter, but he is still unclear on how to proceed and what specific measures to take. Secondly, the Ministry of Health only ordered the Health Bureau to investigate and reply to the reasons for the possibility of Yang Mei not eating published by Dr. Jiang Zhuahua, Director of the Municipal Hospital, before February, and has not mentioned a word about Yang Mei since then. However, medical professionals here have always believed that the previous 21-day observation was not strict enough. Now, she has been moved to Jiulongpo and is accompanied by a female police officer and a nurse, which is also far from careful. In addition, there is little understanding of Zhuo Songdai's attitude. Therefore, apart from the meeting's decision to establish a technical committee, there has been no further discussion.

According to reliable sources, Yang Mei recently received a letter from her hometown stating that her only relative, her uncle, has passed away, and she is eager to return to her hometown to manage her private property of one pig, one chicken, and five dan of sorghum. Ji Zhiyu has repeatedly stated that Yang Mei must not leave Chongqing in the short term. If Yang Mei leaves Chongqing, the mystery of not eating will never be unveiled. The Health Bureau has now become a situation of riding a tiger and cannot get off, and must conduct an in-depth examination. Without this courage and conditions, giving up the research will inevitably become a laughingstock. Therefore, when talking to Li Zhiyu about Yang Mei, he has revealed a worried and anxious expression.

Dong Bingqi, the director of the Sichuan Academy, has gone to Beijing and Shanghai. He was the first person in the medical community to examine Yang Mei's physical body. Studying Yang Mei is not only the responsibility of the Chongqing Health Bureau, but scientists across the country should also jointly promote it. The current evolution has reached the point where if scientists from Jia, Shanghai, and even foreign countries do not come to Chongqing to participate in cooperation, the examination of Yang Mei may not be able to be carried out. As a result of Dong Bingqi's meeting with Dr. Liu Ruiheng, Lin Kesheng, Cai Qiao and other experts, the next step examination of Yang Mei is of great importance. With this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the Ministry of Health should no longer remain silent or indifferent to the Yang Mei incident.

### Farmers Borrow One, Repay Three: "Paradise" Reveals New Tears

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 10th] Hangzhou newspapers are abuzz with rumors of unusually high city revenue this year, but when someone asked the mayor, it turned out not to be true. Hubin Road is being renovated, some scenic areas are being tidied up, and various shops are also fixing their facades. At first glance, Hangzhou does indeed present a grand scene this year. However, in the neighboring three counties of Hangjiahu, although silkworm farming is thriving, the price of mulberry leaves is extraordinarily high. Silkworm farmers can't even afford to buy mulberry leaves and are forced to dump them into the fields as fertilizer. Some reluctantly borrow money at high interest rates to raise silkworms, but the silkworm cocoons don't sell for much. Although the government has raised the purchase price to 25 million yuan per load, it's still not enough to cover the costs. Moreover, some people are forcibly buying farmers' cocoons at low prices and then selling them to factories at high prices. Others have obtained loans for purchasing cocoons but find fault with the quality of the cocoons, deliberately lowering the prices, and using the remaining loan for other purposes.

The farmers originally hoped to earn some money from "raising silkworms" and "spring flowers" to cultivate their fields, but now silkworm farming has failed, and spring flowers aren't profitable either. The capital for rice seedlings must now be borrowed from others. Sadly, in the rural areas of Jiangnan, there are cases of borrowing money and repaying with rice, where borrowing one unit results in repaying three. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this situation.

Shangrao [Our Newspaper Report] On the morning of the 8th, the Keelung Garrison District of the Taiwan Garrison District received over 190 new recruits in the city, housing them in the Main Hall and the Tianhou Temple. They were scheduled to leave Rao within a few days. However, at 10:30 a.m. on the 8th, one of the over 120 recruits housed in the Main Hall suddenly raised his clothes as a signal, shouted a command, and the entire group responded, tearing down the bamboo walls surrounding the hall and rushing out, knocking down the guards and fleeing in all directions. The team leader and deputy leaders in the camp immediately opened fire to stop them, but because the residential buildings around the garrison were densely packed and all the recruits were not wearing uniforms, they could not be identified once they reached the streets. Four were killed on the spot, and only six were captured. As many as 115 escaped. The reason for the mass escape of the recruits is under secret investigation, and the Jiangbei Garrison District has been contacted by telegram to send personnel to investigate thoroughly. According to the team leader, Lai, when receiving the recruits on the 25th of last month, he discovered that several spies had infiltrated their ranks and had arrested and prosecuted them one by one. It remains to be seen whether the mass escape was also incited by illegal elements after a thorough investigation.

### Watching the Central Plains from Wolonggang

— Our Newspaper Reporter Bu Mian

[Our Newspaper Nanyang, 8th] Ever since Liu Bocheng and his bandit gang issued a "crossing the Yangtze in May" blank check, they have never been able to cash it. So, they issued another check, "attempting to annihilate the main force of the Central China Field Army." Can this marked check be cashed? Ironclad facts have already determined its fate.

The Wanxi local forces have been defeated in appearance, but in reality, they have been reorganized into smaller units. (Note: The Wanxi local forces usually operate in the civilian population to avoid hindering production.) Although some weapons have been lost, the bandit army has not achieved its expected goals. On the contrary, in the Houpo Li Guanquiao area west of Deng County, one and a half regiments were annihilated by Zhang Zhen's army corps, and Liu's 20th Column was utterly defeated. Laohekou was regained and lost again. Liu Bocheng silently returned to the Funiu Mountain area from Xixiakou. Is he really fleeing westward? No, definitely not. This is his smokescreen. While the National Army was resting in Zhenping for three days, the bandits secretly detoured through Tanghe from Deng County and infiltrated the northwest area of Biyang, planting the seeds of Nanyang's encirclement. The fate of the Central Plains, for better or worse, depends on this finale.

When the National Army moved far east and west away from the Pinghan Railway, the central area of Zhumadian, Queshan, and Xinyang in a straight line was obviously a gap. The bandit army seized this opportunity and moved south from the north of Zhumadian, attempting to besiege Queshan and directly take Xinyang. At that time, due to the weakness of the force and strategic deployment, the military authorities decisively abandoned Zhumadian and, with lightning speed, mobilized rapid troops to rush to Queshan, determined to defend it. At 7 p.m. on the 27th, Liu's 36th Column, part of the 1st Column, Chen's 8th Column's 63rd, 64th, 65th, and 66th Regiments, and Wei Silou's Independent Brigade, totaling 40,000 men, surrounded Queshan. However, they were two hours too late. The new deployment of Queshan had already been completed. Therefore, after four days and nights of fierce fighting, the bandits ultimately failed. They themselves also admitted that their actions were slow, their intelligence was inaccurate, and their estimates were wrong. Then, the 36th Column fled westward along the railway. If one were to humbly study the situation, the bandits were feigning an attack on Queshan, attempting to lure our main force westward to aid, falling into their bag net and annihilating it in one fell swoop. This is the trap set by the self-proclaimed Liu Bocheng.

By midnight on the 29th, the bandit army was fleeing northwest in a panic. At the same time, Liu's 20th Column and Chen's 10th Column also advanced rapidly from the northwest area of Biyang. General Zhang Zhen, who commanded the battle, knew their pre-set trap and moved towards Dongqiaotou in Sheqizhen. On the 1st of this month, the bandit army increased, including Liu's 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 14th Columns, Chen's 10th Column, Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns, Kong Congzhou's 38th Army, New 1st Brigade, New 2nd Brigade, and 22nd Brigade. The battle situation reached a fever pitch. Both sides engaged in close combat. The Hankou base air force also used powerful formations of aircraft to assist in the battle day and night. The entire plain was like a sea of blood. In order to avoid unnecessary damage to the main force, the National Army continued to retreat in three routes towards Nanyang, luring the bandits in deeper to annihilate them before Nanyang's strong defenses. The bandit army, with five times our strength, pounced on the National Army. Therefore, in the course of the fierce fighting, the Lu Division, which was protecting the main force, was trapped in the bandit army's encirclement.

On the 2nd, the bandits launched a major attack on us from the north and south. Seventy to eighty villages south of Taishupo near Minghuang were occupied by the bandits. The National Army surged forward, fighting hard to break out of the encirclement.

Under the Firepower Blockade of the Bandit Army, most of them finally broke through the encirclement. The division headquarters, the 真燭 force, and the remaining small part were still surrounded by the bandit army. On the 3rd, the Nanyang assault corps pressed eastward, reaching Minghuang, only 18 li away from the National Army surrounded in Ma Liuying. The counterattack forces also provided full support. The air force, illuminated by flares, bombed fiercely throughout the night. Although the surrounded troops were out of ammunition and food, they still fought bravely with bayonets and wooden sticks. In the end, even the telephone soldiers joined the firing line. This was a heroic and moving scene. Division Commander Lu, Deputy Chief of Staff Huang, and a part of the officers and soldiers finally broke through dozens of encirclements. After two days and nights of groping, they had no cup of water to drink and no grain of rice to eat. Honest and kind civilians helped them change into civilian clothes and bravely acted as guides, passing through rugged roads, secretly crossing narrow paths and ditches. At the most dangerous time, they crawled for two li in the wheat fields. On the evening of the 5th, they safely returned to Nanyang City. We express our infinite respect to this brave civilian. As a result of this breakout battle, our army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, but the bandit's deaths and injuries were three times more than ours.

The bandits made a desperate gamble and launched a fierce attack on Nanyang in three directions on the 4th. One route infiltrated Suhedian (8 li from the city) from the southeast, one route attacked Dabinyao (15 li from the city) from the northeast, and another small group launched a surprise attack on the airfield west of the city from Wangcunpu (20 li from the city). The officers and soldiers defending the city, under the command of Commander Wang, calmly held their ground. By 10:30, the bandit offensive was frustrated, and they reorganized their formation. At 2 a.m., they launched another fierce attack. Within three hours, the bandits suffered more than 3,000 casualties. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, they collapsed at dawn and retreated to a place five li away from the Bai River. On the 5th, no sound of gunfire was heard all night. Intelligence on the morning of the 6th confirmed that the bandits had retreated in four routes: east, northeast, northwest, and south. As of now, the situation in Nanyang has improved, and there are no bandit traces within 40 li. At the end of this battle, the bandits suffered more than 30,000 casualties, captured more than 2,000, and countless other spoils of war. We only suffered more than 3,000 deaths and injuries.

During this emergency in the Nanyang battle, our reporter made a special trip by plane to Nanyang for a tour. The people of Nanyang are docile, alert, and sensitive. They not only automatically helped the army build fortifications but also took pride in competing to be the first to do so. Young students volunteered to serve in hospitals and care for wounded soldiers. A dozen or so primary and secondary schools continued to hold classes as usual, and even generously donated their school buildings as hospitals for wounded soldiers, setting up temporary classrooms in tents. All shops operated as usual. The entire city of Nanyang showed no signs of disorder.

This is the last tightrope walk for the bandit army. The overall situation of the Nanyang battle determines the fate of the Central Plains battlefield and also determines the bandit army's future movements. Liu Bocheng, who is in a dilemma, is now wandering and hesitating on Wolonggang, where Zhuge Liang lived in seclusion.

### Hoping the Soviets Can Abandon Their Prejudices and Cooperate for World Peace, Truman Points Out Stalin's Hidden Concerns

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 12th Broadcast: President Truman gave a speech at the University of California today, discussing Soviet-U.S. relations. The tone was more severe than ever before. It is said that "the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate for world peace is extremely disappointing, but there is still hope that the Soviet side will abandon its prejudices and participate in sincere negotiations on peace." President Truman cited the following facts of Soviet refusal to cooperate: (1) Refusal to participate in the European Recovery Program; (2) Unreasonable use of the veto power in the United Nations; (3) Indirect aggression against Eastern European countries and pressure on Middle Eastern countries; (4) Using the Communist Party to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Truman continued that what the Soviet Union is resisting is not only the United States but the whole world. The United States has no aggressive ambitions towards the Soviet Union or any other country. If countries around the world want to restore security, they must end the Soviet Union's aggressive behavior. In this regard, Truman listed the Soviet Union's actions in Greece and Korea as evidence.

[Central News Agency Reporter Lu Qixin Following the U.S. President's Entourage, Eugene, Oregon True Telegram] President Truman claimed here tonight that he admired his [old friend] Stalin, and that he got along well with Mr. Stalin during the Potsdam Conference. He said that the Soviet leader was a noble man. Truman made the above remarks to a large audience gathered here on his special train to San Francisco. While reiterating the United States' desire for world peace, Truman said that when he went to the Potsdam Conference, he had the greatest goodwill towards the Soviet Union and had reached some special agreements with Stalin. He said that although he expressed personal feelings of friendship towards Stalin, Mr. Stalin was ultimately a prisoner of the Politburo and could not act according to his own will. Truman also said that Stalin would abide by the agreements he signed whenever possible, but people in the Soviet government stated unequivocally that Stalin could not abide by the agreements. President Truman expressed his belief that the United States and the Soviet Union will one day realize their mutual interests, which lie in the peace and happiness of the whole world.

### Bidault Defends Six-Nation Agreement; Fate of French Cabinet Hinges On It; Prime Minister Schuman Plans to Request Vote of Confidence from Parliament

[Reuters Paris, 11th] The National Assembly today listened to Foreign Minister Bidault's defense of the London six-nation conference resolution on West Germany for two hours in a quiet atmosphere, with only members of the People's Republican Party and a few moderate members occasionally applauding and cheering. The outcome of this debate may determine the fate of the Schuman cabinet. The debate will continue on the 12th, and the London conference resolution will be put to a vote next Tuesday. It is rumored that Foreign Minister Bidault will resign after the vote, but this claim has not been confirmed.

Bidault's speech emphasized that the resolutions of the London six-nation conference did not neglect security guarantees for Europe and France. On the contrary, it guarantees that Germany will not be able to use the Ruhr to control and influence the economies of its neighbors. In addition, based on this agreement, France has for the first time obtained the guarantee from the United States that US troops will continue to be stationed in important areas of Germany, even after the end of the general occupation. Bidault also stated that he did not feel any special interest in the suggestion of convening a German constitutional assembly before September 1. The French government has only one condition: that the regime established in Germany should not allow the Soviet Union to unilaterally retain excessive or controlling power. Germany must not become a tool of any allied country. Apart from this, the Soviet Union can participate in the institutions proposed to be established in Germany at any time, and we hope to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. Bidault then earnestly appealed to the parliament to approve this six-nation agreement, saying: "I sincerely hope that you will not allow France to fall into isolation. I am not a person who is easily repentant. You can believe that I never express unreasonable approval or unreasonable excuses. The French government is not unaware of the danger of Germany being divided into two, but this is a state for which France cannot be held responsible. The French government also understands the situation in Berlin and does not underestimate the danger there. The French government will repeatedly state that its ultimate goal is still to reach an agreement with the allied countries. The French government hopes that the Soviet government will soon join with other allied countries to seek a solution to the German peace treaty issue. What the French government is facing today is a choice between cooperating with allied countries or remaining isolated. The French government believes that the resolutions of the London Conference are acceptable. Although the resolutions are not perfect, they must first be approved to make them formally established before they can be improved." It is rumored that Prime Minister Schuman plans to make the vote on the London conference resolution on Tuesday a vote of confidence for the government. Political figures believe that this move can allow the government to obtain a relatively majority of support.

### Romanian Industry and Mining All Nationalized

[United Press Budapest, 11th] Romania, in a lightning-like action, has nationalized almost all of its industry, mining, oil wells, and natural resources.

The bill declares that from today, all oil fields, 720 industrial companies including factories, mines, oil fields, railways, and radio and telephones, are the property of the state. The list of state-owned enterprises also includes foreign-invested oil companies, most of which are British and American investors. The bill allows the owners of the expropriated properties to be compensated with government bonds. The total amount of compensation will be determined by a special committee, and the money will be paid by the newly established "Nationalized Industry Foundation," which will use the net profit of the industry to purchase bonds.

[United Press Seoul, 12th] The American-backed South Korean parliament passed a resolution on the 12th by a vote of 106 to 20, calling on the people of North Korea to resist the Soviet occupation authorities and hold free elections themselves.

[Reuters Seoul, 11th] The United Nations Korean Commission's announcement that it is preparing to hold discussions with the newly elected South Korean congressmen is actually a sign that the committee has already approved the results of the recent elections.

### Soviet Occupation Authorities Prepare for Currency Reform in East Germany; Berlin Allied Control Council Shows Signs of Disintegration

[Reuters Berlin, 11th] Germans close to the Soviet military government revealed that the Soviet military government in Germany is actively preparing to announce the implementation of currency reform in East Germany within hours after the West German currency reform recommended in the London Six-Nation Conference communiqué is realized. Political figures believe that the recent disputes over passenger travel between West Germany and the Soviet occupation zone are a prelude to the implementation of East German currency reform. At the beginning of the implementation, traffic between the east and west occupation zones may be closed for several days. Sensitive Berliners, sensitive to the future of the Mark, are rushing to buy everything they can, even porcelain dictionaries, etc., in order to retain their value.

[Associated Press Berlin, 12th] West German currency reform seems imminent, with the aim of recovering 70 to 90 percent of the existing currency. Although officials refused to comment, non-official sources said that the full picture of the plan of the United States, Britain, and France is to make West Germany stand on an economically self-sufficient basis. (1) The West German New Mark does not immediately have value in the international market, and its area of use is limited, but it is hoped that it will eventually have the international value of the American dollar triangle. (2) This currency reform will be the most severe action in Western Europe. (3) The new currency is backed by West Germany's productivity, and the amount of its issuance is limited to the amount of production.

[Associated Press Berlin, 11th] A Soviet official newspaper hinted on the 11th that the Soviet Union intends to withdraw from the Four-Power Control Berlin Committee and control the city on its own. Some members of the Allied Control Council have stopped or abandoned their work due to the Soviet Union's withdrawal, and the whole council is showing signs of disintegration. According to today's editorial in a Soviet-controlled newspaper, the Soviet authorities are now weighing the pros and cons of two options: continuing to jointly administer the city by the four countries, or directly negotiating with the German authorities by the Soviet occupation government. If the latter path is taken, then Berlin is in the Soviet occupation zone, and the Soviet regime's assembly in Berlin is beyond dispute.

[Associated Press Berlin, 11th] The Brandenburg provincial government in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany today prohibited residents from moving to the British and American occupation zones. This kind of ban is still the first time.

### Railway Freight Transport Between Berlin and West German Occupation Zone Has Resumed; Food and Fuel Urgently Needed for Two Million Residents

[Associated Press Berlin, 12th] British military authorities announced today that Britain and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on restoring railway freight transport between West Germany and Berlin.

[United Press Berlin, 12th] US transportation officials said on the 12th that the Soviet Union had intentionally allowed 27 trains from West Germany to Berlin to pass through the Helmstedt iron rail barrier crossing the Soviet area.

[United Press Berlin, 12th] The Soviet Army cut off freight cars from West Germany to Berlin on the 12th, "pending further notice," creating a crisis in the supply of food and coal to Berlin's two million residents. U.S. Army Commander General Clay condemned the Soviet action and denied the Soviet excuse of Berlin traffic congestion. Clay also said that the food supply here is "limited" and that he may not take action temporarily in order to gather information. U.S. troops stationed at the border said that on the 12th, German and Allied cargo troops were blocked from passing through the Soviet occupation zone.

### U.S. Representative Urges Security Council Approval of Atomic Energy Control Plan; Soviet Union Expected to Use Veto

[United Press International, Lake Success, 11th] The United Nations Security Council's vote on the U.S. atomic energy control plan has been postponed until next week. The Soviet Union is expected to use its veto power. For two years, the Soviet Union has vigorously contended within the Atomic Energy Commission. However, the commission does not have veto power. Three weeks ago, the commission voted in favor of the plan despite Soviet opposition, and the plan was submitted to the Security Council for discussion.

U.S. Deputy Representative Jessup today moved that the Security Council approve the U.S. plan. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko requested to speak at the Wednesday meeting next week to prevent its immediate vote. According to Jessup, the governments of all nations face only two paths: to continue the atomic arms race or to agree to an international control plan that all nations can trust. All nine members of the Security Council, except for the Soviet Union and Ukraine, support Jessup's resolution. British Representative Jebb pointed out that scientific inventions have made people believe that absolute sovereignty cannot exist for the sake of maintaining civilization. The basic question is whether countries should accept the supervision of a supranational authority in the area of atomic energy. Otherwise, under the arms race, civilization will eventually be destroyed. The Soviet Union, however, demands that the United States first dismantle its atomic bombs and then implement controls.

### U.S. House Passes Refugee Admission Bill

[United Press International, Washington, 11th] The U.S. House of Representatives today passed a bill by a vote of 289 to 91, allowing 202,000 displaced Europeans and an unspecified number of orphans to enter the country.

[United Press International, Cairo, 11th] Two light warships are stationed off the coast of Tel Aviv. The Jewish side believes this is part of an international blockade plan against Palestine. Seven U.S. military officers and one Swedish military officer have arrived in Haifa to supervise the ceasefire. The remaining personnel have been dispatched to the Jordanian capital.

[Reuters, London, 12th] It is expected that the truce observers under the command of United Nations Palestine Mediator Bernadotte will be stationed on the various battle lines in the Holy Land from the 12th to prevent any further violations of the ceasefire order. Bernadotte issued a public statement in Cairo yesterday, listing four instances of alleged Jewish violations of the ceasefire order, and then cabled the Security Council requesting the urgent allocation of aircraft and coastal patrol boats for monitoring the ceasefire.

Arab League Secretary-General Azzam has solemnly declared to Bernadotte that if the Jewish side provokes first, the Arab forces will retaliate. The Israeli military commander has also stated that if the Jewish forces are attacked by the Arab forces, the Jewish forces will not hesitate to retaliate immediately.

### Tel Aviv-Jerusalem Highway Reopened

In addition to the mutual accusations of violations of the ceasefire order, a major development in the Holy Land yesterday was the reopening of the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, which had been closed since the outbreak of the war. The Jewish side has stated that they have opened a new route next to the Arab Legion blockade station at El-Uut Al-Ara, and supplies are being continuously supplied to the 100,000 Jews in the new urban area of Jerusalem through this new route.

### Both Sides Accuse Each Other of Violating Ceasefire Order

A Jewish spokesperson stated that for twelve hours after the ceasefire order came into effect at 10:00 a.m. local time, fierce fighting continued in the area south of Lake Tiberias and in the Jordan River basin. Syrian forces, under the cover of armored vehicles, artillery, and aircraft, continued their attacks in the vicinity of Ha-Yarden and Ya'akov until yesterday evening. The Arab side's accusations include: (1) Ninety minutes after the ceasefire order came into effect, Jewish artillerymen in the Shuk Ya'ala district of Jerusalem killed several Jordanian soldiers; (2) Forty minutes after the ceasefire order came into effect, Jewish soldiers near the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem fired on Arab civilians; (3) Several hours after the ceasefire order came into effect, a Jewish aircraft dropped several bombs on Damascus, the capital of Syria; (4) On the border between Syria and Palestine, Jewish forces failed to cease firing on time.

### Japanese Cabinet Crisis

Nishio's Accusations Expected to Affect the Entire Situation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The cabinet of Hitoshi Ashida will face a crisis in mid-July because Deputy Prime Minister Suehiro Nishio has been accused of political corruption, and Ashida's Democratic Party is now facing internal divisions. The Nishio case is being investigated by the "Special Committee for Investigating Illegal Property Transactions," but Nishio himself has expressed his willingness to resign from his current position. Because the Allied Headquarters is putting pressure on the Japanese government, forcing it to pass the national budget before any political changes, Nishio's departure from the cabinet will occur after the budget is passed. According to the customs of the Orient, which emphasize joint responsibility, Nishio's resignation means that all Socialist Party members will withdraw from the cabinet, which means the downfall of the Ashida cabinet, as the Ashida cabinet cannot continue to exist without the full support of the Socialist Party.

### Jewish Military Commander Killed in Action in Jerusalem

[Reuters, New York, 11th] An Israeli spokesperson announced that Colonel David "Mickey" Marcus, commander of the Israeli forces on the Jerusalem front, was shot and killed on the 10th while supervising the battle to open a supply route to Jerusalem.

[Reuters, London, 11th] Labour MP Lover asked the Foreign Secretary in the Lower House yesterday whether the British government would recognize the State of Israel. Foreign Secretary Mayhew replied that it was inappropriate to raise this issue at a time when the ceasefire order in Palestine was in effect. The proper attitude during the ceasefire period is to respect the status quo. Recognizing Israel at this time would be a political intervention that favored one side.

### "Tarzan the Ape Man" Johnny Weissmuller Retires; Lex Barker to Continue in the Role

[Reuters, Madras Ootacamund, 11th] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East today, despite opposition from Soviet Representative Novikov, passed a report calling on the world's industrially advanced countries to assist Eastern countries with machinery and basic raw materials. Novikov argued that the report did not take into account the national interests of Asian countries. He said that the backwardness of Asian industry was caused by the exploitation of colonial powers. He believed that to develop Asian industry, it was necessary to mobilize domestic resources and to provide assistance from the outside without any political, military, or economic conditions attached. He also advocated developing Japan's peaceful industry to promote trade between Japan and other Asian countries.

### Three Reasons for the Rice Price Surge; Mayor Reports on Handling Measures; Urgently Cables Central Government to Transport 300,000 Shi of Grain to Aid Shanghai

[Our Newspaper Report] The price of rice in the city has been soaring unprecedentedly for days, with no end in sight. In the Fengjing area, there have been incidents of rice looting, affecting the transport of rice to Shanghai from the area, causing public anxiety. This is a matter of great importance to people's livelihoods. Mayor Wu specially invited reporters to the municipal government conference room at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the countermeasures that the municipal authorities are currently striving to implement. Mayor Wu believes that there are three causes for the rice price surge: (1) the period between harvests, (2) large-scale smuggling of rice to Jiangbei, and (3) the impact of the implementation of the foreign exchange certificate method. The authorities are currently dealing with the situation in two ways: (1) Regarding the rice looting in the Jingyi area, a telegram has been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting its immediate suppression and asking it to provide better protection for rice merchants transporting rice in the future. (2) A telegram has been urgently sent to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, urging them to rush the transportation of 300,000 shi of rice allocated from distant production areas to Shanghai by the end of the month to supply the people's food.

It is confirmed that Mayor Wu, feeling deeply frustrated by the recent inability to curb the soaring prices in the city, formally tendered his resignation to Premier Weng Wenhao of the Executive Yuan on the 9th of this month. When asked about this at yesterday's press conference, Wu confirmed it. However, because Premier Weng strongly urged him to stay and promised to seek a good solution, his intention to resign has been abandoned, and he has decided to reluctantly continue for the time being.

### 1,400 Tons of American Rice to Arrive the Day After Tomorrow

The first batch of 12,000 tons of rice under American aid, purchased by the American side in Siam and transported by our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, has already set sail from Bangkok and is now en route to China. The first ship, the "Jiguang" (繼光) carrying 1,460 tons of rice, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but was delayed by the unrest in Hong Kong and will arrive on the 15th. Following this first batch of 12,000 tons, there is still 25,000 tons of rice purchased and stored in Bangkok awaiting shipment.

### Mayor Wu Criticizes Jiaotong University's Open Letter; Questions the Anti-Support Japan Event; Investigating Whether There Are Manipulators

[Our Newspaper Report] Mayor Wu, at yesterday afternoon's press conference, again criticized the Jiaotong University students' initiation of the "Oppose the United States Supporting Japan" march, and believed that the "Open Letter to Mayor Wu" from the Jiaotong University Student Union yesterday was deliberately confusing public opinion and had simply forgotten that they were Chinese. The reason why the municipal government raised questions to the school was to investigate whether this anti-American movement was being manipulated. If it was purely a patriotic student movement, the municipal government would definitely sympathize and assist. If it was instigated by the Communists, it would be strictly investigated. The various facts presented are sufficient to prove that this march was a planned conspiracy: On June 3rd, the student union held a symposium to oppose the United States supporting Japan. Except for Mayor Wu, all those invited were leftist professors, creating a one-sided situation, with the purpose of building momentum. The day after the symposium, a representative meeting of various departments was immediately held to vote to take unified action, and it was decided that more than a hundred organizations would carry out a march on the 5th. After summarizing the events, three points can be proven: (1) The so-called anti-American support Japan march was obviously decided before the representative meeting of various departments was held. (2) A small number of Jiaotong University students colluded and contacted the initiators of the conspiracy beforehand, without reporting to the majority of students. (3) The representative meeting of various departments was controlled and manipulated by thirty or so absolutely minority students.

Mayor's Agitated Attitude

Mayor Wu's attitude was quite agitated yesterday. He said that the crux of the problem was whether there was manipulation behind the march. The various questions raised by the municipal government were based on the above principles. If the school could answer each question clearly and prove that it was a purely patriotic student movement, then Wu would personally apologize to Jiaotong University.

As for the tenth point raised in the student union's open letter (original text: In your first so-called seven "inquiries," you asked six "who's," and in the so-called eight "re-inquiries," you asked nine "who's." May we ask, in today's era of secret arrests and the endless "automatic" disappearances, what intentions do you have in pursuing "who's"?), Mayor Wu's reply was: The purpose is to make the conspiratorial actions of the conspirators public to society, hoping to subject them to moral and legal sanctions. If the students' anti-American support Japan is purely a patriotic action, then the organizers should be able to stand up and speak out. Only spies would shirk responsibility from each other.

Guarantee of Public Interrogation Mayor Wu also absolutely guaranteed that the municipal government's investigation of the initiating students would be completely open. In the future, when the police department summons them, the press will also be invited to attend and the content will be made public, allowing the citizens of the city to judge for themselves.

Mayor Wu finally revealed the three stages of the Communist Party as (1) a small number of people hijack the public, (2) an organized minority uses an unorganized majority, (3) using appealing names to disrupt public order.

### Municipal Meeting Passes Supplementary Measures for Grain Merchant Registration

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Municipal Supplementary Measures for the Provisional Grain Merchant Registration has been approved by the municipal meeting.

### Change the Civilian Adjustment Committee to Division: Ren's Statement as Head is Inaccurate

According to Ren Xianqun, head of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, the rumor that the Municipal Civilian Adjustment Committee will be reorganized into an allocation division directly under the Ministry of Food is not true. He felt that the handling was tricky due to the recent endless rise in rice prices, and has firmly resigned as of June, yielding to those more capable.

### Food Allocation for News Staff; Civilian Adjustment Committee Denies Suspension

[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Civilian Food Allocation Committee, the committee has consistently decided to handle the case of special-priced rice allocation for news staff.

### Shanghai's Three Guilds Honored; National Government Inscribes Plaques for Commendation

Upon the request of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs, the former National Government has approved the inscription and awarding of a plaque of "Benevolent Heart and Righteous Deeds" to each of them for commendation.

### Unprecedented Oil Shortage; Does It Only Affect Traffic Order? Why Does the Authorities Ignore It?

[Our Newspaper Report] The oil shortage in this city not only has not improved due to price adjustments, but on the contrary, has become more serious in recent days. The congestion at each gas station is almost out of control. Every day, around 10:00 a.m., the supply is sold out, resulting in scrambling and traffic jams, which are often heard of.

There are currently 52 gas stations in Shanghai, but the gasoline supply for each station in May and June has decreased by 25% daily, meaning that the daily allocation for each station is only 300 to 900 gallons. Moreover, a small number of unscrupulous gas stations are taking the opportunity to channel oil into the black market, resulting in black market oil prices exceeding the legal price by more than double per gallon. This situation has become an open secret, but the relevant authorities are ignoring it and have not taken effective measures to stop it. In addition, each company routinely stops supplying oil on holidays, which further exacerbates the severity of the oil shortage.

Recently, there are often many vehicles that rush to the gas stations before dawn to wait, queuing up like a single long snake, but when it is about to be their turn to refuel, the gas station suddenly announces that it is sold out. Therefore, wasting time for four or five hours, and still not getting a drop of oil, has become commonplace.

### Compensation Material Ship Unprecedentedly Searched Someone Secretly Reported Hai'e Smuggling Involving Senior Supervising Officer on Board

According to regulations, ships carrying Japanese compensation materials to China are exempt from inspection. Most of the first batch of Japanese compensation materials have been transported to Shanghai so far, and there are still thousands of tons of materials en route to China. Among them, 3,000 tons were transported to Shanghai by the "Hai'e" ship at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The customs suddenly received a secret report claiming that in addition to Japanese compensation materials, the ship also carried a large amount of Japanese goods prepared for smuggling, and that this smuggled cargo was colluded by a senior officer on the ship supervising Japanese compensation materials and a major smuggling company in Shanghai in an attempt to smuggle in. Based on this secret report, the customs immediately secretly dispatched a number of officers to conduct an unprecedented search when the ship docked and unloaded. The search took a long time, and the customs may announce the situation of the seized smuggled goods today. After this smuggling incident, the customs will closely monitor ships carrying Japanese compensation materials in the future. The last ship carrying the first batch of Japanese compensation materials, the Zizhong (自忠), is now carrying 3,000 tons en route to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive in mid-June. It is possible that it also carries smuggled goods.

### Opening Price of Luan Coal Deadlocked, Resolution Pending

### Business Tax for This Year Levied According to Revised Rates; Finance Bureau Submits to Senate for Reconsideration

After the central government revised the business tax rate for this year, the Municipal Senate, considering that businesses could not bear the burden, resolved at its fifth general meeting to petition the central government to maintain the old tax rate. It also sent a letter to the Municipal Government instructing the Finance Bureau to temporarily collect taxes according to the original tax rate. However, the Senate's proposal was not approved by the central government. The Ministry of Finance has again ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to levy the business tax for this year according to the revised tax rate, starting from January 1st. As the Finance Bureau had previously invited people to levy the spring business tax according to the Senate's decision and had already started collecting it at the original tax rate, changing to the revised tax rate now would require businesses to pay an additional half or 20% for the spring tax collection (the new tax rate levies the tax rate on business income; increasing two percent on income), which would inevitably arouse resentment among businesses and increase the difficulty of collection. Yesterday, the bureau submitted the case to the Senate for reconsideration to decide on a course of action.

### Social Affairs Bureau Sets Standards for Height and Weight of Young Workers

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently received instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs to establish standards for height and weight of young workers in the Southeast region of our country and hopes that factories will be instructed to comply. There is a section of explanation at the front, roughly saying: "Although the Factory Law has age restrictions on child labor, our country has not yet implemented a birth certificate system, which makes implementation very difficult. Now, after deliberation by the Committee for Determining the Height and Weight of Child Labor, the standard for young workers in the Southeast region is established, and all child laborers are renamed young workers." The standards for height and weight of young workers in the Southeast region are as follows: (1) The height of male young workers aged 14 in factories and mines should be at least 140 cm, and the weight should be 34.5 kg. The height of female young workers should be at least 142.5 cm, and the weight should be 35 kg. Young workers of both sexes who do not meet either standard will be prohibited from employment. (2) If male workers in factories and mines are 16 years old but their height is less than 161 cm and their weight is less than 50.5 kg, or if female workers' height is less than 155 cm and their weight is less than 47.5 kg, they will be regarded as young workers. (3) Within one year after the implementation of this standard, existing young workers in various factories who do not meet the standard for the age of 14 will not be eliminated for the time being, but they must be registered upon the start of implementation, and those who do not meet the standard after one year will be eliminated. However, new young workers must still be employed in accordance with this standard. (4) This standard will be implemented from July 1st, and is temporarily limited to Jiangsu Province and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.

### Three Utility Companies Appeal for Resolution of Unpaid Water, Electricity, and Gas Bills, Willing to Offer Discounts to Military Units

[Report from Our Newspaper] The three major public utility companies in this city, namely the electricity, water, and gas companies, have been suffering losses because military units stationed in and transiting through Shanghai have never paid for their water, electricity, and gas usage since the victory. Recently, they have requested the municipal authorities to resolve the issue. They are willing to offer discounts and other preferential treatment methods for military units' usage, but they hope that the bills will not be ignored, so as not to leave the accounts permanently outstanding and increase their difficulties.

### Increasing Work Efficiency by Utilizing Both Hands Simultaneously

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The twentieth century is an era of intense competition where the superior prevail and the inferior are eliminated. Efficiency is crucial in all work, especially in countries with highly developed industries. Their scientists and entrepreneurs are constantly researching: How can work efficiency be increased? How can time and manpower be saved? How can waste be reduced and wealth increased?

Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Industrial Management Association was established. As part of the entertainment program, a newly borrowed American film on "motion study" was shown. This film represents research on the efficiency of manual labor, the result of the painstaking efforts of experts at the University of Iowa in the United States. They discovered that in ordinary daily manual tasks, people unknowingly waste a significant amount of time and energy due to ignorance and neglect, time and energy that could be saved.

Short Process, Ten Steps: The film first demonstrated that any manual task can be divided into several steps of motion. For example, taking a pen from a pen holder, signing a document, and then returning the pen to the holder can be broken down as follows: Reaching for the pen holder is the first step. Selecting a specific pen from the holder is the second step. Gripping the pen is the third step. Bringing the pen closer to oneself is the fourth step. Pointing the pen tip to the area on the paper where the signature should be placed is the fifth step. Starting to sign is the sixth step. After signing, returning the pen to the pen holder is the seventh step. Locating the pen's position in the holder is the eighth step. Inserting the pen into the holder is the ninth step. Retracting the hand is the tenth step. This short process can be analyzed into as many as ten movements, some involving the shoulder muscles, others involving the elbow muscles, and still others involving the wrist muscles. The movements of the shoulder and elbow require more effort and take more time. After analyzing these movements, the scientists found that in most tasks, many shoulder and elbow movements can be reduced or replaced.

The Left Hand is Often Useless: The film also showed that in ordinary manual tasks, the left hand is often nearly useless. For example, when inserting thirty plugs into thirty holes on a wooden board, most people would hold a large handful of plugs in their left hand and then use their right hand to pick them out one by one and insert them. Although both hands are moving, only one hand can be said to be effectively working, which greatly reduces work efficiency.

Based on the above analysis, a method was developed to increase the efficiency of both hands: that is, to minimize the movements of the shoulder and elbow as much as possible. When these movements cannot be reduced, the left and right hands should be used simultaneously in opposite and symmetrical directions.

The film continued to show a comparison of efficiency between the old method and the improved method. Using the aforementioned plug-insertion example, the improved movement involves both hands simultaneously reaching for the tray containing the plugs, each taking one plug. The elbows are then bent inward in opposite directions, and each hand inserts a plug into the wooden board. This symmetrical movement is continued, proving that the time spent can be greatly reduced.

Twenty Glasses of Ice Water Prepared Simultaneously: The work efficiency of a waiter in a coffee shop preparing ice water is an application of the above method. If a waiter needs to prepare twenty glasses of ice water, he might first put ice cubes one by one into each glass and then pour water into each glass. His hand moves back and forth, his movements are too monotonous, repetitive, and time-consuming. The improved method involves first creating a large wooden tray, the tray's bottom having a thickness equal to that of an ice cube, with twenty circular holes the size of the glass openings, precisely aligned with the twenty glasses. First, a thin board covers the glasses, and the wooden tray is placed on top of the board. A large amount of ice cubes is poured into the tray and spread evenly by hand. Each of the twenty circular holes then contains an ice cube. The thin board is removed, and the twenty ice cubes fall into the twenty glasses simultaneously. Then, two rubber tubes are connected to the water source, and each hand holds one tube, pouring water simultaneously. In no time, twenty glasses of ice water are prepared simultaneously.

Unknowingly Adding So Much Wealth: Banks must send account statements to customers at the end of each month. Employees use their left hand to hold an envelope and their right hand to take an account statement, placing hundreds or thousands of statements into envelopes one by one, wasting so much time in the process. If the envelopes are divided into two piles and placed on the table, with the openings facing outwards and the middles held down lightly with an object, both hands can simultaneously take one statement each and insert them into the envelopes on either side. The work can be completed in less than half the time.

Similar examples of increasing efficiency by using both hands simultaneously and reducing unnecessary movements can be studied and implemented at any time in factories, offices, candy stores, and other workplaces that require manual labor. The film presented many comparisons, ending with the sound of a "tick-tock" clock. It tells us: If humans can make good use of every "tick-tock," they can unknowingly create so much more wealth!

### Shortage of Arrivals, Rising Production Costs: Rice Prices Soar, Special High-Quality Japonica Rice Approaches the 10 Million Yuan Mark

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Dragon Boat Festival, rice prices soared wildly, threatening to approach the ten million mark. Yesterday, special high-quality Japonica rice in the North City market reached a new high of 9.3 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). Door-to-door rice shops, after adding a 6% legal profit and transportation costs, reached approximately 9.78 million yuan. Breaking the ten million mark is not far off.

According to relevant sources, the reasons for the recent surge in rice prices are: (1) hoarders are speculating and unwilling to sell; (2) arrivals have been scarce in the past two days, totaling only slightly over 4,000 shi; (3) yesterday morning, a rice boat from Fengjing, carrying 160 shi of rice, was robbed by impoverished people; (4) the wild rise in prices of all goods is stimulating rice prices; (5) rice prices in producing areas are also rising, with Wuxi, Songjiang, and other places reaching 8.5 million yuan per shi.

Flour: Bidding did not commence because economic police were strictly monitoring transactions at the market and inspecting permits. With the prices of all goods rising, the market was strong, but people were afraid of interference from the economic police, so no one dared to call out prices. The bidding session ended without any transactions. In the after-market, old truck and military ship flour were bid at 2.8 million, and large bran at 2.6 million, each rising by about 100,000. The China Trust Bureau continued to release flour at unchanged prices. New wheat was traded at 3.9 million, and old wheat at 4 million.

Grains: Continued to be firm. People remained exceptionally bullish due to the unabated rise in prices of various goods, and sellers were unwilling to sell much. Soybean prices were reported to have risen by 150,000 yuan due to high costs. High-quality Hanzhou miscellaneous beans were priced at 4.8 million. Millet and red sorghum continued to rise by 200,000 yuan under the continued purchases from the northern gangs. Mung beans were being absorbed by the southern Chinese gangs, rising by 3-400,000. New broad beans had fewer customers and abundant arrivals, uniquely falling by 300,000. The price of naked barley also changed little. Sesame increased by 3-400,000. Raw peanuts were traded very little, with raw peanuts from Dawenkou traded at 17.8 million.

Cooking Oil: The upward trend continued. People were still bullish, and with easy money and abundant credit, buying was still strong. Most sellers were holding their goods and not selling. Soybean oil opened at 20.08 million, then Dalian soybean oil at 21.1 million, an increase of 1 million. Rapeseed oil rose by 800,000, to 19.8 million. Raw oil and sesame oil from small trucks each rose by 1 million, and soybean cake rose by 12-30,000.

### Concerned Parties Analyze Reasons for Loose Monetary Policy

[Report from Our Newspaper] The June price surge is still in full swing. Although the authorities have been selling materials and tightening credit, there has been no effect so far. According to observations by relevant parties, the main reason for this price surge is the extremely loose monetary policy. The excessive amount of capital in the market is due to the following factors: (1) More than half of the silkworm cocoon loans issued in the spring have now flowed into urban areas, estimated to be over 4 trillion yuan; (2) Due to the overall situation, funds from North China are still flowing south continuously, averaging over 1 trillion yuan per day, mostly in cash, causing frequent receipts and payments in Shanghai's banks and firms; (3) The release of funds by the National Bank, for the Dragon Boat Festival alone, is estimated to be around 1 trillion yuan. (4) Since the ban on post-dated checks, the number of circulating promissory notes has greatly increased. With their function equivalent to large banknotes, the expansion of credit naturally affects prices. The current authorities' hope rests on the US aid materials that are about to arrive. When the materials are sold and distributed in tandem, prices may be temporarily stabilized.

Yesterday, the monetary policy in Shanghai was still extremely loose. The market interest rate was between 0.24 and 0.25. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a net deficit of 550 billion in the clearing of checks and notes. Among them, the Central Bank had a deficit of 64 billion, the Bank of China 419.1 billion, the Bank of Communications 106.9 billion, the Farmers Bank 11.4 billion, the China Trust Bureau 10.1 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau 50.1 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury 11.4 billion. Commercial banks and firms had a net deficit of 247.8 billion in the large exchange and a net surplus of 551 billion in the small exchange. Foreign banks in Shanghai had a total net surplus of 248.8 billion.

### Customers Enthusiastically Bullish and Compete to Buy: Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Again, Textile Traders Sell Short, Market Still Rising

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by loose monetary policy. Although the China Textile Corporation (CTC) was still distributing a large amount of yarn, the market sentiment was unanimously bullish, and people were scrambling to buy. Outside buyers were particularly eager. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened high at 30 million yuan. Subsequently, due to competition from Tianjin and Guangdong gangs, the market climbed again, closing at 48.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5.5 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The remaining 40, 32, 20, 16-count and other coarse and fine yarns uniformly rose by 1.3-4 million and over 10%, respectively.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market had abundant idle funds flowing into Shanghai, and buying interest was exceptionally strong. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped 200,000 yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to the industry's ample capital and vigorous purchases, coupled with large purchases by the Tianjin gang, the market gradually rose to 9.59 million yuan. Around 10 o'clock, when CTC announced the sale of Dragon Head cloth with posted prices, market sentiment calmed down, and there was a lot of short-selling by traders. Customer interest turned dull, finally closing at 9.55 million yuan, continuing to rise by 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Four Gentlemen flannel was eagerly absorbed by the Hankou gang, and spot prices rose by 340,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also rose strongly.

The Senate has telegraphed the Ministry of Food to request that the shipment of 40,000 dan of military rations be stopped from being exported, and has also telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government to allocate rice for relief.

### The Anglo-Chinese Incident: A Preliminary Resolution Reached

Jinzhong Issues a Letter Clarifying the Sequence of Events

[Our Paper's Report] The conflict between students from Jinhua Anglo-Chinese University and Jinzhong High School has been preliminarily resolved following mediation by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Director of the Zhejiang Education Bureau. However, Jinzhong High School believes that Anglo-Chinese University's account is inconsistent with the facts. They recently sent a letter to this newspaper stating, in brief: The incident occurred on the evening of May 28th. At that time, our school students were holding a variety show to bid farewell to graduating students. Due to the limited space, guests were generally declined. Several dozen Anglo-Chinese University students forcibly tried to enter, and after repeated dissuasion by our school students and the Director of Moral Education proved ineffective, Headmaster Hu repeatedly explained and apologized, but it was still ineffective. As a last resort, they were allowed to enter. At the time, order in the venue was normal, and there was absolutely no booing. As the first act had just ended, an Anglo-Chinese University student suddenly went on stage and shouted that since Jinzhong High School was not entertaining guests, Anglo-Chinese University students should all leave together. After retreating to the gate, they gathered in increasing numbers, their momentum growing menacing, which then triggered the conflict. When Anglo-Chinese University's Dean of Academic Affairs Cai and others came to the school, they were also unable to stop the students' riot. Later, County Magistrate Yang arrived, but the Anglo-Chinese University students continued to besiege him, trapping him in our school for several hours. The next morning, Commander Chen of the 102nd Brigade of the Army came to the school and genuinely intended to mediate. Headmaster Hu told him that the Anglo-Chinese University students must first stop the attack before negotiating, and there was no truth to the claim that he avoided meeting with them.

Furthermore, Jinzhong's Shanghai alumni have also published a "Letter to People from All Walks of Life," stating in brief: "Our alma mater's variety show was purely an internal school activity, not a public performance. Anglo-Chinese University students had no right to interfere. Furthermore, Headmaster Hu had already explained politely and even made concessions by allowing them to enter. How could they have engaged in such violent behavior?" They also put forward five demands: (1) Replace the president of Anglo-Chinese University; (2) Severely punish the perpetrators; (3) Compensate for all losses of books, instruments, school buildings, and school equipment, as well as medical expenses; (4) Publicly apologize; (5) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

### British Female Athletes Request that Women's Basketball and Volleyball Be Included in the World Games Program

[British Information Services, London Dispatch] British female basketball players have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the women's events in the World Games are limited to swimming, track and field, and a few other events. They believe that the International Olympic Committee should include women's basketball and volleyball events, as these two competitions are most suitable for women and are also very popular in the Americas and the Caribbean.

Scientific Arrangement of the World Games Venue

British scientists, surveyors, electrical, radio, and telegraph engineers are currently busy working for the upcoming Olympic World Games to be held in London. Britain plans to equip the World Games venue with the latest equipment. British scientists are conducting various experiments, such as electrical timing, precision measuring instruments, telephone lines, radio control for races, electrical judging machines, signaling devices, and gas flames illuminating the entire venue, striving for perfection.

New Zealand Athletes Arrive in Britain

The New Zealand team participating in the World Games arrived here at the end of last month, so the team can still train in Britain for nine weeks before the opening of the Games. It is reported that the travel expenses for the team from New Zealand to Britain are approximately 500 pounds per person.

### Issue of World Games Commemorative Stamps

[British Information Services, London Dispatch] Britain has always regarded the issuance of stamps as a major industry, and special stamps are especially rare. Therefore, the commemorative stamps to be issued next month to celebrate the 14th World Games will be cherished by stamp collectors and athletes everywhere. The issuance of World Games commemorative stamps has been a long-standing tradition. The new stamps for 1948 will be divided into two and a half pence (ordinary stamps within the Empire), three pence, six pence, and one shilling and four pence. The two highest denominations are suitable for sending overseas airmail. However, these stamps will not be issued until the opening of the Games.

### Reader's Opinion: Lack of Streetlights Leads to Bandit Activity

Residents of the Shuidaidian Road and North Baoxing Road Area Write to Appeal

Dear Editor: We live in the Shuidaidian Road area. Because it is remote, thieves are often active at night. Since last year, the streetlights there have not been lit at all. Even the electric lights that we paid to install are like ghost fires, making people feel terrified. Moreover, the company arbitrarily suspends power, so having lights is the same as not having lights. Recently, robberies have occurred frequently in the Shuidaidian Road and North Baoxing Road area. Even a kitchen knife can be used to rob homes. People living in the city cannot imagine that Shanghai has such a terrifying area. The police station recently published in major newspapers that if there are problems with the electric lights in the alleys, it can be reported to the bureau for processing, and power outages should not be used to deal with them, as this affects social security. Your newspaper is the voice of the people. We hope that you will publish this to bring it to the attention of the authorities, and we hope that the company will not privately suspend power anymore. The citizens will be very grateful!

Respectfully, Readers Li Shufu and Liu Dezhong

### On Supporting Ourselves

— Wen Ji

Anything in the world, once it involves politics, often makes people feel dizzy and unclear about what is being discussed. Let's take the current issue of "opposing American aid to Japan" as an example.

The discussion of this matter has lasted for more than a year, and the arguments from all walks of life have been extremely rich and extremely convoluted.

Some people oppose American aid to Japan because they worry that Japan will rise again, and our country will be the first to suffer. This is a very legitimate and normal reason for opposition. However, they then deviate from this point and oppose raising the living standards of the Japanese people, saying that they have so many spindles, while we only have so many. Because we have less, they dislike that they have more, and the conclusion is that they must be forced to reduce even more than we have, to make our amount appear greater, before they are satisfied. This assumes that we have no hope of increasing our own amount through other methods. Such thinking, if carried to its logical conclusion, would require that Japan be in chaos and that its railways be torn apart. This discussion started with a vertical line, but somehow veered off to one side.

Still other people also advocate opposing American aid to Japan, but somehow their thinking takes a turn, and they suddenly believe that American aid to Japan has ulterior motives, that aiding Japan and aiding China are the same. Since they are already aiding China, they must also have ill intentions. Therefore, while opposing American aid to Japan, they simultaneously shout the slogan of opposing American aid to China. Continuing along this line, it is naturally easy to twist the words and turn the slogan into "anti-Americanism." It started with a discussion of "opposing American aid to Japan," but eventually only the two words "anti-Americanism" remained. This was also a vertical line, which unknowingly veered off to the other side.

This only covers the "discussion." However, in the last ten days or so, this "discussion" has further turned into action, from convoluted and unclear arguments to convoluted and unclear actions.

In this complex and chaotic state, some people think that American aid to Japan is too excessive, some people think that American aid to China is too active, some people think that American aid to China is not ideal, and some people think that the United States should be opposed for no reason. In addition, there are naturally those unambitious and pitiful wretches who willingly admit that their own products will never be able to compete with Japanese goods and are therefore worried that they will not be able to continue to make a fortune. As a result, the situation is becoming increasingly complex.

In fact, when it comes to the issue of American aid to Japan and China, we should know that countries only consider interests, not right and wrong, and they define right and wrong based on interests. Even if there are acts of assistance between countries, they ultimately stem from self-help. Therefore, if we want others to help us and not help others, we must first seek to have something to offer to others. This is a fact, and it cannot be achieved through empty talk about right and wrong.

What is strange is that among the above-mentioned schools of thought, very few people mention China itself, but today China is precisely the country that most needs to examine itself. Regarding this point, one person who speaks with the clearest mind, I think, is Lu Zhiwei of Yanjing University. He said: "American support for Japan is a matter of degree, and it has not yet reached the point of restoring its aggressive forces. But if the American plan to defend against the Soviets in East Asia fails, then supporting Japan to defend against the Soviets is inevitable... The important thing today is to stand on our own two feet. Isn't everyone bullying China now?" (Shen Bao, 7th) In other words, if we don't stand on our own two feet, even if Japan cannot be used to instigate China, are aggressive countries limited to Japan? Another person is Hu Shih. He said: "Talking about the United States giving a wartime enemy country the opportunity to retain its industry, which has the effect of supporting it, is wrong. We are the country being supported. If we treat support as aiding aggressive forces, wouldn't that be a big mistake?... Because Japan is recovering quickly and China is recovering slowly, we can only worry about ourselves. To be fair, we cannot hope that others will be as unlucky as we are, just because we are unlucky, unprogressive, and not prosperous, so even though it is a legitimate concern, it is a bit abnormal." (Shen Bao, 6th)

Weakening others is by no means the same as strengthening ourselves. We cannot build our national defense on the weakening of other countries' power.

### Lost Secrets

— Mao Yi

Selfishness is a bad habit of human nature. It is rare to find an inventor who is wise enough to make his inventions public for the benefit of humanity. Most people regard their inventions as their personal treasures, carefully guarding them and keeping them secret, unwilling to reveal them. Once an accident occurs, and the person dies and the method is lost, it is unknown how many people's efforts it will take to rediscover this secret. Sometimes, these inventions are lost forever. Similarly, due to negligent record-keeping or patriotism, many secrets in the field of invention have also been buried.

For example, the Italian priest Lucci Talaniti re-researched the lost ancient method of making colored glass during his lifetime. He gave up his work of proclaiming the holy word and created some of Italy's most beautiful stained-glass windows. However, a year later, in 1862, he unfortunately died of blood poisoning, and the secret pigment he used was lost forever.

Another victim was Adams, the inventor of the exotic metal thallium. In order to find a metal as hard as steel but only half the weight and price of steel, he experimented with electrolysis for more than five years, and as a result, he refined thallium. His fortune immediately prospered, and thousands of tons of orders poured in from various railway companies. But it was too late. Adams was too exhausted physically and mentally and could no longer support himself. He was confined to an asylum. He had never recorded his research process and refused to divulge his secrets. Two years later, he and his secrets passed away together.

In 1895, the Englishman Sambritch invented a revolutionary new explosive that could double the range of bullets. The German government was willing to pay 100,000 yuan to purchase his secret from Sambritch. However, driven by patriotism, Sambritch refused the German government's high-priced purchase and preferred to offer his invention to his own country. However, when the British government was preparing to sign a contract with Sambritch, news came of an explosion in his laboratory—the scientist also died. He left no records, and no one followed, leaving only a dim memory in the history of invention.

### Anecdotes about Zhang Xun

— Chen Yixian

Zhang Xun was a military man, not worth mentioning, but he led the restoration in the sixth year of the Republic, and his name cannot be erased from the history of the Republic of China. The world says that Xun was a minor official (goshha) under Su Yuanchun, but in fact, there were twists and turns in this matter that were not known to people, and Zhang Xun was not his real name. I will now tell the story.

When Zhang was still insignificant, he wandered around the old capital with money. One of the guests in the inn where he lived fell ill. Zhang took care of his medicine and food. When this person was in critical condition, he told Zhang that he was a minor official under Su Yuanchun, ordered to come to Beijing to handle affairs, named Zhang Xun. Now, thanks to his care, he was willing to entrust his affairs to Zhang after his death, and gave him his gongpi (small military official's certificate) and savings. After this person died, Zhang buried him in a public cemetery. He took the name Zhang Xun, handled Su Yuanchun's affairs well, and went to Guangxi to cancel the assignment. Su Yuanchun saw that he was quite talented and kept him in service. From then on, he officially became Zhang Xun. Soon after, Su sent him to Beijing again. Xun became intimate with a male prostitute in Beijing, indulging in sensual pleasures, spending all his money, but the matter was not handled. A friend gave him money to return to Nanchuan. Xun, not afraid of death, arrived in Guangxi late at night and immediately asked to see Su Yuanchun. At that time, Su was taking opium. Xun knelt in front of the bed and reported the whole story. Su did not say anything while indulging in his addiction. Xun knelt for a long time. Suddenly, Su spoke and called to his subordinates to drag him away and chop him up. Xun was held by people to the hall. A person came out and whispered in the ear of the person who was binding Xun, and then said to Xun: "Why don't you run away quickly!" Xun immediately left the city. After walking a few miles, a horse chased after him. Xun thought that his life was still not safe. The rider came to Xun and threw a package, without saying a word, and turned his horse away. Xun opened it and saw it was a silver ingot, weighing a full three hundred taels of silver. From this, Su Yuanchun can also be seen as a character. After Xun's restoration failed, he came out of the Dutch embassy and still lived in the house sold by Xiao Dezhang in Andingmen, the old capital. I visited Wan Gongyu and Zhang Nianci, two friends of his staff, who told me about this matter, saying that Xun did not shy away from it.

Before the Republic, Xun spent a lot of money in Nanjing to buy Xiao Maozi, a famous prostitute in the Qinhuai River. Later, he served as the Yangtze River Inspector, stationed in Xuzhou, and took Wang Keqin, a famous Kunqu opera actress from Tianjin, as his concubine. Keqin entered the house and was favored as his exclusive wife. Xiao Maozi died depressed. Keqin gave birth to a son for Xun. However, when Xun's restoration failed and he took refuge in the Dutch embassy, she swept away everything and fled. There is a couplet in the old capital mocking her, which is recorded below:

"Looking back on the past, deeply into the barren land, the lonely night is often spent alone."

"The great achievement is the restoration, I fight then I conquer, the zither heart is moved again and elopes."

The couplet contains the names Maozi and Keqin, which is extremely neat and vivid.

Xun held the Xuzhou Conference, united the military governors of various provinces to drive out Li Yuanhong, and led troops into Beijing to restore the dynasty. The National History Museum is responsible for this matter. Now, I will only mention his anecdotes to provide assistance for discussion.

### The Doctrine of Fate

— Chen Yanfan

Many accidental events are generally associated with fate, and the good or bad of fate, superstitious people will trace back to cause and effect. For example, after a fire, there are deaths and injuries, and some people suspect that their ancestors did not accumulate virtue. Mr. Someone is sixty years old and has no son, and some people think that he has done something bad. If you think this way, it is undoubtedly a cruel mistake.

A person's behavior and fate are not related. The Historical Records of Boyi and Shuqi said that Boqi and Shuqi accumulated benevolence and practiced cleanliness, but they starved to death. Among the seventy disciples of Confucius, Yan Yuan was the only one who loved learning, but Yan Yuan was also poor and died early. The bandit Zhi killed innocent people every day, ate human flesh, was violent and tyrannical, and rampaged through the world, but he died peacefully and lived a long life. I remember a novel by Tolstoy that said that a kind and handsome little merchant once went to the market and stayed in an inn. The next day, he was wrongly accused of being a murderer and was exiled to Siberia, where he spent twenty-six years as a criminal. After twenty-six years, his family was scattered, his hair was white, and his body was bent. He had nowhere to go. — The real murderer was not imprisoned until twenty-six years later. Kind and forgiving people often encounter those tragic fates.

When the Wanli ship hit a reef two months ago, the passengers were rescued to the mountains by the sea. Several women remembered that their clothes and property were all sunk in the sea, and they said to themselves with tears in their eyes: "What bad things have we done? I shouldn't have such bad luck! ... Why did I take this unlucky boat?" I was also on this unlucky boat, and I sunk more than two years of hard-earned savings, worth more than one billion at the time, into the sea. Maybe in the eyes of the rich, it is a small amount, but to me it is a bolt from the blue. But I believe this is not "God's punishment for me."

If you think that all disasters are the result of evil, that error is cruel and immoral. This only makes right and wrong unclear: it makes the unfortunate suffer even more slander and blows. Think about it carefully, and things will be clear. If a person who believes that doing good will surely have good results, he can not go to the air raid shelter during an airplane bombing. For example, if you ask a drunk or an idiot to drive, even with good luck, he will fall out. I believe that behavior and fate are not related, so I am not sad.

### Also on the Method of Distinguishing Male and Female Goldfish

— Jin Yu

After reading Mr. Wu Jiren's article "How to Distinguish Male and Female Goldfish" in this newspaper, I know that Mr. Wu is an enthusiast and has considerable research on goldfish breeding. I would like to provide a brief report on the method of distinguishing male and female goldfish based on my years of experience in breeding, and I hope to attach myself to the achievements of others, which Mr. Wu will surely be happy to allow.

According to the growth ability of goldfish is not weaker than other fish. Breeding for one year, they can reach one foot, which is not a rare thing (research and breeding will be discussed in another article). Generally, the male and female can be distinguished after an inch (about two months), and the judgment can be made based on the length of the body and the shape of the fins and abdomen. Generally, the female fish has a short body and a round abdomen, and the distance from the abdomen to the tail is also shorter than that of the male fish, and there are obvious dividing marks. The four fins are oval and slightly soft; the male fish is not like this: the body is longer than the female, the abdomen is oval, and it is difficult to distinguish between the abdomen and the tail. The four fins are diamond-shaped and hard, and the movement is more lively than the female. Several months before spawning (the spawning period is about March-May every year), silver-colored star spots are grown on the front side of the pectoral fins of the male fish; and when spawning in the spring (fish can have offspring after one year), the female fish's abdomen is naturally large, and the male fish's bright silver stars are particularly bright and lovely. If you carefully play with them, it is not difficult to see at a glance.

As for the method of pressing the abdomen with your hands, it seems that it should not be used often, because in order to promote the development of goldfish, attention must be paid to the hygiene and temperature of the water at any time. Touching with your hands is not only harmful to cleanliness and temperature, but also to the fish's own functions, there is a risk of being inadvertently hindered. In addition, the age of an inch-long fish is only about two months, and the ovary development is not complete. It is difficult to distinguish by just touching it; I wonder what Mr. Wu thinks?

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

When walking on the street, in addition to being careful yourself, you must also be careful of other people's carelessness. — It is the same when walking on the street of life.

Hate is a great emotion, but many people hate for fear or jealousy, which becomes humble.

A person who endures pain with a smile is much stronger than a person who complains.

Many women like to moan without being sick. Don't find them annoying. The real "annoyances" are Xi Shi and Lin Daiyu, the two "harmful spirits."

What is called "putting oneself in another's shoes"? — If you don't have coffee and milk yourself, you hope everyone drinks plain boiled water.

The most difficult debt in the world to repay is the one you yourself are most willing and most willing to repay.

If you feel that life is rich enough, then you should pick up better essences. Perhaps, you think that life is empty, and you must never find a lot of useless garbage to fill it.

Clear water suddenly gushed out from the side of the fifth bridge on Qing Shi Road in Shanghai. This may be the trigger of a hidden flow. Geologists can say it. What is gratifying is that the mayor praised it as the "Seventh Spring in the World," which is especially wonderful in the two words "Seventh." According to the usual practice, those associated with "the world" are always "first," such as "the first pass in the world" and "the first landscape in the world," indicating that it is "there can only be one, there cannot be two," that is, the The Only (the only one) commonly used in Western business, saying that it is unparalleled, invincible, and has a particularly high position, which is indispensable. For example, the customs office on the border between Hebei and Kanto is called "the first pass in the world." Jiayuguan, a fortress in the northwest of Gansu, is also called "the first pass in the world." Two "first in the world" seem to be contradictory in theory, but no one wants to be called "second in the world," the so-called difference of a hair, recognition with thousands of miles. As for the "First Spring in the World" on Yuquan Mountain in the western suburbs of Beijing, Emperor Qianlong inscribed it and determined it to be the first, saying: I once made a silver bucket to compare it. The water of Yuquan in the capital weighs one tael; the water of Yixun on the border also weighs one tael; the water of Pearl Spring in Jinan weighs one tael and two li, and the water of Zhuzi Jinshan Spring weighs one tael and three li, which is two or three li heavier than Yuquan; as for Huishan Spring, Hupao Spring, ​​Mountain Spring, Xiaoliang Mountain, Baisha, and Huqiu Springs, they are each four to six li heavier than Yuquan; only snow water is three reeds lighter than Yuquan. Therefore, Yuquan is undoubtedly the first in the world. Such comparison can be said to be extremely concrete and extremely detailed. First is certainly the best, and second is also not bad.

### A few days of illness, I was lying in bed upstairs, feeling lonely. Friends came to ask about it, so I composed this poem to express my gratitude.

— Shi Shufan

In middle age, I gradually realized that gambling and drinking are wrong. When I was sick, I lay in bed and looked at the curtain. I idly flipped through the Party History and sighed at Niu and Li. I meditated on the talents of the Qin Hui! The swallows in the alley no longer exist, and the doors and windows can be seen. The willow catkins originally entrusted the flourishing world. Living on the upper floors, I feel lonely on all sides, and the medicine bowl is clear, and the strength is weak.

I would rather worry about the red land burying the common people, and the suffering and thinness are tempered into hundreds of refinements. I destroyed the pot and stove after the first summer. I listened to the flutes and drums and changed to new sounds. To adjust my hunger, I eat old and unintentional vegetables. To break the loneliness, the lamps float in a sleepless city, illuminating the Sophora japonica in a sigh, and I vow to be pure and chaste with the accumulated pearls.

The green phosphorescence and white bones cry loudly, and a rain can hardly extinguish the fire. The will of heaven is like a human being, still depressed. The market is not the sea, but it is also turbulent; I hide from the wilderness and steal my breath, and grow moldy. I am lazy to eat and sleep stiffly, and I scratch my short temples. My illness is painfully entangled in the dreams of previous generations, and the famine in the wild says to break into Chenggao.

Ten thousand thoughts are flying, and the couch is restless. How many pitiful people are in my heart. The years are like green beans, and the lamp sheds tears. The temperament is like red pepper, spicy and pure. I dream of a garden as big as heaven. When I wake up, I have no flesh and blood, and my eyes are close! How can I wait to release the Huashan horse? The fire flies and lifts up again, and there is more thorniness.
