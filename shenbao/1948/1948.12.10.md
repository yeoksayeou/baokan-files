### The Battle of Bengbu-Suxian Enters a New Phase: Two Major Victories for the Southern Expeditionary Force; 20,000+ Communists Eliminated Northeast of Yongcheng

[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] Today, the Pacification Headquarters here issued its first major victory announcement on the day following the arrival of the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞團 (consolation group) in Bengbu, stating: This morning, the Southern Expeditionary Force routed Chen's 3rd Column in the Lulou area, northeast of Yongcheng. In the areas of Haozhai, Gelou, and Taoge, the bandits were also dealt blows. In both battlefields, the bandits suffered casualties of over 20,000. Also, when Fang Zhi慰勞 (comforted) the Air Force today, a responsible person from the local Air Force stated that there were no special changes in the overall battlefield situation.

[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] The battle situation around Bengbu-Suxian seems to be gradually entering a new phase. The northward-bound Li Corps has been launching pincer attacks for days, severely striking Chen's 6th Column and Liu's 2nd Column facing them. Today, the right pincer captured the Huoshenmiao stronghold. The Heji force is also pursuing westward, while the left pincer is confronting the bandits in a position at Gucheng and Shizhuang (both located 35 li northwest of Huaiyuan). Due to the northward advance of the Li Corps, the pressure on the southeastern side of the Huang Corps' position has been greatly reduced. In recent days, this corps has been gradually closing in on the Li Corps through attacks. According to news tonight, this unit, after defeating the resistance of two bandit regiments facing them today, captured a dozen or so villages, and its position has expanded to the south bank of the Chan River. The distance between the two pincers of the Li Corps is only a day's march (about 61 li). General observation suggests that with the full-scale attack of the two corps, the meeting of the Huang and Li forces is only a matter of time. The focus of future battles may shift to the Southern Expeditionary Force.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] General Du Yuming, commanding the large Southern Expeditionary Force, routed three Communist columns in the Lulou area, northeast of Yongcheng, on the morning of the 9th. The bandits suffered over 10,000 casualties, with more than 8,000 bodies abandoned in front of the National Army's positions. Simultaneously, in the Haozhai, Gelou, and Taoge areas north of Lulou, over 10,000 bandits were also eliminated. In total, these two areas saw over 20,000 bandits killed or wounded. The remaining bandits, having suffered this heavy blow, are in a state of collapse across the entire front. This glorious victory was announced by Commander-in-Chief Liu of the Pacification Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 9th, after accepting banners and gift lists presented by the three consolation groups from Beijing and Shanghai. Commander-in-Chief Liu also expressed his hope that the consolation groups and accompanying members of the press would convey the determination of the troops under his command to secure the Jianghuai region and reverse the overall situation to compatriots in the rear.

[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] It has been confirmed that the Zhang Gan Corps, moving north from southern Henan, has reached Fuyang, and the county seat has been recovered. The vanguard of Zhang's force has reached Mengcheng and will join forces with the large northern and southern corps at Suxian to sandwich the bandit army. Also, a portion of the Huang Wei Corps, which has been fighting bitterly near Shuangduiji for over ten days, has now moved to a favorable area and is gradually gaining an advantage. It is likely to join forces with the Li Yannian and Liu Ruming corps soon.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] Our armored vehicle unit of the Huang Corps, coordinating its advance southeast, captured the bandit strongholds of Yangzhuang and Lizhuang on the 9th, killing over 1,000 bandits.

[United Press, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] News from the National Army side today: The Communist army in the East China region is currently adopting "wheel tactics" due to a shortage of ammunition. Chen Yi's troops are currently retreating, with Liu Bocheng's forces moving forward to fight. When Liu's forces run out of ammunition, they will retreat for resupply, and then Chen's forces will move forward to fight.

[Our Bengbu Office, 9th Dispatch] Military News: (1) Over 1,000 local bandits from Sun Zhuanjia's unit sneaked into Zhulongqiao, 35 li northwest of Chuxian, on the afternoon of the 7th. The railroad protection unit has increased its vigilance. There was minor damage to the railway last night, and the Railway Bureau has dispatched an engineering team to repair it. (2) Over 3,000 bandits from Chen Qingxian's unit of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade, who sneaked into Heqiao Bridge southwest of Xuyi, have fled into the nearby mountains after being attacked by a certain unit of the National Army. It is also reported that a group of bandits has sneaked into the vicinity of Jiuwanji, east of Xinqiao Station.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] A portion of the bandits in the Hongze Lake area attempted to cross the Huai River by stealth near Xuyi. The defending troops are currently blocking and attacking them.

[Our Jiangdu Office, 9th Dispatch] In order to concentrate its forces for deployment and suppression, the National Army has recently shortened the defenses along the Grand Canal line. It is reported that both Huai'an and Huaibei have been proactively evacuated, and a strong defensive position has been set up north of Baoying to await an opportunity to eliminate the bandits.

[Our Jiangyin Office, 9th Dispatch] On the evening of the 9th, three companies of bandit troops gathered at Sidunzi across the river. They were dispersed after being shelled by our artillery on the south bank.

### Liu Zhi Speaks at Length on the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign: National Army Achieves Preliminary Victory; The Rear Should Eradicate the Psychology of Defeat

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi spoke at length to Beijing-Shanghai reporters visiting Bengbu on the 9th, regarding the current battle situation, stating that the National Army has achieved a preliminary victory in the Suxian-Bengbu campaign. He called on people in the rear to eradicate the psychology of defeat. Liu Zhi said: In the Xuzhou campaign, because the officers and soldiers of the National Army fought bravely, Chen Yi's bandit forces suffered 200,000 casualties and retreated in the face of difficulty, so Xuzhou was unharmed. In Xuzhou, I said that this campaign was not over, because the two bandit forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng had transferred from the Central China theater to the border area of Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui. During the Xuzhou campaign, they took the opportunity to sneak south to Suxian, cut off our Xuzhou-Bengbu transportation, and attempted to invade the Huai River. After the Xuzhou campaign came to an end, most of Chen Yi's remaining forces also sneaked south to the area east of Suxian. In order to concentrate its forces and eliminate the main force of the bandits, the National Army abandoned Xuzhou and fought the bandits with all its strength. This is what people generally call the "Suxian-Bengbu Campaign." Liu Zhi continued: The Suxian-Bengbu campaign is currently in full swing. Although the preliminary victory already belongs to the National Army, it has not yet reached a decisive stage. If we can achieve the expected results in the future, not only can the Jianghuai region be secured, but there will be no major problems south of the Yellow River. If we draw, we can also hold the Huai River. Of course, we hope that the officers and soldiers of the National Army on both the northern and southern fronts can make their greatest efforts and bravely charge forward to achieve the greatest possible victory. As for whether some people worry about the outcome of this campaign, what will happen if the National Army fails? Regarding this point, I have never thought about it, because I am very clear about the strength of the bandits facing us, and I am even clearer about the strength of the National Army. I firmly believe that the National Army under my command will not be so weak and incompetent. Gentlemen, some of you have seen them fight on the Xuzhou front, so you know that what I say is based on fact. Therefore, I ask you gentlemen to work together to eliminate this pessimistic defeatism. (News of the慰勞團 (consolation group)慰勞ing (comforting) the troops in Bengbu and the "Weekly War Situation" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense are both published on page 2)

### United Press Reporter: What I Saw at the Front Lines

[United Press Reporter, Cao Lao Ji Front Line, 9th Dispatch] On the 8th, I traveled by military vehicle from Bengbu to Cao Lao Ji, where I met with Liang Tongxin (transliteration), Chief of Staff of the 6th Corps. According to General Liang, 30,000 Communist troops have gathered on the line from Zhang Baying to Heji, eight miles northwest of here. Cao Lao Ji is currently the location of the headquarters of the 6th Army Group. After talking with General Liang for a short time, I followed the army to the front lines. Nine out of ten villages passed along the way were empty, with broken walls and remaining fires, the traces of war clearly visible. When we arrived at the headquarters of Hu Changqing's army, four miles from the front lines, the fighting was intense. Wounded soldiers were being evacuated from the front lines in batches. The National Army's clothing and food were very good, and the equipment was complete, with American-style carbines and 105mm mortars. I also met Communist prisoners, whose clothing and rations were also quite good. They said: "Chen Yi gave us a speech a month ago, saying that we could enter Nanjing within three months. We have three meals a day during combat, but there is too much marching. We travel long distances at night and rest temporarily in the fields and trenches during the day."

### Military Situation in Eastern Hebei Accelerates: Major Battle to Unfold in the Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan Triangle; Communist Forces Around Zhangjiakou Have Become a Spent Force

[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] The military situation in eastern Hebei is gradually tightening. According to official information here, a portion of the bandit forces around Tangshan are moving westward. Lin's 3rd Column is gathering in Zunhua. Parts of the 9th and 11th Columns, with a force of 30,000, are entrenched in Yutian. Part of the 7th and 9th Columns is still stationed northwest of Fengrun. A large number of vehicles are transporting supplies to the Yutian and Jixian areas daily. Looking at the current situation in eastern Hebei, the prelude to the Battle of eastern Hebei has already begun due to the harassing activities of the bandit forces along the Ping绥 (Suiyuan) (Beijing-Suiyuan), Ping保 (Baoding) (Beijing-Baoding), and Ping古 (Gubeikou) (Beijing-Gubeikou) lines. It is judged that the decisive major battle being brewed may unfold in the Sanhe, Jixian, and Baodi areas of the Tianjin-Beijing-Tangshan triangle.

[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] The National Army's mopping-up operations in the west have been successful. Parts of the 8th and 10th Regiments of the local Communist police force near Beijadian Station on the Beijing-Northeast (Liaoning) line were completely routed yesterday. The National Army also captured the village of Qibaihu southeast of Beijadian and is continuing to mop up the remaining bandits in the Leizhuang and Linxi areas. According to local reports, the vanguard of Lin's subsequent units entering the Guan (Shan-hai-guan Pass) has reached Luanxian city yesterday.

[Our Tangshan Office, 9th Dispatch] Several sections of the railway tracks at kilometer 288 of the Tangshan-Guye section of the Beijing-Northeast (Liaoning) line were destroyed by bandit landmines last night. Also, the railway between Guye and Beijadian was also damaged by bandits in many places. Nine officers and soldiers of the Railway Corps were injured by the explosions. The Railway Bureau has begun repairs today.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th Dispatch] The communist bandits around Zhangjiakou are at their wit's end. The National Army is preparing to launch an offensive to mop up the invading bandits. They suffered heavy blows in Chenjiatun, Yulinbao, and west of Wanquan, southeast of Zhangjiakou. On the 9th, the remaining bandits broke up into smaller groups to harass the area. The National Army is deploying new forces to eliminate the remaining bandits. Also, over 1,000 bandits who snuck in on the 8th were completely annihilated near Nantianmen, north of Zhangjiakou.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th Dispatch] The fighting in the eastern section of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway is currently intense between Kangzhuang and Xinbao'an. The National Army's morale is high, and the terrain is favorable. The bandits are being cut off section by section, and layers of attacks are being launched. The Air Force is also flying in to provide assistance. It is reported that approximately 600 bandits have been killed or wounded, and over 30 bandit fortifications have been destroyed. Also, south of Zhangjiakou, the National Army has advanced to the area on both banks of the Yang River to fight the bandits.

[Our Beiping Office, 9th Dispatch] According to sources, in order to concentrate its forces and use them flexibly, the National Army on the Beijing-Baoding line has completed the evacuation of Xincheng and is engaging in guerrilla warfare with the remaining bandits on the periphery. Gu'an is still being firmly defended by the National Army. Wang Fenggang's forces are carrying out guerrilla operations in the Liulihe area. Wang himself will return to his defense position this afternoon after coming to Beiping to meet with the authorities.

### Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to be Hosted by Truman Today: Discussions on China's Requests; Enthusiastic Response to U.S. Aid to China Bazaar

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 9th Broadcast: Washington News: President Truman told reporters that he will discuss China's request for increased U.S. aid with Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek at the tea party he will host for her on Friday. He expects Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to make three requests: (1) U.S. aid to China of $1 billion per year for three years, with this aid being primarily military in nature; (2) the dispatch of a more powerful advisory group to China by the U.S., and the dispatch of a highly respected general to China to assist the government in fighting the communists; (3) the reaffirmation of the unity of China and the U.S. Asked if the President will continue consultations with Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek after this tea party, the President said that no decision has been made yet. Asked if the President could urge Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek to hold a press conference, Truman said that it would be best for reporters to directly request this from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek. Another reporter said that when Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek came to the U.S. last time, she jointly hosted a press conference with President Roosevelt. Truman said that he was not present at that time.

[United Press, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Lovett again avoided answering questions from reporters on the 8th regarding the activities of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek. Lovett said that he was not aware of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's trip plans and did not know the content of Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's two meetings with Marshall.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th Dispatch] Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek gracefully attended the Christmas bazaar hosted by the Washington Committee of the United China Relief today, expressing her gratitude to Chinese friends for their wartime and current aid to our country. Ambassador Gu Weijun and his wife opened the bazaar. Hundreds of prominent women from Washington's social circles participated, and they warmly welcomed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek with an enthusiastic response. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek said in her speech: "I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the friends who have been thinking about China for many years. Your benevolent acts have deeply touched the hearts of our Chinese people. They are extremely grateful for your long-lasting assistance. This bazaar is especially memorable to us. You have a deep love for the welfare of the Chinese people, so you have held this grand event. And you also have a true knowledge and concern for those who are threatened in the struggle around the world." At today's bazaar, Mrs. Brooks, Chairwoman of the Washington Committee of the United China Relief, welcomed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek in her speech and wished her great success on this trip. Mrs. Brooks also said on behalf of American friends of China: We guarantee to move forward bravely and continue to aid China as much as possible. This afternoon, Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek specially presented a blue brocade curtain to the committee. President Truman's wife also visited the bazaar in the afternoon and purchased several items. It is expected that the income from this year's bazaar will be even greater than last year, and the funds will be distributed by American churches to the various hospitals, clinics, orphanages, and cooperatives supported by American friends within the week.

### Tongxian Expands City Defenses: Military and Civilians Actively Undertake Construction

[Our Tongxian Office, 9th Dispatch] Tongxian is expanding its city defenses, and construction is currently underway actively. In addition to the National Army voluntarily rushing to build them, civilians are also participating in the labor. After deliberation by the City Defense Department, the southeast gates have been blocked, and houses within 30 zhang outside the city wall must be demolished to facilitate firing range. According to the person in charge of the City Defense Department, it is estimated that about 2,000 rooms will be demolished. The government will allocate 50 catties of corn per room as a subsidy. Regarding the housing problem for the demolished residents: (1) Public houses will be used to accommodate them as much as possible; (2) Public land is allowed to be used to build houses at will. Also, the historically renowned潞河 (Luhe) Middle School and潞河 (Luhe) Hospital are also on the list of buildings to be demolished.

### Sun Ke Scheduled to be Discharged Tomorrow; To Go to Nanjing on the 12th and Assume Office Mid-Month; A Cabinet of Giants Seems Likely to Encounter Difficulties

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Sun Ke's cabinet formation is currently underway in Shanghai. His proposed cabinet of giants has repeatedly consulted Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, and others, but no satisfactory result has been achieved. It is heard that Zhang Qun firmly declined the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan, but expressed that if Weng, Zhang, and others join the cabinet, he would be willing to assist. He also believes that the future cabinet must be one with proposals and plans, otherwise he would not join the cabinet. Weng Wenhao said that he could assist in government affairs in the name of a 政委 (Political Committee Member). The results of Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Shanghai on the 8th for talks are still unknown. And because Wu Tiecheng and Chen Lifu are restricted by the law that members of the Legislative Yuan cannot concurrently hold official positions, they are also unable to join the cabinet. Therefore, Sun's cabinet of giants seems likely to encounter difficulties. However, it is rumored here that Sun will assume office on the 15th.

[Report from this newspaper] President Sun's condition is improving day by day. Yesterday, he was able to walk indoors without assistance. Liu Weichi visited him, but the content of their conversation is unknown. According to doctors, President Sun can be discharged within a day or two. Also, government officials Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, and others have been in Shanghai for several days and have been in contact with President Sun. The lineup of the new cabinet can be decided within days.

[Central News Agency, Local News] President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, believing that the establishment of the new cabinet cannot be delayed any longer, has scheduled to be discharged from the hospital tomorrow (the 11th) and return to his residence. He may return to Nanjing on Sunday.

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Closed-Door Meeting Today: Discussion of Foreign Affairs Cases; Postal Rate Increase Case to be Referred for Review

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] The 27th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 10th. A closed-door meeting will be held first to discuss cases related to foreign affairs, including cases submitted by Qi Zhihou and others and Liu Zhaoxun and others, accusing the Soviet Union of violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance to the United Nations. Then, an open meeting will be held. Among the reported items on the agenda are the Executive Yuan's proposal regarding the Temporary Property Tax Statute, which has been submitted to the President for approval and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, and the Executive Yuan's request for review of the proposed adjustment of domestic postal rates.

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Postal rates are about to increase again. The Ministry of Transportation's proposed adjustment of domestic postal rates, after being passed by the Executive Yuan Council, was immediately referred to the Legislative Yuan for review. It has been included in the reported items on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 10th and will be referred for review after the report. The standard for this domestic postal rate adjustment is based on the recent supplementary measures announced by the government to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan. The value of the Gold Yuan has depreciated to one-fifth of its original value, so the proposed postal rates are five-fourths of the original price, that is, the new postal rates after the adjustment will be 5 jiao for ordinary mail, 2 yuan for registered mail, and 2.5 yuan for express mail.

### Temporary Property Tax Statute: Ministry of Finance Believes it is Difficult to Implement; Legislative Yuan Responds that it will be Referred to the Financial and Economic Committee for Review

[Our Nanjing Office, 9th Dispatch] Regarding the Temporary Property Tax Statute, which the Legislative Yuan revised and passed after half a year of review and compromise based on a proposal by Liu Butong, the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Finance to discuss and respond, believing that it is difficult to implement. It has been submitted to the President for approval and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration a few days ago. This dispatch has been included in the report to be presented at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 10th. The opinions of the Program Committee are to refer it to the Financial and Economic Committee for review. The reasons for the Ministry of Finance's response cited in the dispatch are as follows: "The implementation of the Temporary Property Tax will help balance current revenue and expenditure and enrich the military expenses for suppressing the rebellion. It is a good strategy to increase revenue. From the perspective of social policy, it also has the effect of equalizing the burden and meets the goal of people's livelihood. However, after comprehensively reviewing the full text of the statute, there are still areas for research regarding the issues of taxation objects, property registration, and taxation of foreign property. The following is a brief description of each: (1) Regarding the issue of taxation objects, Article 8 of the original statute stipulates that taxable property includes real estate and personal property. Among them, some have already been heavily taxed and cannot bear further burdens, while others are easy to conceal and difficult to capture and control. For example, land has been relied upon for years for the collection of land tax in kind, military grain, and civilian food. If the collection in kind is insufficient, additional purchases and loans are levied. Its existing burden cannot be said to be light. And urban land is also subject to the collection of land value tax and value-added tax, and the burden is not light either. The property tax rate is particularly high, and whether there is such a large surplus power is questionable. According to current laws and regulations, homeowners have no income, and in addition to housing tax and property rental income tax, there are various local levies. This heavy tax may also be difficult to bear. As for personal property, gold, silver, foreign currency, foreign exchange, and cash, jewelry, etc., are inherently impossible to investigate. Even deposits, securities, claims, investments, etc., are either unregistered or, although registered, are mostly assumed names, which is equivalent to being unregistered. How can they be investigated accurately? There are also considerations in terms of method. As for goods and transportation equipment, it is difficult to distinguish which should be taxed and which should be exempted. The investigation procedure is also extremely complicated. How can we simplify the complicated? It is necessary to carefully consider and make a proper decision. (2) Regarding the issue of property registration, our country has never had a unified property registration system for the people. The registration methods adopted by various agencies to promote certain management業務 (business) needs are also simple and incomplete, and they are abolished as soon as they are implemented. The data is scattered. Articles 14 and 15 of the original statute stipulate that taxpayers shall declare and pay taxes themselves, and the collecting agency shall register their property in conjunction with the original財政 (Finance) registration agency and carry out investigation and valuation procedures. Whether this can achieve practical results is difficult to say for sure. Even if there are regulations for the supervisory agency to nominate a limited time for reporting, since the government has no registration data for verification, it is not easy to order the people to automatically report truthfully, and the nomination seems to be in vain. In short, if the people's property has not been registered first, proceeding directly to tax collection may have the suspicion of wanting to achieve success too quickly and should be reconsidered. (3) Regarding the issue of taxation of foreign property, it is generally believed that the wealth of the rich is mostly far away overseas, so calls for collecting deposits from Chinese people abroad or征購 (purchasing) and 征借 (borrowing) foreign exchange assets have never ceased. However, the government has repeatedly negotiated with Britain and the United States to register the deposits of Chinese people, but there has been no result. It seems even more difficult to proceed to taxation. Articles 1 and 8 of the statute also stipulate the collection of property of Chinese people abroad. How to start the process requires sufficient preparation in the diplomatic field before it can be expected to achieve significant results. As for the property of foreigners in China, the original statute also stipulates that taxes shall be levied together. Whether this will cause other disputes seems worthy of consideration. The above three points are related to the success or failure of the property tax and must be considered first before proceeding. Otherwise, the same old story of special donation for救濟 (relief) will be repeated once, which will not only fail to help finance but also lead to criticism from the public opinion. At that time, the government's difficulties will not be difficult to imagine. This Ministry believes that although holding a property tax is a good strategy to increase revenue, we should strive to overcome the various difficulties. However, at a time when military tensions are high and society is turbulent, whether it is appropriate to levy it immediately seems to be something that should be weighed."

### Pauley Arrives in Tokyo Yesterday

### Hoffman Passes Through Turkey

Says China Aid Plan Needs Adjustment in Britain

[United Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 9th Dispatch] U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman arrived here today, en route to China. It is said: This trip has no political or military effect and is purely to investigate the best ways to aid China and fulfill our traditional friendship with China. China clearly needs aid, and how to aid China must be decided after arriving in China.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th Dispatch] Hoffman said here today: The U.S. aid to China plan must be adjusted under the current circumstances.

### Second Batch of U.S. Aid Military Supplies: Transferred from Shanghai to Qingdao

[Our Qingdao Office, 9th Dispatch] Part of the second batch of U.S. aid military supplies was shipped from Japan to Shanghai a few days ago, and then transferred to Qingdao and Tianjin. It has arrived and been unloaded in the past two days. Shanghai has the largest distribution volume of the three places, mostly light weapons and ammunition, with a total volume of less than 1,000 tons. Another part will continue to be shipped to Shanghai in the near future, but the exact date is unknown.

### Bei Wen Clarifies in the Lower House: Britain's Attitude Toward China - Limited by its Own Financial Situation, Unable to Provide Assistance

[Our Dispatch] London, 9th (Radio Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin, during a foreign affairs debate in the Lower House on the 9th, addressed the China issue, stating: "We have informed China that we are unable to provide any material assistance to China due to our own financial and economic situation." Regarding the Chinese Communist forces, he stated: "Currently, no one can predict where the Communist forces will be stopped, or to what extent their power will expand." Britain's attitude toward China is constrained by the Moscow Declaration of December 1945, in which Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union declared a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Due to the wartime strategies of the Allied nations and the post-war situation, the U.S. government is more concerned about providing assistance to China than Britain. The British Embassy in Nanjing and consulates throughout China remain at their posts, operating as usual. At the same time, British expatriates continue to conduct business as usual.

### Editorial: How Will the New Cabinet Be "New"?

More than ten days have passed since the Legislative Yuan approved the appointment of Sun Ke as the new President of the Executive Yuan. During this time, President Sun met with reporters and representatives from various sectors of Shanghai, stating that his main goals in forming the cabinet are to unite all forces, widely solicit public opinion, reform past political practices, and rescue the current crisis. People both in China and abroad have placed great hopes on President Sun's candid remarks. Subsequently, President Sun's medical treatment for a leg tumor caused delays in the formation of the new cabinet. However, yesterday, central government officials gathered in Shanghai to discuss the selection of personnel for the new cabinet with President Sun, and it is rumored that a consensus may have been reached. It is also rumored that scholars from the former capital and hermits residing in Hong Kong are being recruited to join the cabinet. It is evident that this new cabinet, which has been "called for a thousand times," will soon be born with President Sun's arrival in Beijing.

China has reached a critical juncture for its survival. Not only are the military victories and defeats in containing the expansion of Communist forces a concern for people both in China and abroad, but also the future of all political and economic measures is attracting widespread attention. Indeed, China's central government has been in a state of near "anarchy" for more than a month, with everyone in disarray, creating a sense of disunity. Fortunately, President Chiang Kai-shek has remained steadfast, maintaining control in the capital, while the soldiers on the Jinpu front have fought valiantly, maintaining high morale, which has stabilized the overall situation. However, in the struggle against the Communist Party, which has international backing, one should not rely solely on the President's steadfastness and the soldiers' sacrifices. Instead, there should be a strong and effective "new" government that recruits "new" talent and demonstrates a "new" style to lead the "new" forces in society and establish "new" hopes for this future government among people both in China and abroad. Only then can we win back the people's hearts and reverse the nation's destiny. Therefore, President Chiang's appointment of Sun's cabinet is with a spirit of "renewal with the people," and President Sun should bravely shoulder the great responsibility of "reforming politics."

But how should this important new cabinet be "new" in order to meet the expectations of the nation?

First, it must be responsible, not just an administrative office. In a democratic country, the cabinet must first determine its own policies and be responsible to the legislative body for implementing those policies, bearing all the consequences of success or failure. Those who take responsibility are politicians; those who merely sit in administrative offices are just bureaucrats! Bureaucrats typically operate with two words in mind: "push" and "delay." When a matter comes to their hands, they either seek instructions or pass it on to be drafted; they either push the responsibility to superiors or delegate it to subordinates. This is the "push" tactic. Secondly, when a matter involves multiple agencies, consultations drag on for a long time, with unclear lines of authority and responsibility, causing delays of months or even years without any results. This is the "delay" tactic. The inefficiency of Chinese politics and the incompetence of Chinese officials have earned them criticism that they cannot defend against, all due to these two words! Therefore, if Sun's cabinet does not wish to reform politics, it can remain as it is. Otherwise, it should first establish a system of responsible cabinet governance, clearly define the authority of each level of responsibility, and prohibit dereliction of duty and overreach of authority. There should be no "pushing" or "delaying" allowed. Only then can the Head of State remain at the top, with capable assistants on either side, and officials at all levels diligently perform their duties without shirking responsibilities, leading to a new look in Chinese politics and inspiring new hope among the people.

Second, it must define policies, not just assemble a hodgepodge. It should be understood that the general expectation of the people is to use new people and implement new policies. Therefore, the prerequisite for using people is their understanding of policies. President Sun, bearing the great responsibility of forming a cabinet, knows that the times are difficult, but duty calls. Before taking office, he must assess the domestic and international situation and determine the new cabinet's major policies, both domestic and foreign. Then, he should select talent, seeking those who agree with these policies to work together, so that they can be as nimble as arms and fingers, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Certainly, unity of the party and unity of the nation are the characteristics that the new cabinet wishes to promote; but it must be noted that this "unity" implies agreement on policies, not simply everyone being included in the cabinet to share the spoils. If the political views of someone are not asked, or the positions on certain issues are not considered, but they are simply included in the cabinet because they belong to a certain party, faction, or group, then if disagreements arise in the future, what can the new cabinet accomplish? Therefore, a "unified" cabinet must have a center, and this center must be determined by policies. Otherwise, it cannot be called unity but can only be named a "hodgepodge." We absolutely do not want China, at this critical moment of survival, to experience another hodgepodge cabinet.

Third, it must select genuine talent, not just add sycophants. In these days of cabinet formation, many people are preparing to criticize others, many are hoping to move up, and many are engaging in lobbying and competition. We, the people, certainly do not want to see some high officials who have been negligent and responsible for misleading the country continue to cling to their positions, nor do we want to see only a few figures constantly appearing in the limelight, as if the world is so big and the people so numerous, only these people are talented. But at the same time, we do not want to see a group of reckless and arrogant bookworms, under the banner of "using new people," filling positions without the necessary qualifications, and especially do not want to see those in high positions only seeking sycophants who are willing to obey and anticipate their wishes, creating a great hidden danger for the country. It must be understood that the current situation in China is like a disease that has penetrated deep into the body. Recovery depends on national experts with profound knowledge and the ability to shoulder great responsibilities. We cannot afford to allow mediocre doctors to conduct experiments again. In particular, we must be vigilant against those who are accustomed to corruption and have tarnished reputations from sneaking in. In extraordinary times, bearing extraordinary responsibilities requires extraordinary talent. And the foundation of extraordinary talent is still built on the four virtues of fairness, integrity, comprehensiveness, and understanding. Only fairness can prevent one from taking risky and opportunistic paths; only understanding can prevent one from becoming stubborn and self-righteous. Fairness, integrity, comprehensiveness, and understanding, combined with a spirit of public loyalty and serving the country, and knowing when to advance and when to retreat, are the genuine talents that the country urgently needs today. The ancients said: "He who gains teachers becomes a king; he who gains friends becomes a hegemon; he who gains those inferior to himself perishes." This precisely explains that those who govern the country must recognize and trust genuine talent, and should not recruit sycophants and use them for their own enjoyment.

The above points are merely humble opinions. It is only because President Sun has taken on his mandate at a time of crisis, and his actions are related to the nation's fate, that I offer my humble thoughts, hoping that Sun's cabinet will become the beginning of a new era in Chinese politics.

### Comfort Mission Visits Troops in Bengbu, Meets with Commander-in-Chief Liu, Presents Banners and Gift Lists, Plans to Continue Comforting Troops on the Front Lines Today

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 9th] The Jinghu Comfort Mission spent the entire day on the 9th in Bengbu comforting Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Ruming, and all their officers and soldiers, as well as the air force stationed in Bengbu, and the joint action police and military units, conveying the deep respect and gratitude of the people in the rear to all the brave soldiers. They plan to continue comforting troops on the front lines on the 10th. The comfort mission first visited the Suppression Headquarters at 10 a.m., met with Commander-in-Chief Liu and other senior generals, presented the "Defend the Nation, Protect the People" banner and gift list, and then Fang Zhi was publicly elected to represent the entire mission in delivering a speech. Fang stated that the people in the rear are enthusiastically supporting the heroic suppression of bandits by the national army soldiers, and hope that the military and the people will be of one mind, striving to "have bandits without me, have me without bandits." Fang continued that, historically, tyrannical forces from the south, whenever they reached the Huai River, would suffer setbacks or perish. For example, Fu Jian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty suffered defeat in the Battle of Feishui, which is proof of this. The Chen Liu bandit group's invasion of the Huai River this time will inevitably repeat historical precedents. Commander-in-Chief Liu, upon receiving the banner, thanked the comfort mission on behalf of all the officers and soldiers, stating that all the soldiers will work harder to secure the Huai River, reverse the overall situation, and repay the earnest expectations of the Jinghu compatriots. The comfort mission then visited the headquarters of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liu Ruming, presented the "Pillar of the Party and the Nation" banner, and all the members were greatly inspired by the strong fighting will, well-fed horses, and vigorous spirit of Liu's troops.

### Chen Bulei's Coffin to Be Buried Today, Mrs. Chen Sends Letter to Funeral Committee, Declines Proposal for National Funeral or Public Funeral

[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, 9th] Chen Bulei's coffin is scheduled to be transported from the Siming Guild Hall to the Municipal Education Bureau on Yingbai Road at 8:00 a.m. on the 10th. There are many wreaths sent by people from all walks of life, and a public memorial service will be held there. Afterwards, it will be sent to Fancun for burial.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Mr. Chen Bulei will be buried in Hangzhou on the 10th. Mr. Chen wrote a will the day before his death on November 13, leaving it to his secretaries, Jiang Junzhang and Jin Shengwu, stating: "Prices are rising daily, so be sure to have a frugal burial, a thin coffin, and a simple burial. If possible, bury me in the Yong'an Cemetery in the suburbs of Nanjing (or a public cemetery within the city is also fine). The funeral should be completed within three to five days." On November 14, Mrs. Chen sent a letter to the funeral committee, stating Mr. Chen's lifelong wishes, requesting to be buried in Fanzhuang, Hangzhou, and declining a national funeral or public funeral, only constructing a simple grave for an ordinary citizen, with the inscription "Grave of Mr. Chen Bulei of Cixi." The funeral committee decided to follow Mrs. Chen's wishes and send Mr. Chen's coffin to Hangzhou, first placing it in the Siming Guild Hall, and burying it after the grave is completed. The following is Mrs. Chen Wang Yunmo's letter to the funeral committee: "To the esteemed members of the funeral committee: My late husband passed away unfortunately, and I, Yunmo, am overwhelmed with grief and confusion. I am grateful for your assistance in handling the funeral arrangements. Your kindness and friendship are deeply appreciated. Thinking of my late husband's lifelong dedication to national affairs, with the nation and the people in mind, and his emphasis on frugality and simplicity in life, I sincerely hope that his funeral arrangements will reflect his wishes and be as simple as possible to comfort his spirit. My late husband loved the beautiful scenery of Hangzhou and purchased a piece of land near Fanzhuang, with the idea of spending his old age there. Therefore, it seems appropriate to choose Hangzhou as his final resting place, and to construct a simple grave for an ordinary citizen on that land, with the inscription 'Grave of Mr. Chen Bulei of Cixi,' without engraving any official titles, to fulfill his lifelong desire for simplicity. If the tomb is not completed in time, the coffin can be temporarily placed in the Siming Guild Hall in Hangzhou, to be buried on a selected date. I have also heard that the state, in recognition of my late husband's hard work for the country, intends to grant him the honor of a national funeral or public funeral. However, my late husband said in his will that as a scholar serving the country, he regrets not having accomplished much, and today the country is in turmoil and the people are displaced. How can he bear to waste the nation's money for his own honor? Therefore, I ask you to kindly explain and decline the proposal for a national funeral or public funeral. In the unlikely event that the state has made a decision that cannot be changed, I hope that the arrangements for the funeral, burial, and tomb construction will be as simple and frugal as possible, and that the surplus funds will be used to relieve the starving people. I hope that you will make separate plans for the specific arrangements. In this way, my late husband's wishes to save the country money and seek happiness for the people will be fulfilled, and you can comfort him in the afterlife. I am weeping as I write this, and I do not know what I am saying. Please understand. Sincerely, Chen Wang Yunmo. November 14."

### The Stalemate in East China and Stability in North China: The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau Releases Weekly Battle Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau has just released the weekly battle situation from November 2nd to 8th as follows:

(1) East China Theater

In order to strike at the main bandit forces of Chen and Liu clustered around Suxian, our forces proactively withdrew from Xuzhou on the 3rd, dividing into three routes to advance towards the bandits' rear. The eastern route, Cao Village and Jiagou, increased pressure on the bandits entrenched along the railway line. The central route launched a mop-up operation between Xiaoxian and Suixikou. The western route advanced towards Yongcheng to intercept the bandit army's retreat towards the Yellow River flood area.

The main force of the Chen bandits was originally concentrated southward towards Suxian and Guzhen, attempting to isolate the connection between our Xuzhou-Bengbu area and threaten Bengbu. However, because our Xuzhou troops advanced southwestward, cutting off the rear communication lines of the Chen and Liu bandits' main forces, and coupled with the fact that our Huang Wei Corps was also pressing towards Suxian from the right bank of the Hui River, threatening to sever the bandits' communication strongholds in Suxian, the Chen bandits, in a state of panic, ordered a retreat at a speed of 100 li per day. However, our main force on the Bengbu front bravely pursued, and the Huang Wei Corps on the west bank of the Hui River also struck from the flank. The bandits dared not retreat northward with all their strength, so the bandits absorbed by us south of the Hui River had no choice but to build deep trenches and high walls, and maintain a stalemate with us in areas such as Shuangduiji, Qianhou Zhoucun, Lizhuang, Shenzhuang, and Zhangjiazhuang. In addition to using the Second Column and the Sixth Column of the Chen bandits to resist our pursuit step by step, covering the full northward retreat of Chen Yi's bandit troops, in order to block our southward advance and reduce the crisis in the Yongcheng area, Liu's bandits also gathered local communists and stirred up trouble in the Jiangyan and Xuyi areas of northern Jiangsu, attempting to contain us. Currently, the Chen bandits gathered facing our Qiu, Li, and Sun Corps are the First, Third, Fourth, Seventh, New Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fast, Liangguang, and Luzhongnan Columns, totaling thirteen units, with a total strength of less than 200,000, currently in a stalemate with us.

Our Huang Wei Corps, fiercely fighting with the bandits in the Shuangduiji area southwest of Suxian, has killed or wounded more than 25,000 bandits in the past ten days or so with superior artillery fire. Among them, the First and Ninth Columns of the Liu bandits and the Twelfth Column of the Chen bandits suffered the most damage. Upon inspection of the bandit corpses, the brigade commander of the 26th Brigade of the Ninth Column, Shou Wengao, and others have been killed by us. In the attacks on Shenzhuang and Zhouzhuang on the 6th of this month, the 20th Division of the Seventh Column of Chen Yi's bandit troops, which was reinforcing Liu's bandits, was completely defeated, killing more than 2,000 bandits and seizing more than 30 light and heavy machine guns, more than 400 rifles, and many other military supplies. The bandits in that area are currently building fortifications to defend firmly, and three columns of bandits have been transferred to support the east and north. As for the main part of the Sixth Column of Chen Yi's bandit troops south of the Feishui River basin, it has been defeated into scattered remnants by us. Although Liu's bandits transferred troops to reinforce, it was impossible to remedy the situation, and we are still continuing the mopping-up operation.

Our main force advancing north from Bengbu is eliminating the obstruction of the bandits in front, advancing step by step. The battle is currently taking place in the area north-northwest of Xinqiao, Caolaoji, and the Heji Baojiaji area (all west of Xinqiao Station).

(2) North China Theater

The treacherous bandits in North China have recently been plotting and stirring up trouble again. Since eight columns of bandits reinforced from outside the pass have entered the pass, Nie Rongzhen, in order to contain our forces and cover Lin Biao's safe concentration, specially led his First, Second, and Sixth Columns, and Li Yunchang's Eighth Column, together with the bandit military region's troops Zhan Danan's New Seventh and New Eighth Independent Divisions, totaling about 40,000 bandits, attempting to sneak attack our Zhangyuan and cut off the traffic on the eastern section of the PingSui Railway. Our forces had already detected their treachery in advance, and immediately coordinated with the people's armed forces to inflict heavy blows on the bandits in areas such as Chaigoubao and Taipingzhai and Dashizhuang southwest of Zhangyuan. The fierce battle started on the evening of the 2nd and continued until the 5th. Our forces, with high morale and proper application of strategy, achieved a great victory. The bandits suffered a total of more than 70,000 casualties. We captured a total of more than 2,170 bandit soldiers, more than 500 rifles, more than 20 machine guns, and more than 700 war horses, as well as many other baggage documents. Although a part of Lin Biao's bandit troops has arrived in eastern Hebei and the vicinity of the various passes of the Great Wall, they dare not act rashly due to Nie's recent disastrous defeat and fear of the unity and strong strength of our army and people. Our forces are searching for the remaining bandits in the north, south, east, and west areas of Tianjin and Beijing, and are waiting in strict formation. Due to the victory of our army in the outer areas of Zhangyuan, the situation in North China has become more stable recently.

### UN Political Committee Passes Three-Nation Proposal: Recognizes the Legality of the South Korean Government, Establishes a New Korean Commission to Continue its Mission, and Withdraws Occupation Forces as Soon as Possible Within a Feasible Range

[United Press, Paris, 8th] The UN Political Committee, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet bloc, passed a joint proposal by the United States, China, and Australia tonight with a vote of 41 to 6, with 2 abstentions, recognizing the South Korean government as the only legal government in Korea, and stipulating the establishment of a new Korean Commission, with the original nine countries of China, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, India, and Ukraine re-elected as members. The committee has the right to travel throughout Korea and supervise the withdrawal of the US and Soviet occupation forces "as early as practicable." The proposal will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval. Even after the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky warned that he did not want to take office, Ukraine was still elected as a member of the committee. After passing this resolution, the Political Committee rejected the Soviet Union's hostile proposal to abolish the old Korean Commission with a vote of 40 to 6 and 3 abstentions. In addition to abolishing the old Korean Commission, the Soviet proposal also condemned the commission for dividing Korea and endorsing the South Korean elections held "under police oppression and suppression." Today's two resolutions have completed the work of the Political Committee in this session of the General Assembly. When the Political Committee began its afternoon meeting to hear the condemnations of the United States' actions in Korea by Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Yugoslavia, there were fewer than twelve countries present. The majority of countries under the leadership of the United States allowed the Soviet bloc to condemn without answering, so that they could vote quickly. During the morning meeting, when Soviet representative Malik accused US representative Dulles of being a liar, the two were only a few seats apart. When Dulles heard Malik's accusation, he took off his headphones and glared at Malik for the rest of his speech.

[United Press, Seoul, 9th] The news that the United Nations recognized the Republic of Korea was met with great rejoicing in this country, and nationwide parades and celebrations have been scheduled.

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 9th] South Korean President Syngman Rhee declared today that the United Nations' recognition of the South Korean government as the national government of Korea will have a major spiritual impact on the people of North and South Korea. South Korean Foreign Minister Chang Taek-sang stated that the United Nations Korean Commission should be aware that there is still an iron curtain dividing Korea into north and south, and for this reason, South Korea must actively defend itself, prepare to be protected by US forces, and receive the spiritual support of the United Nations. A military spokesman said that South Korea hopes to train 100,000 troops by next summer. The current 50,000 are considered insufficient to defend against the Communists should they invade from the north.

### Major Revision of British-American Plan to Mediate the Arab-Israeli Dispute to Facilitate Passage in the General Assembly

[United Press, Paris, 9th] Western countries reluctantly cut important parts of their Palestinian mediation plan on the 9th, striving to have the plan passed by the General Assembly before it closes on Saturday. Official sources revealed that small Western countries, led by Canada and Australia, have drafted a number of extensive amendments to revise the British-American plan. Britain and the United States knew that the original plan had no possibility of passing the General Assembly, so both countries had agreed to revise it in advance. The General Assembly will begin its final debate on the evening of the 9th or the 10th. The General Assembly now has two paths to follow: one is to approve the greatly reduced British-American proposal; the other is to stand by and watch Palestine be in a state of war without assistance. The reason why Britain and the United States are willing to revise the original plan this time is nothing more than to urge the Arab side not to oppose the mediation plan and to weaken the status of pro-Arab countries. The Arab bloc had threatened that if the Security Council approved Israel's accession, they would fight to the end and would never support the revised mediation plan. Some people intend to propose postponing the vote on Israel's membership. France and Canada are also not very willing to vote to allow Israel to participate, which has a pivotal influence on the Security Council's vote. Western representatives are still discussing how and where to revise the British-American plan, but it is known that the revisions currently under consideration include the following: (1) The proposal will absolutely not mention last year's United Nations Partition Plan, or the Bernadotte Plan that subsequently revised the Partition Plan. (2) All instances of the words "State of Israel" in the proposal will be deleted. (3) The original plan stipulated that the five powers had the right to select three countries to organize the mediation committee. Now it has been decided to cancel this and let the General Assembly elect the three-country committee itself.

### International Declaration of Human Rights to be Submitted to General Assembly for Discussion

Social Committee Rejects Zhu Group's Motion

[United Press, Paris, 9th] The Soviet bloc today demanded in the UN Social Committee that the General Assembly postpone the discussion of the Declaration of Human Rights, claiming that this kind of declaration is unsatisfactory, hinders sovereignty, and cannot condemn fascism.

### Security Council to Reconsider Membership Applications of Portugal, Italy, etc.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] The General Assembly overcame Soviet opposition on the evening of the 8th and passed an African proposal asking the Security Council to reconsider the membership applications of seven countries, including Portugal, Italy, Austria, Finland, Transjordan, Ireland, and Ceylon.

However, the rejection of Ceylon's membership application was based on technical reasons. According to current indications, Ceylon may be approved for membership when its membership application is reconsidered.

### Sabotaging Nationalization of Japanese Coal Mines Bribe Case: Shigeru Yoshida Suspected of Involvement; Kijuro Shidehara, Takeo Inukai, and Hitoshi Tanaka Implicated

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida is now also suspected of involvement in a bribery case, the extent of which is comparable to the Showa Denko bribery case that recently led to the arrest of Hitoshi Ashida. It is said that this bribery case involves many members of parliament and political figures who are said to have received bribes from coal mine operators to obstruct the passage of the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill. Japanese political figures, who are feeling nervous due to the government's comprehensive purge of the House of Representatives, are now known as the "panic group." The size of this group is beyond general expectations. Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Man'itsu Tanaka, may be arrested because he is also involved in the Coal Mine Bill bribery case. It is rumored that Shigeru Yoshida's son-in-law, Taekichi Aso (a public figure in Kyushu coal mines), handed over a large sum of money to Tanaka and Kijuro Shidehara, a former prime minister who served as an advisor to the Yoshida Democratic Liberal Party, through his father-in-law, to obstruct the passage of the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill. In addition, Takeo Inukai is also suspected. He was originally the most promising candidate for the president of the Democratic Party after Ashida's arrest.

Foreign Minister Stikker and Overseas Territories Minister Sassen returned to the country from Batavia last night, and are said to still intend to recommend to the government that a provisional government of the Indonesian Federation be established within a month, stipulating that the Republic of Indonesia can join later. However, there are also those outside the Republic of Indonesia who oppose the establishment of a provisional government before next year, so the situation is quite complicated. Well-informed sources said that the cabinet will not make a decision until the parliamentary investigators return from Indonesia.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett denied at a press conference on the 8th that the current Dutch-Indonesian negotiations and Indonesian issue have "broken down" due to Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker's return to The Hague from Java.

Stikker went to Java two weeks ago to inspect the situation there.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Five students from the US Art School, including Lu Lingyun, Lu Hanhua, Chen Liping, Wu Shuzhi, and Liu Ming, were accused of participating in the "Anti-American Support for Japan Movement."

### Tea Market Improves

Yesterday, sales of western-style tea and export boxed tea remained sluggish, but tea merchants, seeing that foreign exchange transfer certificates were reaching new highs, gradually reaching parity with foreign tea prices, and because the authorities had decided to restore export loans to assist exports, were gradually becoming more optimistic and adopting a more determined attitude.

### Cotton Cloth Supply is Fierce

Cloth merchants were all eager to sell goods for cash, and northern merchants were also constantly selling. Prices for all cloths opened flat, but due to the fierce supply, the market tended to decline. By noon, prices began to rise, but due to stagnant sales, the market still closed weak.

[Our Dispatch] The American Aid Cotton Committee held a regular meeting yesterday at 4 PM. Regarding the request from the American Aid cotton spinning mills to increase the exchange ratio to 708 pounds for exchanging one bale of 20-count yarn, the committee carefully studied the seven calculation methods provided by the members of the technical task force. Ultimately, due to the complexity of the issue, no final conclusion was reached. It was decided that the technical task force would conduct further research before further discussion and decision-making.

### Dull Silk Market; Further Decline in Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's artificial silk market was weak with consolidation. There were few transactions on the market, with both supply and demand clearing. Most retail investors were engaged in arbitrage trading. The silk weaving industry suffered dismal demand, and sentiment showed no improvement. No. 120 silk opened at 9,500 yuan at Guangtian Bridge in the morning and was sold off. Trading was slow in the middle of the day, and the market was dull. The asking price declined slightly by 200-300 yuan, hovering around 9,200 yuan. No improvement was seen until noon. Later, the market improved slightly due to some support from Hangzhou dealers. The opening price of Dongyang Jin San Ma and other brands was also quite weak, following the same trend. The market turned firm near noon, and the asking price rebounded. There were not many transactions overall, and the price range was also small.

The export price of raw silk showed no significant gains or losses. Foreign merchants' demand turned weak, and sentiment did not become optimistic. Yesterday's transactions were also rare. The domestic sales price slightly increased yesterday due to sluggish demand in recent days. The D-grade 78 evenness opened at 13,000 yuan, up 500 yuan. Superior grade raw silk and mixed lots of ordinary filature and spun silk all increased by 300-500 yuan.

Yesterday, the silk fabric market saw increased selling and turnover. External yarn prices fell slightly, sentiment was weak, and the market opened weak, declining all the way. Beimao opened at 7,900 yuan and 8,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. Subsequently, prices hovered between 7,400 and 7,500 yuan. Finally, the Hakka dealers sold off their positions, with frequent short-selling pressure. The market was full of closing-out sounds, and the asking price continued to decline by 200-300 yuan. By the close, trading had become a tail-end phenomenon. The market price ended without a clear resolution. Huaqiang closed at 7,300 yuan, Meiya closed at 7,400 yuan, and Dawei Ni fell to 35 yuan. There were few other transactions.

### Uneven Cotton Yarn Market

Cotton yarn saw mixed performance. The market continued its weakness at the open. Later, Guangdong dealers saw relatively smooth demand, and the process revolved around firm grades. Near noon, due to the abundance of short positions, there was pressure to sell at high prices, and the market rebounded slightly at the close. As a result, only some grades saw improvement. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 12,000 yuan to close at 12,500 yuan, a gain of 500 yuan. The performance of other brands like Bao Guang and Jincheng Tiannv varied. 40-count Jincheng remained at its original level, while 32-count Blue Phoenix and Silver Moon showed slight gains. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 9,400 yuan, then, under the support of retail investors, the price rose to the 10,000 yuan mark. The market fell back to 9,800 yuan at the close, resulting in an improvement of 200 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Double Horse and Jincheng Tiannv also rose slightly by 100-300 yuan.

### China Trust Purchases Frozen Eggs: Fourth Batch Paid Today

Totaling 500 tons

After the China Trust Bureau was ordered to resume purchasing frozen eggs for export to the UK, it has been successively collecting them. It has now purchased the fourth batch, the first batch being 200 tons. The remaining batches, two, three, and four, are each 100 tons, totaling 500 tons. The four batches are being paid for today, with a purchase price of 40,000 yuan per ton. Based on the international market price of 210 pounds per ton, there is still a loss of 4,000-5,000 yuan.

### Active Tung Oil Market

The tung oil market progressed rapidly yesterday. First-grade white oil jumped to 640 yuan per dan, and authentic Xihong also reached 580 yuan. The rest all showed a trend of rising prices. The reason is that due to the current turbulent situation, the supply of goods has decreased, while export merchants have seen a surge in foreign exchange transfer certificates in recent days. Also, because favorable export news has been frequently reported, the intention to be active has gradually revived, so the process shows signs of supply and demand imbalance.

### Affected by the Current Situation, Export Industry Shows No Improvement

[Our Dispatch] Due to the recent situation, the export industry has also shown no improvement. Although the market for foreign exchange transfer certificates has trended upward, there is little hope for an increase in exports. Taking this city as an example, most of the larger export companies have already ceased operations.

Due to the reduction in demand for export materials, the market is stable, and the price is not proportional to the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Since its issuance, the market price of the latter has risen by 80% to 90%, but the price of export materials has remained the same, and tung oil and sausage casings have declined instead. Moreover, foreign importers are also refusing to accept futures due to the situation in our country, so the export industry also lacks development abroad.

### Mr. Chen Bu Lei's Voice and Countenance

— Xi Xia

Mr. Chen Bu Lei, a national policy advisor to the Presidential Office, dedicated himself to state affairs with utmost diligence, ultimately sacrificing his life. All scholars in the country who have read his writings and know his name, whether acquainted or not, deeply mourn him. Mr. Chen was meticulous in his conduct and comprehensive in his thinking. Reading his last testament, his arrangements were calm and unhurried, and his mind was clear. Even in the most trivial matters, he did not want to burden those left behind. From this, one can imagine his integrity and purity in self-preservation, and his righteousness and intensity in facing death. Ouyang Yongshu once said: "Since ancient times, all deaths return to nothing, only the saints and sages, though buried, are not extinguished." The spirit of Mr. Chen's death will probably never fade away. On the day of Mr. Chen's funeral in Hangzhou, I will record my observations and recollections from the times when I personally heard his voice and saw his countenance, paying tribute to his example. Now, we are separated by life and death. I am saddened by my thoughts, but lamenting is of no use!

Drafting Famous Documents; Showing His Talent

In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was convened in Nanjing. At that time, the purge was more than half a year old, and the Northern Expeditionary Army had settled Hebei. With the cooperation between Ning and Han, a new atmosphere emerged. The famous closing declaration was written by Mr. Chen. The text was more than 4,000 words long and provided a comprehensive review of the party's program, party principles, domestic and foreign policies. The analysis was clear and it was a brilliant text for uniting comrades after the Northern Expedition. During the conference, Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, and Ding Dingcheng were originally recommended to draft it. Mr. Chen was traveling in Beijing as the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao (Times News). Dai, being a colleague at Tianshi Bao, invited him to rest at Tao Lu in Tangshan and discuss the draft. The draft was completed the next day, and Dai urgently took it to the city to hand it over to Mr. Yu. After reading it, Yu praised it repeatedly, without adding or subtracting a single word. It was then read aloud at the closing ceremony, and the entire audience was amazed. Afterwards, Yu playfully said to Dai and Chen: "I have a twelve-character comment on this article." Dai and Chen hurriedly asked. Yu said: "Not new, not old, half new, half old, new and old again." Then, they clapped their hands and laughed together. This was the beginning of Mr. Chen's writing of important documents within the party, and it was also the beginning of his literary reputation within the party. From then on, every plenary session declaration was entrusted to Mr. Chen to draft.

Calling Himself Weak; Gentle in Nature

Mr. Chen was short in stature, physically weak, gentle in nature, and rarely argued with others. When encountering frustrating things, he would retreat and call himself "weak," "a scholar," and "useless." Among his six sons, the fifth son, Sui, was the thinnest and weakest. He was often ill in elementary school and was often bullied by his classmates. Mr. Chen would stroke his head and comfort him, saying: "You are also weak, just like your father? Poor child!" His words contained boundless love.

The Wobbly Carrying Pole Never Breaks

Mr. Chen was weak and often ill. At first, he only suffered from mild insomnia, but due to long-term labor, lack of rest and adjustment, since the 20th year of the Republic of China, he had reached the point where he could not fall asleep without taking sleeping pills. Fortunately, his wife, Ms. Wang Yunmo, took great care of him, and he was still able to live with his illness, fulfilling his official duties until the end of his life, only one year short of his sixtieth birthday. I still remember that in May and June of the 27th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chen lived in the attendant's room in Wuchang Yanzhi Ping. Japanese planes bombed Xujiapeng Railway Station, Luojia Mountain Airport, Hu Lin Yi Road, and other places, and he felt the shock every time. I went to visit him and asked if he was frightened. Mr. Chen said: "At the beginning of the Japanese bombing of Nanjing, I did feel threatened in spirit, but now I am used to it and no longer pay attention to it." He also said: "I am forty-nine years old this year, and I have already exceeded my father's lifespan. Even if I die, I will have no regrets." I said: "There is a local proverb in my hometown, 'The wobbly carrying pole never breaks.' Mr. Chen is close to that." Mr. Chen smiled.

A Good Story of Family Learning: Chen, Zhang, Cheng

There are many talented writers in the press, and speaking of those who have benefited from their elder brothers, Mr. Chen Bu Lei is quite similar to Zhang Dongsun. Zhang's elder brother, Meng Qu, was a renowned scholar in Wuzhong, and Dai Jitao once followed him. Mr. Chen's elder brother was the elder Chen Qihuai of Yingning, who was the chief editor of Tian Duo Bao in the past. Speaking of those who have benefited from their maternal uncles, Mr. Chen is also similar to Cheng Cangbo. Cheng's father-in-law, Qian Mingshan (Zhen Huang), was a famous scholar in Wujin. Mr. Chen's father-in-law, Yang Xunzhai (Min Zeng), was also a literary giant in eastern Zhejiang. The foundations of Chen, Zhang, and Cheng in Chinese studies are rooted in such sources, which is also a good story.

Heart Cold and Stomach Pain; Talking About the Xi'an Incident

When the Xi'an Incident occurred on December 12, 1936, Mr. Chen was in charge of the handover of affairs as the deputy secretary-general of the Central Political Committee. He arrived in Beijing from Luoyang three days earlier, so he did not go west with Chairman Chiang. However, he discussed the matters of conquest and rescue, and he was extremely nervous and could not sleep at night. Therefore, he was particularly hard-working. On the 14th, I was summoned to Beijing to assist with daily correspondence and miscellaneous affairs. On December 25, Chairman Chiang was rescued and returned to Beijing. On the 28th, Zhang Hanqing was tried. Chairman Chiang took a half-day break at Chen's residence at No. 23 Yihe Road. On the 31st, Shao Yuanchong's coffin passed through the river, and all the attendants returned. I returned to Shanghai on New Year's Day. Before leaving, Mr. Chen said to me: "The ancients often used the words 'cold heart' and 'stomach pain.' Although I knew the meaning in the past, I never really experienced it until I was in the real situation. Now, after the Xi'an Incident, I realized how true and accurate the ancients used words." As he spoke, he touched his heart and abdomen with his hand, saying: "The so-called cold heart, this little square inch of land truly has a cold feeling; the so-called stomach pain, the entire abdominal cavity is cramping. This is truly the case, not just empty words." I said yes and retreated, knowing that Mr. Chen's illness was deep. Fortunately, he got rid of all desires and faced everything with optimism, so he was able to live another twelve years, otherwise he would have left this world early.
