### President Truman's Message to Congress Officially Proposes Aid to China Plan Amounting to $570 Million

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman today presented a special message to Congress, recommending a plan to aid China with $570 million. The full text is as follows:

I have repeatedly stated that the establishment of a just and lasting peaceful environment worldwide is one of the primary goals of the United States. This is a principle to which the American people are dedicated.

Since the surrender of Japan, we have made tremendous efforts and provided substantial financial aid to revive the war-torn nations, restoring them to the effective economic systems needed to maintain peace. The principle guiding our aid to the war-torn nations is to help their people help themselves.

To promote this objective, Congress is now carefully considering one of the most important and far-reaching proposals, namely the European Recovery Program.

I now request Congress to consider the assistance that our country should continue to provide to China.

The American and Chinese people have had many years of sincere friendship. There are also long-standing commercial and cultural ties and close cooperation between the two countries. The American people have always admired the Chinese people and deeply sympathize with the various trials and difficulties they have encountered.

The United States has long recognized that the stability of China is crucial to lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. China, due to its large land and population, has become an important factor in international relations. China has excellent traditions and culture, as well as a large and energetic population. We sincerely hope that China will be strong and progressive, making a full contribution to the strengthening of international forces.

Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government of China twenty years ago, we have continuously supported it. The United States and China were allies in the war against Japan, and we supported China's heroic resistance against Japan from an allied standpoint. Since Japan's surrender, we have provided a great deal of assistance. All military aid given to the Chinese government was not only to help it defeat Japanese aggression but also to help it recover Japanese-occupied territories. The United States provided the majority of the substantial assistance that China received from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. We have also transferred a large amount of surplus materials and equipment of economic value to China at the lowest prices. We are currently continuing to assist China in accordance with the foreign relief program.

### Communist Troops Damage Transportation Further Deepening China's Losses

However, the Chinese government and people are currently suffering from the dual oppression of civil war and rapid economic decline. The difficult situation caused by Japanese occupation and blockade during the eight years of war occurred precisely when construction needed to be undertaken and was further aggravated by internal strife. The continued obstruction and destruction of major transportation routes by communist troops has further deepened the losses already suffered by transportation and production facilities during the war.

The government's increased expenditures due to the civil war far exceed its revenue, further hindering reconstruction efforts. The continuous issuance of currency to cover expenditures has created runaway inflation, disrupting normal commercial activities. In this situation, China's foreign exchange reserves are rapidly decreasing to the point where they are insufficient to pay for essential imports. Without such imports, industrial activity will shrink, and economic decline will worsen.

The United States is deeply concerned about the continued economic decline of China. Since General Marshall's departure from China, the issue of aid to China has been continuously considered. We hope that the environment in China will allow American aid to be used in an effective and constructive manner for construction and reconstruction. The environment we had hoped for has not yet formed, so we can only deal with the situation as best we can under the current circumstances.

We may be able to help alleviate the current economic decline, so that the Chinese government will have another opportunity to begin taking the necessary steps to establish a more stable economic environment. But circumstances have long proven that only the Chinese government itself can take the necessary steps to create an appropriate environment so that efforts for peace and genuine economic recovery can take effect.

To determine the nature and scope of a plan that might be suitable for this purpose, we should pay attention to various different and conflicting factors, including other burdens on our current resources, the availability of certain goods, the scope and complexity of the various problems encountered by the Chinese government, and the extent to which these problems can be resolved with foreign aid. American aid to China, like aid to any other country, must be tailored to its specific needs and capacities.

### Aid to China Plan Should Stipulate Loan or Grant Method Amount Estimated May Be Revised According to Prices

Based on these factors, I recommend that Congress approve $570 million for an aid to China plan before June 30, 1949.

This plan should stipulate that $510 million be used as funds to pay for the transport of essential imports to China, either as a loan or a grant. This is based on an estimate of prices as of January 1, 1948, as it is currently impossible to predict how price changes will affect this plan. If necessary, revised amount estimates can be submitted when requesting appropriations. The so-called essential imports include food, cotton, oil, fertilizer, tobacco, medicine, coal, and spare parts for existing important equipment. The quantity stipulated in this plan is coordinated with the available supplies. By having the United States pay for these essential imports, the Chinese government can use its limited US dollars to meet the most urgent of its other needs.

The plan should also set aside $60 million for several selected construction projects to be commenced before June 30, 1949, to restore essential transportation, fuel, and power industries, as well as export industries, which are urgently needed. This work can be carried out in areas free from military action and can help improve the supply and distribution of essential goods.

### To Implement Aid Plan China and the US Should Sign an Agreement

As with the aid for European recovery, the implementation of this aid plan should be governed by an agreement signed by China and the United States, stipulating the conditions and procedures for carrying out this aid. The agreement should include certain guarantees that the Chinese government will take practical economic, financial, and other measures to achieve the goals of economic stability and recovery. If the United States determines that the aid provided is not being handled in accordance with the agreement, or determines that the Chinese government's policies are inconsistent with the purpose of using the aid to help achieve economic self-sufficiency, then the United States should reserve the right to suspend aid.

Before the establishment of the agency for handling the European Recovery Program, aid to China should be implemented by the current agency handling the foreign relief program. Legislation approving aid to China should transfer the handling of the aid plan to the agency handling our aid to the European Recovery Program. The handling agency needs the power to adjust the plan at any time, just as it needs the power to adjust the European Recovery Program at any time.

### Give China a Breathing Space Amid Economic Decline

I believe that the proposed aid to China plan is the best approach that the national government can take in light of all circumstances. No matter what our country gives through aid, it can never replace the necessary actions that only the Chinese government can take. However, this plan can still accomplish an important purpose, which is to give the Chinese government a breathing space amidst economic decline, so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation. Without this breathing space, it is doubtful whether the Chinese government can establish such stability. The realization of this limited objective is of such great significance as to justify the proposed aid plan.

Therefore, I recommend that this plan be given favorable consideration by Congress as soon as possible.

### The US is Discussing Aid to China Our Country Should Not Comment

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After reading President Truman's address to Congress regarding China on the night of the 18th, government officials announced through Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang: "As the American aid to China bill is still being discussed in Congress, the Chinese government believes it is inappropriate to comment."

### Our Repayment of US Loans

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Chinese Embassy announced today that China has repaid the Export-Import Bank of the United States a 1941 loan of $13,698,000. China has also fulfilled wartime contracts by paying the China Development Finance Corporation with metals worth $3,650,000. The proceeds from the sale will also be paid to the Export-Import Bank. With this repayment completed, the total amount of the 1941 loan of $50 million has been fully repaid. This action demonstrates that the Chinese government, despite its own lack of foreign exchange, is still striving to maintain its credit.

### US Newspaper's Use of "[Reactionary]" Director Dong Corrects It

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Director Dong Xian Guang stated at a press conference on the 18th: Recently, American newspapers, when commenting on China, often use the term "reactionary" to refer to the Chinese government. I do not wish to delve deeply into the meaning of the term "reactionary," but I feel that this term has been overused and should be pointed out to correct the situation.

### Feng Qin Zai Goes to Ping from Zhang

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The newly appointed Parallel Lineage Director Feng Qin Zai arrived in Ping by car from Zhang Xiang at noon on the 18th. After arriving in Ping, Feng will take office as Deputy Director of the Parallel Lineage with ____.

### External Affairs Director Issues Statement South Korea Should Have Free Elections Any Government Built in Violation of the Agreement Will Not Be Considered by Us

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Shi Zhao Ying, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau on the 18th in response to inquiries: The exact situation in North Korea still needs to be clarified. The Chinese government will naturally not consider any government established in Korea in violation of the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the procedures stipulated in the Moscow Agreement. The Chinese government also cannot understand either of the occupying powers being able to ignore the authority of the Moscow Agreement and the United Nations General Assembly and build a government in Korea on its own. The United Nations, in view of the failure of the two occupying countries to cooperate in implementing the provisions of the Moscow Agreement, accepted in the resolutions of the General Assembly the responsibility of assisting the Korean people in realizing their national independence. The acceptance of this responsibility has a solemn and serious meaning, because it is not only related to the happiness of the 20 million Korean people, but also to the safety of the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese government will firmly advocate that the United Nations Korean Commission conduct free elections in any area where elections can be held, to create a government that truly represents the Korean people.

### Anshan National Army Firmly Defends the Urban Area Situation Improves as Shenyang West is Flanked by Land and Air Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Ma Zhanshan Scheduled to Fly to Beijing on the 22nd

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] The battle for Anshan is becoming increasingly fierce. The invading bandits have been concentrating their superior forces and more than 20 artillery pieces to bombard and seize surrounding strongholds. The defending troops held out for several days, and only on the night of the 17th did they make a strategic shift, fully protecting the urban area. Although artillery fire raged in the city, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant workers and citizens, trusting in the bravery of the defending troops, and the air force, which continued to fly back and forth to assist in the battle on the 18th, were quite confident. Anshan was filled with smoke and bullets, becoming a sea of fire. A unit of more than 1,000 men from the 2nd Column of bandits in southern Shenyang fled west from the Sujiatun area, reaching the Erhezi area, ten kilometers west of Shenyang, in the afternoon of the 18th. The National Army repelled them with fierce artillery fire, and the bandits fled in a hurry. The bandits in Masanjia, Laobian, Shalingpu and other places in western Shenyang were largely annihilated by the joint land and air attack of the National Army, and the rest fled. The area has been completely cleared, and the situation is greatly improved.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and others are scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 22nd. Zhang was originally scheduled to go south on the 19th, and the plane ticket had been arranged by the Tianjin Municipal Government. After arriving in Ping, Wan, Ma, and others invited him to go together, so the trip was postponed. On the evening of the 17th, the three men and fellow villagers from Northeast China had a meeting. Li Zongren hosted a banquet for Zhang, Wan, and Ma at noon on the 18th. This morning, Zhang met with reporters again at his residence in Ping and spoke very cautiously. In response to reporters' questions, he said that he had no opinions on the Northeast issue and that everything would have to wait for the central government to decide. After he arrived in Ping, the fellow villagers from the Northeast had not yet held a formal meeting. In his observation, the situation in northern China was not serious and there was no danger. ____ was mistakenly thought to be Zhang Zuolin's younger brother, but he was actually from Yixian County and was not only not closely related to Zhang Zuolin but was not even from the same hometown. When talking about Zhang Xueshi, he said, "I heard that he is running a school in Jiamusi."

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The work of expanding the area in the Jichang area is being actively promoted. More than 10,000 farmers' anti-bandit armed groups gathered around Changchun have completed their inspections. The garrison troops recently notified the foreign county chiefs to lead their security teams to move into the county territory, waiting for the recovery of local counties and towns.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Liu Zhe, a person from the Northeast living in Beijing, had a meeting with reporters on the 18th regarding the Northeast issue that they were concerned about. According to reports, they had previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang, suggesting four items: (A) immediately send a large army to the pass to reinforce; (B) re-use veterans from the Northeast to organize and train the people; (C) use local arsenals to manufacture ammunition for application; (D) stipulate measures for rewards and punishments for people who defend cities and attack places, such as making the people who defend the city the county magistrate of that county, etc. Now that Zhang Zuoxiang is reportedly coming to Beijing soon, Beijing is also paying close attention to this. After Zhang and others arrive in Beijing, they will hold a meeting with people from the Northeast living in Beijing to discuss the Northeast issue and pay a visit to Chairman Chiang for instructions.

### On the Issue of Military Aid to China Kirk Will Offer Opinions

[United Press, Qingdao, 17th] At General Kirk's farewell press conference, when asked "Whether the United States will give military aid to China" and "Whether it will be able to overcome difficulties without American military aid," Kirk replied: "I have lived in China for 25 months and of course have opinions on this issue, but I can only offer this to the Washington Naval Commander." When Kirk praised Chairman Chiang as a strong and good leader, he was asked, "Is Chiang an ideal leader to lead China through difficulties?" Kirk said: You should ask, who else is there besides him? The real question is, is there anyone else who can take on his current leadership position?

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 18th] Admiral Ramsen, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to fly to Qingdao on the 24th. The purpose of this trip is to inspect various units of the Pacific Fleet. Those traveling with him include Lieutenant General Schneider, Commander of the US Navy Pacific Fleet Air Force, and many staff members. Ramsen and his party will have a five-day stay in China. After inspecting Qingdao, they will visit Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, Lieutenant General Badger, the newly appointed Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, will fly to Qingdao on the 19th and will take office on the USS Estes on the morning of the 24th. General Kirk is scheduled to return to the United States on the USS Whiteside on the 25th.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] Rear Admiral Malo, Commander of the US 38th Special Combined Fleet, arrived here at 8:00 AM on the 18th.

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 18th] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, revealed on the 18th that a US warship is currently docked near Haiyang, east of the Shandong coast, waiting for personnel from the Chinese Communists to make contact in order to negotiate the release of the four US Marines captured by the Chinese Communists.

### New Life Movement 14th Anniversary Commemoration Chairman Chiang Sends Telegram to Encourage the Nation Raising Three Meanings to Encourage Comrades to Go All Out

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] On the eve of the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to the nation. The original text is as follows:

To the New Life Movement Promotion General Association's provincial and municipal branches and all compatriots across the country: The New Life Movement has been guided to this day for fourteen years. Its purpose is to hone the inherent instincts of self-awareness and self-government of each of our citizens, and to fulfill their patriotic and national salvation duties. Its method of implementation is to extend oneself to others, from the near to the distant, starting with the neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and punctuality of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, so that daily life follows the guidelines of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Everyone should be a self-reliant, self-improving, responsible, and disciplined citizen, so that our China can join the ranks of modern international society as a unified, independent, democratic, and rule-of-law nation. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our compatriots throughout the country risked dangers, endured hardships, and ultimately defeated the powerful, achieving victory. This relies on the perseverance of our long-standing national spirit and demonstrates the generosity of our national morality, and the New Life Movement has also demonstrated its effectiveness in this regard. Now that the War of Resistance has been won for more than two years, the period of political tutelage has come to an end, and the Constitution has begun to be implemented. I hope that all our compatriots will develop the spirit of democracy and self-government and consistently follow the legal path, so that the Constitution is deeply rooted in the daily lives of the people, and then democratic politics can be improved. The pragmatic implementation and widespread promotion of the New Life Movement is even more important. I would like to tell my compatriots across the country with three meanings.

Firm Self-Confidence

The current concerns of the country and nation lie solely in the rebellion of the Communists, and the most important task of suppressing the Communists is to eliminate the political conspiracies of the Communists. The most dangerous conspiracy of the Communists is to use fierce and evil struggles to create endless hatred among compatriots of all levels, so that reason is lost, morality is destroyed, the foundation of culture is destroyed, and the spirit of the nation disappears, in order to achieve their great desire to divide the territory, destroy sovereignty, and seek glory for the country. All our compatriots must fully understand that today's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos is actually the key to the nation's survival, honor, and disgrace. It is also the final decisive battle between democratic constitutionalism and violent mobocracy. Everyone must promote their pure reason and firm their national self-confidence, fighting for national salvation and mobilizing for bandit suppression. Only sincerity can overcome deceit, and only justice can defeat tyranny. Throughout history, shameless traitors, rogue bandits, although cunning and deceitful, and committing all kinds of evil deeds, have not failed to be destroyed by our nation's morality and the spirit of the country. The presence of good and evil is the basis for judging victory or defeat. Everyone works together to achieve success. This is the first.

Raise Awareness

Warfare and constitutionalism are two sides of the same nation-building effort. Pacifying the chaos is to remove the obstacles to constitutionalism, and constitutionalism is to establish the framework for democracy. All our soldiers and civilians must be united in front to save the suffering compatriots, and be responsible for maintaining social order in the rear. Today, the Communists destroy the law and disrupt order in the villages they control, clearing out their dissidents through cruel struggles, so that the people have no choice but to be forced to participate in the war. In the cities in our rear, they lay in ambush spies and organize their so-called city work departments, attempting to disrupt the security of various places. Therefore, any collective action in schools and factories is prone to deterioration and become the baseline for conspiracy and riots. All patriotic compatriots should raise awareness, encourage each other, abide by discipline, and take responsibility, so as to limit the activities of the Communists and protect public safety. This is the second.

Diligence, Thrift, and Economy

The Father of the Nation said: "Spirit is better than matter, and revolution must first revolutionize the heart." Today's economic problems are more manipulated by humans than they are by natural factors, and psychological panic is more than objective facts. I hope that our compatriots will understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, discern gains and losses, and examine public and private matters. They should use diligence to increase production, use frugality to save waste of materials, do not speculate to fuel the mischief of floating capital, do not hoard to stimulate the soaring of prices, guide businesses to normal tracks, and control profits to reasonable limits, so that the nation's economic and social policies can be thoroughly implemented. Then the economic crisis will be overcome, and the foundation for suppressing chaos and building the nation will also be laid. This is the third.

In short, the country today has moved into the constitutional era, and survival, honor, and disgrace depend on the degree of national self-awareness and the ability to self-govern. All our compatriots must have firm confidence, maintain a well-ordered life, recognize righteousness and benefit, distinguish right from wrong, cultivate the people's love of things, and take on the responsibility of saving the country and building the nation. It is deeply believed that national unification, the success of constitutionalism, the elimination of armed rebellion, and the overcoming of the economic crisis all depend on this. I hope that my compatriots will encourage each other and strive diligently and bravely to achieve it. February 18, 37th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek.

The New Life Movement Promotion Association Reports on Last Year's Work

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The 19th is the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement. Huang Renlin, Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, and Xu Guanyu, Deputy Secretary-General, held a press conference at noon on the 18th to report on the implementation of last year's work and the various activities for the week of the anniversary celebration: The anniversary celebration on the 19th will include city-wide cleaning regulations inspections and group weddings in Nanjing.

Every evening, static films promoting constitutionalism will be screened in various districts, and evening parties will be held. The work of this year has been affected by the disruption of order in various places by the Communists, such as the three cases that occurred continuously in Shanghai, which are nothing less than a challenge to the New Life Movement. The association is determined to muster the greatest courage to accept the challenge, strive for social stability, and continue to assist in promoting the five constructions. Huang also introduced the steel wire recording machine, energy-saving pot, and mobile slogan stand that he brought back from the United States. Finally, he invited reporters to join in a meal made with an energy-saving pot in half an hour, and they dispersed in joy.

### Pinghan Southern Section Recovers Luohe The Communists in Central Hubei Fall Anlu

### French Troops Attack Yunnan Border, We Have Lodged a Protest

Retaining the Right to Compensation for Losses

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since July of the 35th year (1946), French military aircraft have twice intruded into Guangxi's Pingxiang border, once flying over the mountain pass, once circling over Nanguan, once flying into Jingxi, three times intruding into Hekou, and once strafing at Shuikou. After receiving reports, the Ministry has repeatedly protested to the French side, requesting that the French-Vietnamese authorities stop it. The French side replied: the airspace where French aircraft entered was adjacent to the borders of Vietnam-Yunnan or Vietnam-Guangxi, and French flight personnel made slight oversights, resulting in crossing the border. The French side expressed deep regret for this and ordered French military aircraft to pay close attention and not intrude into our country's airspace again. As for the report that French aircraft recently dropped bombs on the Guangxi border, the Ministry, based on Song's report, has telegraphed the special commissioners stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi to investigate the truth and report.

### Grain Rationing Set to Begin Next Month, Contingent Upon Adequate Preparation, Zoned Discussions Held at Distribution Meeting Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Five Cities Grain Rationing Conference continued its zoned discussions on the 18th. The Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) zone was discussed in the morning and the Jin-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) zone in the afternoon, both personally presided over by Yu Feipeng. In the meeting, each unit first reported on the actual situation in various places based on the implementation rules passed yesterday. The issue of grain sources was also repeatedly raised for discussion, with the hope that the central government would provide more assistance to the Pingjin area in terms of grain sources. Furthermore, issues such as transportation, storage, and the profits of distributors have not yet been finalized in today's meeting and will be discussed again at a meeting on the 19th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Five Cities Grain Rationing Conference has concluded. Wu Kaixian of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has left Beijing and returned to Shanghai. Representatives from Pingjin and Guangzhou respectively discussed the special issues of their cities individually with Minister Yu Feipeng on the morning and afternoon of the 18th. The various proposals from yesterday's meeting will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for final discussion and then announced for implementation. The Five Cities Grain Rationing Implementation Rules passed yesterday stipulate that cooperatives be established in various places, and their prices will be reasonably determined by the respective municipal governments according to local conditions, but cannot be lower than a certain standard for grain prices. In order to ensure fairness in the amount of rations distributed, the amount will be uniform across regions. Although Shanghai proposed rationing two dou per person per month, more than the other four cities, this proposal was not finalized by the Ministry of Food. Except for Pingjin, where wheat-based food is the staple, the three cities of Jin, Hu, and Sui will primarily rely on rice, but the conversion ratio between flour and rice will be the same, with one municipal dou converting to fifteen municipal jin of flour. This grain rationing is only a trial run using the more than 170,000 tons of American relief grain. To coordinate with the supply of American relief grain, the trial run is temporarily set for four months. Whether the five cities will continue to implement it in the future or extend it to the whole country will depend on the supply of grain and the results of the implementation. The opening date is set for March 1, but those whose rationing work is not prepared in time will be determined with reference to the actual situation at that time.

### KMT Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, Reorganization Approved by Central Standing Committee, Wang Chonghui Reports on the Issue of National Assembly Delegate Concessions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee approved the organizational plans for provincial and municipal party headquarters on the 18th. It is understood that the purpose of this revision of the organizational structure of provincial and municipal party headquarters is to reduce personnel and save expenses. According to the new organizational regulations, the staff of the provincial party headquarters will be reduced to twenty or thirty people. Regarding the issue of National Assembly delegate election concessions, the Central Committee had requested Wang Chonghui to study the relevant central election laws. Wang presented a detailed report at today's Standing Committee meeting, which was discussed, but no results were reached. It was decided to hand it over to the election working group for further study. It was also learned that Comrade Xie Yongcun, the new secretary of the provincial party headquarters, died in a plane crash on official duty. The Central Committee has recently decided to issue funeral and relief funds to provide condolences.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] KMT Central Committee member Zou Lu arrived in Guangzhou via Hong Kong on the 18th. It is understood that Zou's trip is to mediate the issue of National Assembly delegate concessions and will also return to his hometown of Dapu.

### Nanjing, Hankou, and Other Inland River Ports, Our Government Considers Opening, But Not as a Condition of Accepting Foreign Aid

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Reliable source: Our government is currently considering the conditional opening of Nanjing, Hankou, and other inland river ports along the Yangtze River to facilitate foreign ships carrying American relief supplies, especially grain supplied for distribution in various places, to directly unload them at these ports for use, so as to avoid the consumption and delays of transshipment. This conditional opening will limit the location and date of berthing and unloading cargo through a licensing system. When returning along the river, they will accept our commission to load tung oil, tungsten sand, antimony ore, porcelain, and other handicraft products for export, so as to meet the actual needs of export trade. Authoritative sources claimed: the government's plan to take this step is definitely not a condition of accepting foreign aid, and all control powers will remain in our hands, and it will not involve the basic national policy of maintaining inland river navigation rights.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, replied to reporters' inquiries at a press conference on the 18th:

Question: It is rumored that the US government requires obtaining navigation rights for American ships on the Yangtze River as a condition for assisting China. What is the definition of inland river navigation rights?

Answer: The rumor that the US government requires inland river navigation rights as a condition for assisting China is completely untrue. No other country has made such a request. Since the conclusion of the Equal New Treaty and the abolition of foreign privileges in China, China's policy on navigation rights is no different from the general practices of other countries. Dong also pointed out three points: (1) Inland river navigation rights refer to the right of ships to carry goods from port A in China to port B in China. This right is limited to domestic merchants. (2) Foreign ships carrying goods from foreign ports to China, and carrying goods from Chinese ports to foreign countries, may unload and load cargo at ports in China that the government has announced open. (3) The Chinese government has the freedom to open or close any coastal or inland river port when necessary for foreign ships loading export goods or unloading import goods. This step must be carefully considered after considering the needs of the country, especially the actual needs of export trade. The implementation of this step will not affect the basic policy of maintaining inland river rights. (Continued on page two, column one)

### Re-Baptized in a New Life! — 14th Anniversary of the New Life Movement

Today is the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement. On this day fourteen years ago, when Chairman Chiang was stationed in Nanchang, he advocated the New Life Movement to revitalize the national spirit. The initial purpose of the New Life Movement was not only to equip the general public with national morality and national knowledge, but also to enable them to get rid of the old and embrace the new, and live a new life that conforms to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor." Only three years after the New Life Movement was advocated, the nationwide War of Resistance against Japan broke out. In just three or four years, it was of course not an easy task to thoroughly reform the people of the whole country, whether in consciousness, action, or life, and it can almost be said to be an impossible task in the context of accumulated problems. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, after the central government moved to Chongqing, National Monthly Meetings were held in the rear cities every month. Although nominally it was the National Spiritual Mobilization, in reality it was to constantly awaken the general officials and people to practice the essence of the New Life Movement, so that both public and private life could be thoroughly reformed. No one can deny that the New Life Movement made a great contribution to the victory of the War of Resistance, but this contribution was a spiritual and moral force, unlike material forces that can be estimated with numbers.

Recently, contemporary people have discussed modern international wars, saying that they are "scientific wars," and that the victory or defeat of a war depends entirely on material forces. And we, although not absolute idealists, believing that human beings can rely on their courage to fight bombs and artillery with flesh and blood, always feel that no matter how advanced science is and how strong material forces are, they still have to rely on spiritual forces to use them. Taking our country's War of Resistance as an example, from the September 18th Incident to the outbreak of the all-out War of Resistance, the material strength of the Japanese militarists can be said to have reached its peak, far beyond what our country could compare with. If our country had relied solely on material strength to compete with Japan, it would have been like heaven and earth, but we resolutely disregarded the material disadvantage and launched an all-out War of Resistance against Japan, not only enduring for eight years but also achieving the final victory. What force supported this War of Resistance, which disregarded success or failure and risked life and death? Obviously, it was the spiritual power of our nation! Chairman Chiang said last year today: "Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, we went through all kinds of difficulties, and finally relied on the revitalization of the whole people to achieve victory, which shows that the spirit of our nation has an indelible brilliance." The source of this spiritual power is the "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor" advocated by the New Life Movement.

However, looking at the current situation, whether it is the people's lives or the social atmosphere, it makes us infinitely sigh when we think of the goals revealed by the New Life Movement. We really dare to say a word that explores the root of the problem: the reason why China's disasters have occurred today, as well as the hidden dangers of the future country and nation, is because the general public cannot adhere to the New Life Movement creed, that is, the majority of people have long put propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor on the shelf. Broadly speaking, since the victory, the communists have launched a full-scale rebellion, on the one hand obeying foreign races and splitting China, and on the other hand instigating heresy and destroying culture. Mencius said: "Heretical doctrines and violent actions arise," which is a portrayal of the communists at this time. The purpose of the communists is not only to make our country lose the once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity to build a country, to make the general public feel threatened by life and livelihood, but also to try to bewitch the ignorant youth, destroy the inherent morality of our nation, and try to fundamentally overthrow our country's ethical concepts. Although the New Life Movement has gone through fourteen years of advocacy and practice, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor are seen by the communists as outdated, corrupt, stubborn, and old-fashioned, as if they must be kicked clean and swept away before they are happy. They force sons to kill their fathers and brothers to kill their brothers, so what are they talking about propriety? They sacrifice the people and betray the motherland, so what are they talking about righteousness? They use struggle and liquidation as a pretext, but in reality, they are looting, so what are they talking about integrity? They call it freedom of sexual intercourse and allocate women, so what are they talking about honor? As long as the communists exist for one day, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor will be "humiliated" for one day. Guan Zhong said: "If the four dimensions are not expanded, the country will perish." The communists want to use this method to make China perish at the hands of the ethnic masters worshiped by the communists!

Looking back at our recent social atmosphere, it is so decadent and rotten that it really needs the strength of thunder to make the entire society re-baptized by the New Life. The country is in such danger, and the soldiers are so arduous, but how extravagant and absurd is the life of the Shanghai citizens - especially the higher citizens? During the Spring Festival holidays, they gambled and drank, happily and cheerfully, throwing away tens of millions as usual, even a big bet, the winnings and losses amounted to billions. It is not necessary to mention other extravagant and lewd situations. God! Why don't they think about the soldiers shedding their blood on the cold battlefield? Why don't they think again about the refugees crying and begging for food and warmth on the streets are also compatriots? Why don't they think more about the countless aspiring youths from poor families who are worried about not being able to pay the high tuition fees and are about to drop out of school? These walking corpses who enjoy luxurious lives, no longer have the slightest concept of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. They have forgotten the society and the country, they only know the individual, and only know selfishness. The rampant nature of the communists is of course driven by their violence, but these corrupt social atmospheres are also a contributing factor. And the general officialdom, only talk about perfunctoriness, do not take responsibility, protect each other, do not pay attention to discipline, if this corrupt and incompetent political style is not thoroughly reformed, then China's political future will be very bleak. General Fu Zuoyi said: Suppressing the bandits must be combined with politics, economy, culture, etc., and military affairs can be completed. That's right, we believe that what needs to be coordinated most is the rectification of the atmosphere, and the clarification of officialdom, and to achieve these two points, we must use great strength to promote the New Life Movement and practice a life of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor.

### Dong Xianguang Answers Reporters' Questions (Continued from page one)

Question: Where does the government currently obtain its supply of weapons and ammunition?

Answer: Some were purchased from abroad, and some were manufactured by China itself.

Question: When will Bei Zuyi return to China?

Answer: I have not heard anything about it.

Question: Regarding the reform of the currency system, people from all walks of life have recently discussed it. What is the attitude of the relevant authorities of our government towards this issue of national concern? And what discussions did Bei Zuyi have on this matter in the United States?

Answer: Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan attended a meeting of the Legislative Yuan on February 5 and mentioned the issue of currency reform when reporting on the general budget bill, saying that currency reform has been favored by public opinion, and the government's position is also the same, but because (1) the country is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, and the expenditures are huge, (2) the communists are destroying transportation and destroying the economy, resulting in shrinking production and stagnant transportation, and the supply and demand in some places are not corresponding, and prices are not easy to stabilize, (3) affected by the communist disaster, people are displaced and their ability to bear the burden is reduced, therefore, stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices are equally important before or after the currency reform, but preparing for currency reform must first establish a foundation that gradually stabilizes the currency value. I have no other comments to offer.

### American Newspapers Misuse [Reactionary]

(Continued from page one) In general, the term "reactionary" is often used arbitrarily without understanding its true meaning. The term "reactionary" is translated from the English word "Reactionary." If we consult Webster's Dictionary, we will know that the original meaning of this word is "to favor the restoration of the old order," and its interpretation of "reactionary elements" is "those who intend to obstruct political progress." We ask American writers when they refer to our government as "reactionary," can they point out anyone in our government who meets the above definition? The question itself is sufficient to show the absurdity and unreasonableness of their misuse of nouns.

The important figures in our government are all far-sighted and possess liberal ideas. They can be regarded as representatives of China's most progressive elements. They work day and night to promote the progress of the country and have never "obstructed" its progress. In terms of liberal views and contemporary thought, they can be compared with the enlightened political leaders of Western democratic countries without shame. Of course, such people are all pragmatic and realistic people, and extreme elements or communists have no possibility of being mixed among them. They are now working hard to eradicate various malpractices and backward phenomena, and within the scope permitted by the political and economic situation, they are leading the Chinese people to move forward bravely to establish a progressive and modern government. When necessary, they will carry out reforms forcefully, regardless of difficulties. I can assure the doubters that we are now on the road to practical and lasting progress.

The Chinese government welcomes the participation of any truly liberal elements, but hopes that they can work together within the scope stipulated by the new democratic constitution. Is it too much to ask? In fact, many well-known liberals have been working within the government to effectively implement the constitution. Therefore, the so-called reactionary nature of our government is, in its essence, only communist propaganda. I feel deeply that if we can announce a moral standard to limit the use of this term, it will definitely promote a true understanding of international affairs.

The term "reactionary" has almost become a common title used by political enemies. There is also the same misuse in American politics. As far as I know, in the past few decades, in every presidential election campaign, opposing parties or presidential candidates have inevitably ridiculed each other with "reactionary" or "reactionary elements." However, mutual accusations cannot make either party truly become reactionary, because the political application of this term has lost its true meaning.

The misuse of this term by some American editors when writing editorials has caused great harm to China. It is easy for those who do not know the truth to misunderstand China, thinking that China's democratic and reactionary forces are clearly divided and tend to extremes, but the actual situation is not like this. China, like other countries, also has people with more backward thinking, but they have not participated in the government, and the so-called democrats usually referred to by some editors are known to the Chinese people as puppets used by totalitarian communism. Our country sincerely welcomes the genuine criticism of overseas friends. They point out our true shortcomings, provide objective standards, and help us measure the merits and demerits of national policies, which is a great contribution to us. However, if we only engage in slander, it will not be beneficial to both China and the United States.

### My Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Zhou Qianchong Returns to China from the United States, Talks About American Preventive Measures to Avoid Economic Panic

[Central News Agency, this city] Zhou Qianchong, advisor to my delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, has returned to China from the United States. According to him, although the future of the United Nations is not very bright, he believes that there is no need to be pessimistic. Regarding whether an economic panic in the United States can be avoided, he said that no country can solve all problems behind closed doors. The US government has foreseen the trend of its economic instability, so it has taken various preventive measures, such as restoring price controls and tightening credit loans. I believe that the main purpose of the Marshall Plan is also to avoid domestic recession, because only when all countries are prosperous can the United States maintain its prosperity. Economic panic is by no means beyond human power to save, but if the assistance provided to various countries by the Marshall Plan is too little or too late, it will have a bad impact on the American economy. He said that the United States' plan to provide large-scale assistance to China in various aspects may be decided. When I was in Washington, General Marshall told me that "there will be no major difficulties in Congress passing the aid to China bill, but under a democratic system, everything cannot be demanded too quickly." According to my observation, the United States hopes that aid to China can achieve 100% effectiveness, so we ourselves must strive to implement reforms. Zhou will go to Beijing tonight to report to the government on the experience of attending the United Nations General Assembly.

### Taiwan Aluminum Corporation, Content of the Sino-American Cooperation Draft, Capital Equally Shared by Both Parties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] After the draft cooperation agreement between the American Reynolds Aluminum Company and my National Resources Commission for the joint operation of the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation was signed, it is now awaiting approval from the higher-level institutions of both parties and can be signed and implemented. The reporter recently learned the content of the draft agreement, and its main points are as follows: A. In principle, both parties adopt equal cooperation. The capital of the aluminum company is 50% each by the National Resources Commission and the American Reynolds Company. During the negotiations, I once advocated that the ratio of funds between the two parties should be 51 to 49, but the result was still in accordance with the principle of equal cooperation, each being 50%. B. The organization name is still Taiwan Aluminum Corporation, with the board of directors as the highest authority. There are seven directors, of which China and the United States each account for three, and the other person is appointed by both parties through consultation when necessary. C. Economic cooperation. The total amount of the company's share capital is 17 million US dollars, divided into two types: 1. Common share capital of 1 million US dollars, half each for China and the United States. 2. Preferred share capital of 16 million US dollars, half each for China and the United States. Of this share capital, the 8.5 million US dollars invested by Reynolds Company will be used to purchase equipment. The 8.5 million US dollars of my National Resources Commission will be valued with equipment and machinery. At the same time, in order to effectively implement economic cooperation, the draft agreement also stipulates that both parties can jointly borrow from the US Import-Export Bank when necessary. D. Technical cooperation. Reynolds Company can send technical personnel to China to participate in the work of the company. E. After the start of cooperation between the two parties, the company will set up an aluminum rolling factory to engage in aluminum rolling. In the future development of the aluminum industry, it will focus on daily necessities for people's livelihood.

### Tianjin Cracks Down on Illegal Gold Smuggling

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] The Tianjin Financial Management Bureau cracked down on another case of illegal gold trading at 9:00 am on the 17th. According to reports, Tianhua Gold Store at No. 139 Harbin Road, District 1, Tianjin, was suspected of illegal gold and banknote trading.

When the inspectors were inspecting, there were incoming calls inquiring about gold prices, which proved that the store was obviously engaged in illegal gold trading. Finally, several taels of broken gold were found in the room. The Financial Management Bureau has sent all relevant criminals to the police station for further interrogation, and the seized gold is temporarily kept by the Central Bank.

### Student Public Funding Treatment Issues: Education Ministry Director He's Remarks: Universal Full Public Funding Impossible

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the issue of student public funding, Director He Shijun of the Ministry of Education recently stated: "Student public funding treatment is a very large burden on the government. Currently, there are still those who demand universal full public funding, which is not only financially impossible for the government to permit, but is also unreasonable.

Evolution of Publicly Funded Students

According to today's public funding and scholarships, they originated from wartime loans, initially in very small amounts, with funds being evenly distributed by each school itself. In the autumn of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940], the funds began to be allocated by the government. In the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943], it was renamed public funding. However, it was consistently stipulated that it would last until the end of the War of Resistance or the student's graduation. In May of last year, the Fourth Session of the Third National Political Consultative Conference believed that the public funding system was originally a wartime system, and if it remained unchanged, it would easily foster a dependency mentality among students. Therefore, it was resolved that students already enjoying public funding could continue to receive it until graduation. After that, new students should be granted scholarships based on their academic performance and family circumstances, so that outstanding and promising young people could pursue further studies. On the other hand, the government could transfer the current huge amount of public funding to be used for school teaching equipment. The government has followed this resolution of the National Political Consultative Conference. Since the last semester, it has been stipulated that 20% of newly admitted students will be given scholarships. Those who were originally approved for public funding will continue to receive it. Among the new students, normal school students, Bao Qing students, veteran students from youth military service, border students, children of revolutionary and anti-Japanese war heroes, and honorably discharged soldiers attending school will all receive public funding uniformly, without being subject to quota restrictions. After last autumn, due to the expansion of the pacification zones and the large number of students from bandit-controlled areas, it was further stipulated that students from national and provincial colleges and universities whose household registration belonged to bandit-controlled areas and who were approved for relief would be exempted from tuition and accommodation fees, and provided with meals according to the eight-expense student meal standard. The government's care for students can be said to be meticulous.

Heavy Burden on the Government

Currently, there are 76,978 fully publicly funded students and 12,181 half publicly funded students in colleges and universities nationwide. There are 44,471 fully publicly funded students and 12,765 half publicly funded students in secondary schools, totaling over 121,400 fully publicly funded students and over 24,900 half publicly funded students, not including provincial-level publicly funded students. The treatment of publicly funded students includes a main food allowance of 2 shi and 3 sheng of rice per student per month, or 46 jin of flour. In addition to the allocation areas where a substitute allowance is issued at the allocated price, the remainder is issued at the market price, and a supplementary allowance is issued based on one-thirty-seventh of the living base for public school personnel, multiplied by the living index. According to this standard, the monthly public funding for each student in the Northeast schools has reached more than 3 million yuan, and in the Beijing-Shanghai area, due to the allocation relationship, it is more than 400,000 yuan per student per month. The budget for the first half of this year includes over 430 billion yuan for student meal expenses, accounting for 15% of the educational funds managed by the ministry, but in fact, it is far from enough. Including the additional funds that have not yet been approved, the amount needed for the first half of this year is about 730 billion yuan, accounting for about 25% of the educational funds managed by the ministry. Currently, there are widespread rumors that some people are promoting universal full public funding treatment, which will inevitably make the funding for school teaching equipment even more scarce. This is not the right way to run education. Moreover, due to financial difficulties in primary education in our country, there are many out-of-school children. The government spends a lot of money to provide meal expenses for students in secondary and higher schools, which is purely out of concern for maintaining education. If the quota is further increased and public funding is made universal, it would not only be contrary to reason and sentiment, but no country in the world has such a precedent."

Those who attended this meeting included responsible persons from 14 units of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tientsin.

### Over 10,000 Citizens in Taiyuan Receive "Three Self-Training"

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] Over 12,000 male and female citizens of Taiyuan have gathered in 29 schools since yesterday to begin a half-month long "Three Self-Training" (i.e., self-purification, self-defense, self-government). Director Yan Xishan, in his opening speech, instructed the people that only after self-purification can they defend themselves, and only after self-defense can they govern themselves. Therefore, self-purification is a necessary path to self-government.

The citizens receiving training were selected based on the principles of "three courtyards, one male hero" and "five courtyards, one female leader." The "Three Self-Training Committee," the organization in charge of the training, is headed by Yang Aiyuan, deputy director of the Pacification Headquarters, and Liang Dunhou, a member of the provincial government, as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively.

### The Wars in North and Central China are Relatively Quiet, The Focus of the War is in the Northeast, The Ministry of National Defense Releases a Week of War Situation

[Report from Nanjing, 18th of this newspaper] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense recently released the week's war situation from February 11th to 17th as follows:

Northeast: The battles in various battlefields have been more intense in Guandong [Northeast China] recently, while those in North and Central China have been relatively quiet. The focus of the war is in the Northeast, so all parties are concerned about the situation in the Northeast. In the past week, the National Army in Liaobei launched a mopping-up operation north of Shifosi. The Lin bandit's [Lin Biao] 13th, 10th, and 2nd Columns, a part of the 1st Column, and the Independent 4th Division, totaling about 50,000 bandits, gathered and attempted to make trouble. They were attacked. Due to the cunning of the bandits, who refused to engage in decisive battles with the National Army, the 3rd and 10th Columns turned southwest to Shifosi, attempting to cut off the Shenyang-Xinmin line. In the Liaoxi area, the bandits saw that the National Army's large corps had arrived in Jinzhou, and the plan to cut off the Beining Road was faltering. Only the 9th Column and a part of the 8th Column were left to contain the National Army's forces. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th Columns, totaling about 100,000 bandits, were transferred east to the vicinity of Liaozhong and Shenyang South. After taking the opportunity to capture Liaoyang, they have been besieging Anshan with about 60,000 bandits from the 4th, 6th, and 8th Columns, isolating Yingkou, and attempting to cut off the transportation line from the southern section of Shenyang directly to the sea. In the battle of Liaoyang, the National Army transferred its position after exhausting 10,000 of the bandit army's main forces. The defense battle of Anshan is now unfolding.

North China: After Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops in North China suffered a crushing defeat from the National Army in the outer suburbs of Baoding and near Laishui in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, they have tried their best to avoid battle and recuperate for several weeks. However, they have not yet recovered their vitality. The National Army has gradually completed the deployment of the suppression operation here and is studying political bandit suppression strategies. In the past week, in addition to the very smooth mopping-up operation in northern Hebei and Chahar, the battles in other places have been relatively quiet.

East China: Chen Yi's [Communist commander] troops in East China have no place to survive in eastern Henan, and the main force was forced to flee back to western Shandong. His 1st, 4th, 6th, 8th, Liangguang Columns, and the cadres of his 3rd Column, totaling about 60,000, originally planned to recuperate, but under the continuous pursuit and suppression by the National Army's elite troops, they have not had a moment's rest. Currently, most of his forces have fled to the narrow area east of Heze, and between Dingtao, Chengwu, and Cao County. The 10th and 11th Columns, which were originally left between Cao County and Chengwu, are currently being attacked by the National Army, which has advanced fiercely from Cao County in the east and Shan County in the south, and they cannot advance or retreat.

Central China: The situation of Liu Bocheng's [Communist commander] bandit troops in Central China has recently become quite alarming due to the retreat of Chen Yi's main force to western Shandong. 80% of the vast area of the Dabie Mountains is controlled by the National Army, and all important strongholds are owned by the National Army. At the moment Liu's bandits, with the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns, totaling about 50,000 men, are active in a few mountainous areas of the Dabie Mountains, with no source of soldiers, no food to eat, no strength to fight, and a severe shortage of ammunition. Last month, Liu himself led the 2nd Column in a desperate attempt to flee north, hoping to open a supply line and receive some supplies sent by Chen Yi. The National Army dealt a head-on blow on the north bank of the Huai River, forcing them to flee back hastily, and they were continuously attacked along the way back. In the battle of Xindian (near Fu), on the 14th of this month, the 6th Brigade of the bandits was defeated. The 3rd Column originally planned to attack Yuexi while Liu's bandits fled north, restraining the National Army's forces and supporting Liu's bandits. As a result, not only did it fail to exert any restraining effect, but it suffered losses in the battle to lift the siege of Yuexi on the 6th of this month and in the battle of Shuihouling (southwest of Yuexi) on the 13th. It is currently still dividing into smaller units, lurking in the mountainous areas southeast, west, and east of Yuexi. In short, the Dabie Mountains war situation, which has attracted national attention, has in fact entered a stage of joint suppression by the military and civilians. Other bandits in the Jinshan area, the Yuxi area, and the Dahongshan area have had small contacts, but there have been no significant battles.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Officially Votes to Pass the European Aid Bill with Amendments Stipulating that Recipient Countries Should Balance Their Budgets

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee officially voted today to unanimously pass the European Recovery Program legislation drafted by the committee, naming it the "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948," which stipulates the launch of a 5.3 billion yuan aid plan for 16 European countries for the twelve months beginning April 1st. The Senate will begin debating the bill on March 1st. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced that the European Aid Program has been included in the final amendment by the Foreign Relations Committee, stipulating that each recipient country should balance its government budget as soon as possible according to the actual situation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee officially passed a bill today approving a four-year European Recovery Program and an initial appropriation of $5.3 billion for the first year. However, the committee stipulated that $3 billion of the initial appropriation should be allocated from the fiscal surplus of this fiscal year. Republican senators, eager to have sufficient government fiscal surplus for the purpose of reducing income taxes for the next fiscal year, passed the above provisions, so that the $3 billion line of credit will be paid from this year's government tax revenue, otherwise, if paid under the next fiscal year, this fund will be blamed. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Millikin, who presided over the above amendment, said that the government's proposed $9 billion foreign aid plan is too burdensome on the next year's finances. The action taken by the committee today makes it more likely that Congress will pass the European Recovery Program and the Republican proposal to cut taxes by $4.5 billion to $6.5 billion. At the same time, the Republican move to cut numbers is a political action to show the savings in next year's budget and reduce the tax burden on voters.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today that he would also agree to cut European aid if it was the only way to get the European aid bill through Congress. Eaton said, "I still support a long-term aid plan, but I will also support it if it is necessary to reduce the amount and duration in order to pass the bill. Eaton also revealed that the House Foreign Affairs Committee could complete public hearings by the end of next week, and then begin drafting its legislation. It will not be completed before the Senate begins debating on March 1. It is generally expected that the amount that the House Foreign Affairs Committee will pass will be less than the $5.3 billion approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."

### Small General Assembly to Meet Next Thursday, Korean Issue on Agenda, US State Department Temporarily Remains Silent

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] When the United Nations Small General Assembly meets next Thursday, the Korean issue will be on the agenda. The United Nations Korean Committee has one special report, which is expected to arrive on Thursday. The Small General Assembly will review the issues of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's refusal to participate in the Korean Committee, as well as the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with it in Korea.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department has refused to comment on reports that the People's Republic of North Korea has been established until the situation there is clarified. At the same time, Jebkko, the political adviser to General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, has come here from South Korea to review the new situation in Korea with Secretary of State Marshall. Authoritative sources revealed that the news in the newspapers about the recent developments in North Korea is slightly different from the intelligence obtained by the State Department. Therefore, the US government will not take any action until the investigation is clear.

### New York Times Editorial Criticizes the Situation in North Korea

[United Press, New York, 18th] The New York Times editorial on the 18th criticized the Korean situation, saying: "Korea is only a part of the whole picture. The United States and the United Nations are facing a long-term Soviet policy, and the stakes in this policy are higher than ideas and the Korean cabinet. The stake is the Northeast. The Northeast is currently threatened by the Soviet side on its northwest. If the Soviet Union controls Korea, the southern part of the Northeast will also be threatened. This move can be carried out by the Chinese Communist organization under Soviet command. The Northeast can become an 'independent socialist Soviet Manchurian Republic' in the short term. Korea is just a stop in progress. The United Nations Small General Assembly has encountered some cold political facts. The Northeast is extremely valuable to the Soviet Union. Once Korea is controlled, the Northeast can be taken easily. The Northeast is also extremely important to China. If China strives to recover from the war ruins, all actions of the United Nations should be viewed in this light."

### US Military Officer Mocked, Hodge Protests

[United Press, Seoul, 18th] According to an official announcement here, two US military officers were mocked by Koreans during a review of the North Korean army in the Soviet-occupied area. General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, has lodged a strong protest. Hodge's protest was made to Major General Kolotkov, commander of the Soviet 25th Army. The content will not be released until the protest reaches Pyongyang.

### US Aid to Greece Special Military Expenditure Will Exceed 100 Million Yuan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] If the US Congress passes the current aid to Greece plan, its post-war stake in Greece will exceed one billion US dollars. US aid to Greece includes $300 million in loans under the Truman Doctrine, totaling $767.7 million. It is estimated that Greece can receive $186 million in the first 15 months under the Marshall Plan. The US government will soon ask Congress to allocate more than 100 million US dollars in special military expenditure for aid to Greece.

### Iran Buys Weapons from the United States

### French Ambassador Visits Lovett to Discuss West German Issues

[US Information Service, Washington, 17th] French Ambassador Bonnet met with Deputy Secretary of State Lovett today to discuss the issues related to western Germany, which will be proposed for discussion in London next Monday. Bonnet told reporters that he would emphasize that France is seeking a major step towards the internationalization of the Ruhr area and is particularly focused on the "steel industry," and that France favors a "genuine federal organization of Germany."

As for whether the Benelux three countries should participate in the London conference, Bonnet said that France supports their participation. He expressed his confidence that a method can be found in the future to enable the three countries to express their opinions.

### Polish Representative to the Social and Economic Council Discusses the European Aid Plan

[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] Polish representative Lanzki said at the United Nations Economic and Social Council that the Marshall Plan will fail in Western Europe for two reasons: (1) The industrial products and surplus exports of Western Europe, especially Germany, will have no way out if they do not include Eastern Europe as consumers. (2) Western European countries compete with each other in industry and cannot turn to each other for help. Lanzki argued that it is almost impossible to revive a part of Europe while discriminating against other parts. The economic division of Europe is the result of political considerations. The focus on economic assistance to Western Europe in order to establish a new balance of power in European politics is contrary to economic logic, is costly, and is bound to fail.

### End of the Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference in Eastern Europe; Joint Declaration to Be Issued; Allegedly Aimed at Enhancing Collective Security

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 17th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia will conclude tomorrow morning. President Beneš is scheduled to meet with the Polish and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers tomorrow afternoon, and a joint statement is expected to be released that evening. The Polish and Yugoslav delegations are scheduled to depart for their respective countries at midnight tomorrow.

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 17th] The Foreign Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia held a meeting here today to discuss the German issue. Based on the general impression of the three Foreign Ministers' speeches today, the meeting does not seem to intend to break away from the Western powers and make a final decision, but rather to issue a solemn warning, calling on the powers to strengthen cooperation on this serious European issue. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić criticized the Western powers' policy towards Germany with sharp language, while Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski adopted a more moderate attitude, explaining that the purpose of the Prague Conference is to enhance collective security and that peace is an indivisible whole, which is the foundation of the United Nations. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk stated that we should not give up hope that the powers will eventually reach an agreement on the German issue. Prague diplomatic circles doubt whether this can be achieved, as the hopes of Czech politicians may not be consistent with the actual actions of the powers. On the other hand, it is also said that the "Cold War" between Eastern and Western powers is allowing Germany to reap the benefits, which not only endangers peace and security in Europe but will also affect the entire world.

[Reuters, Prague, 17th] A Czech foreign affairs spokesperson stated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which opened in Prague on the 17th, is not directed against any Western power. There is no intention to discuss any territorial issues at the meeting, and the aim is only to draw attention to the needs and concerns of Germany's neighbors. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland are deeply concerned that unilateral decisions will reduce opportunities for economic improvement, thereby increasing the possibility of German unrest. The Slavic countries believe that peace in Central Europe can only be ensured through cooperation among small neighboring countries. The three countries will issue a joint statement expressing dissatisfaction with the ineffectiveness of disarming Germany and reducing war industries and will demand that the peace treaty with Germany include a provision prohibiting propaganda offensives against neighboring countries.

### Upset Election in the Bronx, New York

### MacArthur Willing to Fully Support Policy of Dissolving Japanese Zaibatsu; U.S. Senate Reads MacArthur's Letter

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Allied Council for Japan held its 52nd meeting today. The Soviet representative proposed discussing the "reasons for the resignation of the Japanese Katayama Cabinet and the policies of the next cabinet." The U.S. representative replied: "According to MacArthur's instructions, this matter is an internal political issue of Japan and should be resolved by the Japanese themselves. There is no need for this Council to discuss it." However, the Soviet representative stated that he reserved the right to re-propose the motion for discussion. The 52nd meeting ended unhappily.

### Life Exists on Mars; Ice Caps at the Poles

[United Press, McDonald Observatory, Texas, 18th] Astronomers at the McKeech astronomers claim that recent studies of Mars have provided preliminary evidence that primitive life exists on Mars. Early in the morning on the 18th, Mars was only 63 million miles from Earth, the shortest distance between the two planets in two years. Astronomers used the infrared spectrum of the 82-inch telescope developed during the war to discover that moss-like plants may be growing on Mars, and that there are also ice caps formed by water at the poles of Mars.

The Philippine government also opposes Japan's proposal to fish near the Philippines. It is feared that the FAO conference will begin technical discussions on nutrition and fisheries, and the conference will discuss food issues until March 1, in order to implement the recommendations discussed by the FAO in Geneva last summer. The recommendations include (1) increased production, (2) markets and distribution, (3) storage of food supplies in various regions, and (4) price stabilization.

### Chilean President Arrives in Antarctica; Broadcast Emphasizes Territory Cannot Be Invaded; Britain Still Insists on Resolution by the Hague Tribunal

[Reuters, Chilean Kingston, 17th] Chilean President Videla arrived in Sovereignty Bay outside Greenwich Island in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica on the afternoon of the 17th. Chile has established a permanent army base on Greenwich Island, and Videla is about to deliver a broadcast speech in response to British Foreign Undersecretary McNeil's statement in the House of Commons.

[Agence France-Presse, Santiago, 18th] Chilean President Videla made a statement at a ceremony in Subrania today, referring to the major powers' re-emergence of territorial disputes in Antarctica, saying, "The return of European imperialism is an extremely threatening move to Chile, attempting to seize Antarctic territory belonging to Chile from Chile and the Americas. Chile has calmly dealt with this threat to peace and the safety of its people on many occasions, but the Americas today is not in a state of disarmament and disunity, so it cannot tolerate the encroachment of any power outside the Americas. The Chilean President concluded by saying that those who attempt to subvert the UN Charter and international law should remember that such aggression is directed against all countries in the Americas."

[United Press, London, 17th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that Britain will again submit a note to Argentina and Chile, insisting that the South Antarctic territorial dispute should be submitted to the Hague International Court of Justice for judgment. The spokesman declined to say whether Britain accepts Argentina's proposal to submit the matter to an international conference for resolution, saying only that it is a legal issue that should be resolved by the International Court of Justice.

[United Press, Capital of Argentina, 17th] The newspapers in this city today took a reserved attitude towards the dispute between Britain and Argentina over Antarctic land, saying that although the fleet had sailed to the disputed area, both Argentina and Chile hoped for a peaceful resolution and did not intend to cause trouble.

### Three Countries Compete for the Falkland Islands; Uranium Mines Play a Role

[United Press, London, 17th] The "News Chronicle" and "Daily Mail" hinted to readers that there may be uranium mines or gold deposits underground in the Falkland Islands.

[British News Service] The dispute over the Falkland Islands with Argentina and Chile has become a matter of global attention.

The Falkland Islands are originally a small island in South America, located at 51 to 53 degrees west longitude and 57.40 to 61.25 degrees south latitude. The islands have more than 100 mountains and a total area of 6,500 square miles. They were first discovered by the Englishman Davis in 1592. Two years later, Hopkins completed the first voyage on the north coast of the islands. In 1764, the French explorer Bougainville occupied the island and established a colony in Port Louis on the island. Three years later, France ceded the island to Spain. However, the year after the French occupied the islands, the British Navy sent Colonel Byron to occupy it based on the fact that Britain was the first to discover the island. Although Britain and Spain occupied the island together, they did not infringe on each other. This continued until 1769, when disputes gradually arose between the troops stationed by the two countries. In 1771, Spain and Britain signed a treaty formally ceding the island to British occupation, which was the first time that British sovereignty over the island was recognized internationally, and also the historical basis for the British Foreign Office's statement of protecting its rights.

### Truman Calls on Housewives to Implement a "Buycott" Movement to Combat High Cost of Living

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman addressed the National Women's Conference here today, hinting that he approved of American housewives organizing a "buycott" movement to force food prices down.

This weapon can combat the enemy that is currently threatening the country - the high cost of living.

### De Valera Meets a Strong Opponent; Prime Minister's Position Shakes

A twelve-year-old girl with beautiful hair clung to her mother shamefully and cried, "No matter what she thinks of me, I will never be naughty again."

### New York Times Launches Facsimile Newspaper; Another Innovation in the Newspaper Industry

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The New York Times has made another innovation in modern news transmission. It is now broadcasting a four-page facsimile newspaper to 14 department stores in New York every day from its radio station. The broadcast time is from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day during the stores' business hours, which is the first successful large-scale experiment in using wireless facsimile to broadcast news after the war. This wireless facsimile newspaper is about one-quarter the size of a regular newspaper, and one page is a women's edition. The news in the facsimile newspaper is broadcast in the font of a new type of typewriter. Each piece of news takes three and a half minutes. The Times cannot yet predict when this type of wireless facsimile version will be widely subscribed to, because the equipment for recording facsimile news is very expensive and production is still low. At the same time, the need for wireless facsimile is still limited by the horizon, so if you want to have this type of wireless facsimile newspaper nationwide, you first need to set up a group of radio stations. However, the Times' publication of the facsimile newspaper at least foreshadows new developments in the future of the newspaper industry.

### Southern Siam is Peaceful; Separatist Movement Has Been Eliminated; New Parliament to Decide on New Prime Minister

[Reuters, Bangkok, 17th] Siamese Minister of the Interior Bukatdi said after inspecting the southern provinces that the southern provinces are very peaceful, the separatist movement has no public support, and after the government took steps to meet the demands of the Muslim residents, the turmoil has disappeared invisibly.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th] The new Siamese Parliament will be formally established tomorrow. The two houses will also hold meetings on February 20 to elect speakers and members of various committees. According to the latest news: the Regency Council has scheduled a meeting on the 21st, and the candidates for the new prime minister will be decided at the meeting.

### U.S. House Passes Bill on Military Missions Abroad

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. House of Representatives again passed a bill and submitted it to the Senate for action. The bill would extend the President's wartime authority to appoint military missions stationed in countries other than the Americas and the Philippines. This legislation has been pending since last year and has now received support from the State Department and the Department of the Army and Navy. If this bill is not passed, it may cause the withdrawal of the existing U.S. military missions in China and Iraq. As for the missions in Turkey and Greece, they are stipulated in special legislation.

### Solar Eclipse on May 9th; Visible in Manila

### U.S. Strictly Controls Exports; Chinese Merchants Request Export Licenses to Be Recommended by the Embassy; Gasoline Export Licenses Also Temporarily Suspended

[Report from Washington by our newspaper] The United States has now implemented a new export licensing policy, which imposes stricter restrictions on the export of various important goods, and also restricts the purchase orders placed directly with U.S. exporters by government procurement agencies of various countries or the self-transportation of materials purchased by government purchasing agencies of various countries stationed in the United States. Export licenses for goods destined for private importers will be given priority in order to encourage the expansion of private trade. Therefore, in the future, the government procurement agencies of our country or the World Trade Corporation will have to purchase goods from the United States within the U.S. export quota for our country; and the quota is often less than what our country actually needs to import.

When the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration approves export licenses for goods destined for our country, if our government wants to "recommend" this, it must be handled by the Commercial Counselor's Office of our Embassy in the United States. The U.S. side agrees to this recommendation before the export license can be issued; otherwise, the application will be returned. In addition, recently, American merchants intend to purchase tens of thousands of yuan of firecrackers and tens of thousands of yuan of fishhooks from our country. It is heard that the Commercial Counselor's Office in the United States has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to contact exporters nearby. Another Canadian merchant intends to directly negotiate with our country's exporters to purchase hardware tools, and our country's Commercial Counselor's Office in the United States has replied by introducing them.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. Department of Commerce today suspended the issuance of export licenses for gasoline and other petroleum products to various countries, except Canada. It is hoped that the suspension of these licenses will only last for a few days. During these few days, the Department of Commerce hopes to learn from the U.S. embassies and consulates in various countries the amount by which the consumption of U.S. gasoline has been reduced.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Senate Banking Committee today unanimously passed a bill extending the government's control over tin, fats, oils and certain other scarce items until after June 1949.

### Memoirs of Hull (25)

— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, compiled by this newspaper's translation department

The arrow of aggression is notched on the bow, about to be released

On January 27th, Grew telegraphed me from Tokyo, stating that the Peruvian diplomatic representative in Japan had told him that he (the Peruvian representative) had heard from many sources (including a Japanese source) that Japanese armed forces would suddenly launch a massive attack on Pearl Harbor when a "dispute" occurred between the United States and Japan, and that Japan would use all kinds of weapons in this attack. The secretary representative told Grew that he believed the news must be passed on, he said. The next day, we forwarded the telegram to the War Department and the Navy Department.

Around this time and under these circumstances, two Catholic priests returned to the United States from Japan. One was Bishop Walsh, the president of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America in New York, and the other was Father Traut.

They reported that they had spoken with many prominent Japanese figures (including Matsuoka); they knew that relations between the two countries were becoming tense, and a worse situation would follow. They both had admirable desires to do their best as ordinary citizens to prevent war.

On the one hand, they contacted Postmaster General Walker, the most powerful Catholic in the U.S. government, and on the other hand, they met with officials from the Japanese Ambassador's office.

The President and I agreed that Bishop Walsh and Father Traut should continue to maintain contact with the Japanese Embassy in a purely private capacity and try to record the Japanese side's thoughts in writing. However, we felt that we ourselves could not take any action until the new Japanese Ambassador Nomura arrived in Washington.

Ambassador Nomura paid his first visit to me on February 12th. He was tall and healthy, with an honest face, very different from the physique of ordinary Japanese people. His English was sometimes good and sometimes not very proficient. His characteristic was seriousness, but often he made unhappy smiles and bows. I believed that Nomura was very sincere in his efforts to prevent war between the United States and Japan.

I had my first long conversation with Nomura on March 8th at my apartment in the Carlton Hotel. This was the first of fifty to sixty conversations we held before the Pearl Harbor incident. The talks were held at night, in the reading room of my apartment, first at the Carlton Hotel and later at the Wardman Park Hotel. Nomura preferred to come to my apartment rather than the State Department in order to minimize the chances of our conversations being reported in the newspapers.

In these discussions, there were many frank words, but our voices never exceeded the level of a conversational tone. Nomura was courteous, and we maintained very harmonious personal relations.

Our initial conversations were limited to Nomura and myself, later including my advisors and Nomura's advisors.

The State Department's outstanding Japanese expert, Blunden, always came to my apartment at 7:45 p.m., bringing various necessary documents and discussing them with me. Nomura and his advisors arrived before 8:30 p.m., and the talks often continued until 10 p.m., sometimes 10:30 p.m. Blunden then returned to the State Department to prepare a memorandum of the conversation.

The informal talks conducted by Bishop Walsh, Father Traut, and Postmaster General Walker with Japanese representatives (including Ambassador Nomura) had made some headway by April 9th. On that day, I received from them a draft proposal that the participants had already agreed upon. In the following days, I carefully reviewed its contents with experts in Far Eastern affairs within the State Department.

As we studied the proposal, our disappointment was great. The proposal was not as easily acceptable as we had imagined; most of the clauses were what those radical Japanese imperialists could have hoped for.

After our Far Eastern experts and I had finished reviewing the proposal forwarded by Postmaster General Walker, my conclusion was that there were several points that should be opposed, several points that could be accepted as they were, and several points that could be accepted after revision. I felt that any opportunity that could lead to large-scale negotiations with the Japanese should not be ignored. Therefore, I invited Nomura to come and see me at my newly moved-in apartment at the Wardman Park Hotel.

I stated to Nomura that I had received an informal proposal regarding the resolution of disputes between our two countries, and added that I knew that the Japanese Ambassador himself had participated in the plan and was aware of its contents.

Nomura quickly replied that he was fully aware of the contents of the document. Although he had not yet submitted it to his government, he firmly believed that his government would approve it.

Two days later, I handed Nomura a statement including four basic principles at my apartment. I explained to him that these four principles must be emphasized in any agreement we might reach. The contents of the four principles are as follows:

(1) Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations.

(2) Support for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

(3) Support for the principle of equality (including equal opportunities for trade).

(4) No alteration of the status quo in the Pacific, except by peaceful means.

I told Nomura that after these four principles were accepted, if he submitted the informal document prepared by private parties from both the United States and Japan to his government, and if his government approved it and instructed him to present it to us, then it could become the basis for starting negotiations.

Nomura forwarded the April 9th document, along with my four points and other comments, to Tokyo, and we waited for the Japanese response.

On May 7th, Nomura came to my humble abode again. He presented a proposal from the Japanese government, advocating that the United States and Japan should immediately conclude a non-aggression pact. Without hesitation, I quickly put this issue aside. I said, "This is completely different from your April 9th document. Our government does not want to consider anything other than the basic principles used as the basis for negotiation."

Nomura also said that he had received a telegram from Matsuoka, but pointed out that much of the content was "incorrect". He asked me if he could give me the telegram. I thought for a moment, and then replied to him, "Since there are so many mistakes in it, if he has the power to do so, it would be better for him to keep the telegram; because, as he has indicated, Matsuoka's text has rejected most or many parts of the April 9th document, so there will be no progress." Nomura then took back the telegram.

In fact, we already knew the contents of the telegram. It included Matsuoka's statement to me, saying that the German and Italian leaders firmly believed that victory could be obtained, and that American participation in the European war would only prolong it, causing the destruction of civilization, and also explained that Japan could not harm the position of her allies. How did we know the contents of the telegram? In fact, our army and navy code experts, with their superb skills, had deciphered the Japanese code, intercepted government telegrams from Tokyo to Washington and other capitals, translated them, and submitted them to the State Department for reference.

These intercepted telegrams called our code name "Magic". In the initial negotiations, these telegrams played a small role, but in the final stages, they were very important. From these telegrams, we learned of the instructions given by the Japanese Foreign Minister to Nomura and other Japanese representatives, and we could also examine how Nomura reported the contents of his conversations with us to Tokyo. These telegrams showed that Japan was still actively pursuing its conquest plans while negotiating peace with us. I saw these telegrams as I saw a witness contradicting his own case. Of course, I had to be very careful not to let Nomura know in the slightest that we had this special intelligence. I had to note that our conversations were limited to the information I obtained from him or through normal diplomatic channels. To ensure the security of these telegrams, I assigned one of my secretaries to handle and preserve them, ensuring that they must be returned to the Navy Department or destroyed.

On May 12th, Nomura gave me a completely new document, which was a draft agreement prepared by the Japanese side, with an "oral explanation" of various proposals attached.

We have now obtained the official proposal from the Japanese side. As of May 12th, the foundation for negotiations had been laid, and the negotiations continued until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident, with only one interruption.

The light of hope radiating from the document was very dim. Most of what Japan proposed was beneficial to itself. In fact, it demanded that the United States and Japan jointly maintain a superior position in the Pacific, while Japan assumed the role of baron, encompassing ninety percent of the population and wealth, with little regard for the rights and interests of other countries.

A straightforward refusal would be tantamount to giving up the only real opportunity we had gained in months to engage in fundamental discussions with the Japanese side about the outstanding issues between us.

As a result, we decided to proceed with negotiations in accordance with the Japanese proposal.

When the Japanese government realized that we were willing to use the May 12th proposal as a basis for discussion, they immediately began to act, not proposing more amicable suggestions in our direction, but moving in the opposite direction. The content of the proposal was changed again and again, so that it was more in line with the imperialistic ambitions of themselves and their Axis allies.

We had very reliable information about everything Japan was planning. On the surface, the Imperial Conference was held in Tokyo on July 2nd; then, military steps of an alarming nature began. One to two million people were called up, Japanese merchant ships were suddenly recalled from the Atlantic, travel restrictions were implemented in Japan, and mail and communications were strictly checked. The various steps taken indicated that Japan was preparing for a large-scale war.

In fact, the Japanese government telegrams we intercepted also gave us equally alarming news. A telegram sent from Tokyo to Berlin on July 2nd included the following radical passages regarding policy:

(1) This Empire is determined to pursue a policy of promoting world peace, and regardless of how the world situation changes, is determined to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

(2) The Imperial Government will continue to work to end the China Incident and will take steps southward in order to establish a solid foundation for self-preservation and self-defense.

On the same day, Matsuoka sent a telegram to Nomura saying: "Preparations for the southward advance will be strengthened, and the policy already decided for Vietnam and Thailand (Siam) will be implemented. As for the German-Soviet war, although the spirit of the three axes should be maintained, everything must be prepared at present to deal with the situation in our own way. At the same time, diplomatic negotiations should be conducted with extreme caution. Although every means should be used to prevent the United States from participating in the war, if necessary, Japan will act in accordance with the Tripartite Pact and decide when and how to use force.

Shortly thereafter, Japanese troops occupied southern Vietnam on July 21st, holding the entire French strategic province, like a huge thumb pointing towards the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies.

On May 23rd, Welles called me from White Sulphur Springs, saying that Nomura had requested to meet with him, and asked me how to talk to Nomura.

I told him that the invasion of southern Vietnam seemed to be the last step before Japan's large-scale offensive in the South Pacific. I said that since Japan was attacking Vietnam in the midst of negotiations, I did not think there was any reason to continue the negotiations. Welles forcefully told Nomura these comments, and told him that I had decided to end our negotiations.

Since then, our main goal regarding Japan has been to give ourselves enough time to prepare for defense.

### Annihilating the Remnant Bandits on the Qing Song Border; Thirteen Killed and Dozens Captured Near An Zhuang; Rumor has it that Bandit Leader Ding Xishan has also been Killed

[Report from this newspaper] After the small groups of bandits wandering on the Qing Song border were wiped out by the national army and local self-defense forces for several days, they have been divided into two groups. One group escaped from Phoenix Mountain to An Zhuang and has been surrounded and annihilated by the garrison troops. In addition to the 13 bandits killed on the spot, 44 people were captured. It is reported that Ding Xishan, the bandit leader, was also identified among the bandits killed. Another group is still wandering in the Tianma Mountain area, and has been tightly surrounded by the local army. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate them. The Municipal Garrison Headquarters issued a public announcement for the first time yesterday to confirm this matter.

A small number of communist bandits from Ding Xishan's unit, who landed in Punan, were led by Ding Xishan himself, about fifty people, wandering around Tianma Mountain. At 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, this group of bandits suddenly appeared in Phoenix Mountain. The pursuing troops tracked and suppressed them, and the bandits fled through Tiansheng Village south through Ao Township to Shang'an Village, trying to sneak into Dianshan Lake. However, the Qingpu County troops had completed their deployment in advance, and all ports of Dianshan Lake from Zhujie Pavilion to Zhangliantang were completely blocked. Qingpu County Chief Liu Jin and Wang Jialiang, the captain of the People's Self-Defense Force, arrived at Zhushu Pavilion early to direct everything. Qingpu County town was also on alert all night, and the lights were not turned off all night (usually the power supply only lasts until 12:00 p.m.). Until dawn yesterday morning, the bandits arrived near An Zhuang, and first sent three people (one in plain clothes and two in gray uniforms) posing as the Third Clearance District and Songjiang Self-Defense Force troops, forcibly pulled civilian boats and ordered them to carry the large army into the lake. The boatman said that the lake was unstable and it would be difficult to pass, and asked them to contact the police stationed in An Zhuang first. When the bandits heard that there were police stationed in An Zhuang, they knew they were prepared and planned to turn back. However, the An Zhuang water police team had already received the news and chased after them, firing shots. The bandits dared not fight and fled to Youwan (30 miles from Qingpu and 5 miles from An Zhuang). At that time, Zhu Changzhong, deputy commander of the Third District Security, had personally led the security troops to arrive. Gao Daoxing, the regimental commander of the Youth Army ×th Regiment, Xing Zuyuan, the deputy regimental commander, Zhang, the battalion commander of the ×th Battalion, and Zhu, the captain of the Qingpu Security Second Company, also led their troops to arrive. So a large encirclement of the bandits was carried out, and a fierce battle was launched in the triangle area of Nanyouwan, Beiyouwan, and Caowangxu. Xie Chengbing, the commissioner of the Third District, also arrived at that time and personally supervised the battle with the county chiefs of Song Qing. The bandits lay prone in the marshes and wetlands, resisting stubbornly. The battle lasted for six hours. The national army fired cannons, and the bandits began to collapse. By 2:50 p.m., they had all disintegrated. In addition to the 13 people who were killed on the spot, the remaining 44 people were captured. It is reported that Ding Xishan was also identified among the bandits killed. The bandit corpses and captured bandits will be transferred to Qingpu today. Commissioner Xie and Deputy Commander Zhu stayed overnight in Qing and discussed the disposal plan and continued clearance plan with the commanders of various troops all night. As for the weapons seized, they are still being investigated. It is said that three light machine guns and three Thomson guns have been confirmed.

However, at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, it was reported that another group of communist bandits was suddenly discovered in Dongshentanjing, Beiganshan, Qingpu County. They came from Tianma Mountain, Songjiang, with about fifty people, carrying eight light machine guns, and seemed to be moving towards Heshangjing. After hearing the news, the townships and towns near Beiganshan dispatched self-defense teams to search and block attacks in different areas. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the bandits forcibly requisitioned five civilian boats in Heshangjing and fled back to Tianma Mountain. According to the authorities' observation, the reason why the bandits urgently wanted to return by boat was because there were more large ports near Tianma Mountain, which made it easier to move. However, Xie Commissioner Liu County Chief, etc. ordered the troops from Youwan District to rush to pursue them last night, and it is expected that they will be completely annihilated today.

### Various Circles in Songjiang Actively Launch a Campaign to Comfort the Troops

In Songjiang County, the good news spread throughout the city at 3:30 p.m., and the people were all overjoyed. All circles in Songjiang launched a campaign to comfort the troops, presided over by Nong Peter, inspector of the Third District Office. As of now, 20 million yuan has been raised. Inspector Nong visited Xiong Kaiyu, the chief of staff, at 5:00 p.m. to contact him to reward the troops who have contributed to this bandit suppression.

According to Chief of Staff Xiong, we obtained intelligence about Ding's attempt to invade several months ago. All counties in Punan under the jurisdiction of the Third District conducted a major investigation in January, searching households one by one. At that time, many members of the bandit party who were hiding were arrested and sent to the respective county governments for rehabilitation. The fact that no local natives responded to the bandits' landing this time proves that Ding's old potential power in the Punan area has been eliminated and cannot play a role.

As for another bandit leader, Tang Jingfeng, leading more than a dozen remnant bandits, appeared once in Yanduntou, Punan, the day before yesterday. However, after the local self-defense teams and others went to search yesterday, they found nothing. Tang may have crossed the river to Pubei and joined the remnant bandits of Tianma Mountain at night, but it is currently impossible to confirm whether Tang is indeed among the remnant bandits of the Tianma Mountain group.

Patrolling and Guarding the Road

The Shanghai-Songjiang-Jiaxing section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway still dispatched traffic police and road police to patrol and guard all day yesterday to prevent scattered bandits from destroying the railway. The person in charge of He Song police affairs near Shihutang was stationed at Shihutang Station yesterday to guard against accidents because it was close to An Zhuang.

Three Suspects Arrested

Because the remaining criminals have not been suppressed, Songjiang City was still under martial law starting at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. The self-defense team of Cunren Township in Songjiang arrested a suspect yesterday. According to the confession: named Xu Mingfu, from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu. The traffic police machine gun company stationed at Xinzhuang Station also arrested two communist bandit suspects who attempted to buy tickets to Jiaxing the day before yesterday, and dry food was found on them.

### Ding Xishan, Who Was Rumored to Have Been Killed

Bandit leader Ding Xishan, a native of Zhuanghang, Fengxian, was a well-known bandit in the local area before the war. In 1936, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was released after the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan and participated in the guerrillas, active in Pudong and Punan. Later, he surrendered to the puppet government and served as the commander of the Puppet Provisional 13th Division, stationed in Songjiang. The area around Beiqiao and Punan was very powerful, and no one on both sides of the Pujiang River did not know his name. Later, he tried to defect again, but was discovered by the Japanese army, arrested and imprisoned. He was released on bail by Li Shiqun, a traitor, and transferred to the free area for training. A few months before the victory, he led his team to sneak into Fengxian. After the restoration and reorganization, Ding was incorporated into the traffic police team. Last summer, he was wanted by the Ministry of National Defense due to a case, so Ding secretly joined the bandits, gathered old troops, and went to the bandit area in Northern Jiangsu for training.

### National Salvation and Reconstruction Train Parade Today

The National Salvation and Reconstruction Train Parade of all circles in this city is scheduled to be held this afternoon. Dozens of units, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Garrison Command, the Municipal Police Bureau, and various industrial and commercial groups, participated in the train, and were all equipped with huge cartoons and wonderful arrangements. The Municipal National Salvation and Reconstruction Propaganda Corps, the Municipal Party Headquarters Propaganda Brigade, and the exiled student propaganda team will also participate in costume performances and speeches.

(3) The No. 3 Shelter on Jungong Road was originally a reception center for unemployed workers, so management is very difficult. In order to make all circles understand the inside story, it is planned to regularly invite people from all circles to visit the shelter on the spot.

### Municipal Councilors Report; Municipal Government Busy Sorting Out Proposals; Prisoners Secretly Report, Council Groups Clarify Position

[Report from this newspaper] Municipal councilors have been reporting to the secretariat of the council for the past few days to prepare to attend the fifth general assembly. As of yesterday, a total of 55 people had reported and seven proposals had been received. Regarding the issue of house rentals, no councilors have yet submitted proposals. According to the standards for house rentals, the municipal government should formulate them, and the council only has the right to decide. The municipal government is currently discussing various issues related to the case, and will submit them to the general assembly for resolution after they are sorted out. In addition, the new tax increase measures newly ordered by the Finance Bureau are also being sorted out, so that they can be submitted to the general assembly for discussion.

Regarding the prisoner's secret report on the inside story of Shanghai Prison, a Japanese speaker at the council stated: The Municipal Council usually receives many secret letters from citizens. The council should appeal for citizens, so after receiving such letters, they are forwarded to the relevant authorities for reference. It is not up to the council to ask whether the competent authorities handle them. As for publishing the news, the right rests with the council, so there is no question of responsibility, and there is no legal basis for questioning.

### The Case of Assaulting and Insulting the Mayor: Additional Suspects Apprehended; Fourteen Students Summoned Yesterday to Provide Testimony Regarding Qu Yuping

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the case of assaulting and insulting Mayor Wu during the student unrest at Tongji University, a key suspect, Sun Kezi, a student at Tongji University, has been apprehended.

### Fierce Battle on the Shores of Dianshan Lake: Bandit Gang from Wu County Crushed; Guns Seized, Eight Bandits Captured

[Report from this Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] A contingent of Communist bandits has been harassing the southwestern border of this county for days, attempting to infiltrate Chenmu. At 11 a.m. on the 18th, the Taihu Anti-Bandit Command's Su Kun Sub-District ordered a campaign to suppress them. Commander Peng Tong, leading the 2nd Company of the Youth Army, in coordination with the Baoan Teng Self-Defense Force, set out to search. They encountered the bandits on the shores of Dianshan Lake, where the counties of Wu, Wujiang, and Qingpu meet, and engaged in a fierce battle for four hours, forcing the bandits to retreat. In this battle, one machine gun, three Mauser pistols, and six rifles were seized, and eight bandits were captured. The bandits retreated towards the vicinity of the Zhexu market town in Wujiang County. The unit has telegraphed the Wujiang County government to intercept them. It is confirmed that the bandit unit is part of Ding Xishan's force. The bandit leader, Gu Fusheng, has approximately 300 men, carrying nine machine guns, fifty Mauser pistols, and over thirty rifles. Suzhou County Magistrate Wang Jiefo, responding to the urgent situation in Chenmu, personally went to oversee the defense and mobilized local militia forces for battle. Alarms are frequent, and the people are restless. Furthermore, it is reported that Wujiang County received an alarm on the 16th, stating that bandits were appearing to infiltrate, and immediately ordered a curfew. On the 17th, a platoon of the Youth Army arrived to reinforce the defense, and the curfew was lifted. Currently, the county's security police force is strengthening patrol efforts and maintaining strict vigilance.

### Wounded Nationalist Army Squad Leader Arrives in Qingpu; Crowds Flock to the Wharf to Express Sympathy

[Report from this Newspaper] An Pingya, 31 years old, from Lianshui, a squad leader (lance corporal) in the × Company, × Battalion, × Regiment of the Youth Army, who was wounded in the anti-bandit operation near Anzhuang, Qingpu, was immediately escorted to Qingpu by merchants and residents of Zhujiege via hired boat after being wounded yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the residents of Qingpu flocked to the wharf to express their sympathy. Despite his injuries, An frequently raised his hand in salute (see photo, taken by this newspaper) to show his gratitude. The Qingpu County government specially allocated 10 million yuan, and the Qinghu Motor Army Company also dispatched a large motor vehicle, with Liu Jingguo, a famous doctor from Qingpu, accompanying the vehicle to escort him to Shanghai for treatment. Although wounded, An's spirits are excellent. According to his interview with reporters: "The majority of the Communist bandits are wearing grey uniforms, with no insignia on their hats. After arriving at Anzhuang, their ranks were disorganized, their equipment was incomplete, and they abandoned backpacks and water bottles along the way, which proves that they have long lacked the will to fight. With a little encirclement and suppression, they can easily be completely annihilated." Currently, the hearts of the people in Qingpu city and various towns are calm, and they are living as usual. The garrison's strength is strong, and public safety is definitely not a problem.

### The Industrial and Mining Construction Promotion Association is Launching Reestablishment Efforts

### Rationed Sugar Continues to Be Sold, Price at 12,000 per Pound

[Report from this Newspaper] The Food Sugar Group of the Shanghai Commodity Price Evaluation Council held its 21st consultation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday, deciding that the 10th phase of rationed sugar would continue to be sold. The allocated price is 9,000 yuan per pound, plus 3,000 yuan for advertising, district security fees, and sugar certificate printing fees, resulting in a selling price of 12,000 yuan per pound. The original allocation was one catty per resident, but the Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar) requires more than 4.3 million catties of rationed sugar to be allocated each phase. The allocated price differs greatly from the market price, resulting in significant losses, so they requested that from the 10th phase, it be changed to half a catty per person. The small group hopes to maintain the allocation of one catty per person. The distribution quantity will be determined after the chairman of the Commodity Price Evaluation Council, Wu Kaixian, consults with the chairman of Taisugar, Mr. Wu, and then distribution can begin.

### Strict Enforcement of Rice Price Limits, No Exceeding 1,908,000; Economic Police Conducted City-Wide Inspections Yesterday; 10,000 Shi of Rice Still Being Released Daily

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the rise in rice prices in this city still had not been curbed. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 10,000 shi of rice at the North and South markets at the original price of 1,750,000 yuan. However, it was stipulated that each business firm be allocated 40 shi of rice, and each rice shop be allocated 5 shi of rice. Mayor Wu had previously discussed stabilization measures with rice merchants, restricting the price of rice sold in retail shops to a maximum of 1,908,000 yuan, and the price of freely purchased rice to a maximum of 1,980,000 yuan.

Representatives of the Rice Shop Guild of this city, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Xu Ziwen, Yin Fuxiang, and Ren Xianqun, representing the grain storage industry, totaling more than ten people, accompanied by Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 5 p.m. yesterday, detailing the difficult situation of the volatile rice market, requesting the municipal authorities to increase the amount of rice released to ensure sufficient distribution to all rice shops, and requesting an increase in the retail price of rice.

Rice Merchants' Requests Difficult to Accept

After meeting with the rice merchants, Mayor Wu told reporters: "The city government finds it difficult to accept the rice merchants' requests. According to the central government's decision, this city will implement full per capita grain allocation starting in March. Currently, the city government is still releasing 10,000 dan of rice daily. To meet the insufficient supply, rice shops must provide a rice quantity equal to their allocation to the market, but the price must not exceed 1,980,000 yuan (including legal profits). According to Mayor Wu, the price limits will be strictly enforced, and economic police have been dispatched since yesterday to conduct city-wide inspections. Those who sell rice exceeding the price limit will be severely punished."

Several Shops Found to Have Exceeded Price Limits

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Economic Police Bureau investigated and discovered eleven rice merchants who exceeded the price limits or sold inferior rice. They have been ordered to provide bail and assurance.

### Homicide Occurs on College Road: Body of an Ugly Woman Covered in Marks of Violence; Police Bureau Offers 10 Million Yuan Reward for Apprehension of Criminal

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau of the Nanshi District, based on a report from Police Officer Liu Wensheng of the Dalign Bridge Police Station, stated: "An unidentified female corpse was discovered outside the bamboo fence at the entrance of Alley 148, College Road, covered in a quilt stained with blood, suspected to be murdered." Upon receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Shen immediately ordered Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan to personally lead Inspector Fan and officers Wang Wenjie and others to the scene to investigate, and notified the Criminal Affairs Division of the General Bureau to send personnel to take photographs. An examination of the wrapped quilt revealed that it was tightly bound with two electric wires and a grass rope. Upon opening the quilt, the female corpse, over forty years old, with thick eyebrows and a sunken nose, and one gold tooth in her mouth, was found. She was very ugly. Her head and the right side of her cheeks were pierced with a knife, the flesh was blurred, the neck bone was exposed, her right arm was slashed four times, her right hand was cut off, and her finger flesh was tattered. She was wearing a purple-red wool shirt and vest, with a white cotton undershirt underneath. Her lower body was exposed, with a pink checkered silk trousers lying between her thighs. She wore a round gold earring on her left ear, but her right ear was slashed and tattered. Marks of violence were found on her arms and fingers, and her lower body was naked, leading to the conclusion that she was first raped and then killed, and that she had resisted at some point. Furthermore, as the corpse had not yet discolored, it can be determined that no more than ten hours have passed since the incident. The corpse was positioned with its head facing south and its feet facing north, indicating that the murderer dragged the corpse from the alley from south to north after the incident and moved it to that location. Traces on the ground have been obscured due to rain and crowds of people, making it difficult to discern. According to the officers handling the case, based on the above indications, it is undoubtedly a case of corpse relocation. Furthermore, given that the quilt was torn and scattered, it is speculated that the victim was not yet dead when the murderer abandoned the body, hence her vigorous struggle. However, inquiries with nearby residents have yielded no information. In the afternoon, two police dogs from the General Bureau were brought to the scene to sniff around in order to solve the case. The previous Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau has specially offered a reward of ten million yuan for the apprehension of the criminal.

### Perpetrator of Kidnapping Case in Changzhou Flees to Shanghai and is Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper] On the 31st of last month, Pan Shixian, a police officer of the Zhabei Police Sub-Bureau, reported that Han Huanda, residing at No. 8 Panjiawan, Zhabei, and Song Laowu, residing at No. 28 Furen Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, were behaving suspiciously. The two were apprehended and taken to the bureau for questioning. It was learned that Han and others had kidnapped Yue Shiying's only son, Guiquan (23 years old), a fishmonger, from his home in the tenth Jia of the ninth Bao, Furong Township, fifth district, Yuejiatang, outside the east gate of their hometown of Changzhou, on December 28th of last year. They hid the hostage in the Sangjing residence. About ten days later, they sent letters to his family, demanding 500 dan of white rice. Yue Guizhen, the victim's sister, negotiated with the abductors twice without success. The third time, Yue Shengbao, a member of the same clan, came forward to negotiate, and the result was an agreement on a ransom of 100 dan of white rice, which was equivalent to 70 million yuan in national currency at the time. It was agreed that after the money was paid, the hostage would be released. Unexpectedly, the news spread locally, and they fled to Shanghai, hiding in the aforementioned locations. Section Chief Shi ordered officer Wang Changsheng and others to travel to Changzhou to work with the criminal police team of the Wujin Police Bureau to send personnel to Yuejiatang. The victim's father and son, Mr. Yue, happened to be in Hangzhou on business and were not met. Only the hostage's mother, Yue Ding Qiaodi, was met. She said that her son had indeed been kidnapped and a huge sum of money had been given in return. The case has now been investigated and completed, and the Han criminals were transferred to the court for punishment yesterday.

### Europe

— Li Han-hun

Mother of Parliaments

With the kind arrangement of the embassy and the reception and guidance of specially appointed officials from the parliament, accompanied by Secretary Run Ming from the embassy, I visited this "Mother of Parliaments" of the world. Upon first arriving in London, I had long admired this magnificent building, standing tall on the banks of the River Thames, with its exquisite and intricate details, seemingly made of granite. Therefore, I paid special attention to observing it.

Upon entering the main gate, rows of stone statues stood on both sides, seemingly protecting the dignity and solemnity of the parliament. Further in, I saw a round, domed ceiling, imposing and grand. The figures of people from the three islands painted above were remarkably exquisite. The long corridors on the left and right were adorned with numerous murals, a feast for the eyes. In addition, there were many famous paintings and sculptures. The House of Lords was on the left, with red furnishings; the House of Commons was on the right, with green furnishings. The contrast between red and green symbolized the urgency and relaxation of time and space. The Anglo-Saxon people expressed the spirit of their democratic politics within this natural setting. Looking up at the hall, my mind felt broadened.

First, I visited the House of Commons. Because the original site was bombed and has not yet been repaired, the House of Lords' chamber is temporarily used as a meeting place. The Speaker's chair was at the top, with members sitting opposite each other on both sides. The government party was on the right, and the opposition party was on the left. It is commonly said that the opposition party is the left wing, and the meaning of this term originated here. Members without seats sat on the lower benches or stood. This simple and relaxed arrangement controls the democratic destiny of the great British Kingdom and sets an example for history, making one linger and reluctant to leave.

Next, I visited the House of Lords. Because the chamber was lent to the House of Commons, a not-so-grand hall was temporarily set up as a chamber. The Queen's seat was at the top. The throne was higher, and the Queen's seat was lower, which originated from the Victoria Queen, who was tall and majestic. This has remained unchanged, perhaps even more so than the adherence to ancestral rules in our country's dynasties. The Prince's seat was on the right, the Speaker's chair in front, and members' seats on both sides. The furnishings were very simple.

The debating chamber replaces the battlefield, and words replace bullets. Having been in battle for a long time, I can still appreciate the taste of the battlefield. It is a pity that I could not personally witness the spectacle of the Mother of Parliaments' spirited verbal duels. I felt a sense of regret. The guide, knowing that I had feelings about this, explained in detail the lively scenes of the parliament banging on tables and chairs and the House of Commons debating with the royal family. He also said that if the intense situation of the Chinese battlefield were moved to the parliament, the Chinese parliament would be even more lively than the British parliament. I remained silent.

I visited the libraries of both houses one after another and discovered that they contained the entire collection of The Times from 1700-odd years to the present, bound into giant volumes year by year, a spectacular sight. I deeply praised the importance of preserving its significance. All kinds of legal books were available. The British Parliament emphasized both facts and theories and valued both history and reality when enacting legislation. The Anglo-Saxon people are both thoughtful and practical, which can be seen in the richness of the parliamentary library collection and the precision of the legislation.

On both sides of the hall, there were paintings depicting Nelson and Wellington's fierce battles against Napoleon. History does not perish, and greatness lasts forever. Hundreds of years later, it still looks as vivid as life.

After visiting the various rooms, I saw a bronze plaque inscribed with "Innocent Man" inlaid on the ground in a certain hall on the lower level. According to the guide, in the past, an innocent man knelt and was questioned by the King. The result was that he was innocent. Later, this was cast at the kneeling trial site as a memorial. There were many such memorials. It is a subtle indication that culture does not perish, and truth does not perish.

Afterwards, I arrived at the spacious members' lounge behind. Below was the River Thames. To the left was the City Hall, and to the right was the hospital (a row of seven). Two long bridges were like the Golden Ao Jade Dong of Zhongnanhai in Beijing, with a magnificent view. Stepping out of the main gate, I looked up at the world's tallest square tower. The tower had a large clock with a long hand reaching 14 feet and a short hand of 9 feet. It was made in 1842. The clock keeps accurate time, with an annual difference of only one-third of a second. Before electric chains were used, it required two people to wind it for five hours each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The size of it can be imagined, which also adds to the splendor of the parliament.

Science Museum

Due to the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment, religious and feudal Europe was transformed into scientific and industrial Europe. This science and industry first blossomed and bore fruit in England, which had been peaceful and quiet, and had gradually led the royal family politics to the modern path of democracy without using bloody methods for hundreds of years. Due to the unrest in Europe, many European scientists in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries moved from the continent to England. Transforming scientific principles into practical science, machines were invented, and thus the industrial revolution took place in the British Isles in the 19th century. In order to seek the signs of the scientific principles and applications that liberated European civilization and saved the world from poverty, I invited Jufang and Zhaolun to visit the British Science Museum, the cradle of modern civilization.

The steam engine was the first tool to promote modern civilization. Visiting the steam engine invented in 1797, I imagined the greatness of modern power. Applying the steam engine to textiles made England the first most successful light industrial country. Applying the steam engine to transportation made trains and steamboats first appear in England. From light industry to heavy industry. By the mid-19th century, British light and heavy industries were already dominating the world. With the transportation industry as a medium, transporting the goods produced by light and heavy industries, the footprints of British merchants filled the world after the mid-19th century. Science sketched the outline of British science and industrial development. After the visit, it was like reading a history of scientific and industrial evolution.

In order to protect the development of commerce and industry, wars followed one after another. Taking airplanes as an example, it is not difficult to see the traces of their progress in the Science Museum. The museum displays a 1903 airplane, one of the first to be made. The gradual improvements of the 1907 and 1908 models, with the pilot's posture changing from lying down to standing up to turning forward, shows that the art of flying and manufacturing advanced together. Later, visiting the 1917 monoplane and the 1918 seaplane, as well as various models from later years, I realized that this industry is constantly changing and making continuous progress. It is no coincidence that today's giant aircraft soar through the universe, exploring and sightseeing without limits. Airplanes have their most important mission in the history of transportation and war. The exhibits in the museum have provided a very powerful explanation.

The discovery of uranium, the invention of atomic energy, and the development of other scientific principles are richly displayed in the museum with simple and concise explanations. Unfortunately, I am not a scientist and cannot easily understand its mysteries. The film describing the collision of atomic energy is not easy to see in the United States. Zhaolun, a chemical expert, was particularly interested in this.

It was the centennial of chemistry, and a special room was set up on the top floor of the museum for display. Seeing certain rays of light projected onto certain qualities and producing various special colors made me think of the colorful phenomena in movie musicals.

### Implementation of the Mass Organization Training Work in the Five Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi is Underway

[Report from Nanchang, This Newspaper, 16th] "Suppressing bandits is the first priority, military affairs are the first priority, and mass organization training should be coordinated with the needs of suppressing bandits and military affairs, assisting in preventing the Communist bandits from fleeing, thoroughly suppressing scattered bandits, and consolidating local security." This is the first principle of Minister Bai Chongxi's mass organization training in the bandit suppression plan for the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi. He attached particular importance to the issue of mass organization. When Bai first came to Jiujiang to plan military operations for suppressing bandits in the five provinces, he spoke to reporters in his office, "How to reduce Liu Bocheng's bandit army in the future," and emphasized Chairman Chiang's famous saying during the bandit suppression in the 20th year of the Republic of China: "Three parts military, seven parts politics." He believed that future bandit suppression must win the assistance of the masses, focusing on "political bandit suppression." Therefore, he advocated that mass organization training should be widespread, in-depth, rapid, and effective, ensuring that everyone is included in various organizations to receive training, and that everyone participates in the suppression of the rebellion. He should also take into account the people's lives in terms of time and space, making them happy to accept. Based on his past experience and understanding of mass organization training in Guangxi Province.

When the governors of the five provinces held a joint defense meeting in Nanjing, the implementation measures for mass organization training were drafted and decided by him personally. In the implementation program, he advocated that for mass organizations, the supervisory and executive agencies should dispatch personnel to participate in their internal work, depending on their nature and current needs, so that they can play a leading role invisibly. In terms of training, they should first start with the leaders and important assistants of each organization in order to set an example, and then carry out general training.

The Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense is now issuing the implementation program for mass organization training in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi in accordance with Bai's principles of mass organization training. Its content: (A) Organization, training, and use of mass self-defense forces, (B) Organization and training of the general public.

All able-bodied men of grades A and B in each district, township, and bao will be fully registered in the roster of the district, township, and bao self-defense forces. The standing team (those who have left production and are paid by the county and city) should be organized into at least one battalion (under the jurisdiction of three companies).

Self-Defense Force Cadres

In addition to appointing officers from the officers' corps transferred from various provinces, outstanding retired officers in the countryside should be employed as much as possible. In addition to the half of their monthly salary already issued by the state, they should be treated in accordance with the county level. Those who do not comply will have their state benefits canceled.

In addition to those owned by the counties and cities, all publicly owned and privately owned weapons in the townships and towns shall be registered and organized in their own counties and cities to defend the local area. The central government absolutely guarantees the private ownership of private guns by the people. Military and political organs shall not extract them for any reason or under any pretext, or reorganize them into provincial teams or national defense forces. If they are lost or damaged due to bandit suppression operations, the provincial government shall compensate them. The consumption of ammunition shall be reported with the shell casings, and the central government shall allocate them back. All weapons privately owned by the counties, cities, districts, townships, baos, and the people shall be registered and organized. Those who hide weapons and fail to report for registration, or who fail to obey the order to be organized, shall be confiscated by the county and city governments and punished as private possession of military fire.

Mass Self-Defense Force

The use within the county and city borders or within the administrative inspector's district shall be the principle. When necessary, the standing self-defense force may be dispatched by the security commander of each province or the commander of the pacification zone to the county and city borders of adjacent administrative inspector's districts to assist the army or the teams in adjacent districts to perform the tasks of defense, alert, and suppression. When transferred out of the county's territory, all supplies shall still be issued by the original county and city. If they fail to be supplied on time for any reason, the county and city governments of the place where they are located may lend them, and the county and city governments of their origin shall be responsible for allocating them back afterwards.

The standing team and the armed teams of the townships and towns shall focus on spiritual education, shooting training, combat exercises, engineering construction, field service, and marching. Various task teams shall be given technical training in accordance with their nature. However, the training time and location must take into account the convenience of the people's lives. The provincial (district) security command shall be responsible for planning and supervising this training. The pacification zone command, the garrison command of various places, the command of the various divisions and regiments, and the stationed army shall all have the responsibility to guide and assist.

The provinces shall first strengthen the organization and training of the people's self-defense forces in the counties and cities adjacent to the bandit areas and along the rivers and rivers, and in the mountainous triangular areas and border areas, and strengthen the defense works of the central city fortresses, river defenses, and important strongholds. All passages, ferries, and key points must be watched day and night in shifts to prevent the intrusion of bandit scouts and scattered bandits. (Reporter Liu Zao of this newspaper)

President Lin submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Education on the 17th. The deans of the school's five colleges and the deans of discipline all resigned to Lin because the students arbitrarily insulted their teachers. They are all back at work today.

(B) Schools applying to add grades must first prepare classrooms and desks and chairs. (C) When applying to add grades, you must pay attention to whether the original grades are full. (D) Rural schools cannot set up branch schools without authorization.

Rural schools should run at least one class, city schools should run two classes, and central schools should run three classes; each class should have no fewer than 45 people. (3) Central activities for this semester have already been stipulated. The main ones are the city-wide children's speech competition and the knowledge exhibition. Schools should prepare carefully.

In addition to one that has been allocated to a middle school, there are still three left. It is planned to draw lots by district as needed. (5) Each person has a food allocation certificate. If there are any cases of over-receiving or fraudulently receiving, in addition to being recovered and dismissed, they must also be sent to the court for strict handling. School principals should strictly check whether teachers have received extra allocation certificates due to part-time jobs. (6) The term system for teachers in municipal schools has been approved by the city government and is currently being submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. The current term for teachers is tentatively set at half a year for the initial appointment and one year for the renewal.

(B) After collecting the supplementary repair fees, a clear list must be submitted within one month. After use, the reimbursement must be processed in the following month, and delays are absolutely not allowed.

(3) Suburban students from poor families can apply to the Shanghai Poor Student Scholarship Review Committee for book fees of 150,000 yuan per person, with a quota of 3,000 people. (4) The municipal school teacher welfare fund has been delayed due to the successive submission of application forms by the schools and the procedures for total calculation and review. We are very sorry, but it can be issued within the team period.

Section Chief Huang of the Production and Allocation Department of the Education Bureau reported the reasons for the delay in the issuance of temporary fees, due to the limitations of legal procedures. He hoped that the staff members of the schools would contact the department more to reduce estrangement and improve work efficiency. Finally, the principals temporarily raised various questions, which Director Li and Director Zhu answered separately. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.

The Education Bureau has sent supervisors to the schools to conduct on-site investigations to determine the issue of increasing fees.

### Joint Reserve Association of Silver and Money Shops Holds Second Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The second standing committee meeting of the general assembly of member shops of the Shanghai Joint Reserve Association of Silver and Money Shops was held at the Bankers' Club at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than 130 member representatives attended. The meeting was presided over by Li Fuxun, chairman of the executive committee of the association, and adjourned at 3:45 PM.

The chairman first summarized the association's affairs. The association has been preparing for its establishment since July 35 [1946], and there have been many twists and turns in its affairs over the past eighteen months. The highest amount of intra-bank lending for the entire year of 36 [1947] was 890 million in October. The principle was not to provide operating funds. Lending was based on treasury bills and limited to one day, with a maximum of three renewals. The total amount of lending for the whole year reached 22,368.4 million yuan. The total amount of expenses shared for the whole year was 976,850,183 yuan. The total amount of prepared assets at the end of the year 36 [1947] was 3,189.1 million yuan. The total amount of treasury bills was 2,232.3 million yuan. However, the association's treasury bill quota was adjusted from 10.5 billion to 22.3 billion in the first half of the year 36 [1947], and has not been adjusted since. Under the circumstances of rising prices and increasing deposits, the association felt that it was not able to compete effectively.

The discussion then began on (A) passing the final accounts for the upper and lower periods of 36 [1947], (B) passing the executive committee's proposal for member shops to freely subscribe to funds, a total of five items: (1) Within 1% of the total deposit amount, each member shop can freely subscribe, without restrictions, as the association's second fund. (2) The association will issue safekeeping receipts for the second fund, which can be included in the amount of treasury bills to be used. In case of exchange differences, they can be used to borrow from the association. (3) When the second fund is not lent out, interest will be calculated monthly at a rate of 1.2% per annum, according to the central bank's interbank fixed deposit rate. The interest will be credited to the original depositing shop. When borrowing, interest will not be calculated on deposits, but will be calculated on the loan, and will not be included in the monthly lending report.

(4) When the second fund is lent out, it will be calculated at the interbank lending rate. Three-quarters of the amount exceeding the interest rate in Article 3 will be paid to the depositing shop on a pro rata basis, and one-quarter will be retained by the association as a handling fee to cover expenses. (5) The second fund will be collected by the end of March this year, and the association will report the total amount subscribed by members to all members. Finally, Article 25 of Chapter 7 of the amended articles of association was passed.

### Non-Trading Stimulation Causes Buying Spree; Chinese Stocks Show Prosperous Trend at Closing

Yesterday, Chinese stocks received strong non-trading stimulation, with securities brokers and cloth merchants resuming buying. Although banks were selling, they continued to move upward gradually. Yongye and Huafeng rose to the limit, and the trend at the closing was very prosperous.

At the beginning of the morning, news of US loans and environmental factors encouraged selling, and the market opened weak. Yongsai entered the market at 805 yuan and 801 yuan, showing an inverted trend. After the opening, No. 224 and other numbers were sold for immediate delivery, while No. 65 and other numbers were sold for deferred delivery, and immediately fell to 789 yuan and 790 yuan. No. 73 and other numbers were bought for immediate delivery, and No. 183 and others also bought for deferred delivery, rising back to 803 yuan and 805 yuan. No. 36 and other numbers sold off for immediate delivery, while No. 89 and others still sold for deferred delivery, falling again to 792 yuan and 794 yuan. No. 13 and other numbers bought for immediate delivery; No. 97 and other numbers bought for deferred delivery, and the outside interest rate fell as low as 22.5 cents and 27 cents, rising back to 818 yuan and 816 yuan. No. 69 and other numbers were still sold for immediate delivery, while No. 207 still offered for deferred delivery, falling to 807 yuan and 810 yuan, but because non-trading market prices such as cloth were very prosperous and money supply was very loose, Yongsai for deferred delivery showed an inverted trend. No. 157 and other numbers bought for immediate delivery, and No. 8 and other numbers bought for deferred delivery, rising to a high price of 830 yuan and 831 yuan near noon. The noon closing price was 824 yuan and 826 yuan. Among the small stocks that rebounded, Jingfu was the most prosperous. Compared with the previous closing price, stocks for immediate delivery such as Yongsai, Xinyue, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Zhongsai, and Huafeng rose slightly. Shangwu, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Shangping were flat, and the rest fell slightly. Stocks for deferred delivery such as Yongsai, Xinyue, and Huafeng rose slightly, Qinxing and Shangping were flat, and the rest fell slightly.

In the afternoon, deferred delivery was suspended as usual, and Yongsai for immediate delivery started from 85 yuan. Although No. 20 and other numbers sold off, No. 224 and other numbers bought up to 849 yuan. No. 181 and other numbers sold off, falling back to 838 yuan. Buying from foreign stocks and cloth was very strong, and market sentiment was still prosperous. No. 31 and other numbers bought up to 852 yuan. The National Bank bought a lot, and No. 156 and other numbers sold back down to 840 yuan. No. 157 and other numbers bought up to 850 yuan at the closing. Huafeng rose to the limit, and Yongye also approached the limit. As a result, compared with the morning closing, Huafeng and Yongye stocks for immediate delivery rose to the limit, Rongfeng rose less than 10%, Yongsai, Xinyue, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhabei, and Shangwu each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. The market prices of various unlisted stocks outside the market were stable and even.

### Unified Bonds Advance; Foreign Stocks Rise

Yesterday, government bonds advanced despite instability. Unified Bond C opened at 89,000, first saw 75,000, then rose to a high price of 90,000 yuan, and then ended in a range-bound market, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Group A, B, and C each rose by 2,000 yuan, and Group Ding and Wu each rose by 5,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the buying spree for foreign stocks expanded. The contraction of Hong Kong Electric caused hot stocks to reach new highs. Securities brokers sold, while Guangzhou brokers and foreign firms bought. Yisha opened at 660,000 in the morning and gradually rose to around 740,000 yuan at the closing. The afternoon was especially tight. Compared with the previous closing price, Hong Kong Telephone was flat, while Yisha, Yinglian, Yipie, Shipping, and Yueguang each rose by about 10%. Zengde, Non-Paper Edition, and Gangye each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.

### Rice Prices Reach New Highs; Social Bureau's Reduced Rice Sales Insufficient for Retail

Although rice prices are under the close watch of the Economic Police, the rising trend continues to evolve, reaching new highs. The Social Bureau continues to sell in the north and south markets separately. The amount allocated to each merchant has been reduced to 40 dan, and the amount allocated to rice shops has been reduced to 5 dan. This small amount is not enough to meet retail sales, and market sentiment remains strong. Moreover, the rainy weather has not stopped, and the amount of goods arriving is very small. The initial market price outside the market once rose to 2.15 million, and the price of thin rice once reached 2.1 million (not high-quality goods). Later, it was heard that the authorities restricted retail sales to no more than 1.98 million, and the black market for rice became difficult, so it became soft. White japonica rice returned to 2.1 million, and thin rice and Yangxian rice fell to 2.05 million, but still 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Yesterday, the total amount of goods arriving in the two markets, including allocated rice, was 13,206 dan.

Flour

The price of flour fell sharply and rapidly, and market conditions fluctuated greatly, indicating a strong speculative atmosphere. Initially, due to the rise in rice prices and the rise in wheat prices to 1,182,000 yuan, the rising trend spread. The opening price of Lao Che flour was 940,000, the opening price of Bingchuan flour was 920,000, and major brokers sold at high prices, and the market went straight down. The closing price of Lao Che flour was 890,000, the closing price of Bingchuan flour was 870,000, and the closing price of Hong Feng flour was 860,000. Except for Lao Che flour, which rose by 5,000, the rest were flat. The price of bran rebounded, with large bran at 520,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains Prices rose and fell unevenly. Soybeans tended to soften, and corn rose steadily, jumping 200,000 yuan. Red beans rose by more than 100,000 yuan. Sesame was scarce, and sellers pushed up prices. Mung beans were bought by Qingdao brokers and local brokers, and the price rose rapidly by more than 100,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil Turned flat. Soybean oil rose again at the closing. Yesterday's opening price was still very weak. Because the second phase of household oil was about to begin, local brokers were very lax, and because the rising trend of soybeans had weakened slightly, market sentiment had turned weak. Soybean cake was flat and weak, and trading was inactive.

### Tea Market Firm

Since the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, all industries have resumed normal operations. However, the tea market remains quiet, with the export tea price being higher domestically than internationally. As for domestic flower teas, the sales of local and guest brokers remain the same, and buying interest is still growing strongly. However, sellers insist that production and inventory are empty, and are stimulated by the rising prices of all goods. Therefore, the mentality is getting better and prices are rising aggressively. Until the closing, the market prices soared, but the negotiations between the two parties were difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion, so there was no trading success.

### The Problem of Taiwan Sugar Exports to Japan Resolved

Allied Headquarters Dispatches Ships to Kaohsiung for Loading

The long-pending issue of exporting Taiwan sugar to Japan has recently been resolved. It is reported that Allied Headquarters has officially telegraphed the Central Trust of China in Taiwan and dispatched the Japanese ship "Nissho Maru" directly to Kaohsiung on the 14th. It is expected to arrive on the 18th and load 5,000 to 6,000 tons of Taiwan sugar for return to Japan.

This shipment of Taiwan sugar to Japan is the largest since the victory and the first batch of the total of 25,000 tons contracted by the Central Trust Bureau with Allied Headquarters in March of last year at a price of US$200 per ton. It is also learned that all shipments can be completed before the end of May. The reasons for the delay in loading were firstly, the gradual decline in world sugar prices after the contract was signed, which led Allied Headquarters to take a wait-and-see attitude. Secondly, the Chinese Shipowners' Association, in order to maintain navigation rights, once opposed the use of Japanese ships for transport. However, based on the contract's stipulation of (F.O.B.) delivery at Taiwan docks, a compromise had to be adopted.

### Shanghai Trust Company Adds Xinjiang Remittance Services

Xinjiang Province, located in a remote border region, has historically been isolated from the mainland due to geographical and other environmental limitations. Since the government began promoting its development, the region's commerce has gradually flourished. However, this city lacks commercial financial institutions to facilitate the exchange of funds with the region. It is now learned that the Shanghai Trust Company, in order to cooperate with national policy and invigorate the economies of both regions, will begin offering Xinjiang Province remittance services effective immediately.

### Ministry Orders Relaxation of Limits on Gold and Cash Carried by Returning Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 18th] The Xiamen Customs has recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to relax the limits on gold and cash carried by returning overseas Chinese. The limit for gold is set at 10 taels (customs weight) per person, and the limit for foreign currency is set at US$100 per person or the equivalent in other foreign currencies. Amounts exceeding these limits must be registered with customs and exchanged for national currency at the market rate at the Central Bank on the day of entry. For transit passengers, any amount exceeding the limit may be declared and registered with customs upon entry and held in custody by customs, to be reclaimed upon departure within six months with a custody certificate and proof of departure. If the deadline is exceeded, customs will send the excess amount to the Central Bank for exchange into national currency at the market rate, which will be returned upon presentation of the custody certificate.

### Rayon Continues to Rise, Mills Manage to Hold Steady

Yesterday's rayon market opened flat but rose sharply, ending the day RMB 7 million higher than the previous day. No. 120 Asahi and Golden Three Horses bright rayon opened at RMB 98 million in the morning. As silk mills were about to resume operations, actual sales showed a slight improvement, and asking prices frequently rose. The market closed at RMB 100.15 million at noon. The afternoon saw further gains, with a closing asking price of RMB 6 million being offered, but the off-exchange price fell to RMB 5 million. Tianqiao and Toyo followed suit with ups and downs.

The mill market was firm and steady yesterday, with twenty to thirty bales changing hands. Grade C opened with fifteen bales, priced at RMB 100.3 million. Higher spot prices were at RMB 98 million, and forward prices were at RMB 100 million, with over ten bales traded. Qianjing rayon was relatively sluggish, and there were no transactions yesterday, but the market was generally stable.

### Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Adjusted Again, 20-count Yarn Rises Another RMB 2 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee again adjusted the negotiated cotton yarn prices yesterday. The new price for 20-count yarn is RMB 42 million, an increase of RMB 2 million, or 5%. The committee continued to entrust the China Textile Construction Corporation to open for sale 18 kinds of yarn at the Yarn Trade Association yesterday, selling approximately 2,000 bales in total. The prices and purchase permits will be revealed this morning.

The China Textile Construction Corporation also opened for sale 15 kinds of yarn as usual yesterday, selling 1,177 bales, equivalent to 2,093 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 427 applications.

Cotton Yarn Prices Soar

In other news, despite the supply offered by the China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tight restrictions placed on applications from fellow traders, leading to a shortage of available yarn. Furthermore, it was heard that Qingdao yarn prices had soared, and a major dealer from the Guangdong faction seized the opportunity to profit, tightening credit conditions in the market both overtly and covertly. Outside buying pressure remained strong, and actual sales to both local and outside customers were brisk. Demand exceeded supply, and the market saw a uniform surge in prices.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped RMB 2.8 million at the opening, reaching RMB 72 million. Asking prices rose even higher, reaching a peak of RMB 78.5 million. Although the China Textile Construction Corporation offered additional supply near the close, the market remained bullish due to high confidence. The market then saw a slight pullback as traders from the Taiwan faction took profits, but the market still closed at RMB 78.2 million, a significant increase of RMB 8 million from the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise, ranging from RMB 2 million to RMB 6-7 million, but most have increased by 20% to 40% compared to the end of the lunar year.

Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with reports of potential US loans, causing some market participants to waver and smaller traders to sell out of fear, softening the market. However, traders from the Hankou and Northern factions seized the opportunity to buy aggressively, and the Xi'an faction also came in to absorb supply. Dyeing factories, due to brisk actual sales of raw cloth and Shilin cloth, and with raw material yarn prices soaring and the China Textile Construction Corporation not increasing the allocated quantity (with each household only receiving twenty-odd bolts of high-quality cloth in the last period, and prices also high), resulted in twelve-pound high-quality and other fine cloths continuing to rise by RMB 85,000 to RMB 100,000. The markets for other fabrics, such as four-gentlemen serge, straight tribute, bleached cloth, twill cloth, and Shilin cloth, also advanced uniformly, by around RMB 50,000 to RMB 100,000.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw remarkably high confidence. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere became even more brisk due to soaring cotton yarn prices. Many smaller players sold at high prices, and trading was active. Prices across all grades rose in unison, increasing by RMB 700,000 to RMB 1 million. 710 bales were traded. Factory delivery prices for Han fine cotton opened at RMB 7.936 million, warehouse delivery prices for Han fine cotton opened at RMB 7.605 million to RMB 7.84 million, Han coarse cotton at RMB 6.448 million, Shashi cotton at RMB 8.39 million to RMB 8.66 million, Tuolisi cotton at RMB 8.267 million, Zhangde cotton at RMB 7.853 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at RMB 1.82 million, up RMB 120,000.

Silk Yarn and Textiles Rise Across the Board

Silk yarn and finished textile products such as down yarn, lining silk, floral cloth, rainproof cloth, white canvas, hemp-rubber cloth, French lining, and gray soft lining all rose yesterday. This was because the prices of raw silk and yarn soared, pushing up costs, and manufacturers raised prices firmly, resulting in uniform increases. Over 200 bolts of silk-gloss down yarn were traded yesterday, with No. 1 priced at RMB 95,000 per yard, No. 2 at RMB 82,500, No. 3 at RMB 70,000, and No. 4 at RMB 64,000. Lining silk sold for RMB 90,000 to RMB 140,000, and French lining for RMB 38,000 to RMB 50,000.

### Government Decides to Compulsorily Purchase Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

[Report from Our Newspaper] The government has decided to compulsorily purchase materials related to national defense from goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, according to the relevant decrees. The Central Trust Bureau is responsible for handling this matter. The bureau is scheduled to convene a review meeting today to discuss the detailed rules for the purchase. After this compulsory purchase, the materials will be allocated to the Ministry of National Defense, unlike in the past when they were sold to merchants. The markup for the purchase will be reduced to 15%. As for the procedures for allocating and selling Western medicine, it has also been decided that within one month, the originally applying importers will resell to the Ministry of National Defense.

### The Quantity of Salt for Export is Yet to be Decided

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Central Trust Bureau's barter trade with Japan, edible salt has traditionally been a major export item. This year, the bureau had planned to ship salt to Japan early, but according to the Salt Administration, the situation in North China is unstable, transportation is not smooth, and the output and transportation from various production areas cannot be predicted. Therefore, the quantity of salt for export cannot be determined at this time. The quantity requested by the Central Trust Bureau will also need to be approved at a later date.

### Import Control Committee Hosts Press Briefing, Explains Quotas for Two Seasons

[Report from Our Newspaper] The import quotas for the fourth and fifth seasons have been reviewed by the National Economic Commission and approved by the Executive Yuan on the 17th. The Import Control Committee has received the order from the Yuan and scheduled a press briefing this afternoon at 3:00 PM to explain the details. The total amount for the two seasons is US$74.72 million, averaging over US$37 million per season, which is about 30% lower than the fourth season. However, items such as fertilizers, coal, rice, and wheat are not included and will be approved at any time as needed. The cotton quota has not been included since the fourth season. If the import figures for the above goods are added, the total amount is not less than that of the fourth season. Among the allocated foreign exchange quotas, oil ranks first.

### Interbank Deposit Monthly Interest Rate Increased to 1.5 Fen

### Prosperity or Destruction

— Yang Shi

— After Reading [Atomic Energy, the Universe, and Life]

By G. Gamow, Translated by Chen Zhongjie and Shu Chongze, Published by Commercial Press

Once upon a time, there was a pessimistic philosopher who wrote a story: A omnipotent master designed a beautiful and complete garden and gave it to a group of children to play in. At first, they were well-behaved, wholeheartedly enjoying and appreciating it. Gradually, they began to quarrel, and then attempted to use many means to rob and occupy each other, forgetting the joy of enjoyment. All day long, they screamed, fought, and exhausted every means to attack each other, until they discovered fire, a terrible weapon. In one of their conflicts, they set fire to each other, ultimately destroying this magnificent garden and ending the lives of these restless beings. This is a fable, and telling it today has an extremely profound meaning. Since humans began to struggle, they controlled water, then tamed fire, step by step venturing into the mysteries of the universe, and finally grasping the source of all this energy – atomic energy. This is a great discovery, bringing both good news and bad news to humanity. Prosperity or destruction; two paths are clearly laid out for humanity to quickly choose using their wisdom.

The industrial revolution brought new impetus to mankind, and also brought new encounters. The rapid development left some social scientists unable to address these new encounters in time. Overproduction, labor issues, colonial issues; a series of unpleasant events followed one another for the better part of a century. Today, this terrible thing has come again. Social scientists cannot keep pace with natural scientists. When hatred, quarrels, and wars are spreading everywhere, they bring something containing danger. With the slightest mistake, it is a great fire that can burn this magnificent garden to utter destruction. Politicians must run quickly, because the distance between you and the scientists is too great.

People often use the phrase "atomic age," but what kind of age is this? What is its core meaning? We believe that most people's concepts are very vague, especially in China, where science is still lagging behind, and understanding of it is even more pitiful. Therefore, we specially introduce a book discussing all issues related to atomic energy to readers. As the author said in his preface: "This book will provide a complete and coherent description of the atomic energy issue and will answer the questions: What is it? Where does it come from? And how can it be used wisely?" The author, G. Gamow, is a physics professor at the University of Washington. His outstanding achievements in nuclear physics qualify him to discuss these issues. Moreover, Professor Gamow is quite humorous. When discussing many solemn and profound issues, he always loves to use extremely vivid examples to make metaphors, greatly helping you in your understanding. And those interesting illustrations make a deeper impression on you. Recently, there have been quite a few books introduced in China on issues such as atomic energy, but most fall into two categories. One category is purely academic discussions, which, except for a few people with an excellent foundation in modern physics, most people dare not touch. The other category is irresponsible nonsense, which will only confuse your concepts after reading. This is the first book that uses a very cordial tone by an authoritative scholar to discuss this issue. He presented the greatness and danger of atomic energy to people, pointed out two paths for readers to choose—prosperity and destruction—and also built his grand vision.

From the discovery by French physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896 that a piece of uranium ore placed in a drawer could darken a nearby package of dry photographic plates, he has always talked about the atomic bomb explosion in Japan, and then further depicts a beautiful vision of how people will use the great energy to improve their lives; A rocket launcher stores one hundred pounds of fuel, going to the moon and other planets. But he says there is a premise; scientists all over the world must cooperate and concentrate their efforts to promote development, and politicians must cooperate to eliminate wars and transfer the efforts engaged in atomic bomb manufacturing competition to atomic energy utilization.

The whole book is divided into three major chapters. The first chapter answers what atomic energy is. Professor Gamow starts with basic chemistry and uses new principles to explain many chemical changes we already know; and reveals all the internal secrets of the atomic nucleus. In our chemical elements, except for silver, all others are restless, so-called in a "metastable state." As long as there is an appropriate object to impact, nuclear fission and fusion will occur, and this occurrence is accompanied by huge energy. Therefore, Professor Gamow issued a warning: "We are actually living in an unpredictable powder keg, where all the substances, whether a glass of water or a piece of bread, are equipped with terrible amounts of energy, waiting for the opportunity to be released."

All the energy on Earth comes from the sun's radiation, but where does the sun's energy come from? It turns out that this is also atomic energy. Using this new theory, many astronomical problems can be answered, and even the theory of the origin of the universe can be found. The last chapter is also the most important chapter. In addition to telling how the atomic bomb has great destructive power, the author predicts that future atomic bombs will be even more destructive. An atomic bomb thrown into the sea can throw warships thousands of feet into the air, destroying each other. However, if atomic energy is used to serve mankind, it will be a more powerful servant. Finally, he appealed to mankind in a tone of prayer, "We are born in the most proud era, but our responsibilities are too great. The prosperity and complete destruction of mankind are all in our hands. Use the highest wisdom?"……『We hope that the best major success of atomic energy will be planetary exploration, not human destruction.』

### Reading [Dongfang Bai]

— Yang Tongfang

—Report of the American Educational Mission to Japan—

Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, First Edition by Commercial Press, November 1947

Since Japan's defeat, the Allied Powers, in addition to military occupation and disarming them, have also assisted the newly emerging Japan in its efforts to reform in politics, economy, education, and culture, hoping that a democratic Japan can be established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for maintaining world peace. In particular, the reform of Japanese education is of great concern to peace-loving people. Education is the foundation of a democratic society and is closely related to the entire nation-state and even the world. All enlightened people should know that the growth of Japanese militarist ideology is closely related to the military-national education they implemented in the past. In a sense, Japan's past education can be said to have been "successful," and that success is manifested in their various forms of aggression, in the so-called "building a new order in East Asia" and "establishing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." If we want to thoroughly eliminate Japan's narrow militarist ideology of the past and eradicate their narrow feudal consciousness and aggressive concepts, it is not enough to simply disarm them. The most important thing is to rebuild the Japanese education system to cleanse all cultural toxins that endanger humanity.

In the year after General MacArthur garrisoned Japan, in order to reform Japanese education, he requested the US military department to ask the State Department to send more than 20 educational experts to Japan for on-site investigation. After repeated observation and consideration by experts, the "Report of the American Educational Mission to Japan" put forward many valuable opinions on the reform of Japanese education. Professor Zheng Xiaocang translated it into Chinese and titled it "Dongfang Bai" (Eastern White). From this book, we seem to see the dawn of a new civilization in East Asia gradually emerging.

This report is likely to have a great impact on Japanese education, culture, and political thought. The theoretical part can not only serve as a reference for the implementation of Japanese education, but also inspire the path of educational research. China and Japan have the closest relationship, and China has suffered the greatest trial in this war. While caressing the painful experience, we cannot but be concerned about their educational reforms. Since China is in the ranks of the Allied Powers, it naturally has the task of eliminating their militarist ideas, so we have to pay attention to the points on Japanese education reform suggested by our allies. In addition, American educational theories and methods still dominate the world. China's past education system has been greatly influenced by the United States. After the war, the relationship between China and the United States became closer and closer, and it is necessary to promote the exchange of education, culture, and thought between the two countries. From this report, we can also see the American education system and its fundamental spirit, and we can also see a concise explanation of American education.

The report is divided into six chapters, emphasizing both facts and opinions. The first chapter, "The Purpose and Content of Japanese Education," elaborates on the defects of Japanese education in the past. The excessive concentration of educational administrative power has made Japanese education tend towards nationalism and militarism, and it is monopolized by bureaucratic politicians. If we want to reform the current Japanese education, we must give teachers the greatest freedom. Knowledge education should be re-evaluated for its value, the curriculum should not only be a fixed knowledge, teaching should not only be limited to the designated textbooks, and rigid examinations can never measure all the activities of a student's physical and mental development. Students have different personalities and talents, and it is important not to neglect teaching students according to their aptitude. The "self-cultivation" course tends to foster obedience and must be infiltrated with the qualities of a free life to cultivate democratic ideals and egalitarian concepts among children and young people. Broad moral training should be carried out in school activities containing democratic ideas. The myths in history and geography textbooks should be deleted, and local teaching materials should be used more in primary schools; senior schools should promote objective research in various ways. Teaching should not be forced to accept, but should cultivate students' reading attitude of careful questioning and clear discernment. The book also makes recommendations for the promotion of health education and physical education courses. It also mentions the scientific and artistic nature of vocational education; and the need to give play to the creative spirit of "social research" teaching.

The second chapter, "Writing Reform," contains many insightful studies by the mission, which believes that the reform movement of Japanese writing has reached its time. The members of the mission suggest using the Roman alphabet phonetic spelling method, but it needs to be researched and reformed in a planned manner. They advocate the establishment of a language committee, which will be responsible for liaison and research on writing reform during the transition period, and to formulate plans to introduce the Roman alphabet phonetic system into schools and gradually promote it in society. In addition, Japanese spoken language is more complex and should be simplified.

The third chapter, "Educational Facilities in the Elementary and Secondary Stages," suggests the reform of school administration in view of the spirit of democratic education. The change should be from centralized power to decentralized power, and educational management institutions should be established at the municipal and prefectural levels, and personnel should be elected by the people. These institutions should have the power to supervise schools, examine teachers, and compile textbooks. These powers were previously managed by the Ministry of Education. In the future, the Ministry of Education can be in a guiding and auxiliary position and does not need to directly control local education. Compulsory education should be increased to nine years, for boys and girls up to the age of sixteen, and tuition should be free. The first six years are primary school, and the next three years are junior high school. Junior high school provides general education and is available to everyone. The curriculum must be flexible and take into account vocational preparation. The above should be a three-year high school, free of tuition, and must be co-educational. Private schools should still enjoy the freedom they deserve as long as they meet the minimum standards.

The fourth chapter, "Education and Teacher Education," gives Japanese educators a new ideal. In the past, teaching methods focused on memory, obedience, and the ideas of the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues, which should be changed. In the future, students' independent thinking, personality development, and understanding of the rights and obligations of democratic citizens should be encouraged. Moral teaching is mainly based on precepts and maxims, which is bound to be ineffective and must be based on experience gained from the specific context of schools and society. The mission hopes that all current teachers will be able to obtain "re-education" opportunities. Normal schools should be reformed to enable future teachers to implement the ideals of democracy. They believe that the current pre-education course for normal schools should be abolished, the purpose is nothing more than to improve the level and strengthen professional training. The professional education of school administrators and supervisors is as important as that of teachers. Universities and other senior schools should provide teachers and administrative personnel with various opportunities for in-depth research.

The fifth chapter, "Adult Education," emphasizes the importance of adult education in the new Japan. It advocates that schools at all levels should be open to the general public. In addition, central libraries and their branches should be set up in large cities, and such facilities should also be available in each prefecture. If the Ministry of Education can set up a public library management department, it can expand the effectiveness of adult education. The educational effect of museums of science, art, and industry is the same as that of libraries. As for various local or professional societies, labor groups, and political groups, they can also be made to exert educational power and educate the broad masses of the people.

The sixth chapter, "Higher Education," expounds the cultural and social significance of higher education. Universities and colleges should enrich their content and provide students with the convenience of studying natural, social, artistic, and humanistic subjects, and promote a free atmosphere of academic and thought. In the past, Japanese higher education was only the privilege of a few people, and this malady should be corrected in the future. The members of the mission advocate that higher education should be allowed to develop freely without being overly controlled, at most supervised and assisted. Assistance should be given to young men and women with talent but without the ability to enter school. It is also suggested to expand libraries and other research equipment and research institutes. In order to establish academic freedom and economic security for professors, it is advocated to abolish the current civil service system.

Although the content described in this report is a plan to reform Japanese education, it has actually implemented the new ideals of democratic politics and the new views of liberalism. The American education experts' in-depth analysis of the Japanese educational tradition can certainly give us a reference for educational research; and their insightful suggestions better express the lofty ideals of democratic education and the true spirit of free thought. We should appreciate these words of General MacArthur: "The educational reform implemented by the Japanese people will eventually enable them to deeply understand the place of a country in the world, and it will promote world peace and protect various human rights." Yes, for defeated Japan, for the Japan that is being restored, their people should be educated with a sound outlook on life, society, and the world. Undoubtedly, the entire educational foundation must be placed on democracy. This is the main trend of American educational thought, the trend of the educational culture of the emerging Japan, and the ultimate goal of world educational ideals. Many experts here have pointed out that the focus of Japanese education reform is on freedom of thought and equal educational opportunities, which happens to be a new path for education that is a new path from militarism. China, which is beginning to implement a constitution, should naturally also draw some ideals of democratic education. Looking at this report with such an eye, it should not be of no help to oneself, right?

### "Pride and Prejudice"

— Shi Bei

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen

"Pride and Prejudice" is a timeless English novel that has been popular in our country for a long time.

The author, Austen, is a writer famous for depicting everyday family life. She was born in 1775 in Hampshire, England. Her father was a local church pastor, and her mother was the niece of a famous satirist. Austen had seven siblings. Throughout her life, she never left her warm and lively family, remaining unmarried and living a peaceful life at home with her family. After finishing trivial household chores or during after-meal breaks, she would write, and the content of her works was almost entirely based on family life. In 1797, at the young age of twenty-two, she wrote "Pride and Prejudice," but it was not published until fourteen years later. She has several other well-known novels, but "Pride and Prejudice" is her most famous representative work.

Austen was not widely recognized during her lifetime, but after her death in 1817, she was greatly praised by writers and readers. Literary critic G.H. Lewes said, "Austen's purpose is to express social life, and she does it just right." Essayist Macaulay said, "She is closer to Shakespeare than any other writer." Walter Scott said, "Her vivid descriptions and genuine emotions make ordinary and trivial matters and ordinary characters very interesting. I myself cannot catch up with her." From these comments, we can already understand the value of Austen's works.

The story of "Pride and Prejudice" depicts the daily life of the Bennet family, a rural gentleman's family, and the love and marriage of his two daughters and two young men who moved from England to the countryside to stay. The story is so meaningful and realistic; the things happening in the Longbourn estate seem like they just happened in our own homes yesterday. We can see it anytime, or we often hear family members talking about such things in family conversations. The author writes every character's actions, habits, and speech without any exaggeration or excessive embellishment. When we read this book, we feel like we are part of the Bennet family or friends of Darcy, closely connected with them. This is the author's greatest success.

Darcy, the male protagonist in the book, is from a noble family. He values the concept of noble lineage. His family has an annual income of ten thousand pounds, and he is accustomed to the bustling life of the city. In his character, a kind of arrogance naturally appears, and his face often reveals a solemn attitude of looking down on others. He is most intolerant of the vulgarity and crudeness often found in the lower classes. However, he also has his merits, as he is happy to help those who have the same status as him. The female protagonist, Elizabeth, is the daughter of a country gentleman, with the natural temperament of the countryside. However, she is intelligent and quick-witted. Although she cannot reach the high ranks of the noble class, her strength and loveliness are even more evident in her humility, maintaining her prejudice and never flattering or bowing to others.

The meeting of Darcy and Elizabeth marks the beginning of the confrontation between pride and prejudice. Only through practical experience in real life can pride and prejudice be eliminated. Therefore, the author allows Darcy and Elizabeth to receive lessons from life's realities. After several trials of separation, reunion, joy, and sorrow, they cannot help but sincerely abandon the bad habits created by the social environment. Finally, they are able to be happily united. This is the understanding that Austen's talented and fluent writing inspires and suggests to us. This is particularly worthy of praise.

Because of Darcy's arrogance, Elizabeth's prejudice is further strengthened. Now, let's look at Elizabeth's words to Darcy at the end of the book: "I often have irresistible painful memories intruding into my mind... Although I have never held selfish views, my behavior has been selfish throughout my life. When I was young, adults told me what was right, but they didn't tell me to correct my temper. Although I held good views, they all let me learn their pride and conceit. As an only son, I was unfortunately spoiled by my parents. My parents themselves are good, but they indulged me, encouraging me to be almost selfish and arrogant, caring for no one except my family; seeing everyone else as inferior, at least thinking their knowledge and value were not as good as mine. From eight to twenty-eight, that's how I was. If it weren't for you, my dearest, most beloved Elizabeth, I might still be like that! What don't I owe to you? You gave me a lesson, although it was not easy to accept at first, but it was very beneficial. You have taught me to be able to properly depreciate myself. I came to you then confident that you would accept me. You also taught me how unworthy my extravagance was to move a woman worthy of flattery."

This is Darcy's self-confession, and I think it should also paint a clear portrait for many young intellectuals today. Today, among the sons of noble families, I wonder how many still carry such airs.

Love and marriage only occupy a small part of life's journey. Pride and prejudice are no longer the bridges to healthy love. Looking at it from other perspectives of life, pride and prejudice are also things that must be eliminated. I think Austen, through her moving story, not only illustrates that pride and prejudice cannot exist in the midst of love, but also directs readers to be equally vigilant in other endeavors.

In recent years, Chinese scholars who study English literature criticism have especially praised this book "Pride and Prejudice" because the original text is simple, and the sentences are delicate, fluent, and easy to understand, making it very suitable for people learning English to read carefully. Therefore, many middle schools use this book as an English textbook. There was a Chinese translation a long time ago by Miss Yang Bin, a student in the Department of Foreign Languages at Yenching University. Although the translation is quite faithful, it is far from the exquisite structure and tactful tone of the original work. We hope that better new Chinese translations will be published soon. It is naturally very necessary to publish one or two more translations of a famous work. Here, we express our sincere hopes to translators!

### My Used Bookstore

— Mao Ren

Ten years ago, I would go to the movies whenever I had free time, but now I run to used bookstores whenever I have free time because I feel that buying used books is more economical than going to the movies. Although some people with so-called scientific knowledge warn us that old books inevitably contain germs and it's better not to look at them, I feel that the world is so big and there are so many germs, there are opportunities to run into them everywhere, so why avoid them specifically when it comes to old books. The reasons for going to used bookstores are, first, to get books I want at a lower price, and second, to discover rare books that I have long heard of but never had the chance to see. There are ways to achieve the former without relying solely on used bookstores; foreign cheap editions are probably aimed at meeting the needs of poor scholars. This faces difficulties in China that do not exist abroad: first, the sales of books are not high, and the original publishers still can't sell many copies, so how many readers will buy cheap editions; second, the reason why foreign cheap editions can be cheap is that I think half of it is saved on paper and given to readers, for example, if the original edition uses thick (I don't know what it's called) good paper, the cheap edition uses thin newspaper, but in China, newspaper is used from the start, so there's already nothing more to save; third, are Chinese publishers willing to let others release cheap editions of their good books that have sold several editions in a regular way (i.e., pay publishing taxes or other fees), as there's no precedent to follow. But despite these difficulties, I still want to make an effort to try...

Let's talk about my used bookstore, which I will try sooner or later. The unpleasant thing about ordinary used bookstores is the "unpleasant demeanor" of the owners or employees; they don't seem to welcome people who come to look at or even buy books. This may be due to their own difficulties; prices are rising every day, and a book that can be sold for 100,000 tomorrow is only worth 80,000 or 90,000 today, which is giving the customer a discount. Although there is always a tomorrow after tomorrow, the only way to make a full profit is to hide it in the mountains. But I am there to look at and buy books, not to look at their faces, so as soon as I enter, I focus my eyes on the books on the shelves, and even when bargaining after picking one, I still don't look around, so the "unpleasant demeanor" is still manageable. It's only during bargaining that I feel indignant. There have been several times when the books were not rare editions, but the prices were almost as high as new books, or only one or two tenths cheaper, but it's useless to say more to them; who told you to want to buy it? Also, it may take them three or five years to sell a book they bought, so how can they do without making a few more bucks?

What I find most unbearable is the "bargaining down" in used bookstores. I often see women and children coming to sell one or two packages of books, with ashamed expressions, and as a result, they are bargained down to selling mutton as dog meat. Once the books are in their hands, the dog meat immediately turns into mutton. With each transaction, they make a huge profit. But seeking more profit is the common commercial ethic in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, so how can we blame only used bookstores?

That's why I want to open a used bookstore. The books are still old books, but I want to try a new way of doing business. For example, there is a fixed price for selling and buying. For example, if a new book sells for 100,000, I give the seller half price when I buy it, and then sell it at 70% of the new book price. Doing this is of course still profitable for me, but it's considered a little fairer, and what's even better is that both the seller and the buyer of used books have a basis for the price, so there's no need for one to ask for the sky and the other to bargain to the ground. In addition, I would often post advertisements to let customers know what books they love are for sale, so they don't have to bother coming often, which is also a convenient way for those who buy from used bookstores.

I am looking for a shop everywhere, but the "transfer fees" are all counted in ounces or taels of gold, so it's not possible to realize it for the moment. Then let's wait for the auspicious day to open when the rent is paid in books.

### Visiting Xiang Yu's Hometown

— Man

When I was young and full of energy, I read "The Biography of Xiang Yu," and with the addition of novels and dramas, I developed a fondness for this West Chu overlord who dominated the world and whose heroic spirit could not be surpassed in ten generations. Regardless of his merits, demerits, successes, or failures, he was always a remarkable figure. Sinking boats and breaking cauldrons, and committing suicide by the Wujiang River fully demonstrated his heroic nature.

Recently, with a rare opportunity, I was able to go to Xiang Yu's hometown and wanted to find some relics that were slightly more realistic than what I read in books. The location is a small village surrounded by mountains more than thirty li southwest of Yuecheng. The village is called Xiangli, and the population is not large. The villagers are simple and honest, and in addition to farming, many are engaged in the tin foil industry. The scenery and terrain are majestic and beautiful.

Under the guidance of an acquaintance, I stepped into the "Xiang Yu Temple" (the only remaining relic of Xiang Yu in the entire village), which is a row of five temple halls. The pillars are not connected, and the beams do not touch. There are also five halls, and in each hall sits a statue of Xiang Yu and Lady Yu Ji. The statues are not large, and Xiang Yu's appearance is far from the imposing figure on the stage. Why build it like this? Because the village is divided into five communities, each community governs itself, competing with each other, and unable to agree, so they built it this way. This alone has some of Xiang Yu's stubbornness.

I wanted to find some inscriptions in the temple for research materials, but not only was it impossible, but there were not even steles describing the history and evolution; the few plaques were all of the "Blessing One Side" and "Answering All Requests" variety. If Xiang Yu really performed the duties of a local god here, it could be said that his heroic spirit was cut short!

I went to a small tea shop to interview an old farmer, and all I got were some half-hour, half-fabricated myths, which made people not believe that Xiang Yu was a real person. An old man enthusiastically took me to the stream in the valley and showed me a large piece of rock at the bottom of the stream with knife marks.

He said, "This is where Jin Wuzhu forced Little Kang Wang to come, and he washed his spear in the stream. The blood on the spear stained the rock red, and these cracks were carved by the tip of the spear. Xiang Wang resisted here for a while, and Little Kang Wang was able to escape."

"They weren't contemporaries, were they?" I couldn't help but laugh.

"Of course it was Xiang Wang showing his divinity!" He turned and left unhappily. I felt very indifferent and disappointed and then left this beautiful mountain village.

### Wordless Spring Couplets

—

During the Qing Dynasty, Chen Hongmou, after studying and retiring to the countryside, often gathered with the elders of the village for entertainment. A few days before the New Year, many villagers asked him for Spring Festival couplets. Chen smiled and accepted the requests, ordering his family members to write marks on the back of the paper. However, he never wrote a single word, nor did he order his scribes to do it for him. When the time came for the villagers to collect the couplets, Hongmou returned the old paper to them. The villagers were greatly surprised and asked: Why not write words? Chen said, "It is better to have no word (matter) than to have word (matter)." The villagers happily took them home and pasted them on their doors. Someone asked: Why are there no words? The villagers said: "Lord Chen said: It is better to have no word than to have word, so we don't use words." Chen heard this and laughed loudly. Later, this became a custom, and to this day, many Spring Festival couplets in Guangxi are pasted on red paper without writing words. (See Xiaoshemeiguan Cuolu)

### Chess Talk

— Mao Yi

To those who don't play chess, chess seems boring. It requires concentration and years of research. Indeed, the Sanskrit words for "chess game" translate to "game of wisdom" – and becoming a chess expert does require a lot of research. However, it is a fact that anyone with ordinary intelligence can quickly learn the basics of chess. Many eight- or nine-year-olds play chess, and it is common for fathers and sons to clash across the chessboard.

Speaking of the origin of chess, it is generally believed to have originated in India. Some historians say there were chess pieces as early as 3000 BC, and objects similar to chessboards have been found in Egyptian tombs. These objects may have been used for some form of chess game, but the more likely origin of chess is from a dice game. Our most reliable records indicate that chess pieces were truly invented in India around 700 AD. Although early chess used dice to determine the movement of pieces, to date, playing chess relies entirely on intelligence and has nothing to do with luck.

Chess was introduced to Europe around the ninth century, probably by sailors who first introduced it to Spain or Portugal, and then spread it from there. At first, people generally viewed it with suspicion, especially figures in the church. One record says that in 1060 AD, the Bishop of Florence strictly prohibited playing chess in hotels. If anyone committed this "sin," they would be punished by "washing the feet of twelve poor people." This prohibition may have been caused by the fact that playing chess was often associated with gambling. Indian chess players would bet a hand or a leg on a game of chess. They would keep a pot of boiling liquid at hand, and if a chess player lost a finger, he would quickly chop it off, cauterize the stump, and continue playing chess – another strange bet is described in a fourteenth-century legend – the loser had to drink all the salt water in the sea. However, the loser was a clever fellow. He demanded that the winner first drink all the fresh water in the sea, and as a result, he was able to get away with it.

By the end of the thirteenth century, all oppression against chess had disappeared, and playing chess became a favorite pastime of the upper class. Warriors, nobles, poets, and even monks played chess whenever they had the opportunity. Noble ladies also played chess, and chess was considered a useful tool for courting women – especially for shy men who were not good at speaking. However, playing chess between men and women was not always harmonious. For example, when the Countess of Flanders won a chess game against her husband, he was so ashamed and angry that he punched her! Later, he was captured in war, and she refused to pay the ransom in revenge, which resulted in him being a prisoner for thirteen years.

Beautiful and valuable chess sets can add to the enjoyment of playing chess. Many museums display chess pieces carved from jade, ivory, crystal, amber, ebony, and other precious materials. The figures and flowers carved on them are often exquisite and delightful.

Chess was most popular in the Middle Ages, and it can be said to have reached an unprecedented peak. By the end of the fourteenth century, playing cards began to appear and became supplements to chess. In modern times, playing cards has become more popular than chess, largely because card games are faster and the number of participants is not limited to two, so everyone can participate and enjoy themselves. However, chess has not been eliminated by the rise of playing cards, and the reason why chess has been able to exist for thousands of years without being abandoned is mainly because it is a fair game – it is a battle of wits and not a battle of "luck."

### Super Saccharin

— Mei

A Dutch scientist, Professor Van Keide, recently created a new compound that can be called "Super Saccharin." According to Professor Van, this compound is five thousand times sweeter than ordinary table sugar, and he is now planning to manufacture it on a large scale. Professor Van said that the cost of this saccharin is low, and when sold in the future, it will only cost about four US dollars per pound, and each pound will be enough for an average family for ten years. The official name of this new saccharin is L-n-propoxy-a-amino-4-mitrobenaene.

### Faithful Believer

— Xi Li

In Scotland lived an old woman who firmly believed that prayer was very effective. One night, two young men overheard her praying for bread. These two wanted to have some fun, so they bought two loaves of bread and dropped them into her cottage through the chimney. The next day, they went again to hear how she thanked God in her prayer. When she finished, the two men laughed loudly and she went inside. They told her how they had dropped the bread in through the chimney.

But the old woman's faith was not shaken at all. She firmly said, "Of course the bread was given to me by God. However, she must have sent the little devils to deliver it."

### Hanshan Temple Bell

— Yu Yifen

When did the bell of Hanshan Temple in Suzhou ring during the Tang Dynasty, I wonder? Wu Jushang (Changchi) wrote in the Bell Chapter of the Hanshan Temple Chronicle: "The Tang Dynasty bell was refined with extraordinary precision, with fantastic and ancient cloud patterns, and flying ridges and valleys that undulate and move, and there are edges to the touch. I have seen rubbings of bells from the Baoshi Temple which all look like this. It is a pity that this temple has been in disrepair for a long time. In the Ming Dynasty, a bell was recast, and it was also locked away, but since Zhang Ji wrote the poem, on moonlit evenings and frosty mornings, there are still lingering sounds. Geng Ling jiaozhu, asking questions and disputes arise again, wrapping it up and recording it, is also a matter of hearing." According to Baicheng Yan Shui, during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the monk Benji built a bell tower, which was melted down to make cannons during the Japanese pirate crisis. Tang Yin's Bell Solicitation states: "The wooden clapper patrols the roads, which is how the Zhou official warned their stubborn and ignorant subjects. The bronze bell controls the morning and evening, which is how the釋氏awakened people's spirits, resolving the battles of the demon kings, resounding in the heavenly palaces above, relieving the sorrows of all living beings, and heard in the hells below. So提尊者 manifested supernatural powers and 外道無言, and Zen Master Benji realized the true words and古德 praised him. It is truly named a Dharma instrument, and its number is 大音. Our temple's number is Hanshan. 建始普明, the temple halls are well-equipped, but the bronze bell has not yet been completed. When the moon sets and crows caw, there is 張繼's line about Maple Bridge, and when thunder drums strike, I am ashamed of Li Bai's inscription made of ashes. Now I will stoke the furnace to melt fine gold, mold clay to cast a great joy, and use this grand event to ask for the wisdom of noble people and increase the grandeur of the mountain gate! May it open a thousand doors to dawn, awakening all latent beings, and pacify myriad households at dusk, and exhaust the dragons. Adorn the Buddha's land, benefit humanity and heaven, increase the light of wisdom, and make the field of fortune not thin. With this solicitation, I look forward to the manifestation of brightness, and the verse says: Outside the Gusu city, in an ancient Zen room, I intend to rust the bronze and inform the four directions. Try to answer, after it is reborn and becomes an instrument, a sound knocks down frost all over the sky." It was made at this time. There was originally a stone inscription in the temple, but it has been blurred over time. Fortunately, the traces are still preserved by the National Palace Museum, and Mr. Wu Hufan personally saw it ten years ago. The name of the talented 6 like, 唐伯虎, is very important. Because of the story of Tang Bohu Pointing Qiu Xiang, the first romantic talent in Jiangnan, it is even more deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary people, so it has been preserved to this day? According to the records, the new bell was cast when Chen Xiaoshi (Kuilong) was governing Wu, and all officials below the fan nie had their names engraved on it.俞曲園's new Hanshan Temple Chronicle contains the words "To the west of the hall, there is still a gap, and a new building is constructed. On this day, the bell tower, cast copper as a bell, hanging it on top, to preserve the ancient relics." The bell that the Japanese pirates stole was not only the old Tang Dynasty thing, but also certainly not 明, which is clear. Chen is now living in seclusion in Shanghai, at the age of ninety-two, and is still healthy. The one who can testify. What is strange is that the Ming bell was destroyed by the Japanese pirates, and the new bell was also taken away by the Japanese pirates. To this day, there is a Japanese bell donated by Hu Xueyan that is confused with the Tang bell, which is unavoidable 閜夾耳.

Zhang Yisun's poem "The bell rings at midnight to the passenger boat" was criticized by Ouyang Xiu, but Tang people such as Bai Letian and Li Yishan have poems with midnight bells. Those who have debated this over the years are many, and Ye's words are 膠柱 詰難 濡起 also. Shilin Poetry Talk says that Zhang Ji wrote a poem about Maple Bridge Temple west of Gusu city. Ouyang once criticized it because it was not the time to ring the bell in the middle of the night, because he had never been to Wuzhong. Now the temples in Wuzhong do ring the bell at midnight. Zhang Ji's poem, thirty餘篇, I have them at my home, often with many excellent sentences. The world thinks that 懿孫 relied on this one poem about resting at Maple Bridge at night to leave his name for thousands of years, seeing this know it is also not so.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 10 Self-Sacrifice (74)

Little Wang's mother said: "There's no use in being anxious. It's so late, and the rain outside is so heavy. Mr. Xu, you can't go back. Please rest here first! There are beds in the outer room, which are prepared for guests. Mr. Xu, please rest, okay?" Zhu Zhai thought for a while, and without news of Qi Wan, he wouldn't feel at ease even if he went back. It would be better to wait here. He nodded and said, "That's fine." After saying that, he wanted to stand up, but as soon as he stretched his waist, a tendon in his left waist felt like it had snapped, and he was in great pain, repeatedly exclaiming, "Aiyo!" He sat down again. Little Wang's mother repeatedly asked, "What's wrong?" She hurried over, helped him up, and slowly helped him into the room, helped him take off his clothes, and covered him with a quilt. She sat on the edge of the bed and massaged Zhu Zhai's left waist through the quilt with her hands. The massage made the pain a little better, and he closed his eyes, letting her massage. After a while, he heard Little Wang's mother asking, "Are you feeling better?" Zhu Zhai only replied, "Thank you for your trouble. Take a break!" Little Wang's mother said, "No, I'm not tired at all. Anyway, the boss isn't coming back, so I can't sleep. Mr. Xu, sleep soundly. After a sleep, the pain in your body will be gone." Zhu Zhai repeatedly agreed and closed his eyes again. After a long time, he felt that Little Wang's mother was still massaging him. He opened his eyes and saw that Little Wang's mother had taken off her shoes and was sitting on the edge of the bed with her legs crossed. Her small face and tender white skin seemed to be dyed with rouge, especially the corners of her eyebrows and eyes, which were particularly bright red. Seeing Zhu Zhai open his eyes, she smiled at him slightly and asked, "You're still not asleep? Are you feeling better now?" Zhu Zhai was very touched by her gentleness and said, "You're too tired. Take a break! I feel much better after your massage." Little Wang's mother said, "If you can feel a little relaxed, I'll massage you a little more." Zhu Zhai stretched out his hand and pressed her hand, feeling that her soft hand was no less than Qi Wan's. Little Wang's mother's hand was pressed by Zhu Zhai, not allowing her to massage. She said, "I'm not tired at all."
