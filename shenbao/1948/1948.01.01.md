### Entering the Constitutional Era This Year: Chairman's Broadcast Proclaims to the Nation, Unite to Destroy National Enemies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang issued a New Year's Day broadcast address to the military and civilians of the entire country on New Year's Eve, the full text of which is as follows:

Fellow countrymen, military and civilians across the country, today is the founding anniversary of the 37th year of the Republic of China. Since its founding, the Republic of China has suffered continuous internal and external troubles. After a long period of dangers and difficulties, all our countrymen, under the leadership of the Founding Father and the guidance of his last will, have worked together, persevered, destroyed the remnants of the imperial system, eliminated feudal strongholds, and defeated invading countries. This year, the Republic of China has finally entered the constitutional era. We can say that this year is the year of constitutional rule, and today is the first day of the year of constitutional rule. On this first day of the year of constitutional rule, I first hope that all my countrymen will remember the difficulties of the martyrs in creating the Republic, fulfill the duties of citizens of a democratic country, uphold the Constitution, and implement constitutional government to establish an unshakable foundation for the country forever. At the same time, we should also observe the country's current environment and the crises facing the nation, understand the greater good, distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, unite our efforts, and work together to continue the spirit of the fifty years of National Revolution and the eight years of war against Japan, to jointly fight against the common enemies of the nation and to work together to eliminate the country's worries.

Today is the third New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. During our country's eight-year war against Japan, the military and civilians across the country spared no sacrifice, endured unparalleled suffering, originally to protect the country's independence and freedom, and also to crush the Japanese imperialists' poisonous plan to divide our country, destroy our unity, and hinder our construction, in order to exterminate our nation's survival. Our countrymen endured hardship and pain, sacrificed and struggled, originally hoping to have the opportunity to recuperate, live and work in peace after the victory, so that our nation could be revitalized and the country could become strong. Unexpectedly, during the eight-year War of Resistance, when our countrymen were bleeding for a long time, the communist bandits carried out their rebellion to subvert the country, endanger the nation, and disrupt the whole country from beginning to end. On the one hand, they cooperated with the government on the surface, expressing their unity in resisting Japan, and on the other hand, they tried their best to avoid war, secretly reaching an understanding with the enemy and not invading each other, concentrating on maintaining their territory and expanding their strength. When the War of Resistance was victorious, they suddenly launched a rebellion, destroying unity, and losing the opportunity for our nation's rejuvenation and the good opportunity for our country's construction, hindering the revitalization and harming the people's livelihood, so that our countrymen, who survived the disaster, were once again in an environment without constitution and without hope of recovery. Our countrymen in the bandit areas who were oppressed by the communist bandits not only experienced the displaced lives of the War of Resistance period, but also suffered disasters that were more unbearable than the rape, murder, and enslavement by the Japanese pirates during the War of Resistance. Today, under the influence of the bandit rebellion, the livelihood of the general public across the country is becoming increasingly difficult, and they are constantly oppressed, unable to breathe a sigh of relief. Those who have escaped from the bandit areas, carrying the old and leading the young, are hungry and cold, and have nowhere to turn. Especially those who are trapped in the bandit areas and cannot escape the clutches, their plight of having no way to survive and no way to die, and living in darkness, cannot be described in words. The country has suffered such disasters and the people have suffered such trauma, which is an unprecedented catastrophe in our country's history of survival. On this New Year's Day, Zhongzheng deeply feels the responsibility and is deeply saddened by the suffering of our countrymen. The thoughts and grief in my heart cannot be expressed in words.

### National Equality and Freedom Must Take Unity and Independence as Prerequisites: Points Out the Responsibilities of Compatriots in Saving the Nation and Themselves

We are now entering the era of democratic constitutionalism, but democratic politics must take national equality and freedom as a prerequisite, and national equality and freedom must take national unity and independence as a prerequisite. Only when the people of the whole country abide by the laws and regulations, uphold unity, and strive for independence can we build a free, democratic and glorious country. If our China cannot be unified, the survival of the nation will lose its guarantee, if the country cannot be unified, economic construction cannot be promoted, and if the country cannot be unified, democratic constitutionalism cannot be implemented. The communist bandits today are shamelessly claiming that their rebellion and arson are patriotic, and even more ridiculously, they are using their strict blockade and creation of terror as democracy. In fact, everyone knows that the communist bandits have absolutely no country, no nation, and absolutely no democracy or freedom in their minds. A year ago, the communist bandits had already opposed the National Assembly and denied the Constitution, trampling on democracy. In the past year, they have been using the division of territory, usurpation of sovereignty, subjugation of China, and destruction of the nation as the goals of their armed rebellion. In order to carry out these unspeakable goals, they have not hesitated to desecrate our national soil. Economically and socially, they are undermining our social and economic foundations. For the entire country, they want to exterminate China's excellent culture and ethics, and eliminate China's five thousand years of long and glorious history. They violate human nature and create division. They destroy unity and ruin construction. What they want is the people's poverty and death, not the people's peace and survival. Wherever the bandit army goes, they universally launch struggles, creating hatred between people. The "land revolution" they advocate actually directs unemployed vagrants and local bullies to control the entire countryside, oppressing honest farmers. They even do not hesitate to destroy human reason, create a crazy psychology, and practice cruel terror to fuel the cruel struggle between people. The various atrocities committed by the communist bandits in the bandit areas prove that they not only want to make our country not a country, but also want to make our people not people. The communist bandits encourage fratricide and cultivate parricide in the bandit areas, forcing women to join the army, glorifying them as team members, but in reality using them as tools for the lust of communist party cadres. Even more heartbreaking is that every child must be incorporated into the Young Pioneers, training them to spy on families, hate their fathers and brothers, and commit crimes against humanity. His atrocities can be summarized in three sentences: First, in order to eliminate the people's concept of the country, they want to destroy families and exterminate human relations. Second, in order to destroy social order, they want to incite hatred and advocate deception. Third, in order to carry out class dictatorship, they want to create terror and destroy democracy. The communist bandits regard sin as virtue and deception as loyalty. They use all means to achieve their goals and have no sense of shame towards people. They use all kinds of means to eliminate our nation's life, destroy our society's livelihood, and endanger our country's survival. Their malicious intentions are even greater than the Japanese pirates' invasion. The Japanese pirates' invasion was only an external aggression, while today's communist bandits' betrayal of the country is an internal rebellion with external aggression characteristics. If such heinous crimes are allowed to continue without suppression, our country will inevitably die, and our people will be reduced to beasts of burden for others to enslave. Where is there any freedom to speak of, and even less hope for democratic constitutionalism? Fellow countrymen, as long as you visit the refugee countrymen who have fled from the bandit areas, ask if there is any intellectual in the bandit areas who can survive without being killed by the communist bandits. Wherever the communist bandits have passed, is there any hole that can be spared, is there anyone who can live freely without being oppressed by the communist bandits as a sacrificial lamb? Therefore, it can be known that our current military suppression of bandits is a war to save the country and the people, a war to save the country against harming the country, a war to build against destruction, a war of freedom against enslavement, a war of light against darkness, and a war of democratic constitutionalism against class dictatorship. This is indeed the key to the fundamental safety of the country and the dividing line between the nation's century-long prosperity and decline. Therefore, today I want to review the situation of the military suppression of bandits since last year for my countrymen, review the economic crisis caused by the communist bandits' rebellion, and point out the responsibilities that my patriotic countrymen should fulfill in saving the country and saving themselves in the future.

### Chairman's New Year's Day Gratification of the Troops: Daily Necessities Distributed to Wounded and Disabled Officers and Soldiers

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Chairman Chiang, on the occasion of New Year's Day of the 37th year, to express his gratitude to the officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines for their hard work, has issued condolences to the officers and soldiers of various units, and distributed to the wounded and disabled officers and soldiers two coarse towels per person, one tube of toothpaste, one bar of soap, two boxes of cigarettes, and one catty of meat (cash equivalent to 22,000 yuan). (The above items are under preparation and will be distributed in succession). In addition, the Ministry of National Defense stipulates: A. According to the number of people accommodated in each hospital (including wounded and sick soldiers from other units and the Southern Jiangsu Army), the Welfare Personnel Committee and the hospital will jointly compile a list of wounded and sick soldiers who were admitted to the hospital before New Year's Day. Those who have been discharged from the hospital but have not yet arrived at their units, after being certified by the original hospital, can still apply for the benefits. B. Military and civilian personnel who have been transferred to other units or are on leave are also required to compile a detailed list and distribute the benefits uniformly. These benefits have been prepared by the Ministry of National Defense and will be distributed or paid in cash separately.

[This newspaper, unknown location, 30th] Chairman Chiang was very pleased with the significant drop in prices in unknown location (see the first page of yesterday's newspaper and the second page of today's newspaper). On the 30th, he severely rewarded the commander of the area and instructed him to reward the meritorious officers and soldiers, which will be done on New Year's Day.

### Review of the Military Situation: National Army Has Completed Strategic Objectives, Pursuing and Suppressing Wandering Bandits in the Interior

When we review the military suppression of bandits in the past year, we must first point out that before the promulgation of the mobilization order for the war, the government was extremely tolerant and exhausted all means to avoid war. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has stopped conscription. The original officers and soldiers have been reorganized and greatly reduced. Before June of last year, in order to understand the people's suffering and preserve the country's vitality, our national army had never taken active military action against the communist bandits. On the contrary, the communist bandits launched rebellions repeatedly in the bandit areas, and while the government loved peace and was unprepared for war, they took advantage of loopholes everywhere, expanded the scope of their rebellions, and strengthened their rebellious forces. The general public did not clearly understand the communist bandits' tricks, and even after the promulgation of the mobilization order for the war in July, they were still confused by the communist bandits' reactionary propaganda. Especially in the rear provinces and cities, spies ran rampant, rumors arose frequently, and various chaotic and complex phenomena were difficult to clarify. Therefore, mobilization could not be thoroughly implemented, and the military suppression of bandits could not achieve complete success. Under these circumstances, the front-line national army has been fighting passively and in isolation, resulting in repeated losses within a year, and the generals and soldiers have been very tired. However, under these extremely difficult combat conditions, the national army has already completed its greatest task on the battlefield and overcome the greatest difficulties. The first is the occupation of Yan'an, the location of the communist bandits' headquarters. The second is that the old nest in the Yimeng Mountain area was completely destroyed by our national army and recovered by our national army. The third is that the main force of the bandit party in the interior has been continuously pursued and destroyed by our national army, making it unable to stand firm. Their conspiracy to occupy North China and divide the country has also been shattered by our national army. Everyone knows that Yan'an has been the communist bandits' base for more than ten years, and their base for dividing North China. The Yimeng Mountain area is the communist bandits' general warehouse for manufacturing military equipment and storing military supplies. Yantai on the Shandong Peninsula is the communist bandits' only maritime transportation and supply line to the outside world. However, our national army, relying on the spirit of loyalty, courage, and righteousness, built its most dangerous target in terms of terrain and most difficult in terms of combat. Finally, it recovered Yan'an, swept away the Yimeng Mountain area, and finally recovered Yantai, gradually destroying the nest that the communist bandits had managed for many years, the supplies they had accumulated, and the headquarters they relied on to call on all the bandit troops. From then on, the communist bandits' so-called political center and nerve center were lost, the economic lifeline on which they depended for survival was destroyed, and their final sea port for external communication was cut off. The price paid by the national army was indeed huge, but the expected strategic goal has been completed as scheduled in the past year. The bandit army in the interior has been hit hard, unable to stand firm, and unable to resist stubbornly. It has to be forced to disperse and become bandits. Although the bandit troops led by Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are still rampant and scurrying, their wandering south of the Yellow River has turned them into thieves without nests and rats without holes. There is no purpose in front of them and no way back behind them. They can only be beaten blindly. The national army will be able to pursue, suppress, and eliminate these bandit troops more easily. It can be said that the most difficult work in the entire bandit suppression campaign has already been completed in the past year. Everyone knows that before July, the bandit army in the interior was completely active in resisting stubbornly and was determined not to give up their bases and flee en masse. However, after our national army began to suppress them in July, they could not hold on and had to flee to avoid war. The national army has moved from the defensive stage to the suppression stage, and recently has entered the pursuit stage. Under this situation, in order to escape their final fate of destruction, the communist bandits have recently restored their hideous faces from the Jiangxi era. In the bandit areas they occupy, regardless of villages or cities, they use methods such as confiscation, liquidation, and review to impose endless oppression and exploitation on all men, women, old, and young, and use methods of struggle and massacre to drive the entire population to completely sacrifice themselves for their rebellion. These increasingly extreme and heinous acts of the communist bandits can also prove that they are at the end of their rope and have reached the final stage. I want to explain to everyone that although the bandit troops led by Liu Bocheng are still scurrying in the Dabie Mountains, vainly trying to rebuild their base in Central China, and the bandit troops led by Chen Yi in western Henan and eastern Henan are still destroying transportation, trying to hinder our national army's pursuit and suppression in order to prolong their remaining lives, but the national army has completed the preparations for the entire bandit suppression plan in the past six months. It is firmly believed that all the bandit army's various attempts will be shattered and all their fantasies will become bubbles. As for the bandit army in the Northeast, although they launched attacks rashly, the national army, which has been fighting in the Northeast for a long time, in order to protect the territorial sovereignty of the Northeast, all officers and soldiers will spare no sacrifice, double their loyalty and courage, and fight the bandits to the end, until the territorial sovereignty is completely recovered. This is a glimpse of the current military situation of bandit suppression that I want to clearly point out to my countrymen across the country. (Continued on the first column of the second page)

Editorial

### New Year's Greetings to Constitutional Rule

The Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated on New Year's Day last year and came into effect on December 25th. Today is New Year's Day of the 37th year, exactly one year from the date of the Constitution's promulgation and a full week from the date of its implementation. This year should be a "year of constitutional rule" in name and in fact. On New Year's Day of the year of constitutional rule, we should first sincerely and respectfully wish the smooth implementation of the Constitution.

According to Article 1 of the Constitution, "The Republic of China, based on the Three Principles of the People, is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." Therefore, the Constitution is truly a symbol of our country's implementation of democratic politics. The value of the Constitution lies not in its 175 articles, but in the spirit contained in these articles, which is the spirit of democracy. If we want constitutional rule to be smooth, we must first strive to cultivate the democratic spirit of every citizen. Only when everyone, from the head of state to high officials, and from peddlers to hawkers, possesses that most precious democratic spirit, can the Constitution have its supreme dignity and authority.

So what is the spirit of democracy? Simply put, the difference between democracy and dictatorship is that the former allows opposing opinions while the latter does not, the former persuades opponents with reason while the latter uses violence to stop them. Therefore, whether the Constitution can be implemented, and whether it can be implemented smoothly, depends on how our government and society, officials and people, express their opinions and promote their policies on any proposal or measure in the future. If we can truly follow the method of discussion in meetings, allowing both those who agree and those who disagree to have a reasonable opportunity for debate, on the one hand, we must never harbor prejudiced views of dominance and servitude, and never casually use force to prohibit the discussions of dissidents; on the other hand, we must never be stubborn or extreme, and only regard opposition or destruction as ability, but be able to obey the final decision of the majority, then we can hope to enter the realm of democracy. On the contrary, if we still follow the old habits, unwilling to use reason to convince others, such as some officials in the past who were never willing to hear opposing discussions in the parliament, and occasionally became angry when debating; or like the communists today, who oppose political enemies not by arguing with words and pens, but must resort to war and meet the national army on the battlefield with pleasure, these are all lacking the cultivation of democratic spirit. We wish everyone to wash away these old stains of self-centeredness and arrogance, and do their best to cultivate the seedlings of democratic spirit, so that constitutional rule can be smooth.

Secondly, what democratic countries value most is the freedom and rights of the people. In our country's Constitution, all the people's freedom of person, freedom of residence and movement, freedom of speech, teaching, writing, and publication, freedom of secret communication, freedom of religious belief, freedom of assembly and association, as well as the people's right to survival, right to work, and right to property, etc., have been detailed in Chapter II, and "unless necessary to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others, avoid emergency dangers, maintain social order, or promote public interests, it shall not be restricted by law" (see Article 23). If public officials illegally infringe upon them, they shall be subject to disciplinary action and bear criminal and civil liability, and the victimized people may also request compensation from the state (see Article 24). It can be seen how the government after constitutional rule should respect the freedom and rights that the people should enjoy. Although the government is currently suppressing the rebellion, and the Constitution has not yet been fully implemented, this Chapter II should undoubtedly be implemented seriously first. Recently, military and police agencies in various places often arrest people and search residences casually based on irresponsible confidential reports, and those who make false accusations are not punished in reverse, or even make anonymous or fabricated false accusations. These officials only know how to infringe on the people's freedom, but do not realize that their actions violate the Constitution. Sometimes, the government rashly stipulates a method without considering that the implementation of these methods will cause innocent people to lose their property rights, work rights, or even their right to survival, such as forcibly confiscating (exchanging at low prices, which is equivalent to confiscation) the silver in the people's homes, confiscating the gold carried by the people, and prohibiting cotton merchants from purchasing cotton in the name of unified purchase, strictly speaking, are all violations of the Constitution! Article 152 of the Constitution clearly stipulates: "The state shall provide appropriate job opportunities for people with the ability to work." We really do not understand what crime the cotton merchants, who could barely have a job during the rebellion, have committed, that they should be forced to lose their job? The country has entered constitutional government, and we wish the officials to thoroughly change their outdated concepts in the past, and not to think that the common people can be arbitrarily manipulated and bullied. They should know that after this, every word and action must respect the freedom and rights that the people should enjoy according to law. Only such officials are qualified to handle public affairs in a constitutional government.

Finally, democratic politics is the politics of discussion, and all policies and laws must be determined by the discussion of the parliament. Therefore, whether the promotion of constitutional government in China can be smooth depends on how the future National Assembly and Legislative Yuan conduct their work. It must be known that parliamentary politics values the use of political parties and the maintenance of order. With political parties, speeches can be coherent, and with order, discussions can have decisions. Then, all kinds of bills, large and small, can be resolved under legal and reasonable debates, and the government's policies can be based on this. Otherwise, the National Assembly of two or three thousand people and the Legislative Yuan of six or seven hundred people, if everyone misunderstands democracy, only knows how to show off their heads with speeches, talking at the same time, and making endless noise, and once the debate is deadlocked and each other does not accept it, it may be like the parliament of the early Republic of China, throwing boxes and using violence, shamelessly, what can we expect? Therefore, to ask for the smooth implementation of constitutional rule, we must pray that the National Assembly representatives and the Legislative Yuan members keep two things in mind: Those with party affiliation must abide by the party's discipline and obey the party's policies. Once a political party has made a decision on a bill, the members of the political party should be consistent and have a designated spokesperson to express their views. It is absolutely impossible for each to act independently and go to the podium to make lengthy and eloquent speeches, wasting the time of the meeting. All kinds of meetings must strictly abide by the rules of procedure, and the implementation of the rules of procedure and the maintenance of order in the parliament must be clearly stipulated in the articles, and ushers must be appointed to assist the chairman in handling them seriously. All national representatives or legislators must form the habit of respecting the status and authority of the ushers, so that the meeting can proceed in an orderly manner. This is the case in the parliamentary proceedings of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. These minimum conditions of the parliamentary system must be met first, so that democratic constitutional government can grow strong in the cradle.

### Chairman’s New Year's Day Broadcast Address Continued from Page 1 This Year's Bandit Suppression Emphasizes Politics over Military, Economic Crisis and Human Resources Can Ultimately Be Saved

Our bandit suppression work for this year, in order to fundamentally eliminate the bandit scourge, must still emphasize politics over military affairs. In military terms, we must first eliminate the tangible strength of the bandit army in order to eradicate the scattered bandits spreading throughout the country. We should not expect too rapid results from bandit suppression at this time, nor should we make overly optimistic estimates, but eliminating the tangible strength of the bandit army can ultimately be completed within a year. As for the scattered bandits throughout the country, it will take an additional year or two after the tangible bandit forces are eliminated to thoroughly eradicate them. In order to achieve the goal of eliminating the tangible strength of the bandit army, we must ensure that the National Army has sufficient clothing, food, weapons, and soldiers. This truly relies on the unity of mind and virtue between the people of the whole country and the government, each fulfilling their responsibilities, continuing the spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance, contributing money if they have money, contributing strength if they have strength, everyone taking the public suppression of the rebellion as their own responsibility, with national construction as the goal. In particular, in response to the comprehensive disruption by the Communists, which has created the poisonous scheme of poverty, destitution, and suffocation of the people's livelihood, we must eliminate their hidden bandit spies everywhere and thoroughly clear out their so-called "underground organizations." This is the only key point to prevent bandits and stop chaos, clarify the origin, and purify the source. It is especially necessary for social figures in all localities to act promptly, rise up together, and jointly take responsibility for organizing the people's armed forces, strengthening local teams, everyone defending themselves, and setting up defenses everywhere, so that the remaining bandits who intend to roam have no opportunity to take advantage of, dare not go deep, and that the scattered bandits lurking in wait cannot stand, cannot survive. In this way, the entire country is united, the entire population is mobilized, military, political, social, economic, educational, and cultural aspects are coordinated with each other, the military and the people cooperate, the communities are united, and they fight to the death to protect the country and their hometowns. Then, based on historical precedents, no matter how stubborn the roving bandits are, they cannot but be completely annihilated before the great power of the people. Just look at the self-defense forces in a corner of Wanxi, Henan, which have already inflicted unprecedented punishment on Chen Geng's bandit forces, almost completely annihilating them. All my patriotic compatriots can be inspired and rise up.

The above has explained the military situation of bandit suppression and the requirements for bandit suppression. Next, I would like to explain to my compatriots the main reasons for the current social and economic crisis, as well as the principles that the country should take to stabilize the economy and the understanding and efforts that the people should have to stabilize the economy. Everyone should already understand that the increasingly deepening economic crisis is deliberately created by the Communist bandits. If our compatriots are complacent and selfish, unaware of the need for vigilance, but instead fuel the flames and deepen the crisis, this is exactly what the evil Communist bandits welcome and applaud. After eight years of long-term resistance, the country's foundation has already been depleted, and production has been devastated. Immediately after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communist bandits revealed their ambition to rebel. In the past two years or more, they have obstructed restoration everywhere, hindered reception, destroyed transportation everywhere, destroyed industry and mining, destroyed social order, destroyed the dying countryside, and even mixed into the commercial market, using commercial scum to spread rumors, promote speculation, promote hoarding, and even smuggle and evade taxes, disrupting finance, in order to deepen economic imbalances and destroy the foundation of the entire economy. Our compatriots are completely unaware of this treacherous plot, and what they think, say, and do, intentionally or unintentionally, has made them accomplices of the Communist bandits, not hesitating to plunge the country into an increasingly deep economic crisis. This phenomenon is really caused by the abnormal psychology of selfishness and harming others in the cities, which is different in path but the same in result as the Communist bandits' deliberate destruction of the economy, harming the country, and suffocating the people's livelihood. I will just cite one example to make it clear. The number of currency issues in our country today is far less than the multiple of general prices compared to before the war, at least it can be said that the multiple of the former is only a quarter of the latter. However, if this more than threefold price increase is not deliberately raised by the commercial market due to speculation, competition, and hoarding, why would there be such an unreasonable phenomenon of chaotic prices? Compatriots, I dare to say that our economic crisis is not beyond the ability of manpower to save. It is undoubtedly because the industrial and commercial circles do not have a clear understanding of the Communist bandits' scourge, the national crisis, and the relationship between individual interests and livelihoods, so they cannot sincerely support the national economic policy, or even outwardly comply but inwardly oppose, only seeking profit and not knowing that "when the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself?" This behavior not only harms the country but is also tantamount to suicide. I want to keenly awaken the industrial and commercial circles in major cities across the country to have a minimum level of vigilance, to know that at this time, to save the country and save oneself, the only way is to sincerely assist the government and work hard to stabilize the economy, and not to be short-sighted, selfish, and greedy for exorbitant profits, and take a path that is contrary to the country's stability and the people's interests. My urban compatriots must immediately correct unreasonable lifestyle phenomena, reject abnormal psychological states, be diligent and thrifty, be public-minded and forgetful of self, and increase production and stabilize the economy for bandit suppression and rebellion suppression, unification, and national construction, and inspire their respective consciences, mobilize their respective abilities and wealth. The country's future economic policies and economic measures must adapt to the requirements of suppressing rebellion and building the country, must adapt to the requirements of the interests of the majority of people, and must adapt to the requirements of the country's long-term self-reliance, and must never cater to the requirements of a few people's complacency and enjoyment, speculation, and exorbitant profits. Anyone who, out of the selfish desire for speculation and exorbitant profits, uses excuses to undermine the country's mobilization orders and economic policies, the law will certainly impose due punishment, and society will certainly impose strong sanctions. I believe that the current economic phenomenon, as long as everyone rectifies their lives, clarifies their concepts, eliminates waste, vigorously practices thrift, takes into account the overall situation, considers the future, and works together unanimously to stabilize finance and increase production, then with the breadth of our country's land, the abundance of its products, the size of its population, and the thickness of its economic foundation, there is no fear that the current crisis cannot be eliminated, and the construction of the people's livelihood will surely be promoted, and the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy our country's economy, cut off the people's livelihood, and create their own destruction will also be shattered and will have no way to implement their plans.

Compatriots throughout the country, at this time of the beginning of the year, we should deeply reflect on the seriousness of the country's worries and shame, should recognize the Communist bandits' viciousness in harming the country and the people, should realize the urgency of saving the national crisis, should grieve the suffering of our compatriots in the bandit areas who are in deep water, should be concerned about the miserable plight of the displaced compatriots who are poor and have nowhere to return, should be grateful for the hard work of the bandit suppression soldiers who sacrifice and fight for the country and the people, should thank the diligence of the vast majority of our farmers and workers who are engaged in production, and especially should understand the lessons of self-reliance and seeking more blessings for ourselves, for the survival of ourselves, for the happiness of our future generations, for maintaining the results of the victory of the War of Resistance, for consolidating the foundation of national rejuvenation and national unification, for promoting the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and for seeking a life of peace and prosperity for all our compatriots, we must raise a deep sense of responsibility, develop a strong love of compatriots, work together with one heart and one mind, help each other, with the determination to live today as if we died yesterday, implement the general mobilization for bandit suppression and national construction, support the national policy of suppressing rebellion, strengthen self-defense forces, consolidate social order, maintain economic security, eliminate the Communist bandits who harm the country, and remove the obstacles to our unification and rejuvenation. As long as our confidence does not waver, we are persevering, thrifty, diligent, practice what we preach, and forge ahead bravely, we believe that in the near future we will be able to achieve our sacred mission of suppressing rebellion and saving the country, suppressing bandits and saving the people, opening up a bright future for the country, and building our new China of unification, independence, equality, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. Zhongzheng sincerely wishes all our compatriots a new beginning and to work hard and move forward. (End)

This unit attempted to attack Nankou with the First Column attacking Yangfang, cut off the Ping-Sui Line, and control the throat of Yire-Chahar. After the National Army took preemptive action to suppress and eliminate them, in addition to the First Column suffering a devastating blow in Yangfang, the bandits in the Battle of Yongning suffered heavy casualties after four days and nights of fierce fighting and completely collapsed at 4 pm yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] At today's press conference held by the Government Information Office, Zhou 楹, Deputy Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, answered questions on foreign affairs on behalf of Shi Zhao, Director of the Intelligence Department. He stated: Regarding the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty, the Chinese government has not yet received a reply from the U.S. government regarding its proposal of November 17th. At the beginning of the Pacific War, about two thousand Chinese miners from Nauru were evacuated to Australia. At that time, there was a shortage of labor in Australia. Our embassy in Australia consulted with the Australian authorities and decided to assign them to work that would contribute to the war effort, mainly in tungsten mining. Later, a portion of them were hired by the U.S. Expeditionary Forces to manufacture small boats. After the war ended, over a thousand had already been repatriated to China. The last group was repatriated last month. The Chinese government welcomes these overseas Chinese workers back to their homeland. Regarding the question of what opinions are held on the so-called "White Australia Policy," I have no comment to offer at this time. China and New Zealand are preparing to sign a new treaty. The number of overseas Chinese in New Zealand and the number of immigrants, both in the past and in the future, will not cause any immigration problems that cannot be resolved amicably between China and New Zealand.

### Secretary-General Wu's New Year's Eve Broadcast: Let Us Advance Towards Democracy Together; Suppressing the Rebellion and Implementing the Constitution are the Two Major Tasks at Hand

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng gave a broadcast speech on New Year's Eve entitled "Let Us Advance Towards Democracy Together." The original text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, comrades:

Tonight, as everyone is gathered around the stove for the New Year's Eve vigil, I would like to say a few words to you all.

Tomorrow is the first day of the 37th year of the Republic of China, the year of the establishment of a democratically elected government, which truly has epoch-making significance. We have achieved what we have today through the joint efforts of the Kuomintang and the people of the whole country for more than fifty years, especially the great sacrifices made during the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. We should cherish this epoch-making harvest all the more!

The so-called epoch-making significance lies in the implementation of constitutional government. What is constitutional government? It is democratic politics implemented in accordance with the constitution. What is a constitution? It is the fundamental law by which the people regulate the government and their own rights and obligations. What the government and the people should do, or should not do, is clearly stipulated in the constitution. When a country has a constitution, the government and the people should jointly abide by the law. Non-compliance with the law is a violation of the constitution.

What is democratic politics? It is politics in which the people are the masters. When such politics are carried out, people with different political views form groups and become political parties. The political party that occupies a majority in the parliament and holds an executive position in the government is the ruling party. The minority party with different political views is the opposition party. Whether it is the ruling party or the opposition party, they must tolerate each other and promote each other under a common goal in order for the constitution to be implemented and for constitutional government to progress. The Chinese Communist Party has become a group of armed rebels against the country. They are enemies of democracy and freedom and are clearly not qualified to be called an opposition party in constitutional government. They clearly have no place in party politics.

The interests of the country are above all else, and the interests of the party are more important than those of party members. The pragmatism of the Kuomintang comrades is for the benefit of the country; the actions of other political parties should also be premised on the interests of the country. The Kuomintang comrades must get used to cooperating with friendly parties and must have the magnanimity to tolerate the opposition party in order to establish a model of democratic politics; other political parties must also have the attitude of mutual forbearance for the sake of the country. Only in this way can we complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The Kuomintang, which founded the country, has a very glorious history, and it must especially use party discipline and bring into play the strength of the party in order to guarantee the completion of the construction of the new China.

Precisely because constitutional government cannot be achieved overnight and there are still many difficulties ahead, the Kuomintang's return of power to the people is not a shirking of responsibility. President Chiang said in his Christmas broadcast that "the implementation of the new constitution is only the initial step in completing our final goal of building a new China." From this, it can be seen that the responsibilities of the Kuomintang and the compatriots across the country are equally great in the future, especially for this generation of young people, who bear the mission of carrying on the past and opening up the future, and their responsibilities are even greater. If we want to be able to shoulder this great responsibility, we must first integrate life and politics, that is, each person's lifestyle must be in harmony with the spirit and methods of democratic politics. This means that everyone must be involved in politics, and at the same time everyone must abide by the law, obey the decisions of the majority, and respect the freedom of others.

Compatriots, comrades! We must know that the current disaster facing the country is the rebellion of the Communist Party. The people must cooperate with the government to quell the rebellion of the Communist Party in order to permanently consolidate national peace and unity and permanently guarantee democracy and freedom. Suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution are our two major tasks at hand. It is hoped that the compatriots and comrades participating in the elections in various places will further promote their ideology, advocate for the people, and quickly complete the responsibility of building the country.

While working hard on the urgent tasks at hand, do not forget the loneliness and hardship of the revolutionary martyrs and the families of the war veterans, and the displacement of our compatriots in the bandit areas. We should comfort them and provide them with relief.

"To have a firm grasp and to act with purpose" is an old saying. "To have a firm grasp" means not to forget the fruits of the difficult creation, and "to act with purpose" means to advance towards a great future. On this day of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, which has epoch-making significance, I would like to encourage my fellow compatriots and comrades to work hard and wish them a happy new year and a bright and promising future!

### Molotov Makes Important Remarks; Hopes for the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference; Compromise on the German Question is Not Impossible; Blames the Failure of the London Conference on the United States

[This newspaper report] London, 31st Broadcast: Moscow News, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today issued a 4,000-word statement to the Soviet press, explaining the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He claimed that the reason why the four powers failed to reach an agreement on the German peace treaty was because the United States was trying to make Germany a bridgehead for American imperialism. The United States' attitude was stubborn, and it insisted on forcing its own opinions on other countries. Bevin and Bidault blindly followed Marshall. They all blamed the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Soviet Union, but in fact, the reason for the failure of this conference was the arbitrary policy of the American ruling class. We only have the option of unconditionally accepting the United States' approach, otherwise, it will be impossible to reach an agreement. This policy of the United States encountered setbacks before the Soviet Union, and the dictatorial policy was the main reason for the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[United Press, London, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov indirectly indicated in a 3,500-word speech on Moscow Radio today that he welcomed the reopening of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and that it was possible to reach an agreement on Germany. Molotov said: "Although there are differences of opinion between countries, if the Yalta and Potsdam agreements can be observed, it is possible to reach a general agreement on the German question." He stated that the Soviet Union was very interested in reopening the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov's speech was in response to inquiries from Soviet reporters about the London Conference, which broke down on December 15th.

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] Foreign Minister Molotov told Soviet reporters today that the rumors of the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference were untrue. The four powers had made progress in their discussions on procedural issues, but the work of the entire conference was undermined by the U.S. delegation, resulting in all previous efforts being wasted.

### The United States Warns the Three Balkan Countries Not to Recognize the Greek Communist Government; May Send Troops to Greece if the Situation Deteriorates

[This newspaper report] New York, 31st Broadcast: Washington News, As the situation in Greece continues to deteriorate, the U.S. State Department and the War Department are very likely to ask Congress to send U.S. combat troops to Greece. Acting Secretary of State Lovett told reporters that future actions will depend on the deterioration of the situation. Senior officials in the War Department expect Congress to make "extremely important decisions" before the end of June, because U.S. economic aid to Greece will come to an end by the end of June. According to the current situation, the Greek government will not be able to eliminate the guerrillas in the country by that time. The last resort for the United States is to send combat troops to Greece.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The United States today issued a note to the Balkan countries controlled by the Soviet Union, telling them that recognizing the Communist "Free Greece" government would violate the United Nations Charter. At the same time, Acting Secretary of State Lovett reiterated the United States' position at a press conference and denounced the Greek Communist guerrillas' claim that they had established a true government in northern Greece. Lovett said that this in itself is not enough to substantially change the current situation, but if other countries recognize this government, it will cause serious repercussions.

Such actions by other countries would be a clear violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter. If one of Greece's northern neighbors recognizes this government, its actions would be a blatant disregard for the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly in October. Lovett's words were a request for the Balkan countries to restore normal diplomatic relations with the reorganized Athens government. Asked what actions would be taken if Greece's northern neighbors recognized the government, he replied that he did not know what actions Greece would take, but expected that it would appeal to the United Nations. Lovett declined to say whether the United States was considering sending troops to Greece to help suppress the Communists, saying that the U.S. government would have to see how the situation develops, and that he could not speculate on what the U.S. would do at this very sensitive time.

[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources say: It is expected that the 5,000 British troops currently stationed in Greece will remain there indefinitely.

### King Michael of Romania Prepares to Leave the Country; Parliament Meets to Prepare for Drafting a New Constitution

[This newspaper report] London, 31st Broadcast: Bucharest, Romania, The royal family of former Romanian King Michael applied to the government today for 60 passports to leave the newly established "People's Democratic Republic." Michael met with Prime Minister Groza for an hour. Groza did not seem to hinder Michael's hope to leave the country. Michael talked about his romance with Princess Anna of Switzerland. The Romanian Parliament met today to hold the swearing-in ceremony for the newly appointed presidium. Cabinet members were present to witness the swearing-in. The army and civil servants expressed their loyalty to the democratic government.

Groza said that the Romanian King's abdication had been considered for a long time and there was nothing new about it. He also said that Romania would strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and the friendly relations with all peace-loving countries to prevent the intrusion of imperialist interests. He said, "We do not want war but want peace, and we will develop our own policies by following the path of true democracy." Groza announced that the royal family's property had been transferred to state ownership, but it is understood that Michael will still receive certain allowances and can immediately obtain US$3 million.

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 31st] The Romanian Parliament convened today to prepare for the drafting of a democratic republican constitution. The first step is to pass a bill to elect a constitutional assembly to draft the new constitution.

Britain and the United States Do Not Attach Importance to Romania's Change of Political System

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials believe that the abdication of Romanian King Michael has relatively little political significance. They believe that the main effect of this matter is only to remove a conspicuous figure in the Eastern European sphere of influence. Michael was the last obstacle to Romania's complete absorption into the Soviet satellite system, but in fact, any major decision of the Romanian government no longer needed Michael's signature to take effect, so Michael's abdication was only a nominal abolition. London Foreign Office officials believe that Michael's abdication is the last unavoidable action in the communistization plan of Eastern Europe. It was long expected that Romania would abolish democracy like Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, replacing it with a Supreme Presidium. This is another example of the "unified policy" currently being implemented in the Balkans. Parisian diplomats believe that Michael's abdication is a prelude to the formation of a "Balkan Federation." The leftist Battle News also stated that when Czechoslovakia holds universal elections on January 15 next year, the Communists will launch a full-scale offensive, which is the true beginning of the "European campaign."

Wallace Issues Seven Points on European Aid Plan; Advocates for the United Nations to Manage Funds

[Reuters, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 31st] Wallace, an independent candidate for the next presidential election, yesterday announced here a seven-point plan to revitalize Europe, advocating that all capable countries should provide assistance, and that the funds should be managed by United Nations agencies. The seven-point plan is as follows: A United Nations Reconstruction Fund. The funds should be managed by a specialized agency of the United Nations. The funds should be jointly raised by the United States and other capable United Nations member states in an amount sufficient for a five-year reconstruction plan. Countries that have been most severely invaded by the Axis powers should be given priority in receiving assistance. Assistance should be based on merit and need, and there should be no discrimination based on political and social conditions. Loans or grants should not be attached to political conditions and should fully respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries. All funds should only be used for peaceful purposes and should not be used to purchase military equipment. The Ruhr industrial heartland should be jointly managed by the four powers internationally, so that its resources can be used to revitalize Europe and ensure that Germany no longer threatens world security.

### Sea Monster Discovered off the Coast of North Carolina; Head Like an Owl, Height of Thirty Feet

### MacArthur Issues New Year's Message; Defends His Policies Toward Japan; Believes Economic Controls are Temporary in Nature

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st] MacArthur issued a New Year's message today, defending his economic policies toward Japan and arousing the sense of responsibility of the Japanese people. He stated that the blueprint for issuing Japan is nearing completion, and future development depends largely on yourselves. You, the people, should exert your utmost efforts. A peace treaty must be concluded as soon as possible to alleviate Japan's poor economy. If your needs continue to exceed your production capacity, then it is necessary to continue to control your domestic economy to prevent the weak among you from dying. But this control must be temporary in nature, and must eventually be lifted to implement free enterprise. The economic policy of the Allied countries requires breaking down the monopoly system of the few financial cliques in Japan in the past. This system deprives the majority and benefits the minority, and cannot be allowed to exist.

[Reuters, St. Louis, Missouri, 30th] Senator Taft delivered a speech here, expressing doubts about whether the Marshall Plan can give Europe the benefits claimed by some authorities. He believes that the United States' export surplus is the main reason for the rise in domestic prices. If Congress passes the Marshall Plan proposed by the government, it will inevitably lead to a rise in prices.

Tojo Continues to be Tried, Testimony is Extremely Cunning; Answers on the Invasion of China are Vague

[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] When the war crimes tribunal interrogated Tojo today, several distinguished guests, including Mrs. MacArthur, attended the hearing. Prosecutor Keenan denounced Tojo's defense statement as "insulting to the court," almost tantamount to restating his wartime propaganda to the Japanese people. Keenan asked, "Do you deny that Japan attempted to assist Hitler in maintaining the new order?" Tojo replied, "I do not mean that. The goals at the time were clearly stipulated in the agreement, which is known to the world." Tojo insisted that he was not aware of the contents of the Munich Agreement. Before leaving the court, when asked how many Japanese troops were sent to China and how many lives were killed in China, Tojo replied, "I cannot remember all of them. If you know, I can answer."

### Paramour Strangled to Death: Claimed Hanging Suicide; Legal Husband Suspected and Reported to the Police; Perpetrator Confessed the Truth

[Our Newspaper Report] On the afternoon of December 26th last year, at approximately 7:00 PM, the Zhabei Police Precinct transferred a murder case from the Republican New Road Police Station to the precinct. The informant, Zhang Rongji, along with his father-in-law, Wang Qiusheng, reported to the station. According to Zhang's statement, he is 29 years old, from Pudong, and works in fashion. He resides at 359 Zhongzheng North First Road. His legal wife is Wang Xiaomei, and their relationship has generally been good. However, due to financial issues, he travels to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, rarely staying home. He heard that his wife had engaged in improper conduct, but lacking evidence, he did not take any action. On the afternoon of the 26th, he received a notification from his father and father-in-law that his legal wife had died at her paramour Wang Afu's residence in the morning. He went to the scene of death with his father-in-law and saw several monks chanting scriptures in the deceased's room. He then learned that his wife had actually hanged herself on the 21st, and the coffin was temporarily at the Taizhou Guild Hall. However, considering that his wife had passed away on the 21st, why was he only notified on the 26th? Suspecting foul play, he reported to the bureau for investigation. After receiving the report, Section Chief Shi instructed Officer Wang Shusheng to investigate. Suspect Wang Afu was brought to the bureau. He admitted to having cohabitated with Wang Xiaomei for several years. Disputes due to financial reasons may have occurred, but he denied any involvement in murder. When questioned about the rope and clothing related to the hanging, he claimed that these inauspicious items had already been burned. He further stated that the deceased had been bedridden since the 18th. On the morning of the 21st, when he returned from shopping, he found her hanging. In a panic, he used scissors to cut the rope, but she was beyond resuscitation. He dared not disclose the incident at the time. It was not until 10:00 PM that he informed his second landlord, his cousin Wang Xiaochai, who then entrusted someone to arrange for the coffin and burial on the morning of the 22nd, and transported the body to the Taizhou Guild Hall for temporary storage. He did not report the incident to the police bureau afterward. Subsequently, the statement of Wang Xiaochai, an accomplice, was generally the same. After reviewing the case, Officer Wang concluded that there was significant suspicion and subjected the suspect to relentless interrogation. The suspect then confessed to the truth of the murder. It turned out that the deceased had married the informant Zhang Rongji in their hometown years ago, and they had been living together for seven years. In 1945, due to economic pressure, Wang Xiaomei started working at the Da Sha Factory in Beiqiao. Wang Afu also worked at the factory as an oiler. Over time, they developed a romantic relationship and cohabitated in the factory dormitory. Later, they both came to Shanghai. Due to the difficulty of finding a place to live, they resided in Wang Afu's cousin Wang Xiaochai's three-story building. Soon, Wang Xiaomei found work at the Anda Sha Factory on Hadoong Road. Subsequently, Xiaomei had another affair and often did not return home, which often led to arguments. Recently, Wang Afu wanted to buy a motorcycle and asked Xiaomei for her savings, but Xiaomei refused. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 8:00 PM, Xiaomei returned home from work, and Afu started another argument. On the morning of the 21st, at 10:00 AM, they fought each other. Xiaomei grabbed Wang Afu's private parts, while Afu choked Xiaomei's throat with his left hand. After more than ten minutes, Xiaomei suffocated to death. After the incident, he secretly discussed with his cousin Xiaochai and colluded with Shao Jincai, and Wang Afu, Zhang Shenwu, and Yao Xiaogou obtained a coffin and privately transported the body to the Taizhou Guild Hall for burial. On the 28th, the bureau arrested the above four accomplices, who all confessed to their involvement. On the morning of the 29th, at 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Liang Shun and forensic doctor Wang Sijian were invited to open the coffin at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. It was determined that Wang Xiaomei had been strangled to death before death. At this point, the truth of the case came to light. The Zhabei Police Precinct has transferred all the suspects to the District Attorney's Office for further investigation.

### Involved in a Fourteen-Year-Old Murder Case: Gu Zhuxuan Declared Not Guilty; Insufficient Evidence to Prove Incitement to Murder

[Our Newspaper Report] In the fourteen-year-old assassination case of Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World entertainment complex, Gu Zhuxuan, a veteran actor of the Tianchan Stage, was suspected of inciting murder. The High Court concluded its retrial, and the verdict was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday. Gu Zhuxuan was not present. Judge Liu Yugui took the stand and read the verdict: "The original judgment is revoked; defendant Gu Zhuxuan is not guilty."

However, the crime committed by occurred in June of the 22nd year of the Republic, while the accusation was made in the 24th year of the Republic, a lapse of two years, which raises doubts about the motive. Reviewing the case , Zhao Guangfu's testimony is inconsistent, with different locations for the meeting to discuss the murder and different amounts for the reward, initially claiming one hundred yuan, then one thousand yuan. The alleged incitement is difficult to believe. As for the , the examination conducted by the former Second Special District Court is consistent, and there is a certificate.

### Northwest Archaeological Team Plans to Study Prehistoric Culture in Gansu and Qinghai

[Our Newspaper News from Lanzhou, 24th] The situation of Mr. Pei Wenzhong, the excavator of "Peking Man", conducting neo-era geological surveys and prehistoric archaeological work in the Taohe and Weihe River basins of Gansu has already been reported in our newspaper. After Pei's twelve boxes of materials obtained in Gansu were transported back by air, they were studied overnight. It was discovered that there are extremely valuable things in this harvest, which has won unanimous attention from archaeologists. Recently, Pei has written articles published in various domestic newspapers, calling on the people of the country to pay attention to archaeological work in the Northwest and not to delay it any longer. In order to realize this archaeological work as soon as possible, the Nanjing General Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Geological Survey Institute and the two branch institutes in Peiping and Lanzhou have organized a "Northwest Archaeological Work Team." Yang Zhongjian, a technician from the Nanjing General Institute, will be the team leader, and Pei Wenzhong, a technician from the Peiping Branch Institute, will be the deputy team leader. They are scheduled to lead the team to Gansu in the spring of next year. May to October will be the survey work period, and after November to the 39th year of the Republic will be the research period (during this period, one or two more surveys may be conducted). The various equipment budgets for organizing the team require approximately 780 million yuan. In addition to the three institutions of the Nanjing General Institute, Peiping, and Lanzhou Branch Institutes sharing the cost, donations must also be raised from enthusiastic people in the country. Regarding the team's work plan after arriving in Gansu, the reporter learned that it will be divided into two steps: preliminary survey and excavation:

### Preliminary Survey

1.  Within Qinghai Province: Starting from Lanzhou to Xining, along the newly built Qingxin Highway, the southern bank of Qinghai Lake, through Dulan and back, then to Guide and return to Lanzhou. The purpose of this survey work is to continue Anderson's work in Machangyuan, Zhujiazhai, and Guide, and to investigate the prehistoric human dwellings and fossil sites around Datong River and Qinghai Lake. It is expected to be completed in one month. 2. Hexi Corridor: Starting from Lanzhou, along the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway through the Hexi Corridor to Dunhuang, and then return to Lanzhou along the same route. The purpose of this survey work is to continue the investigation of Anderson's "Shajing Period" and prehistoric humans in China. It is expected to be completed in one month. 3. Extension Survey Work during Excavation: Part of the personnel will go to Linxia and Lintao to investigate the extension areas of "Qijia" culture and painted pottery culture. The working period is set at 20 days; go to Shuangshipu, Nanzheng, Guangyuan and other places to investigate the relationship between the prehistoric cultures of the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The working period is also set at 20 days.

### Engage in excavation

The excavation work is divided into three areas: 1. Shazhi, Lintao, Linxia Area: This area is an important location for the "Qijia", "Xindian", "Yangshao", "Machang", "Siwa" and other periods and stone-lime dwellings. The excavation work in this area is to study the relationship between the various periods and to obtain complete artifacts and to excavate ancient stone-lime dwellings. The working period is set at 42 days. 2. Area Near Tianshui: The purpose of excavation in this area is to obtain complete objects of the three phases of painted pottery culture in the upper reaches of the Wei River in the area, and to study the interrelationships of the three phases and their relationship with the primitive Chinese culture. The working period is set at 42 days. 3. Lixian and Xihe Area: The main purpose of this area is the same as above. The working period is set at 42 days. 4. Excavation of vertebrate fossils. After the above survey and excavation work is completed, detailed research will be carried out for more than two years. The research results will be published in the Central Geological Survey Institute and Chinese Geological Society publications.

### Ideal Area

The Northwest has a vast land and complex terrain. It is the most ideal area for geological and archaeological work. It has long been noticed by the world academic community. According to reporters, the geologists who studied the Northwest in the past were: the German Richthofen in 1866, who came to various places in the Northwest for geological travel. From 1877 to 1880, the Austrian Ludwig Von Loezg accompanied Duke Sichengyi to China to investigate geology, and worked in Longnan and Lanzhou areas. In 1893, the Russian B·A·Obrutchew came to my country's Northwest for geological surveys. In 1921 and 1923, Xie Jiaye and Yuan Fuli successively investigated the geology of northern Gansu and the vicinity of Lanzhou. From 1923 to 1924, the Swede J·G·Anderson investigated the geology of southwestern Gansu. In 1929, Zhao Yazeng and Huang Fanqing investigated the geology of Qinling. In 1934, Hou Defeng and Sun Jianchu investigated the geology of northern Gansu and the Hexi Corridor. In 1935, Yang Zhongjian and Mei Nian investigated the geology near Lanzhou. In 1938, the American J·M·Weller and the Chinese Sun Jianchu and the Englishman F·AS·uton came to Gansumen and Qinghai Minhe to investigate oil fields. After 1941, the researchers of Northwest geology gradually increased. They include the National Gansu Science Education Hall, the Northwest Branch of the Central Geological Survey Institute (now the Lanzhou Branch Institute), and the Exploration Office of the China Petroleum Company's Gansu-Qinghai Branch Company. They regularly conduct planned research. As for the archaeological work in the Northwest, in 1922, Sang Zhihua and Father PereTeihard obtained many stone tools from the Paleolithic Age in northern Shaanxi and the Hetao area.

### Cultural Relics

In 1924, Anderson obtained pottery cultural relics from the Neolithic Age when he conducted geological surveys in the Taohe River Basin and the Hexi Corridor, which were quite rich. From 1944 to 1945, the excavations of Xia Nai, a researcher at the Institute of History and Research of the Academia Sinica, and Huang Wenbi, a researcher at the Peiping Research Institute, in the Hexi and Taohe River Basins were also quite successful. In 1945, Wang Yongxing, a researcher at the National Gansu Science Education Hall, discovered a large number of vertebrate bone fossils in Wudu, which were once mistakenly rumored to be "Wudu Ape-man", but this batch of mammal fossils has a helpful reference value and cannot be ignored. From June to November this year, Pei Wenzhong, a technician at the Peiping Branch of the Central Geological Survey Institute, and Mi Taiheng, a technician at the Lanzhou Branch Institute, conducted prehistoric cultural archeology in the Taohe River, Weihe River, Xihanshui River, and the vicinity of Lanzhou, which was the guidance for this expanded organization "Northwest Archaeological Work Team" to conduct systematic surveys and excavations.

### Team Member Issues

Although the list of team members of this work team has not yet been announced, it must include domestic experts in prehistoric archeology, paleontology, fossil anthropology, anatomy, geology, soil science, history, etc. As for the core of the Neogene Research Office of the Central Geological Survey Institute, there may also be foreign scholars and experts to participate in joint work. In a recent speech, Mr. Pei Wenzhong said that the archaeological work in Gansu this year has not solved any problems, but has raised many problems. We welcome the scholars and experts of the "Northwest Archaeological Work Team" to come together to solve these problems related to the progress of human culture and to enhance my country's academic status in the world!

New Year's Greetings and Spring Awakening Bai Yong
"If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" This famous line by the British poet has now almost become a cliché. But at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, we cannot be without this hope and premonition. This year's winter cold is said to be the most severe in seventy years. Chinese meteorologists, whom I don't quite dare to believe, clearly remember that not long ago they published warm news in the newspapers that there would be no winter this year. How long has it been before the Siberian cold current came, with a heavy snow, and frozen bones on the road, causing students from various universities to run around the streets, soliciting warm clothing. Now the New Year has arrived. According to the Chinese way of saying, after New Year's Eve is the new spring, "the handle of the Big Dipper points to Yin," "a new beginning," as if from the first day of the first lunar month, even the willow branches have changed color, and naturally the heart will be lazy. Shelley's famous line, saying it is just right. But it won't work in the Gregorian calendar. The Western calendar is awkward, and December, January, and February are taken as winter. Therefore, although it is New Year's greetings, spring has not yet arrived, and "the second Siberian anti-cyclone is in progress," we feel that "spring" is still far away.
Waiting is the most unbearable thing. Young men and women have probably all experienced it. If there is no hope, then it is okay, but it is annoying to have hope but it is unlikely to be realized. That which is enough to make people feel short of breath and anxious is almost the same as when something comes to a head and becomes a phantom bubble. The ancients once said, "Waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will a person's life be?" This led to a pessimistic aversion to the world. In the past, the leisure class created a kind of "Nine-Nine Cold Dispelling Chart," for example, "In front of the pavilion, drooping willows cherish the spring breeze" has a total of nine characters, each character has nine strokes, a total of eighty-one strokes, drawn into double hooks, starting from "counting nine," filling in one stroke every day. After "the river opens in the seventh nine, the geese come in the eighth nine," this method of gradually cutting off time is very good, at least it can dispel our loneliness of waiting, and thus reduce much pain. Although that is also often a sign for wealthy friends to eat mutton hot pot and guess poem riddles.

It is better to find some work than to wait idly. The ancients said, "The sun and moon pass away, time does not wait for me," which is a very sad saying and should not be regarded as a common literary cliché. Just imagine how much good time in our lives has been lost in waiting. Assuming that the time is gathered together, it must be an alarming number. It is common to see many foreigners reading and chanting incessantly on traveling boats, while we are impatient, looking around, accomplishing nothing. Nowadays, many female students knit woolen yarn while listening to lectures, using both hands and brains, which is extremely economical and should be promoted, and should not be rejected by the director of discipline as illegal. If I could use the "boring" time every day to do some serious work, I would probably have become an expert long ago, and would not have to write this boring text in the newspaper's rear end.

However, the Chinese methods of killing time while waiting are various kinds of gambling and eating and drinking, and the New Year is the most prominent of these. Someone once used Suzhou people eating melon seeds as a topic to praise the greatness of the Chinese spirit of perseverance, but unfortunately it is only used for shelling melon seeds, and not for studying apples falling to the ground or boiling water rushing tea, which has made Chinese mahjong more mysterious than foreign poker. Even New York clubs regard mahjong as the most interesting pastime, and Chinese students who make a living by teaching mahjong are also doing great work. Let's not talk about that for now. What will happen if we finally wait for it? Will the beautiful spring scenery really bring warmth? Or will we be able to "strive to love the glory of spring" and take action? It is a bit unpredictable. Wang Yuyang's Miscellaneous Poems of Jinling have a few lines that I still remember: "Ten days of rain threads and wind slices, the sunny spring scenery resembles a bleak autumn." This is not necessarily better. Sadness for spring and sorrow seem to be not just a Chinese disease. The whole world does not lack this kind of climate and young masters and beautiful women with many worries and illnesses. As for work, that's even more interesting. There is originally a jingle called "Spring is not a time for reading." If you don't read, then what do you do? "A young woman is in love with spring, a good man entices her." Clearly, it has again come to a moral issue, so it's best not to talk about it.

On Foolishness Xuan Xuan
Dancers have a bold style and can say what ordinary women dare not say publicly, which is called "thirteen points"; seeing someone jump into the river, risking their own life to save the person from drowning, or encountering a robber, daring to resist, and thus being shot by the robber, is called "foolish". The former is just doing too much, with no major crime. The latter is simply a modern gentleman, and a friend who cannot be subdued by force, and is indeed worthy of praise; but both are called "thirteen points", and "foolish".

"Foolishness" is a derogatory term used by the weak to scold people. Seeing someone die without helping, and seeing someone else saving them, they always feel uncomfortable, which is also a slight guilt. In order to explain themselves, they scold the rescuer as "foolish", so they have a legitimate reason for not helping. On the one hand, they laugh at the rescuer as naive, and on the other hand, they feel that they are worldly and will never do such a boring thing.

"Thirteen points" is a derogatory term used by mediocre people to scold people. Drifting with the tide and living in a muddle, they sigh at their inferiority when they occasionally see someone being serious. But these mediocre people have the habit of "fearing poverty when seeing others become rich." Although they sigh at their inferiority, they still want to say that they are good, but there is really nothing good to say, so they can only say that others are doing too much, and only they are just right, so they scold others as "thirteen points." Thus, those who are not afraid of breaking their rice bowls and exposing the corruption of their superiors are "thirteen points." Others muddle through, but they alone are honest and self-respecting, which is also thirteen points. Broadly speaking, all loyal ministers, righteous men, saints, and sages in the world are nothing but "thirteen points."

Whether the occupation of a dancer is proper is another question, but since they are dancers, is it not right to try to give full play to the spirit of a professional dancer in order to attract more customers? Just like a polite barber shop owner serving tea and cigarettes to customers, being attentive in every way, it is the same with professional ethics.

Not good enough themselves, they dislike others for going too far. Others fulfill their duties, but they can't even do the bare minimum, so they become more and more angry and scold others as "thirteen points", and "foolish".

Shaw's Contradictions Mao Yi
"War is one of the most malicious stumbling blocks to the public...I do not agree with using war as an excuse for any such unconscious slaughter and destruction." – Said by Shaw in 1917, when the First European War was in full swing.

"Why should we stop war? Is it an evil? War is a method of killing, and in this world, there are many, many people who should be killed off." – Said by Shaw in 1934, when Hitler's arrogance was at its peak.

"Surplus value, or what you call capital, is the root of all evil."

"Money is the most important things in the world. It stands for health, strength, honor, generosity, and beauty."

"There is no religion in the world that an intelligent person can believe in." – This was said by Shaw in 1906.

"Culture needs a religion, just like the problem of life and death." – This was said by Shaw fifteen years later.

"An educated person is more annoying than an uneducated person."

"The public schools established by the various classes in the United States are one of the most valuable organizations."

New Year's Fun Tong Tuo
When I was young, I liked the New Year because I didn't have to go to school to study and could play at home as much as I wanted. Besides, there was food and drink. In the countryside, which was very far away from the city, there was no new entertainment throughout the year. The only thing was that during the New Year, I could watch monkey shows, wooden puppet shows, and temporary stage shows, which were economical and practical. Compared to today's urban children, who are happy to squeeze in every time they see monkeys running staggeringly in wire cages in a park; who applaud and welcome every time they see a string puppet show in a noble Western-style building...etc., the New Year's entertainment in the countryside in the past was ahead of the times and could shame the lives of today's urban children.

However, as I grew older, the fun of the New Year gradually decreased. First, I felt a headache for the New Year's messages published in the newspapers, which were all the same, talking back and forth, and could not come up with anything other than the "firecrackers bid farewell to the old, peach charms update thousands of households" type of Buddha's palm. Second, many people today are probably still yearning for the old lunar New Year. Therefore, some people say that the Gregorian New Year is the "official" New Year. Whenever something is stained with "official" air, there is very little warmth, leisure, humor, and casual atmosphere. The third reason is because I have become a father, and it seems that I should be more generous with my children's requests, especially during the New Year. For example, they want New Year's cards, want to see the Snow White movie, want to buy a revolving lantern, would you be embarrassed to be stingy and not agree to one of their requests? And there are still problems with your year-end bonus, still talking about how many percent it will be. After the percentage is properly studied, you still have to wait for the lunar New Year to open. May I ask how you can have spare money to meet your children's requests at this time? Based on various reasons, my New Year's fun decreases in inverse proportion to the increase in age.

Therefore, some people want to gamble and drink heavily during the New Year. The more fashionable ones in the city dance all night. They do this to reduce the stimulation of the passage of time caused by the arrival of the New Year – those who are a little neurotic will have the feeling of "increasing in age without accomplishment" – so they try to obtain sensory anesthesia, such as gambling, drinking, dancing – fine wine, women, and calling out dice throws are all ways to temporarily anesthetize you. The so-called "sorrow of the floating world" is rarely encountered in places of extravagance and dissipation. However, when a gambler steps onto the street in the light of dawn, a drunkard dreams back after vomiting and making a mess, and a dancer, with sleeves drooping and rubbing sleepy eyes, jumps into a car, when firecrackers are crackling all around, they will occasionally wake up in their minds, "Oh, it's another year!"

However, I am an optimist. I always want to find hope in hopeless places and find light in dark places. Therefore, I also look for fun in the New Year, which has no fun. After searching, I actually found the fun of the New Year. That is, there are three days off for the New Year, and I don't have to go to the office. I can comfortably let you connect and get up late for three days – in this cold weather, may I ask what is the greatest fun besides sleeping soundly under the covers, not being restricted by office hours, and getting up leisurely when the sun is high? And this greatest fun is what the New Year gives. However, this matter can only be discussed with colleagues who go to the office every day. If the boss class hears it, I am afraid they will laugh at us for being stingy.

Law Wang Baili
Laws (this article includes various decrees) are formulated according to actual circumstances, and the people rely on them as a guideline. However, today's laws are dominated by a precarious era, and they are often divorced from reality, but sometimes they are completely implemented according to the explicit provisions of the law. The public says it is reasonable, and the mother-in-law also says it is reasonable, making the people truly feel the sorrow of the Yuan Dynasty's lyrics, "Between right and wrong, a concubine's affairs are always difficult!" Take the crime of injury as an example: The criminal law originally had a fine of one thousand yuan for the crime of injury. One thousand yuan at the time of drafting the law could buy one hundred piculs of rice. Now, according to the law, the fine can only buy one flatbread. If calculated according to the price of rice, then the one thousand yuan fine should now be changed to one hundred million yuan. However, I have never heard of a court making such a judgment. Although courts have also increased the fine to three or five hundred thousand yuan, it is still too far from the current reality. No wonder there are more and more people who commit the crime of assault, because they don't care about the fine. Is such a "lenient sentence" the same as the ancient meaning of showing shame with a leather whip? However, showing shame with a leather whip is only a matter of etiquette, not the rule of law. The Analects of Confucius says: "The knowledge of ordinary people can see what has already happened, but cannot see what is about to happen. Etiquette prevents what is about to happen, while law governs what has already happened." Therefore, although etiquette and law have different paths but the same goal, they cannot be treated as the same thing, especially under today's circumstances. I think that everything now talks about the cost of living index, so all the amounts in the law should also be calculated according to the cost of living index to be fair. However, the fact is not always the case. For example, if the government finds silver dollars hidden by the people, if they simply confiscate them, then the people will lose all hope. However, the government purchases them at a one-to-one exchange rate. Can you say that the government does not pay attention to the law? Furthermore, when people who have contributed to the country die, the government grants them honor and a special pension of 30,000 legal currency. If you go to collect it, it is not enough for the travel expenses. If you don't go to collect it, you will be betraying the country's grace, which is truly laughable and ridiculous. However, the people's taxes to the government are calculated thousands or hundreds of times more. Recently, there was a case of defamation. The plaintiff demanded that the defendant compensate for a loss of one legal currency, but the defendant "generously" offered to give 1,000 legal currency in court. The plaintiff said that the lawsuit was not for money, but for reputation, so 1,000 yuan was not accepted, and only one yuan was enough. This is based on the law, and no one can say that he is stubborn. However, the defendant "generously opened his wallet" and was willing to increase the compensation for the loss by 999 times. Can you still say that he is not generous? One is "humble and yielding", and the other is "generous". Since lawsuits have been fought, I have never seen such "well-matched" opponents, which can be called unprecedented and unmatched in the future. Mencius said, "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in books," because the facts in books are not very reliable. I think it is better to have no law than to have a law that is divorced from reality. The annotation is: A law that is divorced from reality will only cause righteous people to suffer.

Various Aspects of Sweden Xu Tonghua
The country of Sweden is long and narrow, extending for nine hundred and seventy-eight miles, with no point in the year exceeding three hundred and ten miles in width. Its coastline is roughly similar in length to that of the United States. Within Sweden's territory, 9% is lakes and 15% lies within the Arctic Circle.

During the summer months, Swedes often head south to escape the heat, where temperatures typically range between sixty-eight and seventy degrees Fahrenheit, allowing them to bask in the sun's rays.

A foreigner visiting Sweden for the first time is likely to be struck by two things: the high cost of living and the prevalence of beautiful women.

Sweden is a nation that emphasizes etiquette and formality. When introduced to someone, you should bow twice in quick succession. If you attend a banquet, you are expected to shake hands with the host after the meal to offer your thanks formally. Furthermore, should you encounter a friend who has recently entertained you, you must greet them and say "Tack for sist," a Swedish phrase that translates to "Thank you for the last time you welcomed me as a guest; it was very enjoyable."

Swedes have a large capacity for alcohol and often drink from large glasses in one go. At banquets, women generally do not drink, but they may make an exception after being strongly encouraged by the host.

Fleeting Flowers Chen Shengyan
Chapter 6: Such a Fine Night (31)

Zhu Zhai waved his hands repeatedly and said, "I'm not worthy." Qi Huan said, "You are worthy of everything except one thing, your marriage is too out of touch with the times. Perhaps my view is incorrect." Zhu Zhai took a sip of wine, nodded and said, "What you say is absolutely correct. This is my life's regret, the most helpless thing!" Qi Huan said, "What you think is the most helpless thing, I think is the easiest thing to solve. You don't have any children, only your wife." Zhu Zhai said, "Yes." Qi Huan said, "Then what's the difficulty!" As she said this, she glanced at Zhu Zhai, picked up her wine glass, drank half a glass of wine herself, put down the glass, and continued to look at Zhu Zhai's face. Zhu Zhai had already raised his wine glass, but then put it down again, nodded and said, "You say it's not difficult, please tell me what good method is there?" Qi Huan shook her head and said, "How can I say this! It's wrong to break up other people's families." Zhu Zhai said, "I understand, you're saying that I can divorce her, right? This matter is very difficult for me." Qi Huan said, "I want to express a point of view. I think the most important thing in life is that the spirit can be comforted. Whether rich or poor, if you can get a like-minded partner and cooperate with them, even if you live a difficult life, the spirit is happy. Life is short, why make yourself suffer!" Zhu Zhai said, "You're right about this point, but I have parents above me. Besides, my wife has not lost her virtue, so what reason do I have to divorce her?" Qi Huan smiled and said, "Hearing you say this, I see that you have a kind and honest heart. The newspapers publish divorce announcements every day. Have these people all lost their virtue and have no parents?" Zhu Zhai was asked by her and couldn't help but laugh. Qi Huan said, "Then you should be fined a cup." Zhu Zhai immediately drank the cup of wine in front of him, put down the glass, and still frowned. Qi Huan said, "Don't take this problem too seriously. It's my fault for mentioning this, making you sad. I'm leaving tomorrow, so let's not talk about this, let's drink a few more cups!" Zhu Zhai said, "Qi Huan, you shouldn't drink so much, your voice is important." Qi Huan shook her head and said, "It doesn't matter, what value is there in maintaining this voice of mine!" Zhu Zhai said, "Why are you suddenly complaining today?" Qi Huan patted her chest with her hand and said, "I have an unspeakable sadness in my heart." As she said this, she drank another cup of wine in front of her! Zhu Zhai said, "I advise you not to drink anymore." Qi Huan said, "It doesn't matter, my brothers and sisters-in-law at home can all drink. You have a cup too. Why are you so depressed tonight? If you drink another cup, I still have something to tell you."

New Year's Reflections Xu Jin
(1) Farmer
Don't say that this year is the "Year of the Rat," city foxes are easy to chase away, but rural shrines are difficult to move; after the village catastrophe, it is desolate, but there are still farmers working hard in the fields.

(2) Worker
The words "labor is sacred" are not a lie, material civilization originates from this; the most important thing is the construction in the New Year, seeking housing in the face of the "hundred buildings" shortage.

(3) Merchant
Rice is as precious as pearls, and cinnamon is used to pass the New Year, with wailing wild geese entering the market; slightly happy that there are no unusual events in the New Year, only rumors that "American goods" will help merchants through difficulties.

Great Sympathy Zhong Ming
When our school launched a campaign to raise warm clothing to help the disaster-stricken compatriots, I joined on the first day. During these few days, I traveled all over the bustling urban area of Shanghai, ran through many theaters and restaurants, and contacted many Shanghainese.

In the course of our generally smooth fundraising efforts, I discovered that the rich are not as stingy and devoid of sympathy as rumored; on the contrary, when I peddled "relief tickets" to them, they all expressed sympathy and generously bought a few. Although two classmates also encountered several "exceptional" figures, mostly because they had "very little left" in their pockets, or "another classmate had already come to solicit donations"; and there were even many people who appeared hesitant and bewildered when donating because they doubted whether the money donated would all benefit the disaster-stricken compatriots.

But it is worth mentioning that, in terms of the overall situation of our work, the efforts and sympathy shown by the poor and several soldiers were indeed even more outstanding. In particular, two people who looked like small workers were even more commendable, as they chased after us after we had passed by and donated all the money in their pockets. Another soldier also said to us, "I have already donated my body to the country, what is so rare about donating a few coins to the poor disaster-stricken compatriots!" I was very moved when I heard this and felt infinite respect for this patriotic and caring soldier.

Through the past two days of fundraising, I feel that there is plenty of sympathy and warmth in the world. "Great sympathy" should be able to make the world beautiful, lovely, prosperous, and happy.

Finally, I feel that if the fundraising work of various schools can be properly improved so that the people who donate can deeply trust that none of the money they give is wasted and that none of it fails to reach the disaster-stricken compatriots, then the relief work will surely have a more perfect harvest.

Two New Year's Days Jie Ding
In the blink of an eye, it's the Gregorian New Year. However, apart from holidays for government agencies and schools, and the end of the year for banks and companies, the general public doesn't really care much about this "New Year." In the countryside, in particular, one cannot see any so-called "New Year's atmosphere." It is really too shameful that the national calendar, which has been promoted for thirty-six years, has only reached a very small scope.

Logically speaking, the Gregorian calendar is much more convenient than the lunar calendar. For example, the Gregorian calendar has a "leap" every three years, and the leap year only has one "leap" day in February, unlike the lunar calendar, which has to have a leap month, and you have to check the almanac to know which month it is in. The Gregorian calendar has more regular months with more or fewer days, and the solar terms are also more regular. Of course, the Gregorian calendar also has unreasonable aspects, such as the difference in the number of days in a month, with too few days in February and one extra day in August, but it is still much better than the lunar calendar.

However, farmers (not only farmers) still use the lunar calendar of their ancestors two thousand years ago, and literary people and scholars also love to call the "old calendar" and "abolished calendar" the "Xia calendar" and "agricultural calendar," adding the year and day of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. Farmers still use their own experience to look at the moon and determine that today is the first day or the middle of the month, and plant and harvest according to the old calendar. I also celebrate my birthday according to the old calendar.

In reality, this is also the case. The Christian Era of Jesus and the Sabbath of Jehovah have nothing to do with hired workers, tenant farmers, small farmers, and small shop owners. Therefore, government agencies and schools can take their holidays as much as they want, and set off firecrackers, go to theaters, and carry lanterns on New Year's Day, but the general public still does their business as usual and goes to their work. On the other hand, when the end of the lunar year comes, they settle accounts, collect debts, urge payment of grain and rent, press for debts, receive lucky money, send off the kitchen god, get rid of the old and welcome the god of wealth, pay New Year's visits, have guests, put on lanterns to welcome the gods, put on operas, celebrate the Lantern Festival, and play with lanterns, making a lot of noise for a month or two. Even civil servants and students cannot help but play along with the "customs."

In the past, in order to promote the national calendar, there were no holidays for the old lunar New Year. Now, even this cannot be done. The "Spring Festival holiday" is also carried out in a grand manner. Is this because they cannot resist the conservatism of the farmers, or because they do not have the perseverance to continue promoting it? As a result, two New Year's Days are still celebrated every year, and two New Year's Days are celebrated every year.

The power of the old calendar is so great.

In fact, it was a bit unimaginable to force the Western Gregorian calendar on Chinese farmers at the beginning. Chinese farmers do not have the blessing of resting one day every seven days, and it is enough to look at the moon to accurately calculate the days. The general masters can rest every day and live in a muddle-headed way, and they do not need the lunar calendar either.

The system is like this, how can other things not be like this? The complete acceptance of the Europeanization of China is another miserable failure here.

If "reform" always encounters such experiences, it is a bit chilling.

New Year's Message Cheng Qian
Time flies easily, and the scenery changes. The thirty-sixth year has passed imperceptibly. The New Year's Day of the Republic of China's thirty-seventh year has arrived suddenly. Recalling the past and hoping for the future is truly something to be happy about and to be vigilant about.

Since the government issued the mobilization order last year to intensify the suppression of the rebellion, the communist bandits, after being defeated, still struggled desperately, spreading to Northeast China, North China, and Central China. The compatriots in the occupied areas were either displaced, brutally massacred, or coerced into becoming bandits. The compatriots in the rear were also under the wartime system due to the national general mobilization, everything for suppressing bandits, everything for the front line, and could not restore the normal life of peacetime, living and working in peace and contentment. Opening the calendar of last year, there are many bloodstains and tear marks. Grieving for our people and caressing our rivers and mountains is truly infinitely heartbreaking and unbearable to look back on. At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone hoped that the world would be peaceful from then on, and that the people would yearn for governance. Who would have known that there would be today's tragic situation? Now, in the new year, everyone naturally has the same feeling, but grieving recollections and chronic expectations cannot engage in construction and enjoy the happiness of strength and health. Therefore, whether this wish can be realized in the newly arrived year depends on whether the people of the whole country can rectify their spirits and work together to suppress the rebellion.

The general mobilization order was issued earlier. The government originally did not want to burden the people again, and made compromises in the hope of the communist bandits' enlightenment. The result was the opposite. Therefore, it was an unavoidable measure to send out troops and launch a large-scale campaign. The people of the country should also deeply understand that the communist bandits do not want to see the peaceful construction of the country. Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance, they launched wars, expanded destruction, created chaos, promoted economic terror, and caused people's hearts to be restless in order to achieve their sinister plan of causing the country to collapse and perish. The government cannot tolerate these inhuman and brutal thugs. Even if it is broad-minded, the communist bandits themselves have no room for compromise. The government and the people of the country can only stop war with force, stop cruelty with benevolence, stop cunning with good faith, stop cowardice with loyalty and courage, stop looting with purity, and stop licentiousness with chastity, in order to escape from death and embark on the open road to national construction. However, most people in the country do not pay attention to rectifying their spirits, thinking that the country's manpower and material resources are abundant, and there is no doubt that the communist bandits will be eliminated. However, they do not know that rectifying their spirits is closely related to suppressing bandits and wars. If the spirit cannot be rectified, the future of suppressing the rebellion will be greatly affected. The unreasonable communist bandits, their behavior is not surprising, but the eight-year War of Resistance caused the society to develop abnormally, and laws and morals inevitably deviated from the norm. The psychology of ordinary people fluctuated. Therefore, in my New Year's message in the 35th year of the Republic of China, I warned the people of the country that they must not be complacent after the victory of the War of Resistance. From the government to the common people, everyone should be diligent and vigilant, reflect together, check the past and present, and fulfill their respective duties in order to eliminate the hidden disasters within. Unexpectedly, the situation in the past two years has indeed not been beyond my expectations, and the things of speculation and profiteering and committing crimes have emerged one after another. Once victory arrives, people's hearts become even more restless, greedy and insatiable, and monopolizing profits and competing for power promote social unrest and order is ruined, giving the communist bandits an opportunity to take advantage of. A glorious era has once again evolved into a tragic era. This situation is certainly caused by the communist bandits' insanity, but how can people with abnormal psychology not have a responsibility? Moreover, under the current situation, a few lawless people are still living in a drunken dream, still not realizing the seriousness of the situation, the sword is already approaching their eyebrows, and they are still indifferent to the suppression of the rebellion, still treating the country as if they do not see it, and are completely unaware of their own safety and the permanent interests, only focusing on how to engage in corruption and pervert the law to feed themselves, how to squeeze the good and enjoy themselves, how to maintain their vested interests, and scheming in every possible way. If one person is like this, most people are like this, forming a group of evil forces in society. People with weak will cannot withstand the suffering of life, and then flock to follow the trend. As for those who are unwilling to degenerate, they are pessimistic and frustrated, bewildered and distressed, so that they cannot distinguish between right and wrong, and righteousness declines. They do not know that this is what the communist bandits hope for, this is helping the communist bandits, this is digging our own graves.

We examine the rampant rebellion in recent years, the reason why it cannot be quickly quelled, and we must admit that the corruption and deterioration of people's hearts in society is an important factor.

Law and morality are the standards of human behavior and the foundation of social evolution. By observing the law and advocating morality, there can be fairness and righteousness in society. With fairness and righteousness, there will never be the emergence of communist bandits who are without fairness and without righteousness. However, for corrupt officials, local bullies, and unscrupulous merchants who manipulate the market, the law can hardly stop their behavior, and morality cannot change their concepts. They do not care about their bodies, minds, lives, or safety, and it is not easy to bring them back to harmony and dignity. However, saving the disaster is only a matter of a change of heart. What is so difficult about that? The secret is in the sixteen characters passed down through the ages (the human mind is perilous, the moral mind is subtle, be precise and single-minded, and sincerely hold the mean.) All laws and morals are based on this. Indeed, all problems in the world contain various factors. Expand it and fill it, that is the myriad of chaotic things. Lead and simplify it, it still returns to the wonderful use of one heart. Starting from one truth to start using it is to leave human desires to unite with the will of heaven. If the human mind always obeys the moral mind, daily life and common sense will naturally not have excessive or insufficient differences. If the moral mind is established, human beings will always live together in a harmonious, beautiful, and equal environment, and there will never be a catastrophic change. Even if there is, it will be easy to quell. The abnormal development of personal selfish desires will naturally not be needed. Now, no one is not terrified of the communist bandits, but the people of the country have not realized the reasons for the formation of the communist bandits and the methods of eliminating them. This is truly a great crisis. The ancients said: "Attacking a city is inferior, attacking the heart is superior, a complete army is inferior, a complete country is superior." This is the wonderful trick for suppressing the rebellion today. However, my intention is to go a step further, overcoming others is inferior, overcoming oneself is superior, completing things is inferior, completing the heart is superior, because attacking the heart and completing the country is a noble strategy and political strategy that develops outward, and overcoming oneself and completing the heart is developing inward, cultivating the new life of the universe. Darwin once said, "Human beings are always more sensitive to the immediate reality, and selfish psychology is brought from nature, so most people cannot be independent." People with mediocre talents or below cannot withstand the oppression and temptation of the environment, so they cannot avoid reversing cause and effect, the moral mind is dominated by the human mind, once the dam collapses, it will overflow horizontally without end, wanting to avoid the slaughter every day, but constantly creating killing opportunities, the denser the killing opportunities, the more difficult it is to avoid them, ending up dying together after drunkenness, the crystallization of the development of personal selfish desires throughout their lives, who knows where they will be at that time? Therefore, I hope that everyone will pull back from the brink of the precipice and turn back as soon as possible, the mind is none other than the self-nature precept, the mind has no ignorance, the self-nature is wise, the mind has no chaos, the self-nature is stable, not afraid of thousands of feet high, as long as you stand firmly on your feet, this is the thorough rectification of the spirit, this is the fundamental plan to save the country, the family, and oneself, and the meaning of life, "Cultivating one's heavenly nobility and the people will follow," enjoying both spiritual and material enjoyment at the same time, wouldn't that be very good? Otherwise, eliminate a part of the communist bandits, and there are still countless communist bandits in their hearts, eliminate a part of the burning, killing, looting, and there are still countless burning, killing, looting in their hearts, and the great cause of suppressing the rebellion will never be fundamentally solved, because everyone cannot exert the power of their whole heart, and relying solely on material resources, the power will be very weak. In the past, the spirit power accounted for 70% of the revolution and the victory over the Japanese invaders, while the material power only accounted for 30%, which is proof that spirit triumphs over matter. The Founding Father said

Celebrating the Founding of the Nation and the Implementation of the Constitution  by Fang Zhi

Today is the first day of the 37th year of the Republic of China. It is the anniversary of the founding of our nation, when our Founding Father led the revolution, overthrew the Manchu Qing imperial system, and established the Republic of China. It is also the beginning of constitutional governance, and all the people of China will henceforth embark on the road to democracy, freedom, happiness, and prosperity, ushering in a new year for the nation's destiny. In these times of comforting the people and saving the nation, when the entire country is mobilized for the suppression of the rebellion, as we face this double celebration, we reflect on the past fifty years of arduous struggle, which have finally led us to the goal of the revolution: returning power to the people and implementing a government by all the people. We are truly joyful and elated, and the whole world celebrates together. However, as we assess the current situation and look to the future, we deeply feel the arduousness of our future responsibilities. How much more should we strive and work hard to complete the unfinished task of our revolution?

Since the Manchu Qing entered the pass, all our compatriots have been subjected to the iron heel of autocratic rule, suffering endless pain and hardship, living an inhuman existence worse than that of cattle and horses for over two hundred years. Our Founding Father, to save the nation and its people, led the revolution with his great wisdom, benevolence, and courage, running around and appealing to the masses. Despite ten failures, his will was not diminished in the slightest. Finally, in the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai year, he overthrew the deeply rooted Manchu Qing imperial system, rescued our compatriots from fire and water, and established the Republic of China, forever leaving this glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation.

Since the founding of the Republic of China, for more than thirty years until today, although the autocratic system of monarchy has been overthrown, warlord separatism and the aggression of powerful neighbors have followed one after another. For more than thirty years, it can be said that not a single day has passed without the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, democracy and anti-democracy. Such as the punitive expedition against Yuan Shikai, the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits, and the War of Resistance against Japan, the Founding Father led the way in the front, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek succeeded him from behind, struggling arduously and persevering with fortitude, always striving to fight for the independence, freedom, and equality of the country, and to establish a new China based on the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people. In such a time of domestic worries, foreign troubles, and repeated national disasters, we finally completed the drafting of the Constitution with hardship the year before last, and this year, we are implementing the Constitution amidst banditry. Our government's hard work and spirit in striving for democratic constitutionalism are worthy of our gratitude and admiration. At the same time, today, the goal of our Founding Father's lifelong revolutionary efforts, the dedication and struggle of our party for more than fifty years, and the wishes of the people of the whole country, which they have sought day and night – the implementation of constitutional governance – are now announced to the nation as a reality.

This is an epoch-making advancement and success in China's three thousand years of political history. From now on, we can see the brilliance of democratic constitutionalism, we can truly enjoy the happiness of democratic constitutionalism, our civil rights and obligations are guaranteed, and our nation will henceforth be a vigorous and dynamic entity. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his Christmas broadcast last year, declared to us: "The thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, that is, Christmas of the year 1947 of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when a unified, independent, equal, and free new opportunity for the Republic of China and all its people begins. The characteristic of our new Constitution is that it guarantees to give to our compatriots throughout the country the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, the dignity and freedom of the individual, universally. This new Constitution affirms the various rights of all citizens, and under national unity and freedom, the spirit of a self-governing people is conceived and born." Looking back on the hardships of more than fifty years of revolutionary struggle, and looking forward to the bright future ahead, on this day of celebration, we truly cannot describe the praise, joy, and excitement in our hearts.

However, while we are enthusiastically celebrating the implementation of the Constitution, we should also be more vigilant about the counter-revolutionary, anti-unification, and anti-democratic forces, who have been undermining the law, disrupting order, harming the country, and endangering the people, that the revolution has encountered in the past fifty years. Today, they are rampant in the Northeast and other parts of our territory. In those so-called "liberated areas," our compatriots not only cannot see the brilliance of democratic constitutionalism and receive the warmth of democratic constitutionalism, but also, under the iron heel of the communist bandits, their lives and property can be destroyed at any time. If we do not eliminate the communist bandits for even one day, then not only will the benefits of our constitutional governance not be universally enjoyed by our compatriots across the country, but also the concrete spirit of our government by all the people will have no way to be expressed. In the past few decades, due to the obstruction of the general counter-revolutionary feudal forces, the provisional constitution of the founding of the Republic of China and all the autonomous codes of the past could not be thoroughly implemented. This is the lesson we should learn from the past. At the same time, the communist bandits of today are not only an obstacle to the implementation of the Constitution, but also traitors who betray the country and violate the Constitution. The Constitution is the fundamental code of the nation that all our people have jointly formulated and abide by. Whoever violates the Constitution betrays all the people of the country. Therefore, the communist bandits are even more the public enemy of all our people.

In order to safeguard the Constitution, to ensure the universal and thorough implementation of the Constitution, and to eliminate the traitors of our free and happy nation and country who are harming us, on this day of the implementation of the Constitution, we must, with twelve thousand percent sincerity, that is, twelve thousand percent urgency, demand the intensification of the suppression of the rebellion. All our people, all our compatriots who seek democracy and freedom, should rise up in unison, under the call of the government, mobilize all manpower and resources, strengthen our military, political, economic, and cultural efforts to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion, and even our moral and public sentiment, in order to accelerate the success of our work to suppress the rebellion. That way, the brilliance of our democratic constitutionalism will be able to shine universally throughout the country sooner. Today, as we celebrate the implementation of the Constitution, we approach the bright future with joy. But we should also recognize that drafting a constitution is difficult, and implementing it is even more difficult. We should be vigilant that today's implementation of the Constitution is only the first step in our struggle for democratic constitutionalism. Our road ahead is still full of thorns. We should carry forward the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice and struggle of the past fifty years to remove all obstacles to the implementation of the Constitution and to safeguard the Constitution in order to complete the construction of our new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his Christmas broadcast last year: "I believe that the implementation of the new Constitution is only the first step in achieving our ultimate goal of building a new China." This is what we should deeply be vigilant about, deeply examine, and deeply strive for today, when we are joyfully, excitedly, and enthusiastically celebrating the founding of the nation and the implementation of the Constitution.

### Implementation of the Constitution and Suppression of the Rebellion: An Announcement to the Citizens from All Circles in Shanghai Celebrating the 37th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China and the Inauguration of Constitutional Government

Fellow citizens of the city!

Today is the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year's Day after the implementation of the Constitution. As we commemorate this auspicious festival while the whole country is mobilized to suppress the rebellion, and at the same time celebrate the implementation of the Constitution, it has a particularly significant meaning.

At the beginning of this constitutional governance, we must deeply understand that nation-building must begin with constitutionalism. The Constitution is the guarantee of the people's rights, and the implementation of constitutional governance can improve people's welfare and maintain social security. We must establish fair public opinion, cultivate a spirit of respecting the law, elect virtuous and capable people, and exercise political power with the implementation of constitutional governance as our goal. We must also thoroughly recognize that the implementation of the Constitution must begin with the suppression of the rebellion. The communist bandits are raising troops to create chaos, acting perversely, opposing the National Assembly the year before last, and opposing the drafting of the Constitution. Seeing the success of the drafting of the Constitution, they do not hesitate to gamble everything and launch a full-scale armed rebellion, destroying unity and obstructing the implementation of the Constitution. Since the government issued the General Mobilization Order for the whole country last year, the military progress in suppressing the bandits in the past six months has been extremely smooth. The communist bandits will surely be defeated, and the suppression of the rebellion will surely succeed. We must sincerely support the government's national policy of implementing constitutional governance, suppressing the rebellion, and building the nation. In short, nation-building must begin with constitutionalism, and constitutionalism must begin with the suppression of the rebellion. This is the basic understanding we should have when celebrating New Year's Day and the implementation of the Constitution today.

With the beginning of constitutional governance, all undertakings are being renewed. How should we, the citizens of Shanghai, work hard?

First, ensure local security: In the past, the communist bandits created labor unrest and student unrest in order to disrupt security and destroy order. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, although they have ostensibly retreated, they are actually still lurking. We must strengthen the training of the people, tighten the Baojia organization, establish self-defense forces, and call on the communist bandits to reform and ensure the stability of Shanghai.

Second, comfort the soldiers who are suppressing the rebellion: The officers and soldiers of the National Army are suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion, constantly fighting battles, and enduring all kinds of hardships. We should warmly and sincerely treat and comfort the troops stationed in our territory, the volunteers recruited in our city, and the wounded and sick soldiers who remain in the hospital, so that the front line and the rear are integrated, and the army and the people are one family.

Third, strictly practice thrift and economize on consumption: The government has long advocated the strict practice of thrift and economizing on consumption, and various measures have been formulated separately. We must continue to work hard to save material resources and financial resources, reduce consumption, and strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion and build the nation.

Fourth, intensify relief efforts for disaster victims: As winter approaches, the weather is extremely cold, and the general poor and destitute disaster victims are lacking clothing and food, crying out in hunger and cold. We should, based on human compassion, actively donate and provide relief to them to save them from the suffering of hunger and cold.

Fellow citizens, this year is the first year of the implementation of the Constitution. The final victory of the military campaign to suppress the bandits is within sight, and the great future of democratic constitutional governance is shining brightly. We must unify our will, concentrate our strength, unite our spirits, and, under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek, eliminate the bandit scourge and build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People: government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

[Another News] The Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan United States Relief Material Handling Committee has been established in Shanghai, with Mr. Peabody serving as the director, and has already begun operations.

### Many Disputes on New Year's Eve; Workers Demand Year-End Bonuses

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, on New Year's Eve, many year-end bonus disputes were submitted to the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. More than 300 workers from the Da Zhonghua Match Factory petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, claiming that the factory had issued a month's year-end bonus to male workers. When the other two-thirds of female workers also made the same request, the factory stated that the female workers were all piece-rate or temporary workers, so instead of issuing bonuses, they would give each person one yuan and two jiao, which is equivalent to an extra day's wage. The female workers did not accept this. The Social Affairs Bureau temporarily persuaded the workers to return and await mediation.

Workers demand the issuance of year-end bonuses, but the industry is sluggish and unable to pay. Workers at a certain hair salon requested the issuance of year-end bonuses, but the management stated that the year's business was poor. The labor side demanded a month's bonus.
