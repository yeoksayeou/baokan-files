### Feng Yuxiang and His Daughter Burned to Death En Route from the US to Moscow by Steamer; Ship Catches Fire Carelessly Near Odessa

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Feng Yuxiang and his daughter were aboard the Soviet steamer "Pobeda" traveling from the US to the Soviet Union. Near the port of Odessa in the Black Sea, the steamer carelessly caught fire, and Feng and his daughter were both burned to death. The "Pobeda" set sail from New York in early August, with most of the passengers being family members of Soviet officials being repatriated from the US. En route from Batumi to Odessa, a film was being shown on the steamer, which carelessly started a fire. In addition to Feng and his daughter, there were several other unknown victims. One account states the date of the incident as August 31st, while another says September 1st. The "Pobeda" arrived at the port of Odessa yesterday.

[United Press, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here on the 5th that Feng Yuxiang, the Chinese "Christian General" known for his desertions, was aboard a Soviet steamer which set sail from New York in early August carrying family members of Soviet officials being recalled to the country. After passing through Cairo, the ship picked up another 2,000 passengers. After delivering these 2,000 passengers to Batumi, the ship was en route to Odessa (a Black Sea port) on August 31st when it carelessly caught fire due to the handling of movie film. Feng Yuxiang, his daughter, and several unknown passengers were burned to death. The ship was towed to Odessa on the 4th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It is reported that accompanying Feng Yuxiang on the trip to the US was his second daughter, Lida. It is not yet known whether Feng's wife, Li Dequan, was also on board. Upon learning of Feng's death by fire, a certain high-ranking government official, a friend of Feng's, expressed surprise as to why Li Dequan was not with him, because according to what he knew, Feng's "transformation" was most influenced by Li.

Brief Biography of Feng Yuxiang

Feng Yuxiang, courtesy name Huanzhang, was originally from Chaoxian County, Anhui Province. He was born in Baoding, Hebei Province in the seventh year of the reign of Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty (1881 AD). At a young age, he entered the Beiyang Military Academy, but dropped out after less than two years. He joined the Right Army of the Wuwei Army, serving as a company commander in the Ninth Division. Later, he was selected to study at the Baoding Military Academy. In the second year of the reign of Xuantong, he served as a battalion commander in the Third Division, stationed in Zhili (now Hebei Province), and was subsequently incorporated into the Imperial Guards. After the founding of the Republic of China, Feng's troops were reorganized into the Sixteenth Mixed Brigade. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), during the Zhili-Anhui War, he assisted Wu Peifu. Recommended by Wu, he became co-director of Shaanxi military affairs, and his troops were reorganized into the Eleventh Division. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), he led his troops back to Beijing (now Beiping), where he helped Wu defeat Cao Kun and supported Duan Qirui's assumption of the position of Provisional Chief Executive. Later, he also launched a coup against Duan. In January of the fifteenth year (1926), he announced his retirement from public life, traveled to Russia via Kulun, and toured for half a year. In the sixteenth year (1927), he returned to China and joined the National Revolutionary Army. In the seventeenth year (1928), the National Government was reorganized, and he was appointed as a member of the National Government Committee, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and concurrently Minister of Military Affairs. In February of the nineteenth year (1930), he allied with Yan Xishan in a third act of betrayal, becoming a "famous turncoat general." In the twentieth year (1931), after the September 18th Incident, domestic leaders united to resist Japan. Feng returned to Nanjing and resumed his position as a standing committee member of the Military Affairs Commission. He once took sick leave and went to Mount Tai to recuperate. His wife, Li Dequan, was from Tongxian County, Hebei Province. The couple were both Christians, hence his nickname "Christian General." After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, in April of the thirty-fifth year (1946), he went abroad to the US under the pretext of inspecting water conservancy. While in the United States, he often made statements attacking the government, and was said to have colluded with elements of the China Democratic League hiding in Hong Kong and the rebellious Li Jishen, forming a close-knit group. On January 7th of this year (1948), the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a resolution to expel Feng from the party. But Feng remained unrepentant. Amidst the uproar of daily events, at the invitation of Li Jishen and others, he left the US in late August and returned to China via Europe, meeting with disaster on a Soviet ship in the Black Sea at the age of 67.

### Tao Qiming Provides Important Clues: Xu Baiqi Instructed Him to Dump Stock; Police Department Will Arrest Him Today for Interrogation

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, who is under house arrest, was confirmed on the 5th to have leaked information based on Tao Qiming's confession, and the Yongsheng Yarn stock dumping case has now entered a new phase. Tao's confession also stated that his dumping behavior was passive, meaning that he was acting on instructions. In addition to pointing out Xu Baiqi's actions, Tao's confession also identified other related personnel who were also instructed. The Police Department dispatched personnel to Shanghai by night train on the evening of the 5th to cooperate with the Shanghai authorities in promptly arresting these related personnel. Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, the supervisory committee members handling the case, said in this regard: "Until the interrogation of Xu Baiqi is completed, we cannot determine whether the accountable elements of the case end with Xu, because it cannot be determined whether Xu's leaking of information and instructing Tao involves other behind-the-scenes issues." On the 5th, the supervisory committee members interrogated Tao Qiming for as long as seven hours, using various methods to obtain Tao's confession. From a legal point of view, if Tao was indeed passive, his crime will be lighter; from a political point of view, his crime will be more serious. If Xu Baiqi's actions are consistent with what Tao has confessed, then his crime will be even more serious, because he used his position to instruct others to act for speculative profit. As for the Control Yuan's attitude towards this case, Sun stated: "We must wait until the entire case is fully investigated. The judicial part will be handed over to the judicial authorities, and the rest will be processed after the entire report is compiled and then we will study the object and authority of the exercise of supervisory power. However, due to time constraints, it cannot be decided at present."

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Xu Baiqi, the Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance who is suspected of being involved in the Tao Qiming case and has been under house arrest for three days, will have his fate decided on the 6th whether he will be arrested for interrogation. Xu was still under house arrest on the 5th on the third floor of the Minister of Finance's office, guarded by several criminal police officers, and Xu was forbidden from meeting with outsiders. Xu's expression seemed quite sad. The police originally planned to arrest Xu Baiqi on the 5th for further interrogation, but as of 11 p.m., Police Chief Huang had not been able to meet with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, so the arrest procedures had not been carried out. The arrest procedures can be decided after Huang contacts Minister Wang on the 6th. Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, the supervisory committee members waiting to handle the case and interrogate Xu Baiqi, also stayed until 11 p.m. On the 5th, they abandoned the interrogation work of the 5th because they did not get results, but in principle, the procedure of detaining Xu has been decided.

### Zhang Qun Visits Nara's Famous Sites; Has Discussions with US Commander Swen; Washington Expects China to Promote Early Conclusion of Peace Treaty with Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Nara Mayor and Prefectural Governor of Nara, an ancient Buddhist cultural city, welcomed Zhang Qun and Shang Zhen to visit the area on the morning of the 5th. Overseas Chinese in the area waved our national flags and welcomed them along the way. Mr. Zhang's party visited Todai-ji (the largest temple in Japan) and other historical sites, returning to Kyoto in the afternoon.

According to sources close to Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang will meet with Swen at the First Army headquarters for about an hour on the evening of the 5th, and the matters discussed will not be announced.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Diplomatic circles anticipate that China will immediately begin a campaign to promote the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. It is generally believed here that China will use a dialectical argument, believing that Japan cannot truly restore its former economic status before the conclusion of the peace treaty. This point will undoubtedly be a major bargaining chip with US officials, as the United States believes that a sound Japanese economy can be used to counter communism and may also be used to reduce the burden on American taxpayers for occupation costs. It is generally believed that Zhang Qun's remarks to Japanese businessmen in Osaka marked the beginning of this campaign. Mr. Zhang said that China hopes to restore normal economic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible after the signing of the peace treaty, on the basis of reciprocity. Chinese sources here said that the Japanese problem cannot be solved before the signing of the peace treaty, but that the restoration of normal trade would be beneficial to Japan and other Asian countries. Although China is still fearful that Japan will return to its pre-war strong power status, Mr. Zhang's visit to MacArthur has been seen as a new direction in China's policy.

### Loyalty to the Country and Love for Youth - In Memory of Mr. Zhang Jiluan -

The senior journalist Mr. Zhang Jiluan passed away in the wartime capital of Chongqing on September 6, the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. Today is the seventh anniversary of his memorial service. Mr. Zhang engaged in journalism for thirty years, using the direct pen of a southern censor to serve as a guide for society. Not only did his writings pass down through the ages, but he was also truly immortal. Therefore, Mr. Yu Youren, upon Mr. Zhang's death, praised his thirty years of struggle as having "made great contributions to the country and had a great impact on the times." At the time, public opinion also regarded him as "a journalist of a generation." From the standpoint of an old colleague in the news industry, this newspaper should have a special admiration for Mr. Zhang, and the reporter now wishes to use the position of national mouthpiece to briefly expound on his admirable words and deeds, hoping to provide a model for compatriots. The world is already in chaos, and we mourn the passing of a wise man; the country's fate is still thorny, and we know that his spirit has not faded. Forever remembering Mr. Zhang, we especially hope that the journalistic community will cherish its mission and speak with caution.

Mr. Zhang served in politics early in his life, but his life was ultimately dedicated to the newspaper industry. Although he founded and led the Ta Kung Pao for fifteen years, his early commentaries in the China New Daily had a distinct and indelible impression on middle-aged people, and he also had connections with the Minli Pao and Minxin Pao. Although his life's work was devoted to running a newspaper, and he stayed at one newspaper for more than a decade, his spirit and personality were poured into the entire country and nation. How to revitalize China, how to preserve China's territorial sovereignty, and how to maintain the beautiful traditions of Chinese culture - in a negative sense, how to do everything possible to eliminate the aggressive forces that infringe upon our independence, freedom, and equality - can be said to be the general goal of his life's struggle. In his writing and speeches that advocated for national self-strengthening and revenge for national humiliation, he placed special hope in young people - because young people are the force for our nation's rebirth, and are the talented and capable citizens. In his sharp and clear "editorials" of thousands of words, he was filled with pure loyalty to the country and love for the nation, and at the same time, he naturally revealed his warm heart for caring for young people and guiding future generations. Loving young people is for the sake of loving the country, and believing that loving the country relies on young people who are capable of serving the country; these two meanings are consistent, and can be said to be the center of Mr. Zhang's life's words and deeds. This is what we want to know deeply and inherit and carry forward in commemorating Mr. Zhang.

The term "loving the country" seems very ordinary, especially in modern China, which has suffered too much foreign humiliation. This meaning has long been deeply rooted in people's hearts and has become a standard for journalistic commentary. However, the greatest truth in the ordinary is to believe in it firmly and act on it sincerely. Mr. Zhang Jiluan sincerely believed in loving the country, sincerely loved the country, worried about the country with maturity, and was loyal to and loved China unswervingly and increasingly in his later years. His old friend Wu Daquan often said: "Others also worry about the country and love the country, but Jiluan truly loves the country, and worries about the country from the depths of his heart, never forgetting it day and night." He had been weak and sick since early in his life, but he did not change his habit of staying up late to write, as if the country was calling him; during the War of Resistance, he relocated with his elderly body, traveling between Chongqing and Hong Kong, it could be said that he believed that China could not do without him during the war; even when he was dying, he earnestly asked about the US-Japan negotiations at the time, and his expression was still brave, and it seemed as if the soul of the country had possessed him. Therefore, although he refused to seek officialdom and had no intention of engaging in politics, he paid close attention to politics and was always concerned about the country's fate. Also, therefore, he only joined the Tongmenghui once and never joined a party afterward, but he fully sympathized with the completion of the revolution and unification, because this was the prerequisite for China's independence and strength. Before the Northern Expedition was completed, he earnestly said that "the National Revolution can be successful but cannot fail, and everyone should encourage each other"; after the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident], his commentary consistently focused on self-strengthening and revenge for national humiliation. As Japan's aggressive ambitions grew fiercer, benefiting from China's disunity, he also had the sincere argument of "using the joint efforts of the people to support the unified situation." During the War of Resistance, the Ta Kung Pao's voice was followed by many, serving as a beacon for the people and valued by friendly countries, because Mr. Zhang's pen strongly advocated the great righteousness of "national sovereignty," "resistance to the end," and "national supremacy and national defense first," which was the most thorough, the most firm, and the most vividly expressed. This spirit of loving the country, piercing the sun and moon, was the reason for its success.

In the winter of the 29th year [of the Republic, 1940], Mr. Zhang had already arrived in the rear, and his colleagues in Shanghai were still working hard to hold the fortress of resistance commentary. Mr. Zhang sent a long article of ten thousand words from Chongqing to the Zheng Yan Bao (New Year's special issue of that newspaper in the 30th year [1941]), which was truly a famous article expounding the national position and the great righteousness of resistance. He explained that the greatest reason for the certainty of victory in the War of Resistance was that our purpose was "absolutely just," that is, "absolutely striving for the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation," and he further explained it. He said: "China only has this one road, and if we walk it熟练ly, see it clearly, and walk it, there will definitely be a day when we reach the end. What is the end? It is independence, freedom, and equality." Finally, he also emphasized "not to expect Japan to turn back," in order to warn colleagues and intellectuals remaining on the isolated island. It was truly "righteous and awe-inspiring, with the power of a thousand pounds."

Speaking of the word "national defense," the reporter recalls a small anecdote, which may as well be revealed today, three years after the victory. At the end of February of the 30th year [1941], the Japanese bandits were quite rampant, and the attitude of Britain and the United States was still ambiguous. Our second National Political Council was about to hold its first meeting. President Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as commander-in-chief, was supposed to deliver a speech, and he asked Mr. Zhang in advance for his opinion on what should be said. He specifically stated the essentials of "national defense security." Later, when Mr. Chiang gave his speech, he reiterated the two major goals of current efforts, namely, "resistance must strive for final victory, and nation-building must achieve absolute national defense security." With a far-sighted vision and firm words, he inspired the military and the people, dispelling the enemy's famine and competing for [resources]. According to what was heard, the leader's edict had its own main points, but it must have incorporated Mr. Zhang's views. The government's emphasis on righteous people can be said to complement each other, and his spirit of loving the country can also be developed and immortalized.

Secondly, when we talk about Mr. Zhang's love for young people, there are endless facts and famous sayings that can fully demonstrate his great affection and foresight. Precisely because he loved the country and was loyal to the nation, he cared for the future pillars of the country, whom he called "national youth," with special sincerity and empathy. Because he loved young people, he especially cherished education that cultivates young people. His writings often offered frank and quiet words to teachers who bear the heavy burden of cultivation, not teaching indiscriminately, but saying with tears. The reason why the Ta Kung Pao gained the favor of the education community was not because it catered to young people or praised scholars, but because of its consistent and well-intentioned promotion of young people and respect for the scholarly class. The newspaper's article mourning Mr. Zhang at the time said that he "especially enjoyed promoting young and upcoming talents," which is very true, but one must know that Mr. Zhang's promotion was support and guidance, not praise, allowing young people to engage in all kinds of activities that opposed the status quo. Mr. Zhang's love for young people and respect for scholars was "loving people with virtue," so "honest words do not avoid being offensive." He believed that "good people can accept all words," so he was as unrelenting in his criticism of corrupt and derelict soldiers and politicians as he was in his earnest admonitions to students and young people who were depressed, frivolous, or going astray; he especially exposed the great righteousness of scholars and teachers who were unconventional and high-sounding and despised the country, and he condemned them in words and writing. We still hope that writers who have personally been taught by Mr. Zhang and are willing to inherit his mantle can practice this tradition; although the trends of the times are different, how can we bear to measure our colleagues by daring not to deviate from the "trend of the times"?

Mr. Zhang's care for young people, guidance of young people, encouragement of young people to set goals, and demonstration of targets for young people were tireless throughout his life, even after his death. In the early summer of the 30th year [1941], he was already recuperating on the South Bank of Chongqing, and he still wrote an article "On Political Education" (Ta Kung Pao editorial on April 26) to discuss the methods and standards for giving political education to young people. According to Chen Bulei's memorial article, he had first sent the general idea to Chen, believing that "we must work together to consolidate the foundation of the country," which was already beyond doubt. In this regard, he did not hide political shortcomings, but stated that improving practical politics was more urgent than implementing democracy; however, he believed that promoting integrity and guiding young people was more fundamental than reforming politics. Taking the best as a model, he marked out the standard for "young people to set goals in life" that was suggested in the "Nei Xing" chapter of the Book of Rites at that time. He believed that "as long as young people have passion and ambition, then childishness and impetuosity are not a problem, but if they are frivolous, cold, selfish, then if they are not rescued, it is no different from self-harming the life of the country." He denounced those who were激越, high-sounding, but actually only selfish, and who harmed young people. He demanded that the country have national education that teaches "how to be a person" and teaches "how to set goals," and that it must "have a strong and unyielding personality" and "have a common will to build and defend the country," only in this way can China have true successors and bearers of burdens. Every word is precious, imbued with blood and tears. We hope that young people can read this article carefully, and we hope that the Ta Kung Pao and colleagues in the news industry can follow this beautiful intention and carry it forward, so that we will naturally not see the darkness of the times. As for what Mr. Cai Yuanpei called "君馬" [obsequious intellectual], it will be wiped out due to the revival of Mr. Zhang's great spirit and will no longer exist in our country's forum today. In summary, Mr. Zhang was loyal to the country and sincerely cared for the country's youth. Therefore, conversely, he hated the perverse forces that undermined national unity no less than the aggressive forces that violated our independence and freedom; he hated the Communist Party that惑青 youth and trampled on scientific education no less than the traitors who sold the country for personal gain. His views were impartial on diplomacy and non-partisan on politics. However, he did his best to safeguard the center of the country, not only respecting the leader and constructively criticizing the government during the War of Resistance, but also consistently reminding young people not to forget the national interest and the sacred task of building and defending the country in his newspaper and writings. Here, we would like to quote an editorial written by Mr. Zhang in June of the 25th year [1936] to question the contemporary world:

"Today's unified situation in China was exchanged for at the cost of countless sacrifices. Therefore, only by working together to support this situation and urging its progress and reform can we not allow ambitious people to collude, undermine, and cause unification to return to chaos. This is because, with China's national strength and the urgency of the environment, if chaos is restored, there will be no surplus to rebuild unification." (25th year [1936])

At that time, the latent Communist Party was using a part of the military to try to coerce the leader and carry out its conspiracy. Mr. Zhang's keen eye saw through the treachery. Soon after, the Xi'an Incident turned misfortune into blessing, completing China's unification and laying the foundation for full-scale resistance. Unexpectedly, the government and the people's tolerance after the victory of the War of Resistance led to the rise of the CCP. If Mr. Zhang were still alive today, his deep hatred and abhorrence for the communist bandits who betrayed the Northeast and the national interests, and for how their directed "student movement" poisoned young people, would greatly wound his hopes for governance in his later years. His pen would surely condemn the traitors, deeply reminding young people to be vigilant. Perhaps public opinion would not be as confused as it is today, the student unrest would not be as糜爛 as it is today, and the facts of suppressing spies and suspected students would perhaps not exist. It is not easy to inherit the legacy of a wise man, but we also have reasons to be gratified, because the Ta Kung Pao, which leads the forum, has long been warned against the "traditional mistake" of "enjoying slander and criticism" (Ta Kung Pao editorial on September 7, the 30th year [1941]), and has vowed its arguments on freedom of speech and using speech to serve the country after Mr. Zhang's death, saying: "Freedom of speech is not the freedom to violate the law, harm the country, and harm customs," and that criticizing politics must "be based on the interests of the nation," and that "we must condemn those who harm the interests of the country and the nation without reservation." We deeply believe that Mr. Zhang's spirit is here, and with the successors' self-love and self-respect, the journalistic community can also admire the former model, love the country, love young people, and jointly save the world to comfort Mr. Zhang's spirit in the afterlife.

### British Side Accepts Our Suggestions for Protecting Overseas Chinese in Malaya; Agrees to Notify Our Consulates of the Situation of Detained Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] News from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since the outbreak of riots in Malaya, terrorist incidents have occurred frequently. The British authorities, seeing the seriousness of the situation, then implemented an emergency martial law order in the affected areas, and arrested a large number of suspects, including many overseas Chinese.

### Seeking Cooperation with the Socialist Party to Restore Collaboration: New French Cabinet Formed; Schuman Appointed Prime Minister and in Charge of Foreign Affairs

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] After overnight consultations with leaders of various central parties, Schuman achieved the goal of forming a cabinet today. The new cabinet includes nine members of the Popular Republican Movement, seven Socialists, five Radical Socialists, one member of the Democratic Social Resistance Union, and one Independent. The list is as follows:

Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Schuman (Popular Republican Movement), Deputy Prime Minister Marie (Radical Socialist), Minister of Finance and Economy Pineau (Socialist), Minister of the Interior Moch (Socialist), Minister of National Defense René Mayer (Radical Socialist), Minister of Justice Le Coeur (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Overseas Territories Florette (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Agriculture Frisanlin (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Commerce and Industry Lacoste (Socialist), Minister of Veterans Affairs and Pensions Catoir (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Health Schneiter (Popular Republican Movement), Minister of Public Works Queuille (Radical Socialist), Minister of National Education Revillon (Radical Socialist), Minister of Reconstruction Cottat (Independent Republican), Minister of Information Mitterrand (Democratic Social Resistance Union).

[United Press, Paris, 4th] Schuman agreed on the 4th to try to form a cabinet again. The Socialist Party, which had previously hindered him, has agreed in principle to join the cabinet. The Socialist Party voted 40 to 20 in a meeting to join the cabinet, but Schuman must agree to make some amendments to its economic plan. The fall of both the Schuman and Marie cabinets was due to the opposition of the Socialist Party. President Auriol's political skills have surprised even French politicians. He summoned Schuman and informed him that before officially accepting Schuman's resignation, his resignation was not legal, so in theory, Schuman was still the Prime Minister in charge of forming the cabinet. The President was deeply concerned that if the government collapsed, it would not only require general elections but also lead to an all-out struggle between the Communists and the de Gaulle faction. After Schuman expressed his agreement, he immediately returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and consulted with the leaders of the three centrist parties separately.

Furthermore, organized labor unrest, demanding across-the-board wage increases, made it difficult to resolve without a national strike, which prompted Auriol's action. The French Treasury was almost penniless. The government had borrowed heavily from the Bank of France to pay urgent compensation, and the franc continued to depreciate on the black market.

### Italian Colonial Issues to Be Handled by the UN General Assembly: Difficult to Resolve Smoothly Due to Differences of Opinion Among the Four Powers

[United Press, London, 5th] The United Nations, established to maintain rather than create peace, will once again engage in peacekeeping missions later this month. According to various indications, issues that the four powers cannot resolve are unlikely to be resolved by the UN General Assembly, and peacekeeping efforts cannot be smoothly resolved. The task of this year's General Assembly will be to address the Italian colonial issues. The Korean and Transjordan issues, which the General Assembly has failed to resolve in the past, are still far from being resolved. For three years, the four powers have attempted to find a solution to the future of the Italian colonies in North Africa. When the Italian peace treaty was completed, the four powers decided to postpone the resolution of the Italian colonial issues and, at the same time, hand this matter over to the United Nations. If this issue cannot be resolved by September 15, 1948, it will be automatically resolved by the United Nations unless the four powers order an extension of the deadline for resolving this issue. However, the General Assembly must now have a two-thirds majority to resolve it, so it is extremely uncertain whether this issue can be resolved. Italy's colonies in North Africa include Eritrea, Somaliland, and Libya. It is understood that the four powers all intend to return Somaliland and part of Eritrea to Italy under UN trusteeship, and part of Eritrea will be handed over to Abyssinia. The Soviet Union and France support returning all Italian colonies to Italy under joint supervision. The US policy on Italian colonial issues is more complex due to the election. US policy must consider the US Air Force's new air base in Libya. It is rumored that the US is preparing to establish a base there for the use of super fortresses. Britain had guaranteed to return Cyrenaica and eastern Libya to Italy but now also supports returning it to Italy. Due to the different opinions of the four powers, this issue will become even more complicated in the UN General Assembly.

Then, the new monarch Juliana expressed her gratitude to her mother and addressed the people, saying: "I ask the people to give me their trust, as they did when I was regent for five months in the past. Let our country move forward united. Long live the motherland!" Wilhelmina signed the abdication decree at 11:33:20 AM.

[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, 4th] The new Dutch monarch Juliana addressed the Dutch and Indonesian people, saying: "Although I accept the throne in these difficult and arduous times, I am not discouraged. Although the motherland has suffered destruction and devastation from the war, its international status is still very strong. With the help of the friendly countries, we will be able to recover quickly. The government will establish harmonious new relations with the Indonesian people, and these new relations must be based on the needs of the Indonesian people themselves."

The government army's offensive will adopt a three-dimensional war of land, sea, and air. Major General Deng will command the attacking troops to drive the rebels out of the city.

### Brief Biography of the New Dutch Queen Juliana

Following the abdication of the former Dutch Queen Wilhelmina on September 4th, Princess Juliana immediately ascended to the throne as Queen, and her official coronation is scheduled for today (September 6th).

Queen Juliana is a direct descendant of the House of Orange-Nassau. The founder of this royal house, William the Silent, waged an eighty-year war against King Philip of Spain in the mid-16th century, ultimately liberating the Netherlands.

Juliana was born on April 30, 1909, in the Royal Palace in The Hague. She was named Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina, with the titles of Princess of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, and also Duchess of Mecklenburg through her father, Prince Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The little princess was born eight years after her parents' marriage. At that time, the Dutch people were worried that the Queen would have no descendants, and a distant German relative would become the Emperor of the Netherlands.

Juliana received a strict upbringing, but her family life was also filled with joy. In her early years, her educators focused on languages and various sciences. She also learned singing and violin, and although she was not particularly fond of sports, she did enjoy skating and tennis.

She was kind and sincere to others, and deeply respected her mother.

The royal family often traveled throughout Europe. When Juliana reached marriageable age, each of her holiday trips sparked rumors about her marriage. The name of every suitable man was reported alongside hers, including the Prince of Wales.

When she turned eighteen, she reached adulthood. On her birthday, her own flag was raised for the first time above the palace allocated to her. Soon after, she enrolled at Leiden University under the name "Miss Van Bureen." Her four years at university were among the happiest of her life. She made many friends and insisted on being called by her first name.

During this period, rumors about her marriage continued to spread. However, around 1935, during a winter sports holiday, she met a young German prince whose name had never been linked to the Princess before. This young man was Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld.

They married on January 7, 1937. Prince Bernhard was a fine man, tall and robust, with beautiful blue eyes. Cheerful and brave, he was deeply favored by his mother-in-law. During the resistance against the Nazi invasion, he fought until the very end before escaping to London to become Queen Wilhelmina's adjutant.

Juliana publicly told the people that she loved him. Their first child, Princess Beatrix, was born the year after their marriage. The second princess, Irene, was born in August 1939, just weeks before the royal family fled the Nazi occupation to London. The third princess, Margriet, is now five years old and was born in the United States. During the Nazi bombing of London, Juliana sought refuge in Canada for her children's safety.

After the war, she returned to the Netherlands and had a fourth princess, Marijke.

Juliana inherited her mother's talent for problem-solving, and from her father, she inherited a cheerful spirit, which won her many friends. Although young, she is experienced. She has been preparing her entire life for the important role she assumes today—to be the constitutional monarch of a kingdom of six and a half million people. In fact, she has already shouldered many responsibilities since the end of the war. This year, she has twice served as regent for her mother. She understands her people and understands her position. She learned everything from her capable and steady mother. From childhood, her responsibilities were clearly taught. When Juliana was still a little princess, she and her mother received the cheers of the people from the balcony. She asked her mother, "Mom, do these people belong to me?" "No," her mother replied, "you belong to them."

### Rice Price for Household Registration This Month: Ordered to Remain the Same as Last Month, Still 3.2 Million Legal Tender per Dou

[Our Report] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee received a telegram from the Executive Yuan yesterday, ordering that the rice price for household registration in September remain unchanged from August, at 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou. Rice for the poor (broken rice) is 1.6 million Legal Tender per dou. The sale of rice for household registration will start today and end on the 25th. Rice for the poor must be purchased with a separate certificate.

According to the People's Livelihood Committee: The rice price is calculated according to the central government's regulations, which must be converted into Gold Yuan, and any decimal places are rounded. The price of household registration rice is 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou, which is 1.066 Gold Yuan… rounded to 1.07 Gold Yuan. The People's Livelihood Committee allows citizens to purchase rice at 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou to avoid increasing their burden.

In addition, according to news: This decision by the authorities, as well as the US side abandoning the principle of calculating the Sino-US agreement at 95% of the market price, is considered by all parties to be extremely suitable for the needs of the current environment.

### The China Trust Bureau to Auction 20 Units of Enemy Property This Week; Relocation of Residents Will Face Great Difficulties

The Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Central Trust Bureau is accepting seized enemy and puppet properties. In order to cooperate with the new economic plan promulgated by the government, the properties will be sold off one after another to absorb floating capital, so as to avoid it circulating outside and causing trouble. Last week, the Bureau discussed the first batch of 20 units of enemy and puppet houses and properties for sale. These houses are mostly office buildings, and they will be publicly auctioned this week. The reserve price of each office building has been estimated based on the multiplier of August 19, converted into Gold Yuan. The reserve price for the auction may be made public. It is said that after this batch of enemy and puppet houses is auctioned off, one-third of the total amount of Legal Tender issued will be recovered. However, the Bureau is facing a great difficulty in the auction: the residents in these houses cannot be forced to move out, because the bidder must obtain an empty house for their own disposal and use. If the house is already full of residents, the bidder will not be willing to accept it. Therefore, how to solve this problem still needs to be discussed with Chiang Ching-kuo, the economic supervisor of the Shanghai area, for a solution. As for the rumors that the Broadway Mansion will also be auctioned, the Bureau denied it, saying that it was only suggested once and did not become a reality.

### Cracking Down on Mid-Autumn Festival Gift-Giving: The Thrift Committee Implements Effectively

According to the person in charge of the Committee: During the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, it is a Chinese custom for both government officials and the general public to exchange gifts, which is a waste of money. This decadent social trend fosters a psychology of hypocrisy and flattery, which should be reformed. Leaders of government agencies, community organizations, and people from all walks of life should take the lead in launching a no-gift-giving and no-gift-receiving campaign.

### President Chiang Instructions on Promoting New Economic Measures; Completing Land Registration to Absorb Floating Capital; Central Government Determined to Suppress Prices; Mayor Wu Talks to Reporters After Returning to Shanghai

[Our Report] Mayor Wu flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 4th after receiving a telegram from the President. After finishing his official business that evening, he returned to Shanghai by night train with Zhang Peter, the director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Municipal Government. He got off at the North Station in the drizzle at 7:10 yesterday morning. Reporters drove to meet him. According to Wu, he was summoned to report to the President on the price and economic situation in Shanghai after the announcement of the financial and economic emergency decree. He met the President twice, and also visited President Weng and Secretary-General Li. He was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on a 6 o'clock military plane, but was recalled by the President after arriving at the Xiaguan Railway Station. When asked about the reason for the President's recall, he replied that the President believed that Shanghai was full of floating capital after the implementation of the economic plan. In order to prevent it from causing trouble, he gave further instructions. The President also ordered to expedite the land transfer registration work to guide floating capital into the right track, as most of the pre-war floating capital was concentrated in real estate. When asked if there were other ways to channel floating capital, Wu said that there were many methods, but only this point could be disclosed. He also said that he would invite Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, today to discuss active and elegant progress strategies. The Land Administration Bureau is expected to draft concrete measures first. The reporter also asked if the President had also inquired about the arrest of major merchants in the city.

The reporter further informed the Mayor that it was rumored here that he was presenting his resignation to the President, and that his resignation had been approved. Wu replied urgently: "There is no such thing." The reporter continued to say that at a time of such rumors, the Mayor should make a statement and ask if he had already dismissed the idea of resigning. He replied: "The facts prove that I cannot resign at present."

### A Corrupt Official in the Xu Jizhuang Case: Qi Zaiyu, Former Captain of the Garrison Headquarters' Inspection Brigade, Executed; Died After Three Shots; Will Wrote to Warn His Son Not to Become an Official

[Our Report] Qi Zaiyu, the former captain of the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, was executed by firing squad at the Jiangwan shooting range at 9:15 yesterday morning for the crime of extortion and corruption. He died after three shots in the drizzle.

Qi's arrest was actually related to the sensational Xu Jizhuang corruption case this year. When the authorities were most closely pursuing Xu Jizhuang, Qi helped him hide in his residence, allowing him to escape to Hong Kong. After being reported, he was detained. After several months of investigation by the military court, he was finally sentenced to death and reported to the Ministry of National Defense and then to the President for review and approval.

When Qi Zaiyu was taken out of the Garrison Headquarters detention center at 8:00 yesterday morning, he was wearing a checkered short shirt and pants, white socks, and yellow leather shoes. He looked haggard. After Section Chief Zhu Cheng read the President's order, Qi's face turned pale, but he still pretended to be calm and requested permission to write a will to his wife and children. But when he finished writing three pages of letters, his hands were shaking uncontrollably. Before the execution, Qi drank a glass of sorghum wine and was injected with an anesthetic. Then his hands were tied behind his back and he was escorted to the execution ground by soldiers of the Special Service Company. He was dragged to the grass and executed by firing squad with a Type 38 rifle. A total of three shots were fired. The first shot hit the back of the neck. After two minutes, the second shot was fired. His legs and body were trembling non-stop, and he was still moaning. He died after the third shot. After the execution, the military court immediately notified Qi's wife by phone to collect the body.

### The Course of Two Corruption Cases

Qi Zaiyu was 43 years old and from Jiaxing, Zhejiang. During the enemy-puppet period, he was ordered to host a secret radio station in Shanghai, which was quite successful. After the victory, he was transferred to the Shanghai North Inspection Section of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters. In the spring of the 36th year, the Action Team of the Inspection Office was reorganized, and Qi served as the captain of the Sixth Inspection Brigade. He was usually quite capable in his work, but he indulged in entertainment venues, contracted vulgar habits, and ended up in this situation. The revelation of Qi's corruption case stemmed from the Xu Jizhuang case. Qi often frequented singing and dancing halls and knew Xu's concubine Wang Baimei (formerly a Paramount dancer). After the Xu case broke out, Qi was ordered to handle it. Wang Baimei used private relations and money to lure Qi, who first hid Xu and then helped him disguise himself as a refugee and escape to Hong Kong. But the opportunity was not secret, and Xu Jizhuang's self-provided steam army was found in Qi's residence, and the matter was revealed. In addition to the Xu case, in December last year, Qi received a tip that Wu Baokang had hidden a large amount of enemy-puppet materials, including more than 10,000 radio square sheds and more than 100 military telephones, hidden on the third floor of No. 6 Lane 69 Yongqing Road. After Qi was approved, he ordered Chen Wenyu, a lieutenant inspector of the team, to lead people to arrest Wu Baokang and take him to the team on the morning of December 13 last year. The team's major inspector Zhou Wenyuan and others were responsible for interrogating and detaining him. Qi took the opportunity to extort 455 million yuan from Wu Baokang through Jin Runsheng, under the guise of a donation, as a cover-up, and as a bonus to distribute to his subordinates, in order to silence them. The case was also reported by the victim, and the Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu ordered an investigation.

### Will

The will Qi Zaiyu wrote to his wife and children yesterday morning was sad and the handwriting was scribbled. The content said: "This morning, I, Yu, was ordered to be executed. I have no time for everything. I am afraid you are still dreaming and have not woken up. This time, I was sentenced to death for violating the naval, army, and air force criminal law, and I was not given the opportunity to appeal. I am afraid it is difficult to accept. This time, I was ordered to be executed, and I have infinite emotion. After that, you should return to your hometown and live a hard life. […], educate well. (Omitted) There are several points to take care of. […] If you don’t study, you should return to your hometown to run a rice shop as soon as possible. You must not be an official in the future to avoid being wronged. Nannu Nanshan has been in my home for a long time. After that, he will still be at home, and everyone will treat him as family. Take care of your mother-in-law, who is old. After you return to your hometown, the residence on Kainalu Road can be returned to Yepu Real Estate Company. The lease contract is with Lawyer Ma Junsok. Everything can be entrusted to Lawyer Ma. The human relationship in Shanghai is bleak. Yu is usually sincere to people. Once something happens, few people take care of him, and it will be even more unimaginable in the future. (Omitted) At this moment, my heart is in a mess. I can't write anything. Take care of yourself. In the future, you can recite the Buddha in your hometown to seek Buddha's blessing. People in troubled times are worthless. One more thing, I heard that there is a new child in Changzhou. You can ask Xiuzhen, and maybe you can educate him in the future. Leave an ivory pen (fountain pen) as a souvenir. Qi Zaiyu's last words. September 5, 8:45 a.m."

### Many People Involved in the Qi Case; Two Convicts Sentenced to Five Years Each; Five Acquitted, the Rest Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Report] Seventeen people were involved in the Qi Zaiyu corruption case, all of whom were former members of the Sixth Inspection Brigade. Among them, Zhou Wenyuan (Major Inspector) and Chen Wenyu (Lieutenant Inspector) were sentenced to five years in prison and five years of deprivation of civil rights, and were sent to prison for execution. Pan Fushuo (Lieutenant Colonel Brigade Adjutant), Liu Zhijian (Lieutenant Inspector), Ma Jigang (Major Inspector), Yu Peng (Lieutenant Inspector), and Jin Wenlan (Warrant Officer Clerk), a total of five people, were acquitted for lack of evidence. Jin Runsheng (i.e. Jin Camel), Yu Shunfeng, Xue Jianshi, Huang Xiaoqing, Ye Chaoren, Wu Bin, Wang Hong, Ling Chenghun, Jiang Shilin, and Huang Huaxiong (i.e. Japanese Yokoi) were all volunteers and did not have military status.

### Decisions Made at the Economic Inspection Meeting: Strengthening Inspection Work, Massive Sales of Materials, and Three Recommended Uses for Proceeds from Confiscated Goods

Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Chiang Ching-kuo, the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor, convened an economic inspection meeting at the National Bank Conference Room. Attendees included Police Chief Yu Shuping, Deputy Chief and Special Criminal Division Director Zhang Shi, Economic Inspection Brigade Commander Cheng Yi-kuan, Gold Control Bureau Director Lin Chongyong, and other relevant agency heads.

(2) To solve the supply of materials and increase the demand for commercial raw materials, the Materials Adjustment Committee will, starting next week, massively sell various materials that are lacking in the market. (3) Regarding the large amount of stockpiled materials that have been inspected and confiscated, it has been recommended to the central government that they be sold in full, and three uses for the funds obtained are recommended: (A) A portion should be allocated to a scholarship fund for cleaning up students, (B) A portion should be used to relieve refugees, and (C) A portion should be used to慰勞 the soldiers at the front. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.

The Economic Control Inspection Committee Encourages Citizens to Report Violations Confidentially

The Shanghai District Inspection Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Committee issued a public announcement yesterday under the Shanghai Inspection Secret Character No. 1, stating: "This committee was formally established on September 2 and has begun operations at Room 410 of the Central Bank Building, undertaking economic inspection work in the Shanghai District. All citizens in the Shanghai District who are hoarding, speculating, manipulating the market, privately raising prices, or engaging in black market transactions, attempting to obtain windfall profits, and disrupting the economy and finance, are encouraged to report to this committee or submit confidential reports based on a sincere love for the country (confidential reports should list factual evidence and specify the name and address; this committee will absolutely maintain the confidentiality of the reporter's name). Once the investigation confirms the facts, severe penalties will be imposed according to the law, and the reporter will be rewarded with a percentage of the proceeds. Furthermore, if the inspection personnel of this committee engage in extortion, corruption, or dereliction of duty while exercising their authority, citizens are also encouraged to report them, and this committee will definitely investigate and punish them."

### Leather Merchant Couple Startled While Watching a Movie: Two Thieves Follow Them into Their Car and Rob Them in a Secluded Location

[Our Newspaper] The Cathay Theatre on Rue Cardinal Mercier (today's Middle Huaihai Road) and Route Tenant de May (today's Maoming Road) is currently showing the movie "The Yearling", which has been a box office hit. At 8:45 PM last night, after the second showing ended, the audience filed out. Among them was Guan Shengkang, who runs a leather business and resides at 115 Nanjing West Road. He and his wife left the theater and were about to step into their private car at the corner outside the main entrance (the license plate number of the car is 03.9492), when two thieves suddenly appeared behind them, each brandishing a pistol. One thief jumped into the car compartment, and the other drove the car, heading east along Rue Cardinal Mercier, turning into 八仙橋, and then turning west into Route Paul Henry de Vries (today's Jinling Middle Road) towards the secluded area of Xujiahui. Using force, they robbed Guan's wife of her gold necklace, diamond ring, and cash in her wallet. Then, they turned the car around and headed east, near the Lyceum Theatre, where they forced Guan and his wife out of the car. As they left, they said, "If you want the car, look for it at the Great World." After Guan regained his composure, he reported the incident to the Lou Jia Wan Police Sub-Bureau. Chief Song, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers in patrol cars to search the area and notified other sub-bureaus to assist in the pursuit. More than two and a half hours later, the car was found in front of the 新華舞厅 next to the New Nanking Theatre west of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII (today's Middle Yan'an Road). After investigation by the police, it was handed over to the owner, Guan Shengkang, to drive back. Meanwhile, the pursuit of the escaped criminals continues.

### Insurance Industry Plans to Launch a Large-Scale Insurance Campaign to Channel Idle Funds and Cultivate Insurance Virtues

[Our Newspaper] Since the currency reform, the insurance industry in this area is planning to launch a large-scale insurance campaign to channel idle funds in society and cultivate the virtues of insurance among the Chinese people. The planned projects include strengthening the existing insurance businesses such as reinsurance, marine insurance, fire insurance, and life insurance. In addition, new businesses such as national insurance and passenger insurance are planned to be added to life insurance, so that the insurance business will become increasingly socialized. Insurance industry insiders said that this campaign, in a backward society, still relies on the advocacy of the government and the assistance of leaders from all walks of life to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Enabling Idle Funds to Find a Home

Luo Beichen, a leader in the insurance industry in this area, told reporters yesterday: "The insurance industry can enable idle funds to find two legitimate homes: (1) Production Funds: After absorbing funds, European and American insurance companies mostly invest in industries, mines, railways, and various development projects, which are purely production-oriented investments. (2) Social Funds: The principle of insurance is that the fortunate help the victims. Insurance premiums are for the benefit of the public who have suffered disasters in society, so as to compensate for their losses. Therefore, insurance funds are actually social funds."

Promoting Full Public Awareness

He said: "The United Kingdom has recently implemented social insurance, providing a certain degree of protection to every citizen from birth to burial. This is not impossible to do in our country, but our people lack a full understanding of insurance. However, the Ministry of National Defense is about to start military insurance, which is a combination of life insurance and accident insurance, and is also the beginning of social insurance. If the national insurance, passenger insurance, and travel insurance that the insurance industry in this area plans to actively promote can be expanded to include all citizens and travelers, the premiums collected per unit will become lower and lower, and citizens and travelers will be guaranteed everywhere." He hopes to invite insurance industry personnel in this area to jointly launch an insurance promotion campaign in the near future to promote the public's understanding of the insurance business.

### Zhang Yamin's Death Sentence Awaits Final Approval

Zhang Yamin, Chief of the Economic Section of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, was sentenced to death for dereliction of duty and is awaiting final approval from the President before being formally executed. However, whether the execution will be carried out in Shanghai has not yet been decided. This is only a request from the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, and there is no regulation that after a case is concluded in Beijing, the criminals must be handed over to the local authorities for execution. Therefore, a decision from the Ministry of National Defense is also required.

### Strict Control Measures for Dangerous Goods Under Review

Following the fire at the 衆發 Warehouse, the authorities, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in warehouses in the future, have jointly formulated strict control measures for dangerous goods by the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau. The measures place various restrictions on the storage of dangerous goods in warehouses and stipulate various necessary conditions, such as those related to construction and fire protection. Anyone intending to store dangerous and flammable goods must apply for registration in advance, undergo a detailed review, and then be issued a permit. Afterwards, personnel will be dispatched from time to time to investigate whether there is any possibility of danger. The above-mentioned control measures have been jointly submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion by the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau, and it has been decided to send them to the Councilor's Office for review.

### Since Its Establishment, the Mechanical Land Reclamation Office Has Cultivated More Than 130,000 Mu of Farmland, Which Can Increase Food Production by 170,000 Shi Dan

The Mechanical Land Reclamation Management Office of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Commission was formally established in February of this year, taking over the land reclamation business of the former Executive Yuan. In addition to the head office being located in Shanghai, branch offices have been established in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Taiwan, Hebei, Suiyuan, and Northeast China.

The main businesses of the office are three: (1) Serving farmers, using its own machinery to cultivate, irrigate, drain, and transport products for farmers. As of the end of July, it had cultivated more than 132,000 mu of farmland, drained and irrigated more than 40,000 mu, which can increase food production by at least 170,000 shi dan. (2) Continuing to distribute agricultural machinery.

Thirteen mechanical cultivation demonstration farms have been established in the provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Suiyuan, with a total area of 20,000 mu. In the future, in addition to strengthening the above three businesses, it is reported that the office will expand its business, on the one hand introducing agricultural machinery manufactured by the China Agricultural Machinery Company and agricultural implements from abroad that are suitable for our country's agricultural conditions, and on the other hand establishing repair and supply stations in the provinces where branch offices are located to solve the difficulties farmers encounter when using agricultural machinery.

### Land Occupied by Longhua Airport: Landowners Petition for Unpaid Land Prices

[Our Newspaper] During the enemy-puppet period, Longhua Airport occupied more than 5,000 mu of nearby civilian land. After the victory, it has not been returned. Previously, the Land Administration Bureau convened a meeting of the user agency and representatives of the landowners to discuss the method of negotiated purchase. Although an agreement was reached, it was not implemented. The landowner representatives, Cao Zhimin and others, petitioned the Civil Aviation Administration a few days ago, but did not receive a definite response. After discussion by the district residents, it was decided that District Councilor Zhang Xuelian would submit a document to the Executive Yuan, urging the competent authorities to allocate land prices as soon as possible to complete the negotiated purchase procedures, so as to avoid other disputes. It is also learned that the district residents will dispatch representatives to Beijing to petition in the shortest possible time in order to seek early repayment of land prices.

### Expansion of the Flying Fortress Structure

In addition to the original 60 team members, 120 diligent officers have been selected from various sub-bureaus, concentrated for training, and will join the work starting today. Therefore, the original Flying Fortress with one squadron has now expanded its structure to three squadrons, stationed at the General Bureau, the Tilanqiao Sub-Bureau, and the Jiangning Road Sub-Bureau. In the future, if citizens encounter emergencies, in addition to dialing the General Bureau's telephone numbers "12220" and "13300", they can also dial the Tilanqiao Sub-Bureau's "53200" and the Jiangning Road Sub-Bureau's "30442".

Wang refused, and a quarrel ensued, followed by a physical altercation. Wang was punched by Hu several times. After mediation by others, they dispersed. Unexpectedly, Wang harbored resentment and bought a knife that day, hiding it on his person, intending to harm Hu.

### The Young Air Force is Growing: Hu Weike Discusses the Foundation of Air Education

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] On the day we celebrate Journalists' Day, it is also the anniversary of the cradle of the Iron Winged Eagles soaring in the skies of our motherland. This anniversary has special significance in Hangzhou, because the cradle of our Air Force is located at Jianqiao, near Hangzhou. The reporter's first report to readers is that this cradle of the Air Force—the Air Force Officer School—has been through nineteen winters and summers. This cradle of the Air Force has trained batches of aerial heroes, who are now spread throughout every corner of China, shouldering arduous tasks. And what about the cradle itself? Although it is facing high prices and a shortage of funds, it is constantly seeking progress. Especially in the past year or two, Principal Hu Weike has completed the Greening Jianqiao plan with the belief that "Hands are omnipotent, and man can conquer nature." They have planted more than 200,000 trees, all of which are growing vigorously. They have also completed more than 20 kilometers of circular roads around the school and more than 20 kilometers of circular canals around the school, connecting the center of the campus. At the same time, they have completed the necessary military equipment on the main transportation routes. In addition, they used bombs confiscated from the Japanese army to build a large-scale bomb platform to raise the awareness of the people in the school.

Building a Self-Reliance Village

Using the spirit of labor service, they completed the residences for the mechanics' families, named "Self-Reliance Village." What can be called a miracle is that they did not spend a single cent, but only used waste iron and cement from the school to build the highway-grade bridge "Jianqiao." The construction of this bridge has greatly increased the magnificence of the front gate of the Air Force School and saved more than 100 billion legal currency for the public treasury.

In addition to the original swimming pool and sports field, they have added a racetrack, a statue platform for Air Force warriors, a large fountain, a music stage, and a dancing venue.

In terms of production, they have established two farms. The products of the farms are supplied to all officers and students in the school at half the market price. In addition, there are utensil factories, tofu factories, and rice mills. The dregs left over from the tofu factory and rice mill can be used to feed pigs. There are also stables, cattle farms, and so on.

Now they are still actively engaged in afforestation. Most of the trees are fruit trees, so the strong men in the Air Force School will have endless good fortune in the future.

Aircraft Deployment

In the past two years, the number of aircraft deployed in the Air Force School has reached 10,390 times, with an average of 18 to 20 aircraft deployed every day. The number of aircraft repaired has reached 2,796. They do not have many aircraft, but they can deploy them so many times. This must be attributed to the efforts of the instructors of the school. They publish 17 kinds of publications. They also pay special attention to recreation, music, and recreational activities, with a total of more than 309 activities.

Many people think that the Air Force's treatment is much better than that of other troops. In fact, the Air Force requires first-class physical fitness and should pay special attention to nutrition. The Air Force's treatment in the United Kingdom and the United States also pays special attention to nutrition. However, now our Air Force instructors' treatment is equivalent to that of the Army, with just a little more flight allowance. Their students' meals consist of two vegetarian and three meat dishes. In June and July, they can't even eat fish. The taste of chicken and duck has long been forgotten, and fruit has long been cancelled.

New System of the Air Force School

Principal Hu Weike is a very hardworking and progressive person. Since he took office as the educational affairs officer of the Air Force Officer School, he resolutely shortened the length of education and reformed the educational system. The first batch of graduates produced under the new system, after being assigned to various troops, were found to be particularly satisfactory by the troop leaders. Through his efforts, he was able to overcome the financial difficulties.

Now, in the skies above Hangzhou, there are often groups of new types of training aircraft. These training aircraft are PT-17s, which are made in China. Since China made these aircraft, many people still doubt their performance, and even doubt whether they can take off without crashing. Principal Hu Weike and the instructors in their school went to the aircraft manufacturing plant. Principal Hu first test flew the aircraft, and then confirmed that the aircraft had its strong performance. Then, groups of new aircraft were driven back to the Air Force Officer School. Now our aircraft manufacturing plants in China are constantly working overtime to build aircraft to meet the needs of our young Air Force.

Large Formation Performance

On September 1st, in addition to holding a celebration meeting, they also held a large formation performance of aircraft. The aircraft performed were all made in China. In addition, there were water sports games, concerts, and dances. After the concert, there was a large dinner party. Chinese and American Air Forces raised their glasses to celebrate, and the excitement was intense. They joyfully spent the school anniversary celebration day.

The Era of Air Power

I talked with Principal Hu about how to build a strong Air Force. He said: "There is only one school for the education of Air Force officers. In the vast airspace of our motherland, this is naturally not enough. At the same time, the foundation of the Chinese Air Force is still built on the bodies of the people. The Chinese people are weak and do not meet the conditions for the Air Force, which is also an obstacle to the expansion of a strong Air Force."

In the future, air sports will be particularly frequent, because air traffic will shorten the space-time of the world a lot, so countries without a strong aerial talent will be ridiculed by others forever. The future is the era of air power, and our people should make the necessary preparations and cooperate with air education, so that we can catch up with the era of air power.

### Shaoxing Unscrupulous Merchants Transport Rice to Bandits, Food Department Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government to Investigate and Reply

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Reports state that unscrupulous speculators in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, disregarding the people's livelihood, secretly transported rice and wheat out to sea to supply the Communist bandits.

### The Strange Corpse in South Chang'an Street, Beiping, is the Orderly Cai Yongquan; The Cause of Death May Be a Scandal

[Report from our newspaper in Beiping, 5th] The strange corpse case in South Chang'an Street was published in this newspaper on August 30. The strange corpse was named Cai Yongquan, who was an orderly of Wang Huanting, the owner of the downstairs room at No. 1 South Garden. Wang is the Deputy Director of the Investigation Department of the Tianjin Garrison. Cai had a very deep affection for Wang's daughter, Wang Shuhua, and had privately given Cai Yongquan a self-embroidered handkerchief, and they had also taken a photo together. Cai was dismissed around August of last year. A year later, he suddenly disappeared in April of this year. Now, a strange corpse was found on the roof of the Wang family's house. According to his elder brother, Cai Yuquan's identification, it may be Cai Yongquan. The background may also be a complicated and serious scandal. When the police chief Zhao Zhengping, who discovered the strange corpse, went upstairs to examine the body, he also found a bullet casing, so Cai may have been shot to death. Cai's brother, Yuquan, in addition to sending all the evidence to the District Court for investigation, urgently telegraphed Cai's uncle, Cai Shengshan, who is the Deputy Section Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Police Bureau in Shanghai, asking him to redress his brother's grievances.

Chongqing

[Report from our newspaper] The old and new streets of Chuanping Xiningyun were completely destroyed by a major fire on the 2nd, with losses of more than a hundred houses, worth more than 200 billion legal currency. The cause was that the Xiningyun Center Reclamation Agency sold to the Changying Reclamation Agency, which was dissatisfied by the Anti-Construction Agency and set the fire. The victims have sent representatives to the county government to petition, demanding the sealing of the property of Lu Zhenhua, the manager of Anti-Construction, because when the fire broke out, the Anti-Construction Agency sent teams to monitor and prevent people from rescuing.

### On the Eve of the Autumn Harvest, Nantong Cotton Production Increases by One-Third

— Our reporter Cong Yongshu

[Fast report from our newspaper, Nantong, 3rd] In another half a month, cotton will be on the market. The cotton merchants who have been resting for a short period will once again revitalize.

It is estimated that the cotton planting area in Nantong this year has increased by more than 100,000 mu, and the yield has also increased correspondingly. It is estimated that cotton production may increase by more than 10,000 shi dan, which is close to one-third of last year's total production.

"Chicken Feet" Cotton Merchants Purchase

Nantong has always been one of the important cotton producing areas in our country. The quality of cotton has always been quite good. Later, "Chicken Feet" cotton was tried, and after multiple improvements, it has become a common cotton variety in Nantong area today. Because the cotton here can be used to spin 20-count fine yarn, Jiangnan manufacturers such as China Textile, Xin Shen, and Cotton and Linen, in previous years, sent specialists or entrusted merchants here to purchase cotton when the cotton was on the market, bidding each other up and even rushing to buy goods regardless of quality. This news of a sharp increase in cotton production this year will definitely be noticed by these manufacturers.

Last year, the cotton planting area in Nantong was 900,500 mu, of which about 200,000 mu were planted with American cotton, and the rest were still planted with Chinese cotton. In terms of yield, American cotton yielded more than Chinese cotton. On average, each mu of American cotton can yield 24 jin of seed cotton, while Chinese cotton can only yield 28.8 jin. Therefore, the total seed cotton production last year was 269,744 shi dan. This year, the cotton planting area has increased to 1,080,000 mu, and the output is estimated at 385,662 shi dan, an increase of 115,888 shi dan compared to last year.

Dai Character Cotton Achieves Excellent Results

The Tongfu Cotton Planting Guidance Area has further promoted the Dai character cotton variety here after the restoration and has achieved excellent results. According to statistics from the area, this year, the new promotion area covers 12,418 mu. In addition, there are farmers who have retained or automatically exchanged the Dai character cotton seeds promoted last year, totaling 59,000 mu. Altogether, the area planted with Dai character cotton totals 71,418 mu. Although there has been a great promotion, it only accounts for one-fifteenth of the cotton planting area this year. Greater efforts are needed to promote this excellent cotton variety throughout the region.

Two Major Reasons for Increased Production

The reasons for the possible increase in cotton production in Nantong this year are, first, the increase in the cotton planting area. The main reason why the cotton planting area can be increased is that cotton prices have been higher in the past nine years. Before the war, roughly one dan of cotton could be worth three shi of rice, but last year it had risen to five shi of rice to be worth one dan of cotton, and the current cotton price is not far from this ratio. When farmers see this situation, they naturally intend to abandon planting food crops and switch to planting cotton. The second reason is the suitable climate. After sowing in early summer this year, the rainfall was very harmonious, and the cotton plants developed very well. The autumn weather is also very good, which is very beneficial for the flowering and boll formation of cotton.

However, these are all from a favorable perspective. If we look carefully at the vast wilderness, it is still a question whether the abundant cotton production in the areas harassed by roaming bandits can be controlled by us. On the eve of this autumn harvest, I hope that the self-defense forces can exert some strength and strive for this huge amount of material.

Widespread Production Increase in Northern Jiangsu

The total cotton field area in northern Jiangsu today has also increased significantly, and cotton production has also increased accordingly. According to statistics, the cotton fields in 12 counties including Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Funing, Yancheng, Dongtai, Baoying, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Rugao, and Changshu in southern Jiangsu total 4,146,132 mu, an increase of 635,891 mu compared with last year. Cotton production also increased from 1,053,737 shi dan to 1,264,244 shi dan. Among them, the cotton production of Chongming, Baoying, and Gaoyou counties last year was 29,606 dan, and the survey figures have not yet been included this year. On the whole, the output of various counties has increased, only Yancheng has slightly decreased due to repeated harassment by bandit troops.

Gansu Province Implements Land Reform

[Report from our newspaper, Lanzhou, 4th] Gansu Province initially selected Gaotai and Qingyang counties to implement land reform, but after reconsideration by the Provincial Government, Yongdeng and Yuzhong counties were also included. The total cost for September and December of this year is more than 52,000 gold yuan. It is estimated that the entire plan can be completed in two years and six months to eight months. The "Work Plan for Supporting Self-cultivating Farmers" drafted by the Provincial Government will be implemented after the Executive Yuan approves the allocation of funds.

### A Special Record of Smuggling Grain from Taiwan

— Our Special Correspondent Wu Shourren

[Airmail from our newspaper, Taipei, 3rd] The situation of armed smuggling of grain from Taiwan has been recorded in the previous article. Here is another example: The case is like this: In March of this year, Chen Kunlai, the owner of Zhenfeng Bank, a grain merchant in Taipei, applied to the Grain Bureau for permission to transport 1,000 bags of white rice (equivalent to 10,000 shi jin) to Penghu to relieve the grain shortage. Penghu is a group of small islands in the western sea of Taiwan. Although it is not a barren land, it does not produce a single grain of rice. It can only produce a little corn, and the residents also have a population of 70,000 to 80,000. The annual food needs are entirely supplied by the main island of Taiwan. Therefore, the Provincial Government specially allows grain merchants to operate grain sales to Penghu.

The Course of the Grain Ship Changes, However, the grain ship has to pass through the sea, and the destination of the voyage is controlled by the grain merchants. Who can guarantee that they will not change the direction of the rudder once they leave the port? Therefore, in order to thoroughly implement the ban, the Provincial Government has also formulated a rule: that is, grain merchants transporting grain to Penghu must obtain a permit from the Grain Bureau, and when exporting, they must issue a guarantee to the customs with a guarantee from a reputable shop. After arriving in Penghu, they must also obtain a certificate from the police station in the unloading area and send it back to the customs for inspection before completing the legal procedures. At that time, when the Grain Bureau received Zhenfeng Bank's application to transport 1,000 bags of rice to Penghu, it was precisely when Penghu was experiencing a grain shortage and urgently reported to the Provincial Government, so it easily issued a permit and stipulated that the shipment must be made on March 3, and it would be invalid if overdue. The Tainan Customs only received the customs declaration on March 4. A motorized sailboat named Ruicheng was loaded with 1,000 bags of rice, with a permit from the Grain Bureau and a guarantee from Lian Da Bank. The procedures were impeccable and of course, it was released. Only waiting for the certificate from the police station in the unloading area to arrive, this transaction could be concluded.

So-Called Return Certificate is All Forged. Sure enough, on March 5, the Tainan Customs received the certificate from the Xiyu Police Station in Penghu sent by the people transporting the rice, stating that the Ruicheng motor vessel had unloaded 1,000 bags of rice in Xiyu, but for some reason, the staff of the Tainan Customs suspected the authenticity of the return certificate, so they sent the original return certificate to the Xiyu Police Station for inquiry. Unfortunately, the Xiyu Police Station's reply confirmed this suspicion. The so-called return certificate was originally forged.

The Signboard is a Dummy and the Shop Disappears. The Tainan Customs launched an investigation. First, they looked for the guarantor of Lian Da Bank, but the shop of Lian Da Bank had disappeared. According to the landlord of the original address, someone temporarily requested to hang up this signboard, but it was taken down in just two or three days, and the person who ordered the signboard was also nowhere to be found. Obviously, this was a well-planned smuggling case. The Tainan Customs reported it to the Ministry of Finance. In early June, the Ministry of Finance consulted the Provincial Government and ordered the Grain Bureau to investigate. The Grain Bureau transferred the entire file to the Taipei District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The facts seem very obvious. The key to the problem should be the Zhenfeng Bank that applied for transportation, but Chen Kunlai, the owner of Zhenfeng Bank, argued that he did not know about this matter at all, and that the Cambodian Kang Zhang and private seals were not forged, but were stolen by someone unknown. Everyone hoped that the Ruicheng motor vessel could come back again and be caught, so before and after the case, they always kept the secret, until now, this is still an undiscovered secret news.

Weekly Economy

### General Prices: Strengthening Control and Strictly Enforcing Price Limits

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree for Finance and Economy, in the second week after the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the authorities, with firm will, have strengthened the implementation of economic control and strictly enforced price limits. Under this situation, merchants dare not test the law and openly violate the law, so the market also has few special reactions. However, due to the excessive flooding of floating capital, the authorities have not yet formulated effective guidance measures, which is somewhat of a hidden worry for the current prices. It is estimated that the floating capital congestion in the market last week was more than 50 million Gold Yuan. The cause of this will be discussed in the next section of this publication. Because of the flooding of floating capital, the black market interest rate dropped sharply, once falling to as low as 4.5%, falling below the officially set interest rate. Bank deposits have therefore also increased significantly, totaling 6 million Gold Yuan, an increase of about 60% compared to before.

Market Transactions Demand More Than Supply

The price trend in the commodity market last week was not very normal, because under the strict control of the authorities, trading above the 819 price limit was illegal, and trading within the 819 price limit would inevitably result in losses due to cost reasons.

The yarn and cloth market, for example, formed a situation of sparse transactions, with very little business being done. Popular yarns such as Blue Phoenix and Double Horse were rarely traded, with only a few assortments and miscellaneous brands being sold. The quoted price for Dragon Head Fine Cloth stood firmly at the涨限 of 29.5 yuan, and the prices of other cloths also mostly stood at涨限, with demand exceeding supply, and the market was in a state of semi-shutdown. However, due to actual needs, there were those who exchanged goods for goods, roughly using 4 Gentleman Yuan Serge for 1 Yuan to offset the standard for Dragon Head Fine Cloth.

120 Count Sky Bridge Silk also consistently stood at the price limit of 1,133.3 yuan, with very little business being done.

In terms of food, due to the soft prices in the producing areas and flat outflows, the price of white粳 in the North Market in this city stood at 21 yuan at the weekend. Due to the Social Bureau's prohibition of old stock trading before the end of August and the limit order to appear within 7 days, the price of flour once retreated to 6.5 yuan, and returned to 7 yuan and 3.5 cents at the weekend. Miscellaneous grains and edible oil mostly stood at the fixed price limit, with scarce supply. For example, the price of Qingdao Jitong Raw Oil stood as high as 64 yuan. Among daily necessities, such as cigarettes, some tobacco shops sold them with a limit of one pack, and there were anecdotes about tearing the carton to avoid resale.

Various Industries State the Difficulties of Price Limits

The implementation of price limits in this city has reached two weeks as of the end of last week. Mr. Jiang Jingguo, who is responsible for supervising economic control, has given speeches to various industries and listened to opinions. According to the analysis of the grievances stated by various industries, they are roughly no more than the following points:

First: Due to the increase in costs, price limits are difficult to maintain. For example, the wine and food industry complained that since the 19th, fish, meat, chicken, duck, vegetables, etc. have frequently increased in price. If the industry is to maintain price compensation, the prices of various raw materials must be suppressed and maintained in accordance with the price limits.

Second: Due to the increase in donations and taxes, price limits are affected. For example, the sauce and wine industry representative pointed out that after the currency reform, the salt tax suddenly increased, affecting the cost of soy sauce and salted goods. The fresh pork industry stated that due to increased transportation costs, slaughter taxes, health inspection fees, and the pacification of northern Jiangsu, it is difficult to maintain price limits.

Third: Due to the high ex-factory prices, it is difficult to maintain price limits. The cotton cloth industry stated that, such as fine cloth, the current distribution price of China Textile for the industry is 29 yuan and 3 cents, and the price limit is 29 yuan and 5 cents. The profit seems to be 2 cents, but the business tax alone needs to be paid 9 cents, plus a few days of interest, freight, etc., which is unbearable. The cigarette industry also said that cigarette factories distribute less goods, and what is sold cannot be replenished, and the source is in danger of being cut off.

Fourth: Due to the relationship between supply and demand, prices fluctuate slightly. The vegetable industry reported that the industry is entirely for customer sales, and cannot be hoarded or speculated. After the 23rd, the price was slightly higher due to weather and rain. It is hoped that the government will provide convenience in transportation and reduce costs.

Fifth: Due to the loose organization, it is difficult to control. For example, the tree firewood industry said that many colleagues in the industry have joined the guild and illegally engage in black market transactions, which is very difficult to control.

### Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association Index Compilation Instructions

(1) This association was established in November 1946. There was no collection of price materials during the Anti-Japanese War, so the compiled index temporarily starts from January 1946. Because many inland industries were in the process of moving east in the first few months after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and production had not yet returned to normal for a while, it started calculating from January of last year.

(2) In 1946, the index was compiled once a month, based on the wholesale prices on the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month. From 1947 onwards, it is compiled once a week, based on the average wholesale prices from Monday to Friday of each week. Because the weekly index compiled by this association must be compiled on Saturday, the price materials used can only be up to Friday.

(3) This association compiles a total of three types of indexes: one is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the use of goods, the second is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the degree of processing, and the third is the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to import and export goods.

(4) This association uses the entire year of 1936 as the base period for compiling the index. This is because in 1937, it was already facing war, and North China had entered an extraordinary situation. The political and economic situation was no longer as stable as in peacetime, so it was not suitable to be selected as the base period.

(5) The compilation of ordinary indexes uses 100 as the base number, but recently the price is more than 100,000 times higher than the base period, so 1 is used as the base number for convenience. As shown in the table below, the food index for the fourth week of November this year is 75,305, which means that the average price of food this week is 75,305 times the average price for the entire year of 1936.

(6) The three types of indexes compiled by this association all use the simple geometric average method. The compilation of the index is of course more detailed with weighted calculation. However, under the current situation of extreme scarcity of statistical data in our country, the collection of weights is extremely difficult. Only the trading volume of various types of goods can be used for reference, and the weighting effect is implicitly included in the selection and abandonment of various types of goods. Therefore, the number of goods included in each category is not the same.

(7) Since January 1947, the monthly index has been calculated by the simple geometric average method using the weekly indexes of the same month.

(8) Due to the limited space in this edition, it is impossible to publish all the indexes in each issue, so they can only be published in rotation. For example, the first issue publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the use of goods, from January 1946 to the fourth week of November this year. The second issue after the week publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to the degree of processing, from 1936 to the first week of December this year, but at this time, the complete figures of the index classified according to the use of goods will no longer be published, only the various figures and the total index of this type of index in the first week of December will be published. The third issue after two weeks publishes the Shanghai wholesale price index classified according to import and export, from January 1946 to the second week of December this year, and also publishes the various figures and total index of the above two types of indexes in the second week of December, no longer publishing all the figures after 1946.

(9) In order to make it easier for readers to understand the actual situation of price fluctuations, a指　曲綫圖 is attached to each index table. However, due to the limited space, only one figure can be attached each time. There are many methods for drawing物價指数曲綫圖. In order to make it easier for readers to compare the trend of price fluctuations of various types of goods and compare the multiples of the price increase of various types of goods relative to the base period at the same time, this association draws several index curves on the same graph. For example, the index compiled according to the use of goods has a total of seven categories, plus the total index, there are a total of eight curves. It will be too blurred to combine the eight curves on the same graph, so only four are selected, and the rest can only be published later.

(10) The numbers listed on the left of the curve chart are the indexes. But it is arranged in the order of its logarithm. For example, the logarithm of the index 1,000 is three, the logarithm of the index 10,000 is four, and the logarithm of the index 100,000 is five. The vertical distance from the index 1,000 to 10,000 is equal to the vertical distance from 10,000 to 100,000. The ratio of the price increase multiples of the two end points of two sets of points with equal vertical distance on the curve is equal.

(11) The horizontal axis of the curve chart represents time, in months.

(12) After the currency reform in August 1948, from the first week of September, the Gold Yuan was calculated according to the law of 3 million 法幣 合 one, and the compilation method remained the same.

(Note) This explanation has been published in the newspaper once before. Because there are frequent inquiries from all parties about the compilation method, it is re-added, revised, and published as above.

### Monetary Finance

(1) Undisclosed Interest Rates due to Loose Monetary Policy

The urgent need to tighten the loose monetary policy: Last week, the authorities attempted to address the loose monetary environment by reforming the currency, but this has not had any restraining effect. This is naturally a result of the excess of floating capital in the market. The reasons for the abundance of floating capital are still due to: (1) The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies for gold yuan notes. (2) The government's substantial payments for the procurement of materials. (3) Due to political pressure, there are few loan requests, causing bank deposits to increase while lending decreases. (4) The indefinite postponement of the stock exchange opening, leaving floating capital with no outlet. Although the government has decided to sell materials and state-owned enterprises, such as over ten thousand boxes of artificial silk (worth ten million yuan), China Textile Industries' issuance of 1.3 million shares (worth 390 million yuan), and the disposal of 200,000 tons of surplus U.S. military supplies (worth 150 million yuan), these decisions are still in the planning stage and have no practical impact on tightening the loose monetary situation last week.

The destination of floating capital is noteworthy: One phenomenon is particularly noteworthy. It is reported that from the second half of last week, interbank lending rates have gradually returned to normal, allegedly due to clients competing to purchase goods. If floating capital, lacking other outlets, ultimately targets goods, it would be deeply disappointing. Furthermore, there are indications that floating capital is flowing to other cities, possibly due to looser regulations and lower prices in those areas. If this is the case, the subsequent consequence may be the outflow of goods, which would undoubtedly add further upward pressure on prices in this city. It is evident that ceasing the creation of floating capital and guiding its flow are matters of utmost urgency.

Significant inflows to government banks cast a shadow on the future: Last week, from Monday to Friday, the clearing results of national banks and government-owned banks showed a net inflow of over 3,563,000 yuan, a significant increase compared to the net outflow of over 5,000,000 yuan during the same period of the previous week. In today's environment of excessive floating capital, this is undoubtedly a positive sign. However, recalling the "one out, one in" policy implemented before the currency reform, while highly profitable, it was this repeated process that ultimately led to the demise of the legal tender. The controllers of the gold yuan must take heed of this lesson! Last week, foreign banks reversed the previous week's trend and recorded a significant net inflow. From Monday to Friday, the total net inflow was 366,952 yuan, an increase of over 1.1 million yuan compared to the same period of the previous week.

The potential of floating capital should not be underestimated: Last week's undisclosed interest rates were generally around 7 per month, with some falling to as low as 3. Subsidized interest rates for lending were only 2-3 yuan per day, equivalent to 6-9 per month. Bank liquidity was generally relaxed, with interbank lending virtually nonexistent. Some banks even refused to accept large customer deposits, indicating the extent of the excess liquidity. Bank deposit rates were lowered repeatedly last week, with deposit rates at 2.4 and lending rates at 1.10 on Monday, and interbank rates at 6. On Wednesday, deposit rates were lowered to 2.1, lending rates to 0.09, and interbank rates to 4.5. However, on Friday, deposit and interbank rates returned to Monday's levels, possibly due to increased trading activity and slightly improved demand for loans. The potential of floating capital should not be underestimated!

The clearing results for banks after number 60, from Monday to Friday, showed a total outflow of 3,644,000 yuan. Deducting the Taiwan Bank's net outflow of 230,100 yuan over five days, the actual net outflow between commercial banks was 3,413,900 yuan, an increase of over 3.8 million yuan compared to the same period of the previous week. This is also a sign that floating capital is seeking an outlet!

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, exchange rates in Shanghai commercial banks remained stable. The Guangzhou exchange rate remained unchanged at 20 yuan before Wednesday but suddenly increased to 50 yuan on Friday, possibly due to increased remittances. The Xiamen exchange rate remained at 20 yuan before Friday.

The Chongqing exchange rate decreased, starting at 60 yuan on Monday, dropping to 40 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then further to 20 yuan on Friday. The Wuhan exchange rate remained stable, starting at 60 yuan on Monday, dropping to 40 yuan on Tuesday, and remaining unchanged thereafter.

The Tianjin exchange rate trended upwards, starting at 10 yuan on Monday, rising to 20 yuan on Tuesday, and then increasing by another 10 yuan on Friday. This is a significant departure from the phenomenon of Tianjin exchange rates frequently trading at a discount before the currency reform.

Last week, there were continued transactions in foreign exchange settlements, with prices around 3.85 yuan and 3.75 yuan. Gold prices in jewelry stores remained unchanged, but the industry only sold 70% fineness gold, resulting in sluggish trading. Hong Kong gold prices fell, from 290 HKD per tael on Tuesday to 284 HKD on Thursday. The closing price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong on Thursday was 5.05 HKD, nearly a dime lower than the opening price, reportedly due to the collapse of a certain bank. The sluggishness of gold prices is attributed to the excessive supply from Macau.

### The Central Bank Revises Regulations on Overseas Remittances

To support the new measures and accelerate the absorption of overseas remittances, the Central Bank has revised its regulations on overseas remittances. In areas with the largest amounts of overseas remittances, such as Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fuzhou, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank has entrusted the four bank groups, China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust, to act as collection agencies, with the Central Bank advancing funds. Overseas remittance handling fees are also waived. It is learned that the two methods of entrusted collection have been announced.

Methods for Entrusting the China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks in Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fuzhou to Collect Overseas Remittances:

(1) When people sell overseas remittances to these banks, the banks can, upon presentation of a telegram certificate from their respective Shanghai branches verifying the sale to the Central Bank, withdraw gold yuan from the local branch of the Central Bank.

(2) After making the payment, the local branch of the Central Bank will debit the Central Bank's account and immediately notify the collecting bank and the amount withdrawn, stating that the foreign exchange was purchased locally.

(3) Upon receiving the telegram, the Central Bank will credit the overseas remittance account of the Shantou, Xiamen, Wuzhou, and Fujian banks. The balance in this account can only be cleared with gold yuan obtained from the purchase of foreign exchange.

(4) Upon receiving the telegram, the Shanghai branches of these banks will sell the overseas remittances collected by their respective branches to the Central Bank, and the resulting gold yuan will be credited to the banks' overseas remittance accounts to repay the funds withdrawn from the local branch of the Central Bank.

(5) The portion of overseas remittances collected in foreign currency banknotes will continue to be handled in accordance with the Central Bank's regulations for entrusting these banks to exchange foreign currency banknotes, with a handling fee of 0.25%.

(6) The handling fee for the banks' inward foreign exchange, whether D.D. or T.T., is uniformly calculated at 0.5%.

(7) The foreign exchange collected by these banks should be converted into gold yuan at the prescribed exchange rate and paid to the overseas Chinese, without any increase or decrease.

(8) The Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank can buy and sell foreign exchange locally. The remittances collected by these banks in Guangzhou can be sold to the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank at any time. Apart from applying the handling fee specified above, the other provisions above do not need to be applied.

Methods for Entrusting the China, Communications, and Farmers Banks and China Trust Bureau in Hong Kong to Collect Overseas Remittances:

(1) The gold yuan needed by these banks in Hong Kong to pay for overseas remittances will be allocated by the Central Bank from the payment locations for overseas remittances, as follows:

A. The Central Bank will notify its branches in Xiamen, Shantou, Wuzhou, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou in advance that the local China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks can, upon presentation of a telegram certificate from their respective Hong Kong branches, withdraw gold yuan from the local branch of the Central Bank to pay for overseas remittances. The local branch of the Central Bank should prioritize these payments. However, this withdrawal cannot be repaid locally.

B. After making the payment, the local branch of the Central Bank will debit the Central Bank's account and immediately notify the collecting bank and the amount withdrawn, stating that the foreign exchange was purchased in Hong Kong.

C. Upon receiving the telegram, the Central Bank will credit the overseas remittance account of the Hong Kong banks. The balance in this account can only be cleared with gold yuan obtained from the purchase of foreign exchange.

D. The foreign exchange collected by the Hong Kong banks should be telegraphed to their respective Shanghai branches for sale to the Central Bank on the same day, and the resulting gold yuan will be used to credit the banks' overseas remittance accounts to repay the debt.

(2) The handling fee for these banks to collect overseas remittances is calculated at 0.25% for foreign currency banknotes and 0.5% for DD and D-T.

(3) The foreign currency banknotes collected are limited to U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars. Temporarily, in accordance with the statutory exchange rate, each U.S. dollar is converted to 4 gold yuan, and each Hong Kong dollar is converted to 0.75 gold yuan and paid to the overseas Chinese, without any increase or decrease.

### Illiterate Citizens Account for Half of the City's Population; Literacy Education Needs to Be Promoted Urgently; Intellectuals Will Be Mobilized to Participate in Eradicating Illiteracy

[Our Report] Illiterate citizens in this city account for nearly half of the total population, and the literacy movement needs to be actively promoted. However, to achieve practical results in this work, sufficient funding and comprehensive implementation are necessary. It is learned that the city's Education Bureau has formulated a general outline for promoting mass literacy: targeting illiterate citizens aged 15 to 50, focusing on the recognition and application of basic characters, supplemented by life skills and basic national knowledge. In terms of teaching: teachers and schools will adapt to the learners, adopting different methods based on the living environment of the citizens. Textbooks, films, and broadcasts will be used as teaching tools. Teaching venues will make full use of schools at all levels, government agencies, factories, shops, and public places in neighborhoods and shantytowns. In addition to the city's primary and secondary school teachers, social education workers, and senior elementary school students, teachers will also be recruited from faculty and students of specialized colleges and universities, in order to mobilize the city's intellectuals to participate in eradicating illiteracy. In terms of organization: a Municipal Mass Literacy Movement Committee will be established, chaired by the mayor, to coordinate planning and implementation.

### Assistance for Education Basketball, Second Day: Ta Kung's Subpar Performance Leads to Loss Against Ch'i Ch'i; Jen Yu Defeats Shan Team in a One-Sided Match; Final Two Games Tonight

[Our Correspondent] Despite boasting two world-class representatives, the Ta Kung basketball team performed unexpectedly poorly last night. In the charity basketball tournament for education aid, they were surprisingly defeated by the Ch'i Ch'i team, recently tied with Morning Friends, by a score of 59 to 49, a difference of ten points. This greatly surprised the fans. The competition was exceptionally fierce, with Ch'i Ch'i's defense being tight and their movements quite intense. At halftime, Ch'i Ch'i led 32 to 24. In another match, Jen Yu, leading from start to finish, easily defeated the Shan team by 40 to 35. At halftime, Jen Yu led 20 to 10, ahead by ten points. The charity ball was auctioned off, with Li Ya-ku purchasing it for 500 Gold Yuan. Ticket sales for last night totaled 930 yuan.

Jen Yu Leads All the Way At 7:00 PM, Jen Yu and the Shan team took to the court. Le Chia-chou scored two free throws, opening the scoring. Little Wu then put in a shot under the basket, and Peng Ju added another, giving Jen Yu a 6-0 lead. The Shan team called a timeout. Although Ch'ing Chiang broke the duck egg, it was difficult to stem Jen Yu's offensive. Chung Yi, Kuo Cheng, and Wen Yi then scored in succession. The Shan team only managed to score 20 points in the first half, trailing by ten points. In the second half, Jen Yu continued to control the game, with Little Wu shooting from long range and Peng Ju turning around under the basket. The Shan team only saw Ma Ts'an-hsi score with a long shot, making the score 30 to 17. In the final minutes, Jen Yu gradually became lax, and the Shan team quickly chased after them, but time was no longer on their side. As the buzzer sounded, the Shan team lost 35 to 40.

Ta Kung's Decline in the Final Match In the final match, Ta Kung fielded Wen Hua and Yun Shan as guards, Chin Tien in the center, and Lung T'an and Po Ling as forwards. Ch'i Ch'i's lineup consisted of Ti Hang, Ta Kuang, Chih Chi, Shih Hsuan, and Chih Chun. In the center jump, Lung T'an committed a foul, and Ch'i Ch'i scored the first point. Liao Ti-hang seemed divinely inspired, making two shots in a row, making the score 5-0. Ta Kung struggled to catch up, with Wen Hua scoring frequently. At 7-6, Ch'i Ch'i missed two free throws, and Chin Tien seized the opportunity to break through, giving Ta Kung an 8-7 lead for the first time. Wen Lung replaced Yun Shan, opening the attack. Wen Hua made a free throw, making it 11-7. Ta Kung's momentum was only briefly seen, and they declined from then on. Ch'i Ch'i's Cheng, Liao, and Wang rarely missed their shots, with long passes and fast breaks, making it impossible for Ta Kung to defend. With five minutes remaining in the first half, at 29-18, Ta Kung replaced all five players on the court with Lien K'o, Yun Shan, Wen Hua, Lung T'an, and Chin Tien, but there was still no improvement. At halftime, Ch'i Ch'i led 32-24, ahead by eight points.

After switching sides, the battle became deadlocked, with the score difference remaining at three or four points. Ta Kung was eager to win, making frequent mistakes, and Chung Ch'iang was particularly out of form. Ch'i Ch'i's performance also gradually became more ruthless, with both sides committing numerous fouls. After ten minutes, Ta Kung's defeat was sealed, and their morale declined. Only Wen Lung fought like a cornered beast. Although Wen Hua occasionally scored with mid-range shots, it was not enough to save the situation. As the final buzzer sounded, Ch'i Ch'i won by five baskets with a score of 59-49.

### Davis Cup Trials Begin: USA Wins Two Singles Matches Against Australia; Shroeder and Parker Defeat Quist and Sedgman; No Problem for the United States to Retain the Davis Cup

[United Press, New York, 4th] American Davis Cup players Shroeder and Parker won two singles matches on the 4th in the opening of the Davis Cup trials against Australia, in front of 8,000 spectators at the Eastern Lawn Tennis Courts here. Shroeder easily defeated Australian Davis Cup team leader Quist 6-3, 4-6, 6-0, 6-0, while Parker defeated Australian newcomer Sedgman in straight sets 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. The doubles match is scheduled for the 5th, with Americans Mulloy and Talbert facing Australians Long and Quist. The final two singles matches will be held on Monday, with Sedgman against Shroeder and Parker against Quist. Shroeder's selection for this year's American Davis Cup team has been criticized by tennis experts. Shroeder participated in six major championships this year, losing five times. Today's victory proves that Davis Cup non-playing captain Meyne's choice was not a mistake. His experience is indeed superior. Parker's hitting today was incredibly well-prepared, like a machine. Sedgman had many errors, with 35 net touches and out-of-bounds shots. There seems to be no problem for the United States to continue to retain the Davis Cup.

Today's Final Two Games

Today is the final day of the charity event, with two more games. Ticket prices and match times remain the same. The schedule is as follows:

Hui Li vs. Morning Friends, 7:00 PM

### Carnegie's Philosophy

— Shih Tu

Dale Carnegie's book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is said to have sold millions of copies. I don't know how many languages it has been translated into, but there are probably two Chinese translations. This is a good book. At least, it is a pleasing book! It tells you how to please others; how to "give small favors"; how to use the right bait to catch "fish." It also generously tells you Socrates' secret and many so-called "great men's" ways of dealing with the world.

No one doesn't want to improve their "social skills." Therefore, this book caters to the taste of the general public and truly "catches" millions of readers like the right bait. I myself was one of those "caught." I often hear people say, "My George doesn't understand social skills at all!" or "Jane doesn't have a single friend!" So this "George" or "Jane" would enthusiastically or secretly buy this book and read it over and over again. Naturally, this book would have a great influence on him or her, and they would change. One day, I deliberately flipped through this book in front of a "George."

"Ah! I've been studying this book for three years!" he said.

"Three years!" I said in surprise, "Then how many friends have you made?"

"How many?" He glared at me. "'Several dozen' is an understatement."

But many people in the city are suffering from this kind of distress: they have several dozen friends but lament their loneliness; they shake hands and laugh outside every day but lament the lack of friendship. Parisians are the most skilled at socializing, but they are also the most lacking in "friendship." A French nobleman declared that he would give half of his property to anyone who could give him valuable "friendship."

A comedy copied from the same "copy": people elegantly take off their hats, bend their waists, everyone is smiling, saying some unimportant things, the weather and movies are the best topics. Someone says, "Shakespeare is Russian!" So people say, "He's Russian!" Everyone is careful not to hurt other people's feelings, so everyone gives everyone a good impression, and everyone gains a friend. This kind of friendship may continue for a long time. Their friendship is probably built on "shared joy." If they don't watch movies or play bridge, they will be silent and embarrassed.

Romain Rolland has a wonderful saying: "People are not Louis d'or (an old French coin) and cannot please everyone." But Carnegie insists that we please everyone. In order to be a Louis d'or, people have to agree with others forever, never criticize others, and always say things that are ambiguous. Therefore, everyone lacks individuality. A friend criticizes us: "You all seem to be printed from the same plate! It's like admiring Italian plaster statues, it's hard to find a trace of thought on you!"

Carnegie's philosophy makes us appear frivolous, hypocritical, and lacking in individuality. Therefore, it is not easy for our hearts to merge, and we cannot see through each other's thoughts, which makes us lose the simple, deep, and real friendship. Carnegie may have given you several dozen friends, but he has not given you a trace of friendship!

### Book on Chu Chiang-ts'un

— Ch'en Tso-kao

Chu Chiang-ts'un of Kuei-an was a master of tz'u poetry of the late Ch'ing Dynasty, on par with Wang Pan-t'ang, K'uang Hui-feng, and Cheng Ta-ho. Each of his works was meticulously regulated, his language was sharp and beautiful, like a second Meng-chuang. Critics have said that he surpassed the established rules, surpassing Chu, establishing great merit in the field of tz'u poetry, especially in textual research. He continued Pan-t'ang's research on Meng-chuang, and greatly expanded the field. His original name was Tsu-mou, his courtesy name was Hsiao-sheng, also known as Ku-wei, and his literary name was Ou-yin. After the dynastic change, he changed his name to Hsiao-tsang, also known as Chiang-ts'un. In his later years, he was a Ch'uan-lu (top graduate) and successively held the position of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites. During the Boxer Rebellion in the year of Gengzi (1900), he submitted multiple memorials strongly advising against using the Boxers, and personally faced the Empress Dowager Cixi, firmly stating that the Boxers could not be used. He spoke frankly and uprightly, without any flattery. His life was marked by integrity and distinction, as detailed in the biography written by Xia Sun-t'ung and the epitaph by Ch'en San-li. In the past, when I listened to my elders talk about his past deeds, there were often things that were not recorded in the biographies. Therefore, I, despite my ignorance, will pick up a few things to recount:

It is said that his success in the imperial examination was due to luck. Originally, his name was Tsu-hsun, and he inherited his brother Tsu-mou's name to take the Guangxu Renwu (1882) provincial examination. After passing, he did not change his name, and his old name was discarded. The following year, during the palace examination, he realized that his handwriting was crooked and did not conform to the standards of the court style. It happened that the examiner, surnamed Lao, was privately currying favor with the son of Grand Secretary Yan Jingming, and had long been interested in calligraphic skill. When he saw a paper that looked very similar to the handwriting of Yan's son, he presented the paper to the Guangxu Emperor, intending to award it first place. The Emperor said: "The writing is good, but the characters are not neat enough. Is this not a flaw in the white jade?" He immediately changed it to second class, first place, and exchanged it with Chen Mian. After the sealed paper was opened, the examiner suddenly realized that the top graduate of this Keju (imperial exam) was actually Zhu Tsu-mou, not Yan's son. The similarity of the two's handwriting had caused him to repeat Dongpo's mistake of privately promoting Li Fangshu, and he was filled with grief and indignation, almost falling ill. His late father, Guangdi, served in Henan, investigated a robbery case, redressed unjust verdicts, and saved seven lives (similar to reversing the Wang Shuwu case). Accumulating good deeds had a long history. Initially, Chiang-ts'un only hoped for the status of a Jinshi. Upon hearing the good news, he was filled with satisfaction and happiness, and he smiled as he closed his eyes on his sickbed. I heard this story from Niu Gengsheng, my great-uncle of the same generation. It seems that there is little outside knowledge. And he and Zhu had a good relationship that passed down through generations, with friendship like glue, I think it is not a false rumor. I recall that ten years ago, Shen Qi-ch'uan, Ta-yen-pai, often visited my home. He said that on the day of the examination, he suddenly lost his mother and hurried home for the funeral, which is why he missed being the top scorer; and after the make-up exam, he got the second-class second name. How far apart is the Deng Ke Di with Weng's position?

He began to study poetry very late, only starting when he was nearly forty, when he sought advice from Wang Pan-t'ang, who introduced him to friends. More than a decade later, he lived in Wu and discussed editing a collection of poems with Zhang Meng-chu. He then came to Shanghai and met K'uang Hui-feng, and they became close. Because K'uang's poems were selected, he was deeply admired, and he always addressed K'uang as "teacher" in his letters. Some letters remain with K'uang, and also with Han Hsiao-sung.

His wife was fierce, so when he was a guest in Shanghai, he would often curse at his wife in front of his close friends, calling her a "lioness". She died in Xinwei, at the age of seventy-five. He wrote collections of poems, which were passed down to the world. Before the change of banner, his wife still lived alone in Suzhou, treating it like Wu and Yue. Zhu then wrote a Ci "Partridge Sky" on the spot, saying: "Loyalty and filial piety, have I ever done my part? Over the years, the warmth of the ginger quilt has diminished. In my eyes, is the rhino horn true or false? After my death, will the ox cart of poverty harbor resentment and kindness? Bubbles and dew, a fleeting life, futile effort in making Ci poetry; pitiful is only the human world, not concluding the unfinished cause of the next life." The lament and knot, overflowing with words, is also the word of farewell.

### Rare Surnames

— Yu Mo-chun

During the summer vacation, I had nothing to do and was very bored, so I often flipped through the notes of ancient and modern people, taking each for its own sake, and I could throw the book away when my hands were tired.

In K'uang Chou-yi's "Hui Feng Yi Erh Bi" volume two, it is recorded that in the Guangxi provincial examination of the eleventh year of Kangxi in the late Qing Dynasty, there was a Mao Changfu from Quanzhou. This surname is only seen here; Ji Dexiang, who ranked fifth in the Guangxu Ji Mao martial arts list, is also a rare surname.

In Ye Changchi's "Yuan Du Lu Diary", many rare surnames are also recorded: Ba, Bian, Chan, Gong, Tuo, Yun, Dao, Chou, E, Tuo, Xian, Wan, Ya, Tuo, Kou, Wei, Xing, Lu, Li, Dong, Ling, Xie, Men, Wei, Min, Yu, Chang, Lu and other unseen surnames. Compound surnames include "He Si" and "Gui Dai". These rare surnames were all obtained by Ye when he was a provincial education commissioner in Gansu and selected scholars from various places, and they are recorded in records ten and eleven, without fully listing the original text.

According to Zheng Qiao's Tong Zhi Lue, Zuo Shi only clarifies five categories: "Bestowing surnames because of birth, enfeoffing land to create a clan, and taking clan from characters, titles, officials, and cities. Nowadays, it is not the same. There are thirty-two categories for discussing surnames, and Zuo Shi's words are narrow! … In addition, there are four tones." Like the Guang and Lu surnames mentioned in the previous section, they both belong to "taking characters as clan", saying: The former came from the descendants of Jin official Xian Fu, and the latter came from the descendants of Zhou son Wu Geng, with the character Lu Fu, and there was also a Tibetan chieftain named Lu Dongzan. (Editor's note: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Kunming military police commander was Lu Guofan.) The clan Jie belonged to "taking names as clan", after Cangjie. The clan Li belonged to "taking officials as clan." Originally Li, it was changed in the Spring and Autumn period. Jin had Li Ke, Lu had Li Ge, and Zheng had Li Qi. The clan Gong belonged to "taking titles as clan", originally Ji, from the son of Duke Zhao of Lu, Gongzi Yan. Gongzi was afterwards. Zheng Qiao believed that Duke Zhao lost the country, so his descendants took the title as clan. The surname Yu belongs to the four tones of Ping Sheng, after Yu Wenhua and Jiang Yu Cheng of the Tang Dynasty. The remaining three surnames, Tuo, Xing and Wei, are all found in the three tones of Shang, Qu and Ru of the Tong Zhi Lue.

As for the rare surnames mentioned by the two authors, K'uang and Ye, that are not recorded in the Tong Zhi Lue, it is not easy to investigate.

[Letter from Zhu Chiang-ts'un to Kuang Hui-feng]

### Flying Advertisements

— Chen Xiang

If the astrologers of ancient times were to return to Earth this summer, they would surely be astonished by the sight of fiery, illuminated red-maned horses soaring through the sky, colossal whales wagging their tails and spouting water amidst the constellations, and giant chickens carrying babies in their beaks...

They might even witness divinely bestowed food – vast loaves of bread descending from the heavens, glowing with a mystical light.

These nocturnal spectacles are, in fact, "flying advertisements," created by affixing neon signs to the sides of small blimps. This novel form of aerial advertising is the latest innovation from Douglas Leigh, a New York-based outdoor advertising entrepreneur.

In late 1945, Leigh purchased three surplus blimps from the U.S. government and transformed them into airborne electric advertisements. Initially, however, there was little demand, and the expenses were staggeringly high – each blimp consumed $150,000 annually. But by the following autumn, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) leased the flying advertisements to promote their film, "The Yearling." Flying advertisements became an instant hit. Today, Leigh has acquired all 29 of the U.S. Navy's remaining surplus blimps, five of which are currently under contract. This innovative advertising method generates an annual revenue of $3 million for Leigh.

Flying advertisements possess an overwhelming advantage over other forms of advertising. Last autumn, the Associated Press (AP) held an editorial conference in Detroit. To usurp the position of the Nash Motors Company, General Motors Corporation (GM) purchased tickets for every editor to attend a football game between the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan, transporting them to the stadium in Ann Arbor in GM's sleek new "Train of Tomorrow" automobiles. However, as the train departed Detroit, the sky-viewing car became crowded with editors, for a flying advertisement had appeared in the sky, its giant letters floating above the locomotive, proclaiming "Ford Leads the Way," closely tracking the train as it arrived at the stadium. In the end, GM expended great effort, but Ford reaped the advertising benefits.

### "Look to the Sun"

— Zhi Yi

A collection of poems arrived from New York, titled "Look to the Sun," sent by the author Weston McDaniel for us to review.

Weston McDaniel is from Virginia, USA, residing in Louisiana and Florida. He first entered Mercer University and, after graduating, transferred to the University of Virginia and Western Reserve University, earning a Ph.D. in Literature. He worked as a teacher and principal in public schools, as well as a drama teacher, and was particularly fond of collecting folk songs and tunes. During World War II, he also put down his pen and joined the army, joining the Air Force, but still made time to write his poems, winning several poetry awards, including the Genie Award in 1944, and two special awards from the Tribune Publishing Company for soldiers. He has submitted manuscripts to various newspapers and literary magazines in the country. Before this collection of poems, he had published two collections, "Windows of Darkness" and "A Fire Miracle," both rich in Southern flavor. Although he now resides in New York, his slow speech and casual attitude fully reflect his Southern background, but he is not an old-fashioned Southerner. He can be said to be a typical emerging Southerner.

"Look to the Sun" contains a total of sixty-three poems, most of which have strength, emotion, and can deeply stimulate people's hearts, especially those that speak out against the inhumanity of the world. He writes in free verse, which makes it feel particularly vivid. This poet advocates that life should struggle against various negative forces. He is most familiar with the customs and beliefs of the South, expressing them in the form of folk songs, using magic as a symbol of all oppression, and describing the hope and happiness of mankind with the beauty and emotional power of the mountains. He has the foresight and compassion of a prophet, and understands human nature, so his poems are truly refreshing, using only colloquial words and phrases, truly "removing stale expressions." In short, he has a keen observational power and artistic expressive power, which can give readers a genuine impression and make them understand what is hindering cultural progress. If people can solve this problem because of this, then they can enter the world of Great Harmony. From this point of view, he is not only a Southern poet, but also a national, and even a global poet.

What this poet opposes most is narrow-mindedness. With narrow-mindedness, the world cannot be peaceful, and there will be conflicts. We must free ourselves from this trap in order to be saved, to live in peace, and to live happily. His avoidance of vulgarity is also where he succeeds. He is good at using ballads, although they do not conform to the old forms, they really open up another area. He is a completely authentic "Imagist".

His poems are a bit like our ancient Yuefu poems, genuine, simple, unadorned, and naturally humorous. His views also fit the temperaments of Easterners. We have never been narrow-minded. Confucianism advocates the Doctrine of the Mean: it is not biased in order to be called the Middle. Finally, let me quote a few lines from his poem:

"Racial hatred,

Religious hatred,

Hatred... has been around for a long time,

Wrong within wrong,

Suffocating everyone's heart."

### Evening View from the Thirteenth Floor

— Zhang Yiqu

Thirty years of dust, a traveler's broken heart, tall buildings and the setting sun again, autumn clear, not yet quenching Sima Xiangru's thirst, dusk teaching Ruan Ji madness; worldly right and wrong are fleeting, gains and losses in the pot are entrusted to the azure sky, I too now engage in scheming, with discerning eyes I watch the yellow of the evening glow.

After the rain, cold leaves fly from the wutong trees, in the wind, the wild osmanthus has sick flowers, the vast wilderness is becoming desolate, the rugged world is still extravagant! City sentiments rise and fall, firewood and rice are both expensive, human affairs change, kudzu vine and melon, the sea smoke floats, autumn is faint, a lone scholar in exile feels the sorrow of insects and sand.

### Visiting the Tomb of the Loyal and Honorable Ancestor on Jingxian Mountain

— Zong Xiaochen

The towering Huabiao is hidden on the mountain shoulders, and the white-haired descendants worship before the tomb. It has been thirty generations since me, and the grief for you has been a thousand years; the river flows endlessly, and the cries are still there, the declining grass cannot cover the loyal bones, the Fengshui is vast, and the legacy is far-reaching, with ten thousand peaks surrounding the earth.
