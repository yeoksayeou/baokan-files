### Major Victory for Northeast National Army: Westward Bound Corps Captures Xinlitun, Cutting Off Bandit Army's Retreat with East-West Pincer Movement

[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in PanYang on the 17th] Since the westward-bound corps from Shenyang continues to display its power, advancing westward from Banlamen along the Raoyang River in the south and coordinating with the Zhangwu area in the north, after completing the pincer movement against Xinlitun, it launched a surprise attack at dawn on the 17th and captured Daheishan, a vital road west of Xinmin leading to Xinlitun. The advancing troops pressed westward in victory, reaching Xinlitun. After a fierce battle, they recovered Xinlitun, a railway transportation hub held by the bandits, at 11 a.m. this morning. The bandit's 5th, 6th, and part of the 10th Columns suffered heavy losses and fled south towards Heitun, Sijianfang, and other places. The recovery of Xinlitun marks another major victory for the National Army, as Xinlitun is a strategically important location. The Northeast bandit field army consists of twelve columns. Currently, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Columns are in western Liaoning, while the 5th, 6th, and 10th Columns, having been routed in western Shenyang, are fleeing west. With nine columns now in western Liaoning, the National Army can launch an east-west pincer movement to encircle and annihilate them. Now that the bandits' retreat is cut off, it presents an excellent opportunity. It is predicted that a major decisive battle will take place on the banks of the Daling River. The bandit Lin Biao's forces in Jinzhou, with approximately three columns of strength, are attempting to cross the Daling River eastward and return to Beizhen. There are signs of activity in the Goubangzi area, and the air force is currently pursuing and bombing them. The eastward-bound corps from Huludao and Jinxi are still blocked in the Tashan area. The bandits are deploying all their forces in a line south of Gaoqiao, requiring a great effort [to overcome], but the bandits have suffered significant losses. The battles at Fanchegou and Quanyanggou west of Tashan on the night of the 16th inflicted heavy damage on parts of the bandit's 7th and 11th Columns, resulting in the capture of many large-caliber cannons and light and heavy machine guns. Fierce fighting continues east of Tashan on the 17th.

### Song Ziwen Explains Ineffective Implementation of Financial and Economic Measures; Executive Yuan Has Responded to the Legislative Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Nanjing on the 17th] Five members of the Legislative Yuan, including Zhou Jieren, submitted a written inquiry at the end of last month, stating that Guangdong Province Chairman Song Ziwen "ineffectively implemented the emergency measures order for finance and economy, and publicly criticized the new currency system for insufficient preparation, intending to undermine it and take advantage of the opportunity to seek profits. The government did not punish him, and the Legislative Yuan transferred it to the Executive Yuan for response." After the Executive Yuan telegraphed for inquiry, Song submitted a reply by telegraph and responded to the Legislative Yuan a few days ago, stating that the allegations were true and that he is currently recognizing their control. According to Song's explanation, after the currency reform, commodity prices in Guangzhou fluctuated due to the low exchange rate difference with Shanghai and the sharp increase in the exchange value of foreign currencies. However, after he supervised his subordinates to handle the matter separately, re-evaluated commodity prices, inspected merchants who violated price negotiations, cracked down on black market operations, restricted the withdrawal of remittances, strengthened anti-smuggling along the Hong Kong and Macao borders, registered existing goods, and planned to transport supplies to provide relief. At the same time, promoted the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, and intensified financial inspections. After various measures, the number of collections was considerable, and commodity prices generally tended to stabilize. Approximately 150 cases were solved through inspection work, and the market is still considered stable, so it cannot be said that the implementation was ineffective. Song also stated: "In the past, I have never made public criticisms of anything in the press." The so-called criticism of the new currency system is a deliberate rumor. As for taking advantage of the opportunity to seek profits, he stated: "It may be a misrepresentation that the Guangdong Provincial Food Management Committee entrusted the Provincial Bank to purchase Hong Kong dollar drafts before the currency change in preparation for paying for the rice allocation amount."

### Investigation of Responsibility for the Fall of Jinan; The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee Report Lists Seven Points; The Legislative Yuan Meeting Tomorrow Will Discuss Them

[Special Dispatch from Ben Bao in Nanjing on the 17th] The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee held an expanded meeting on the 29th of last month to review and investigate the responsibility for the defeat in the Jinan battle. Subsequently, a resolution was made to appoint five members, including Wang Jun, to formulate a plan, which was then reviewed and submitted as a report. It has been included in the agenda of the second meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 19th for discussion. It is reported that: It is reported that: The report pointed out that the distant reasons for the fall of Jinan were two: (1) The mistake of the reorganization measures caused the local armed forces in Shandong to be destroyed. (2) The near causes for the fall of Changle and Weixian are six: (1) The operational guidance was not appropriate, (2) Intelligence was inaccurate, (3) Wu Huawen's betrayal, (4) Liao Wenwei's suspicion of colluding with bandits, (5) The new airport was not completed on schedule, and (6) Reinforcements were ineffective. The report finally raised seven points regarding the responsibility for the fall of Jinan: (1) The mistake of reorganization caused the militia to be almost completely destroyed, which has an impact on the fall of Jinan. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (2) The failure to defend Changle and Weixian isolated Jinan. Should Wang Yaowu and the Ministry of National Defense be jointly responsible? The fall of Yanzhou made Jinan an isolated island. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? Should the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters also bear its share of the blame? (3) The inappropriate operational guidance of the Ministry of National Defense is the most important reason for the fall of Jinan. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (4) Inaccurate intelligence. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (5) Wu Huawen was fickle. Why did the Ministry of National Defense entrust him with important tasks? Wang Yaowu was Wu's direct superior. Why couldn't he learn the details and take precautions? Should the Ministry of National Defense and Wang Yaowu share the responsibility? (6) The construction of the new airport was not completed in time. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible? (7) Ineffective reinforcement. Should the Ministry of National Defense be responsible?

Editorial

### How to Save Resources?

To regulate supply and demand is similar to managing finances. On one hand, we must increase production, and on the other, we must conserve consumption. The former belongs to the nature of expanding income and is active; the latter belongs to the nature of reducing expenditure and is passive. Although addressing the symptoms and addressing the root cause are different and their functions differ, if we want production and sales to match, and the people's daily necessities not to be scarce, we must advance on separate paths and not achieve results without working in tandem.

Currently, everyone is paying attention to increasing production. For example, opening up imports of goods with self-provided foreign exchange, increasing the allocation of foreign exchange, purchasing raw materials, streamlining freight transportation, and jointly purchasing goods are all efforts in this direction. As long as we identify the goal and carry it out earnestly, I believe that various difficulties can be overcome separately, and the gradually shrinking production industry can be restored to normal.

As for consumption, since the promotion of the thrift movement last year, followed by the diligent and thrifty nation-building movement, many measures in this regard have been striving to promote it. Recently, panic buying has occurred in various places, and the scarcity of materials has become increasingly significant. Therefore, restrictions on purchases and plans to conserve consumption have been advocated one after another, and are more active than before. The pros and cons of this situation are worthy of our exploration, and are explained separately below:

(1) Prohibiting Sales: Those that have already been implemented include: (1) banning the sale of imported foreign wines, sea cucumbers, shark fins, and nylon stockings; (2) not allowing new restaurants and wine shops to be established; (3) limiting the price and amount of banquets; (4) reducing the number of cars and saving gasoline; (5) prohibiting the brewing of wine with rice and wheat, etc. Those that are still under consideration include: (1) banning meat consumption on Fridays; (2) banning the sale of various luxury goods; (3) not eating chicken eggs, but eating duck eggs. Some people in the inland even advocate that civil servants should all wear cloth clothes and not be allowed to use silk fabrics, etc. If these many items can truly be implemented universally with one heart and one mind, the benefits to the conservation of materials and the cultivation of frugality will naturally be significant. Unfortunately, many cities turn a blind eye and pretend that this never happened. In places where orders are implemented, all kinds of foreign wines, shark fins, sea cucumbers, and lavish banquets can still be seen everywhere. The result is only that the government reduces a part of the tax revenue, while merchants and civilians add some fraudulent procedures. We cite these facts not to doubt this principle, but to point out that if we want to implement frugality and prohibit sales, we must pay great attention to and improve the execution techniques.

(2) Expanding Rationing: Rationing has many functions, and eliminating waste and controlling consumption are among its important goals. Countries often implement rationing when materials are scarce and food is insufficient, and once production is abundant and there is no shortage of food and clothing, they resolutely cancel it. This is a very obvious example. However, if rationing is to have a good effect, it must be matched with several conditions: (1) the time must be long-lasting; (2) the distribution must be universal; (3) the allocated items must be barely sufficient. Otherwise, the black market is bound to occur. Moreover, due to insufficient daily use, the public may rush to buy and store, and merchants may hide and refuse to sell, which in turn makes the goods that can barely be supplied scarce out of thin air. This is obviously not the original intention of rationing. Therefore, for the rationing of each item, it is necessary to grasp the corresponding materials and their sources, so that everyone has no fear and does not realize the difficulty of succession and the lack of minimum usage, and then the foundation is stable, and the people in charge will not encounter unexpected difficulties.

(3) Purchasing with Certificates: The current method of allowing purchases within quotas based on national identity cards seems to be a good way to deal with panic buying, but it is not without its shortcomings. First, there are many shops that supply the public, such as hotels and restaurants, which require a large amount of consumer goods that cannot be purchased with certificates. For example, cooking oil is very difficult to obtain for these types of shops because it must be purchased with certificates. Second, it induces many unnecessary competitive purchases. Under normal circumstances, they do not necessarily have to buy, especially not everyone has to buy, but when purchases are allowed within quotas based on certificates, they may realize that this is a right that should be enjoyed, and they are unwilling to give it up easily. They may also think of the fact that materials are really lacking, so they might as well buy them and store them for future needs. Wouldn't this increase the sales of goods? Third, there are still some local citizens who have not received identity cards, and there are also many foreign travelers who do not carry this document, or who do not have this document in the first place. Fourth, the identity card has limited space. Originally, it was not prepared as a purchase certificate. If it continues to be used or expanded to other items, there will not be enough space to stamp and fill in the date. Therefore, we believe that this method of purchasing goods with certificates can only be used as a temporary means of dealing with the situation, and should not be sustained or expanded.

In short, conserving consumption is a principle that everyone should follow. As for how to effectively promote it, the technical aspects still need to be earnestly studied. In particular, the fundamental work, namely increasing production, must be stepped up so that the supply and demand are not too disconnected, and then people's hearts will be stable and panic buying will naturally disappear. Another measure that can complement increasing production is to dredge the source. We believe that the current method of issuing rice purchase certificates may as well be expanded. The management scope of the Shanghai area has been expanded to four provinces and two cities. At least within this area, the exchange of all goods, except for necessary restrictions, should be made smooth. Therefore, oil, firewood, miscellaneous grains, and other raw materials can be directly issued purchase certificates by the supervisory office when necessary to reduce the resistance in their procurement and transportation, that is, to increase the supply of materials in this city.

### Price Fluctuations and Goods Shortages: Various Places Are Actively Seeking Countermeasures

Zhenjiang [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The shortages of rice, flour, oil, and firewood in Zhenjiang have reached the most serious stage. The common people and displaced refugees are on the verge of starvation because it is not easy to buy food. However, because some people are intercepting purchases in the suburbs, villagers dare not enter the city, and the sporadic supply of firewood and rice is also decreasing day by day, and the poor are crying out in pain.

[Another telegram] The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various trade associations on the 17th, chaired by Lu Xiaobo. It was resolved that (1) the Zhenjiang merchants' purchases of yarn, cloth, rice, flour, etc., stored in Shanghai and other places that are being detained, should be counted overnight by the various trade associations, and the county government should be requested to negotiate for their release to the market. (2) The average number of goods imported from January to June of this year should be used as the monthly standard for needs, and sent to the county government for forwarding to Shanghai Supervisor Jiang for distribution. In addition, County Magistrate Xie Bi of this county has already traveled to Shanghai by car tonight to attend the economic inspection meeting to be held at the Central Bank in Shanghai at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

The Hankou Economic Inspection Team discovered this afternoon that the Anlian ship was transporting more than 6,000 bags of soybeans, peas, sorghum, and sesame seeds. All the goods on the ship have been detained. At the same time, Zou Jizhi, who is famous for trafficking in gold, has been arrested by the Criminal Police Team again.

[Another telegram] It is reported that some unscrupulous merchants in remote rural towns in Hubei Province have recently refused to use Gold Yuan. After receiving the report, the provincial government has issued a notice to all counties to explain and correct this situation.

Kunming [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] The Kunming market has been in a state of complete chaos for the past week. The trend of refusing to sell and panic buying is very strong, and dangerous situations are emerging. The municipal government has specially convened 83 industries in the city to renegotiate prices. The method is to first discuss among the industries themselves and submit them to the municipal government. Finally, the provincial government will review and approve them under the principle of fairness and reasonableness, and promulgate and implement them. It is heard that the prices proposed by the various industries are more than three times higher than the original negotiated prices, and Chairman Lu is carefully considering them.

Ya'an [Report from our newspaper on the 17th] Commodity prices here have fluctuated greatly recently. Due to the impact of panic buying in Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Chengdu, they have risen several times compared with the prices a month ago, which poses a great threat to the general public.

Since the 17th, the Arab forces' offensive appears more determined and better planned. Some observers believe this is the prelude to a full-scale offensive, expanding from the recent attacks on isolated strongholds along the Jerusalem front. According to an Israeli military communiqué, the Arab Legion launched a counterattack against Israeli positions on the morning of the 17th, but was repulsed. However, Arab sappers succeeded in placing explosives inside Israeli trenches, causing some damage, but no casualties.

### The New Cabinet Can Be Formed Today; The Social Reform Party Decides to Participate in the New Cabinet; The Minister of Finance and Minister of Health, Etc., Have All Been Tentatively Decided

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] According to reliable sources, the sixth post-war cabinet of Japan, under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, is expected to be formed tomorrow. Yoshida spent the night quietly in Oiso yesterday, and is scheduled to return here at noon today. Reliable sources say that even if one or two positions in the new cabinet cannot be assigned in time, the appointment of the heads of the various ministries will be decided tomorrow.

These sources also said that Yoshida is planning to appoint his advisor, Shuto Hideo, as Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Although Shuto himself is willing to serve as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, most members of the Democratic Liberal Party want him to take on the position of Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. The above-mentioned sources further revealed that some key positions in the new cabinet, such as the Minister of Labor, the Minister of Education, and the Prosecutor-General, may be filled by non-partisan and well-respected individuals.

By the afternoon of the 18th, all cabinet ministers should be decided and the appointment ceremony will be held."

### Shidehara and Saito to Serve as Advisors to the New Cabinet

The Cooperative Party Will Demand the Dissolution of the Parliament

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] The new cabinet under Yoshida will concurrently serve as Foreign Minister. The only feature of the new cabinet is that most of the cabinet members are new faces. This is because Yoshida intends to prevent the appointment of personnel who may be involved in corruption cases in the future. Leaders within the Democratic Liberal Party, such as Shidehara, who had served as Prime Minister, and Saito, who had served as a cabinet member, will not participate in the new cabinet, but will only assist Yoshida as advisors. The Cooperative Party, the fourth largest party in the Diet with thirty seats in the Lower House, has decided to demand the dissolution of the Diet and a new election, in order to reflect the will of the people in the Diet. However, the party declared that the dissolution of the Diet should take place after the Yoshida cabinet urges the current special session of the Diet to pass the revised Labor Law bill prohibiting strikes by civil servants. The revised bill was instructed by MacArthur.

### 5,000 Left-Wing Korean Residents in Japan Celebrate the Establishment of the North Korean Regime; Japanese Communist Party and Soviet Representatives Attend

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] A meeting of 5,000 members of the "Korean Residents Union in Japan" controlled by the Communist Party was held, and 120 representatives were elected to visit North Korea. Soviet representative to the Allied Control Council, General Travianko, sent a letter congratulating the meeting, which was read by Colonel Polyesbenko, the secretary of the Soviet delegation. Nosaka, the second-in-command of the Japanese Communist Party, and Kato, chairman of the executive committee of the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union, both attended the meeting and gave speeches. All the speakers denounced South Korean President Syngman Rhee and the new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru as "reactionaries."

Nosaka shouted loudly: "The United States itself was liberated from British rule in the War of Independence, but now it has become a victim of capitalism!" Kato said: "The Japanese labor movement will continue to struggle until a People's Democratic Republic is established in Japan!" The organizers of the meeting said that they will ask the Allied Headquarters to allow 120 representatives to visit North Korea. Regarding this matter, the Allied Headquarters said that they may be allowed, but this is a one-way trip, and they will not be allowed to return to Japan after going to North Korea. This conference is undoubtedly part of a Korean communist propaganda campaign, which is being launched simultaneously among Korean residents in Japan and the people of South Korea, in order to undermine President Syngman Rhee's scheduled visit to Japan on the 19th.

### A Love Letter Leads to a Bloody Incident: Invited to Dinner, Suddenly Heard Gunfire, Young Woman Commits Suicide in Hotel; Police Station Summons Her Husband to Investigate the Cause

[This Newspaper's Report] Chen Jiasheng, a 27-year-old from Changsha, once served as a pilot in the Air Force and studied in the United States. After returning to China, he retired from the military. Two years ago, Chen married He Lunming (20 years old), a woman from Hankou, in their hometown, and they had a child. Recently, Chen came to Shanghai alone to look for work, and was introduced by his classmate Hu Yunxiang to room 22 of the Changfa Hotel in Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. On the 14th of this month, his wife, He Lunming, also followed him to Shanghai with their young child and found Chen's residence. The next afternoon, Chen, his wife, and his friend Hu Yunxiang went to the New York General Assembly on Sichuan Road to dance. When paying for tea, Chen took money from He's wallet and unexpectedly found a love letter from someone named He. He quickly snatched back the wallet and tore up the love letter, throwing it on the ground. Chen picked up the torn letter from the floor and took it back to the hotel, where he questioned his wife. This led to a quarrel. Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m., their friend Hu Yunxiang persuaded Chen and his wife to go out for a walk, hoping to restore their marital relationship. However, He remained depressed and unhappy. Around 8 p.m., Chen invited He out for dinner, but she refused. So Chen and Hu went out of the room first. After walking a few steps, Chen asked Hu to go back to the room and invite He to dinner again. When Hu reached the door, he suddenly heard a loud gunshot from inside the room. Hu knew something had happened and quickly broke open the door, finding He lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing, with a bullet in her right neck. Afterwards, the hotel bookkeeper reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau. The head of the judicial section, Xu Shibin, led patrol officer Jiang Tianfu, police officer Xu Daren, and Liu Shizhu to investigate. They found a revolver, several bullets, and many small photos of He in the suitcase. He was rushed to the Country Hospital for treatment, and as of this morning, she was still undergoing surgery. Her life is said to be in danger. Chen and Hu were both taken to the police station for questioning. According to Chen, the gun was one he had carried when he served in the Air Force, and he brought it to Shanghai in his suitcase from his hometown. The investigation is underway to determine whether He's suicide was voluntary or instigated.

### Wu Yun Chu Hosts Visit to Three Factories: Main Raw Materials Are Water and Air, Electricity Restrictions Hinder Development

[This Newspaper's Report] Industrialist Wu Yun Chu yesterday hosted members of the press to visit his Tianli Liquefied Gas Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, and Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory. After browsing the equipment of each factory and witnessing the continuous production process, the reporters deeply felt that in this autumn of economic bankruptcy and industrial depression, it is truly commendable that these three factories can increase production and strive for development under difficult circumstances. Wu is famous in the world for inventing monosodium glutamate (MSG), but the focus of his industrial efforts lies in the Tianli and Tianyuan factories. The former produces oxygen, nitric acid, and ammonia, while the latter produces hydrochloric acid, bleaching powder, and caustic soda, all of which are important chemical industrial products. Both factories are located near Beixinjing. During the War of Resistance, some of the machinery was moved west, and most of the equipment was destroyed. Post-war restoration was full of difficulties. The Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory resumed operations this spring, while the Tianli Liquefied Gas Factory took three years to restore production. The Liquefied Gas Factory uses new high-pressure machinery, using nitrogen and water from the air as raw materials to first produce ammonia, and then nitric acid with a concentration of 98%, making it the only concentrated nitric acid manufacturer in the country. Currently, the daily output of ammonia is more than one ton, which can produce more than four tons of nitric acid. The daily output of oxygen is more than 200 cylinders (each cylinder holds 6 cubic meters). However, this output is still less than half of what it was before the war, due to electricity restrictions. If all the machinery were running at full capacity, it would require more than 2,000 kilowatts of electricity per month, but the power company can only supply 800 kilowatts, greatly affecting production. The Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory uses the electrolysis of salt method and can produce 450 tons of caustic soda, 3,700 boxes of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 4,000 boxes of bleaching powder per month. Recently, a new rotary bleaching powder tower is under construction. The Tianchu MSG Factory uses wheat gluten and other materials as raw materials and can produce more than 400 tons of MSG per month. Wu believes that the raw materials for basic chemical industries are mainly taken from the natural world in the form of air and water, so there is no problem, but the lack of electricity is very difficult. If the coal energy source for electric power can be continuously supplied, then with the cooperation of coal, air, and water, the chemical industry can be greatly developed.

### Case of Fraudulently Obtaining Jewelry Store Ornaments: Two Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment, Economic Brigade Squad Leader Wang Shuci Acquitted

[This Newspaper's Report] Wu Bofan, who worked as a broker, and Zhou Yunshan, who was unemployed, heard in early February of this year that Qiu Zhaoyan's Baokang Jewelry Store at 703 Xin Zha Road was suspected of dealing in gold and foreign currency. They and other defendants in other cases, Zhou Kuangshan, Shao Xingnan, Xiang Xiuying, Zhou Jingwei, etc., went to the Juele Hotel to discuss the matter. Through Zhang Lin, an economic police officer from the Municipal Police Bureau, they tipped off the Economic Section to obtain a reward. The head of the Economic Brigade, Cheng Yi Kuan, assigned squad leader Wang Shuci on the morning of the 24th of the same month to lead police officers Zhang Lin and others, as well as informants Wu Bofan and Zhou Yunshan, to search the Baokang Jewelry Store. Shao Xingnan and Zhou Kuangshan followed the police officers separately to Qiu Zhaoyan's house on Datong Road to search. Wu and Zhou were assigned to guard the telephone. They finally found more than 40 taels of gold bars and 270 million yuan in legal currency in the jewelry store, as well as a wooden box containing more than 100 taels of ornaments. Wang Shuci sealed the wooden box, intending to take it to the bureau along with the gold bars. However, the jewelry store's bookkeeper, Zhu Wenbin, claimed that exchanging ornaments was not illegal and presented a permit from the Social Affairs Bureau and a receipt for the application as proof. Wang, believing his request to be reasonable, returned the original wooden box. Zhang Lin, who was on the run, saw an opportunity and defrauded the store employee Shen Guigen of 30 taels of ornaments. The loot was distributed the next day under the direction of Zhang Lin. After the police station learned of this, they arrested Wu and others and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. The District Court sentenced Wu Bofan and Zhou Yunshan to three years and six months of imprisonment each for taking advantage of their positions to defraud others of property. Wang Shuci was acquitted. Zhang Lin is still wanted.

### General Prices Seek a Way Out in Turmoil

Since the implementation of the new economic plan, the Shanghai market has been truly turbulent and has undergone many changes; however, in terms of market depression and sparse transactions, the past week was the most notable. In the past week, many items, including yarn, cloth, flour, oil, and cakes, were ordered or publicly suspended from the market. There are countless others that are in a state of semi-suspension or are not officially suspended but are actually suspended. On the other hand, regarding the measures on price limits, on the one hand, the authorities reiterated their determination to strengthen maintenance, and on the other hand, there was talk of adjusting them when necessary. Looking at the market from the perspective of floating capital, the money market was extremely loose and flooded in the early and middle of last week, with estimates of about 1 billion yuan in congestion, and the underground interest rate was once as low as 1%. Northern capital flowed south, and the authorities in charge of Guangdong and Guangxi restricted the entry of cash, not exceeding 1,000 yuan. The control in Southwest China was looser, and the underground interest rate in the Chongqing and Chengdu areas was as high as 12 to 14 yuan, thus forming a phenomenon of capital flowing westward. In short, the current economy has reached a turbulent situation. Maintaining price limits has various difficulties, and abandoning price limits has an even more uncertain future. There are many discussions, and there are also many who are advocating their own positions with a certain bias. It is hoped that the wise authorities will be able to make up their minds, identify their goals, and not disrupt their own steps.

The most important measure taken by the authorities in charge last week was the solution to the raw material supply problem. The Shanghai Materials Adjustment Committee meeting passed the following measures for the supply of industrial raw materials: (1) Industrial raw materials should be divided into the following three types according to the source of supply: (A) all from domestic sources, (B) all from foreign sources, and (C) part from domestic sources, but the insufficient part still needs to be obtained from foreign sources, so as to facilitate planning supply and distribution. (2) Raw materials obtained domestically: (A) those with special management agencies shall be coordinated by the special management agencies. (B) those without special management agencies shall be responsible for supply by the trade associations. (C) those without special management agencies and trade associations shall be consulted by the Central Trust Bureau for procurement. (3) Raw materials obtained from foreign countries should be based on the principle of minimizing the increase in government foreign exchange expenditures, and the Import and Export Control Commission should complete the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth quarters as soon as possible to facilitate import. (4) Regarding the distribution issue, except for cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which are all managed by special agencies, for the remaining raw materials that do not have distribution agencies, the labor unions are planning to collect data, formulate distribution measures, and submit them to the Materials Adjustment Committee for transfer to the Economic Control Supervisor for approval and implementation. (5) Although each distribution agency has its own affiliation, for the sake of overall coordination and adjustment, it is necessary to report the production and sales figures of various materials to the Adjustment Committee on a regular basis so that it can understand the overall situation. The form for this regular reporting is to be negotiated and handled by the Secretariat of the Committee with the various agencies. (6) The amount of raw materials currently in stock for each manufacturer should be clarified, and the Social Affairs Bureau should handle the registration.

On the third day after the above measures were passed (the 15th), a spokesman for the Bureau of Economic Control stated: "(1) In order to ensure a sufficient supply of industrial raw materials, this Bureau has decided that in addition to the foreign exchange quota currently stipulated by the national banks, US$20 million will now be paid by the national banks to the Central Trust Bureau to entrust it to order various industrial raw materials from foreign countries. (2) It has recently been found that some importers in this city are hoarding raw materials. Yesterday, the responsible persons of the industry and commerce trade associations were summoned by the Supervisor's Office and ordered to submit a detailed list of the import orders for the past three months to the Supervisor for reference within three days, and ordered that all raw materials be distributed and sold to the factories at the August 19 price limit."

Regarding the supply of rice in this city, the arrival of goods was scarce last week, and high-quality goods disappeared, with only some transactions of medium-quality goods. Supervisor Jiang then summoned Wan Molin, Zhu Yongming, and other important figures in the rice industry for talks and decided (1) the Bureau of Economic Control can solve the difficulties encountered in purchasing rice at any time, (2) the purchasing certificates required by the purchasing merchants will be stamped and issued by the Supervisor's Office, and (3) the sugar in this city will be exchanged for rice in other ports.

Regarding the implementation of the comprehensive rationing system for daily necessities, the authorities are quite determined. It has been decided that starting next month, rice, oil, salt, cloth, and coal will be rationed first, and then extended to other items. A general census of the city's population will be conducted soon, and new identity cards will be reissued with attached purchase certificates in preparation for the implementation of the rationing system.

Regarding market control, Supervisor Jiang convened representatives of wholesale merchants from 17 units, including cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, cotton, woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, cigarettes, Western medicines, rubber, paper, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, food, vegetables, woolen yarn, department stores, and silk fabrics, to listen to their difficulties in business. Jiang stated that price limits must be observed and that black markets will not be tolerated. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau will hold the second phase of inventory registration for daily necessities, stipulating that the items to be registered are sugar, soap, woolen yarn, kerosene, charcoal, firewood, and soybeans.

According to the National Bank of China, in order to guide idle funds and promote production, the government will allow the issuance of corporate bonds, through banking organizations, to be used for production purposes without increasing currency issuance. The pilot program for this corporate bond is planned to start with the factories and mines under the Resources Committee, which will be purchased by the national banks and then resold to the people. President Yu of the National Bank of China also invited Li Ming, Wang Zhishen, and other responsible persons of banks in this city on Thursday to discuss the organization of a banking group to underwrite corporate bonds and handle production loans in the future. The measures for the issuance of state-owned corporate bonds are said to have been jointly drafted by the Resources Committee and the Central Bank and will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for approval and will be announced and issued in the near future.

Currency and Finance

### The Money Market Outside the Industry Remains Loose, While the Positions Within the Industry Become Increasingly Tight

Last week, the money market in this city, in terms of outside the industry, remained loose due to sluggish transactions and sparse demand, but in general, it was no longer as abnormally flooded as in the previous week due to the absorption by certain groups. In terms of within the industry, the loose trend suddenly decreased from Wednesday, and the supply of money from banks and financial institutions was no longer as widespread as in the past. Interbank lending became more active, but because the supply was abundant, turnover was convenient. According to the idle funds in this city, the accumulated amount had reached more than 700 to 800 million yuan by the end of the previous week. This slight stabilization of the money market is also the first time since "August 19." The reasons for this are nothing more than the following points: First, most ports outside Shanghai generally show a tight money market and high underground interest rates, especially in Chengdu and Chongqing, which is a kind of attraction for the idle funds in this city. The reason why funds have flowed out sharply in the past week is probably due to this reason. It is estimated that the daily outflow of funds is between 1.2 million and 5 million yuan, which has also helped a lot in stabilizing the money market. Second, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications opened current deposit accounts with a monthly interest rate of 2% for commercial banks and financial institutions, adding another outlet for those with surplus funds. It is said that the amount of this current deposit has reached 20 million yuan in recent days. Third, the underground interest rate in Tianjin and other places is as high as 30%, and the authorities have stipulated that the withdrawal of funds remitted from the north will be made in installments, so the outflow of funds to the south has decreased compared with the past. Fourth, short-term treasury bills continue to be sold, and by the end of last week, the total amount had reached more than 100 million gold yuan. The funds invested in real estate have also exceeded 100 million yuan since "August 19," which has also had a small effect on tightening the money market. Fifth, the measures for increasing the capital of banks and financial institutions have been officially announced, increasing the industry's demand for funds.

As for cash, it was also shorter than before last week, which is because part of the outflow of funds was carried out by transporting cash. It is reported that some people have been collecting 50 and 100 yuan gold yuan notes in recent days, which may be related to the transportation of cash.

Although the authorities have prohibited the public from announcing the detailed figures of the clearing differences of the national banks, it is known that the huge clearing difference on Tuesday last week set a new record after the currency reform. On Wednesday and Friday, due to the collection of payments and deposits from other banks, the national banks reversed the precedent since September 9 and turned from deficit to surplus, but the amount of the surplus was not large. As for foreign banks, they all showed a surplus from Monday to Friday. Commercial banks and financial institutions all showed a deficit on Wednesday and Thursday, and the deficit on Wednesday was as high as more than 6 million yuan, which is of course also one of the phenomena of the money market becoming tight.

Speaking of the market underground interest rate, it also rose consistently in the situation of the money market within the industry becoming tight. For example, on Tuesday, it was only between 2% and 4%, but after Wednesday, it generally rose to 6.5%, and on Friday, it even rose to 9%. It is also said that the longer-term interest rate is as high as 20% or more, which is said to be specially for transferring these funds to Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places to make national profits.

Last week, the internal remittance rate of commercial banks and financial institutions in this city did not change in the situation of funds being remitted out exceeding the inflow. The Guangzhou remittance rate was still 24 yuan, but the Central Bank has limited the Guangzhou remittance to only 5,000 yuan per transaction to prevent the large outflow of funds to the south. The Xiamen remittance rate was 20 yuan, and the remittance rates for Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, and other places were all 12 yuan. The Tianjin remittance rate was 5 yuan.

Last week, the official foreign exchange rate remained the same. Gold shops have stopped buying and selling gold jewelry. The price of gold in Hong Kong hovered downward. On Monday, the price of gold per tael was HK$318. On Tuesday, it fell by HK$2. On Wednesday, it fell to HK$314.5. On Thursday, it shrank to HK$309.75. The market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong once rebounded from the previous week. It is said that one of the reasons was that a certain bank bought a large amount of US dollars in Hong Kong, and the other reason was that the outflow of funds from this city promoted competition. Last week, the market price of the US dollar in Hong Kong was stable at a high of 5.31 yuan from Monday to Wednesday, but the price suddenly softened on Thursday, only making 5.28 yuan.

Industrial and Commercial Trends

### How to Solve the Problem of Raw Material Supply?

In the recent surge of panic buying, how to expand the supply of raw materials has become one of the most important issues urgently needed to be resolved by the industrial and commercial sectors. According to Huadong News Agency, an industrial tycoon made two suggestive remarks on the issue of easing raw material supply: (1) Various raw materials that cannot be produced domestically should be imported as much as possible. The import quota can be increased according to needs. The foreign exchange paid should mainly come from export settlement and overseas remittances, and the current foreign exchange obtained by the Central Bank and various collecting banks should be allocated to supplement it. (2) The selling prices of various raw materials that can be produced domestically in the production areas must be strictly stabilized. There are also many wealthy households in rural areas who hoard and speculate, and they should also be thoroughly inspected and ordered to sell. In addition, the quantity of raw materials needed by each factory should be planned, reviewed and allocated in a unified manner. The above two points can represent some of the industrial and commercial sectors' views on the issue of easing raw material problems.

However, whether the opinions of the people can be approved is still quite questionable. For example, the Shanghai District Materials Regulation Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 12th to discuss the supply of industrial raw materials and the regulation of daily necessities in detail. However, the resolution on importing foreign raw materials still decided to adhere to the principle of minimizing the government's foreign exchange expenditure. The import quota also only decided that the Import and Export Management Committee should expedite the completion of the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth quarters, without showing any signs of relaxation.

Since the import quota stipulated by the government cannot be relaxed under the principle of not increasing foreign exchange expenditure, the focus of the problem will inevitably shift to self-provided foreign exchange. According to those who can use self-provided foreign exchange to import materials and raw materials, there are generally three sources. The first is the foreign exchange positions held by Chinese people, but most of them have now been collected by the government. The first is the import of overseas capital in the form of materials. Although the provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th has passed the measures for overseas capital to apply for import, most of the measures are aimed at the importers of production equipment. Regarding the import of raw materials, Article 4 of the measures stipulates that it is limited to the applicant's own use and does not exceed six months of production needs. Under this regulation, ordinary industrialists and businessmen who do not also have the status of "overseas Chinese" are naturally excluded. Even for industrialists and businessmen who also have the status of "overseas Chinese," it is questionable whether they are willing to risk importing raw materials with a six-month limit under the current situation. According to reports: "The Import and Export Management Committee has received very few applications for overseas capital import in recent days." This is probably not accidental. Finally, the third source of self-provided foreign exchange is of course the exchange settlement of exporters. In other words, only by striving to increase export exchange settlement can the expansion of raw material re-import be demanded. However, this hope is also felt to be slim due to "the recent inconsistent domestic market conditions for export goods, making it difficult for merchants to purchase and transport them, which poses a problem for promoting imports and striving for domestic exchange." Furthermore, although the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 16th passed the measures for applying for the import of foreign orders for which payment has been made, the clearance of this import is not only limited to goods ordered and paid for before "August and September," but must also be limited to those allowed to be remitted in accordance with the "Central Bank's Foreign Currency Deposit Payment Measures." It can be seen that it is difficult to have a significant effect on expanding raw material imports to meet urgent needs.

Since the large-scale import of foreign raw materials has become a problem, the expansion of domestic raw material supply is mixed with optimism due to the inability to thoroughly implement the price restriction policy. This is a simple truth. On the one hand, it is necessary to adhere to the "August 19th" defense line, and on the other hand, it is constantly creating floating capital and purchasing a large amount of materials from production areas. As a result, urban and rural prices are reversed, and the source of raw materials is cut off without being cut off. It can be seen that the reason why the supply of raw materials has shrunk in recent days is not simply a raw material problem, but a link in the entire economic policy and the entire political problem.

### Allocation Ratio of College Funding - Ministry of Education Explains Standards for the Second Half of the Year - Increased Research Equipment Costs Must Be Viewed in Light of National Financial Resources

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 17th] The allocation ratio of funding for national universities: during the war, those used for salaries and meals for faculty and students accounted for slightly less than 50%, while those used for research equipment accounted for slightly more than 50%. Currently, faculty and student expenses account for 80%, and only 20% is used for research equipment. General equipment is considered simple. The Ministry of Education recently convened a symposium of university presidents, requesting improvement, with 60% used for salaries and meals, and 40% used for research. (Already recorded in this newspaper) This proposal is equivalent to increasing the current funding for each university by about 40%. The progress of this matter is being watched by all parties.

According to statements from responsible parties in the Ministry of Education: The funding for national colleges and universities can be listed in five categories. The allocation standards for the second half of the year are briefly described below: (1) Regular expenses are first calculated by converting the nature of each college's departments and subjects into points, and then listed according to the points each college should receive and the number of students. (2) Construction equipment expansion and improvement fees are listed according to the points each college should receive and the actual needs. (3) Temporary special project expenses are listed based on the special needs of each college in the second half of this year. (4) Employee living expenses have been paid in gold yuan since August of this year. Living expenses are allocated by the national treasury in accordance with the approved payment standards for the number of budgeted employees. (5) Meals for publicly funded students and scholarship students are issued in accordance with the number of students in each college and the approved standards in each region. Categories (1), (2), and (3) are used for research equipment, while categories (4) and (5) are used for salaries and meals for faculty and students. However, the situation varies depending on the number of employees and students in each college, the quality of existing equipment, and the location. Therefore, even in terms of the funding for the second half of this year, the allocation ratio of expenses for faculty and student salaries and meals to research equipment expenses is not entirely the same, and it is even more disparate compared to the pre-war ratio of 50% each. The Ministry of Education is planning to invite experts to conduct detailed research on this proposal. If the research equipment expenses are changed to 40%, it will inevitably increase the total annual expenditure of the country because the Ministry of Education has no other sources of funding. Therefore, this improvement must be gradually improved depending on the country's financial resources and the amount of total tax revenue. If it can be realized in the short term, the Ministry of Education will go all out.

### Football League Opens - 3-0 One-Sided Victory - Qingbai Defeats Qunli Completely

The fourth football league opened yesterday. Qingbai defeated Qunli completely with a dominant posture of 3-0. The first half was 1-0. The situation was completely one-sided. The audience in the Yiyuan stands was estimated at about 3,000 people, which was quite lively.

Qingbai attacked first. At seven minutes, Xiao Fei crossed the ball, and Afu headed it, but it was caught by Xie Boming. After that, it was all Qingbai's offense, and Qunli's hinterland was often ravaged. At 20 minutes, Lin Shaojun started an uprising on the wing, and Jiang Yanqing committed a foul by tripping someone. Sun Hanxing took a penalty kick, but it was saved by Huang Shijie, which won applause from the audience. Yan Shixin replaced Fu Naidang. At 40 minutes, Lusheng dribbled the ball and went deep along the side. Xiao Luo passed the ball to Afu, who did not hesitate and kicked it into the goal. Boming撲扑住, but the ball had already entered the white line. Qingbai took the lead 1-0 in the first half.

In the second half, Qingbai did not make any changes. Qunli replaced Jin Jiasheng and Yu Musen with Yu Zhenyue and Chen Laifa. Five minutes into the game, Xiao Gu dribbled the ball deep and passed it to Xiao Fei, who shot it into the goal near the goal, adding another goal to make it 2-0. Half an hour later, Xiao Fei passed the ball to Xiao Gu, and Afu kicked it straight into the goal, making it 3-0. Qingbai won three goals cleanly. In order to reverse the decline, Qunli interchanged Yu Zhenyue and Lin Shaojun, but it still did not improve. Xiao Gu陷一城 again, but it was not ordered because of offside. Before the time ran out, Qunli's Yao Lihua attacked the camp alone, and Huang Shijie撲撲空, but fortunately Meng Yiliang was behind to kick it away. The silver whistle blew, and Qingbai defeated Qunli with three goals.

### Remembering Dafu

— Zhu Zhenjiang

Dafu's birth year cannot be verified, and his death date cannot be examined. This coincides with Zhu Muqing's saying that writers are unwilling to fill out resumes. However, heaven and earth are the inn of all things, and time is a passing traveler of a hundred generations. In a short life, as long as it is enough to comfort oneself and others, that is enough. As for ordinary people who are afraid of not recording their birth and death dates completely, and regard it as the only important way in social interaction, this is ultimately the behavior of petty men, not enough to talk to elegant people and reclusive scholars. And Dafu's personality is indeed not someone who is rigidly benevolent or overly righteous. He thought of everything as acting on stage and never thoroughly investigated it. Even his own age was not allowed to be clarified by his descendants. As for the number of books, he even said that there were as many as five million volumes. If so, I think the booksellers in Hangzhou would definitely know about it. But I have never heard them talk about Dafu's collection of books.

That's right, Dafu did have a book-buying habit. When we lived in the same hotel in Tokyo, he often brought back a few books from the old bookstores in Jinbocho, saying that he had bought many good books today. The quality of the books certainly varies depending on the person, time, and place. So I often told him that these were all your good books. As for whether he read them after buying so many books, that is another question.

My acquaintance with Dafu was on the day I took the entrance exam for the preparatory course of Tokyo First High School in the second year of the Republic. His seat was right in front of me, and Xu Zuzheng was behind me. In the end, 32 people were selected from the 800 to 900 candidates. Both Dafu and I passed the arts course. Later, we lived together. He told me that he was engaged, which was decided by his brother Yu Hua. And he was about two or three years younger than me at the time, or one or two years younger. If someone asks me how old I am this year, as proof of Dafu's age, I would say that if I have a hundred years of longevity, then I have passed more than half of it. If we were to cite the saying that seventy is rare since ancient times, then Dafu did not die young, and I am already on the front line today.

Dafu and I often acted in unison. We believed that the arts course was empty, and it would be more reliable to transfer to the medical course. After the transfer exam, we both became medical students. After graduating from high school preparatory, he entered the Fifth High School, and I entered the Fourth High School; he entered Kyoto University, and I entered Kyushu University; there were very few opportunities to see each other. And he, who was good at changing, changed from medical science to economics.

After he and I left Japan, we didn't meet many times. Once, in a hotel in Shanghai, I saw him and Moruo lying on the bed, saying that you came at the right time, you can see our life today. This was exactly the era when they were busy writing, the era when writers were down on their luck, and also the era of their "creation." After that, I accidentally saw him once in a Shanghai tram. He said that he had not been feeling well recently and was afraid that he had lung disease. From his haggard face, I had already seen that he was suffering from a chronic illness, and the heroic spirit of his youth had long been shrouded in twilight. But from his changeable temperament, there were still a few traces of his early demeanor left. He told me that his home was in Peiping and that he wanted to see his wife. At the same time, I didn't ask him whether a person with a double life was enough to kill his body and mind.

What I can't forget most about Dafu is the time we spent in the dormitory. After we had evening self-study, we often wanted to sneak out of school to eat something. But the gate was heavily guarded, and we couldn't cross the line. So we ventured to escape from the side gate, and after a full meal, we brought a few raw eggs in our pockets and climbed back in from the side gate. When we returned to the dormitory, just as we were about to摸摸出 the eggs, alas,天地玄黃 had long become 宇宙洪荒. When both hands were stained with egg yolk, we never dared to show any expression in front of our classmates, and only looked at each other like prisoners of Chu.

Recalling the situation at that time, it seemed that Dafu was still shining in front of me. But this was already more than thirty years ago. Alas, Dafu!

### Qing Ping Yue

— Gu Fei

Waking up as if drunk, gauze green hides my sorrows. My soul drifts further from my pillow, dreams only adding to my misery. The small lamp casts a dim red glow. The small window turns lightly, revealing silver buds. I move the bright mirror from the window, the person in the mirror resembling a yellow flower.

### Ode to Mother-Forget-Me-Not Flowers

Fragrant snowflakes feel a thousand points cold, light floats in a clear stream beneath the bright moon, always blooming and falling without restraint, why should foolish people painfully entrust their feelings.

### New Initiatives in the US Postal Service

— Cong Zhi

The US Postal Service recently proposed issuing a "Special Express Stamp" with a face value of 20 cents. Its main function is to replace the currently popular "Air Express" stamp of 18 cents. Anyone who uses "Special Express Stamps" does not need to specify what method to use for delivery. Instead, postal experts will plan the fastest route, ensuring that the letter arrives faster than a regular air express letter that has to wait for a plane.

### Drinking Alone

— Yu Chuang

There are only a few chrysanthemums in the vase, and they seem to be gradually withering, but they are still vermilion and dark green, reflecting each other's beauty. A golden thread on the edge of the petals is even more like a finely crafted golden dragon painted on the outside of those vermilion lacquer teacups. That red, that green, plus those lithe golden yellows, form a strong picture rich in oriental colors.

Under the flowers are two or three dishes and a pot of warm good wine. On the left side of the table is a book that I like to read. I drink my cup slowly. Sometimes, in order to repeatedly ponder a poem, I forget to drink the wine; sometimes, in order to savor the taste of the wine, or to revel in the countless associations that the chrysanthemums give me, I forget the book. The poem is full of beautiful scenery: a sky full of brilliant clouds, small wildflowers swaying in the wind all over the mountains, a young man gently knocking on the door in the dark night, seeing in the flash of a match that the one who opens the door is the girl he loves so much... The chrysanthemums also bring me countless dreams: those forgotten smiles and frowns, just like a wisp of smoke slowly rising into the clear sky, I thought they had disappeared completely, but in the blink of an eye, they reappear vaguely.

It is silent. Under the lamp, the small room seems smaller and warmer than during the day. I silently raise my glass, and I feel that this moment is completely my own. I don't have to be as careful as I am in public, enduring all kinds of restraints; I don't have to force myself to accompany those annoying guests who keep shouting "Cheers"; everything is natural, drink when you want to drink, stay when you want to stay. Wearing a comfortable old jacket and dragging a pair of cloth shoes, I put all the idleness behind me, my heart and face are empty, and I can read the good books that I have always liked to read but never had time to read. Moreover, reading at this time is exactly what Bacon called "chewing" and "digesting," with wonderful meanings emerging one after another and endless images. Compared with the reading method more than ten years ago in university, with the table full of reference books and notebooks, the difficulty is different, and the meaning is not quite the same. Perhaps, the hard study behind closed doors more than ten years ago was for today's preparation?

Sometimes, I push the book aside for a while, gladly raise my glass, and think like this: All day long, I have worked hard and diligently, without doing anything fraudulent or selfish, without letting anyone down. I still have these few enchanting chrysanthemums in front of me, and the cup is full of fragrant and rich good wine, isn't that gratifying? To be able to have a moment of tranquility in my heart is the ultimate blessing.

In the quiet night, I only hear the chirping of crickets around the eaves outside the window. Autumn is already deep, and another year is about to pass. If you say it's bleak, it's true that it's a bit bleak. Year after year passes, and when I look at everything, I always feel that the meaning is gradually fading. Life is like this, without brilliant sparks, without dazzling light, just like a plain and ordinary stream in a Jiangnan village, flowing quietly. This stream could not generate unparalleled electricity like a torrent, so that the people on both banks could universally receive its benefits; but, if there were clusters of beautiful little flowers on both sides of this stream, nourished by the stream, growing up, then there is nothing to regret, is there?

I push open the window and see the cold moon in the sky. As the wind passes, the leaves in the garden rustle. The chrysanthemums in the vase quietly fell down. I quietly raised my wine glass again.

### Human Skin Book

— Song Xian

Before the French Revolution, Rousseau wrote "The Social Contract." It was greatly ridiculed by many nobles at the time, who said that the book's arguments were empty and not worth mentioning. But these nobles were mostly sent to the guillotine during the revolutionary frenzy, executed, and unexpectedly, the skin of their remains was used as the cover of "The Social Contract."

The British Museum Library has a book bound in the skin of a murderer. The Marlborough Library in London also has two books said to be bound in the skin of two witches.

Even more strange is that a French woman, admiring the works of the astronomer Camille Flammarion, made a will, wishing to dedicate the skin of her remains after death to binding these books.

### Snippets

— Xian Si

A new aluminum bridge has been built in Quebec, Canada, weighing only 400,000 pounds. If steel were used to build a bridge of the same length, it would weigh about 1.5 million pounds.

A kind of "glass" ball (the "glass" of "glass stockings," i.e., "plastic") has recently become popular in the United States. It is filled with clear water, and fresh flowers are placed inside, which magnifies the shape of the flowers when viewed from the outside, and the colors are particularly bright. The ball is about seven inches in diameter, with a spiral on the upper part that can be opened and closed.

### Xue Nei Ling

In the twenty days after the currency reform, there were several types of shops in Beiping that were "selling off" rather than "snapping up." These were silk shops, eyewear and watch shops, and department stores. These luxury goods shops were mostly located in busy downtown areas, resplendent and magnificent. The owners and staff were all dressed in extraordinary clothes, with high expenses and heavy taxes. Moreover, they were all close to each other, with similar appearances. Beiping was not a prosperous commercial port. Although there were some modern men and women, the supply greatly exceeded the demand. Although department stores were timely tools for profit (because they also sold shiny and fragrant everyday goods), one store profited, and many more continued to open. The two main streets in the east and west cities were dazzling. Many department stores and companies often posted slogans such as "Grand Lottery," "Special Discount," and even "Ruthless!," "Cheap!," "Please Compare Who Is Really Cheap!" on their windows, in order to quickly sell for cash to cover expenses. After the currency reform, taking advantage of the abundant floating capital and the large number of buyers, they opened their doors even wider, clearly marking prices. Several eyewear and silk shops even jointly published large advertisements in various newspapers with the good title of "Working Together to Assist Currency Reform, Truly Selling at Limited Prices" to attract customers. Young men and women, as well as those who exchanged gold and silver for large amounts of new currency and had nowhere to settle it, flocked to them. The owners behind the counters were delighted to "clear their stock," while the customers were happy to "use their floating capital." Both sides needed each other and got what they wanted. They busily served customers, forming an unprecedented false prosperity. This lasted from the end of August to the end of September. In the past half-month, it has gradually faded. It is truly "in winter, the smoke makes the flowers like brocade, but in the blink of an eye, they will become haggard." It was originally not a normal phenomenon.

### Scenes of Nanjing

— Shi Yu

I finally waited for a Sunday, which was also the annual National Day. How could I waste it in vain? I had long ago arranged for a friend who had just come to Nanjing to go shopping in the morning and visit Yanzi Rock in the afternoon. That day was indeed what is called a clear blue sky, without a cloud in sight. We went straight from Gulou to Xinjiekou. We saw crowds of people everywhere, and national flags flying everywhere. Nanjing had many government offices, and each one was decorated with some color. The shops were also particularly pleasing this year, celebrating by closing their doors, as if it were the New Year. We ran straight to the Central Market (the largest market in Nanjing), but the iron gates were tightly closed. A large group of civil servants, soldiers, and ordinary citizens were sighing in front of the door, as if they had to spend some money. We ran through half of Nanjing, still empty-handed, and the loudspeakers in Xinjiekou had already chimed twelve o'clock. We had to fill our stomachs first.

Nanjing's snacks are famous, with flavors from Tianjin, Beiping, Suzhou, Sichuan, Hunan, and more. But the recent booming business often makes the bosses nervous. As soon as we walked into that small restaurant, the boss quickly bowed to us: "Please come earlier next time!" We didn't fall for his trick and barged in, waiting in the corner. Seeing that a table was about to finish eating, we took the opportunity to occupy the seats. We almost "snatched" our order and sat for three-quarters of an hour before we could finally enjoy our meal. A small civil servant-like person sitting across from me ordered a large basin of steamed buns, a large portion of home-style rice, two stir-fried dishes, and a bowl of sliced ear soup, which surprised me greatly. He seemed to realize it too, and said blankly: "Isn't it good to eat more when there's something to eat?" He pointed to the countless people who were burying their heads in eating and said: "I'm not alone!"

After filling ourselves, we walked out of the restaurant sadly and ran straight to Jiangnan Station. We wanted to go to Yanzi Rock to broaden our minds and wash away the sour aftertaste of that small civil servant. When we arrived at the station, the long queue had already turned a corner. We had no choice but to buy tickets and line up at the back. In the past, there was a Jiangnan train to Yanzi Rock every ten minutes. I thought at most three trains would take the people in front, so I waited with peace of mind. I didn't know that things were different now. We waited for half an hour before a train slowly arrived. Fortunately, a ticket seller told me that trains to Yanzi Rock now ran every hour and a half. I calculated that I would have to wait another four and a half hours to get on the train. If I waited another four and a half hours for the train back to the city after arriving at Yanzi Rock, it would probably be the next morning. So I had to give up and drag my tired body to the movie theater to try my luck.

There were only six movie theaters in Nanjing. We chose one that was showing an "art" film, thinking that fewer people might come. Unexpectedly, that theater had few seats and also allowed advance sales, so the window of the ticket office seemed to change magically, opening and closing in an instant. In just a moment, it was announced that the tickets were sold out. I looked at my friend who had just come to Nanjing, and had to express my infinite apologies. We couldn't laugh or cry, it was truly a case of mixed emotions.

We had no choice but to wander aimlessly on the streets filled with crowds. We saw the twilight gradually blurring, the setting sun slowly sinking, and suddenly realized that the holiday was over.
