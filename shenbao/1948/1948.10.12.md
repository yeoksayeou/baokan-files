### President's Address on National Day: Elucidating the Current Path to National Reconstruction and Encouraging All Citizens to Fulfill Their Responsibility in Suppressing the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Republic of China's 37th National Day commemoration was solemnly held in the Presidential Palace on the morning of the 10th. President Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, with Vice President Li, as well as more than 400 central civil and military officials, including Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Boling, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, and He Yingqin, participating. The interior and exterior of the Presidential Palace's auditorium were decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, creating a brilliant and renewed atmosphere. The President, wearing the Grand Cordon of the Colored Jade Medal, arrived at precisely 10:00 AM and delivered an impromptu speech. He first recounted the difficulties faced by the Founding Father and the martyrs in creating the Republic and the arduousness of the current task of national reconstruction. The President expressed optimism about the future of national reconstruction and emphasized that the path to national reconstruction must follow the teachings of the Founding Father and implement the Three Principles of the People. The President pointed out that the Communist bandits are enemies of nationalism, and their goal is to eliminate the Chinese nation. At this critical juncture when the fate of the nation is at stake, all members of the government should be especially vigilant, strive together, and recognize that suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion is the implementation of nationalism. They should not fear dangers or difficulties, and should work together in military and political affairs to fulfill the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. The full text of the President's speech is as follows:

### The Urgent Task is to Complete Nationalism

Today is the 37th National Day of our Republic of China. Reflecting on thirty-seven years ago, our Founding Father led the revolutionary martyrs and the compatriots of the whole country to fight arduously and unitedly, overthrowing the rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for more than two hundred and sixty years, abolishing the autocratic political system of thousands of years, and establishing the Republic of China. This is the most glorious and greatest historical achievement in the history of our Chinese nation. Today, as we approach this glorious anniversary, recalling the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of our Founding Father and the martyrs, and returning to the responsibilities we should fulfill, we feel an even greater burden. Only by being of one heart and one mind, and continuing to work hard to complete the unfinished cause of the Founding Father, can we comfort the spirits of the Founding Father and the martyrs in heaven.

The Republic of China was founded by the Founding Father himself. The Founding Father's Three Principles of the People are the principles of our national reconstruction. For more than fifty years, the sacrifice and struggle of the revolutionary martyrs have been entirely for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. This March, we convened the National Assembly and, according to the Constitution, established a constitutional government. The implementation of the Principle of Democracy has thus achieved initial success. From then on, the Republic of China began to be a republic that lived up to its name. The Founding Father once said that the Republic of China before the thirteenth year (of the Republic) was only a Republic in name, without the substance of a Republic, because warlords and bureaucrats stole political power. From the thirteenth year to the present, twenty-four years have passed. During these twenty-four years, although our country has encountered difficulties and hardships unprecedented in the national reconstruction period of any country, our government and people have always been united in striving to realize the Three Principles of the People, and finally established a Republic of China that lives up to its name. This arduous and outstanding achievement deserves our celebration and can further strengthen our confidence in the future of national reconstruction. Since the Principle of Democracy can achieve success, the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood will naturally not be difficult. As long as our government and people can follow the teachings of the Founding Father, work together in unity, and strive to promote it, we can naturally enter a state of people's livelihood, prosperity, and happiness.

What I want to remind our government colleagues and compatriots across the country today is that our most pressing task at present is to complete nationalism. Everyone knows that the completion of nationalism is the prerequisite for realizing the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood. Only with national independence and the guarantee of survival can democracy and people's livelihood be realized. If nationalism cannot be realized, then democracy cannot develop, and people's livelihood cannot be promoted. The entire country and nation will be reduced to slaves and beasts of burden for foreign races. In the Xinhai Revolution, we overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty, and everyone thought that this was the success of nationalism. Later, there was the invasion of Japanese imperialists. After the victory of the War of Resistance, everyone thought that the Founding Father's nationalism could be fully realized, but today it proves that this is not entirely true. Today, the enemies of our nation still exist, and they are very insidious and stubborn. Eliminating this enemy is more difficult than overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty and defeating Japan, because the Manchu Qing Dynasty and Japan were foreign enemies, their targets were clear, and they were easy to recognize. The compatriots of the whole country suffered the pain of their trampling and oppression, and naturally rose up to resist with the same hatred and indignation, and would never be deceived or fooled by them. Today, the enemies of our nation are the insidious and vicious Communist bandits. The Communist bandits wear the false mask of Chinese people and act as the Fifth Column of international organizations to kill their compatriots. On the surface, they chant slogans of democracy and freedom, but in reality, everything they do is to destroy China's democracy and freedom. Because they are also Chinese, their crimes of acting as accomplices for tigers are difficult to identify. Because they are skilled in deceptive propaganda, their conspiracies and tricks are not only difficult for ordinary citizens to identify, but even intellectuals are often fooled by them and echo them, and the government's work of suppressing the rebellion encounters significant obstacles. Therefore, I believe that since the Founding Father led the National Revolution, we have only encountered the final enemy today, and nationalism has only encountered the final test. At this final juncture when the fate of our country and nation hangs in the balance, to avoid the tragic fate of becoming slaves and beasts of burden, we must raise our vigilance, recognize the true face of the Communist bandits, and give full play to our conscience of loving our country and our nation, fight with the same hatred and indignation, and sacrifice and struggle to eliminate this final enemy, ensure the unity and independence of our country, and then can we truly realize the Founding Father's Three Principles of the People.

### The Future Situation of Suppressing the Bandits: Military Suppression of the Rebellion Cannot be Completed in a Few Months or a Year or Two; Everyone Should Strengthen Solidarity and Strive to Eliminate the Enemy

When the constitutional government was established in the first half of this year, I estimated that the banditry south of the Yellow River would be cleared up before November. However, it is now October, and not only has the banditry south of the Yellow River not been cleared up, but recently Jinan was also captured by the bandit army. This is the greatest misfortune for the country and the thing I personally feel most ashamed of. Why did I make this estimate at the time? It was because I imagined that after the implementation of the Constitution, the compatriots of the whole country would all assume political responsibility and would surely unify their will and concentrate their strength to enhance the work of suppressing the rebellion and banditry. However, later facts were completely contrary to the ideal. The reason for this is that people who have not suffered from the banditry are misled by the Communist bandits' false propaganda, thinking that the Communist bandits are also Chinese and that they are also implementing democracy and freedom. Therefore, they feel that the Communist bandits' rebellion is just an ordinary civil strife and will not be as cruel and terrifying as the Japanese imperialists. Because everyone has this misconception in their minds, their will cannot be concentrated, their spirits tend to be lax, and their strength cannot be brought into play, so that in the past six months, our military suppression of the bandits has not achieved the effect of military and civilian cooperation and has suffered many setbacks. This is the main reason for our failure. If we do not reflect on this today, if we do not correct this mentality of following the old ways and hoping for luck in the past, if we do not recognize that the Communist bandits are the enemy of our entire nation, and if we do not realize the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction, and thus unite our hearts and minds, fight with the same hatred and indignation, and make a life-and-death決鬥 (jue dou, duel), then the future situation of suppressing the bandits will be even more difficult and serious than it is now. The Founding Father often said, "Spirit is superior to matter." Today, the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation depends only on a change of mind. If we can reflect on the reasons for failure, remember the lessons of the past, and from now on unite our spirits, concentrate our strength, and strive to fight, then the more dangerous our revolutionary environment, the more arduous our work, and the more rapid our success. This is evidenced by the revolutionary history of the past thirty years. No matter how difficult and arduous the times, as long as we can follow the principles and the responsibilities of the revolution, regardless of all sacrifices, taking risks and overcoming difficulties, and never giving up, we will eventually succeed. On the contrary, the reason why the Communist bandits are bound to fail is because they only shout slogans of revolution, but in fact have no revolutionary spirit at all, only engage in opportunism and seek personal gain at the expense of others, and will eventually harm themselves and others and move towards self-destruction. Because we have this spirit of taking risks, overcoming difficulties, and working hard, the more difficulties we encounter, the greater the chance of success. In the past six months, we have indeed revealed many weaknesses and shortcomings, discovered many mistakes, and encountered many unexpected difficulties, but this is undoubtedly a favorable phenomenon. The exposure of weaknesses is the data for our reflection, the discovery of mistakes is the beginning of our improvement, and temporary setbacks are the foundation for our turning defeat into victory. As long as we can continue to reform and continue to progress, we will eventually achieve the goal of success. Of course, the military suppression of the Communist bandits in the future cannot be completed in a short period of a few months or a year or two. However, the ancients said, "Born in sorrow, die in ease." The more overlapping the sorrows, the more we should invigorate our aspirations and cultivate new forces. As long as all members of our government and compatriots across the country can reflect and awaken, eliminate the accumulated bad habits of following the old ways, being slack, and being disorganized and extravagant, unite our spirits, cooperate fully, be self-reliant and self-strengthening, then the weaknesses of the bandits will inevitably be gradually exposed, and they will eventually fail. In the past, the Communist bandits exaggerated and claimed that they could overthrow our government this year, but now they plan to extend the rebellion to five years. Everyone must know that time is the factor of our victory. The longer the time, the more the weaknesses of the Communist bandits are exposed, the deeper the people's understanding of their true nature, and the closer the time of their failure. Now the people in the bandit areas have a deep hatred for the rule of the treacherous bandits. Wherever they cannot control it militarily, the people will immediately rise up to resist. This proves that the Communist bandits are the common enemy of our entire country and nation, regardless of region or occupation. Under our strong and deep national consciousness, they will inevitably be eliminated. All members of our government and compatriots across the country must recognize the difficulty of the situation and the magnitude of our own responsibilities. From now on, no matter which department of the government or any sector of society, we must concentrate our efforts to strengthen our military suppression of the bandits, be diligent and vigilant in our work, be thrifty and frugal in our lives, and be harmonious and cooperative in political and economic affairs, cooperate with each other, unite closely, and intensify our efforts under the same goal to eliminate the enemies of our nation and implement the Founding Father's nationalism. Only when nationalism is fully realized can the implementation of democracy and the principle of people's livelihood be guaranteed and successful. These are my thoughts on today's National Day commemoration, which I use to encourage myself, my colleagues, and my compatriots across the country. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. (The End)

### Director of the Shandong Social Affairs Department Arrives in Nanjing to Report: Wang Yaowu Dies in a Breakout Attempt; His Body is Buried by the People; Claims of Capture Are Absolutely Incorrect

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] "General Wang Yaowu indeed died in a breakout attempt during the Jinan campaign, and the reported news of his capture is absolutely incorrect." This was the report given by Wang Pingyi, director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Social Affairs, at the Shandong Provincial Association in Nanjing on the 10th. Wang disguised himself and escaped from Jinan on September 29th, four days after Jinan fell, and arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 10th after experiencing many hardships. According to Wang, "General Wang Yaowu accidentally fell into a camouflaged machine gun bunker while inspecting the positions on the city wall of Jinan at 3:00 PM on the 21st, and injured his right kneecap. The injury was very serious, and he needed to be supported to move. In the afternoon of the 23rd, when I had dinner with Chairman Wang in the provincial government, Wang's attitude was still very calm, and the officers and soldiers under his command were also in high spirits. In the afternoon of the 24th, the street fighting was very fierce, and Chairman Wang went to the Beijige heights in the city to command the battle, and I lost contact with him. On the 29th, when I escaped to the Huangtai Railway Station Huayuanzhuang in the east of Jinan city, I met a staff member of the Social Affairs Department's porridge factory who told me that Chairman Wang led a small number of troops and broke out of the city at 8:00 AM on the 27th, encountered bandits west of Huangtai Bridge, and died in battle on the spot. The accompanying guards were also sacrificed, and Chairman Wang's body has been buried by the local people." Wang continued, "On the 26th, the Communist bandits in Jinan city widely rumored that they had captured four Wang Yaowus, and three places in the local Communist bandits near Jinan also reported that they had captured Wang Yaowu. At that time, any middle-aged person with a short, stout body and a dark complexion could be mistaken for Wang Yaowu. In Shouguang County, the 'Wang Yaowu' detained by the bandits was actually a retired old county magistrate, who confessed to being Wang Yaowu because he could not bear the torture of the Communist bandits. The bandits publicized this widely, but when he was taken to Jinan, they realized he was not the one. As of the time I left Jinan, the Communist bandits were still searching for Chairman Wang's whereabouts."

### President Chiang Presides Over KMT Memorial Week, Explains General Situation of Politics, Economy, and Military; Current Situation Indeed Perilous But Absolutely Not Pessimistic

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Central Headquarters of the Kuomintang held an enlarged memorial week for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 11th. In addition to Central Committee members and heads of various Yuan and ministries, KMT members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans were also invited to participate. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting and explained the current general situation of politics, economy, and military. A summary of his remarks is as follows:

Do Not Forget Our Position and Responsibility During the Extraordinary Revolutionary Period

Some people believe that the current national situation has reached an unprecedented level of danger. I also acknowledge that the current political, economic, and military situations are quite serious, but they are by no means as severe as some people imagine. Everyone must understand that the present is an extraordinary revolutionary period. We must observe all issues from a revolutionary standpoint and with a revolutionary historical perspective. As long as everyone does not forget their revolutionary position and responsibility and can maintain the traditional revolutionary spirit and confidence, we will never be pessimistic about the current situation. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen said: "Revolutionary power, spiritual ability, accounts for nine-tenths, while material ability accounts for only one-tenth." It is evident that the success or failure of the revolution depends entirely on our mental fortitude. As long as our minds are strong and our spirits are high, any danger can be overcome, and any difficulty can be broken. Since the "September 18th Incident," our nation has faced many hardships for seventeen years. It is natural that the public's mental state cannot be normal, and their nerves have become fragile. Party comrades have the responsibility to lead society and must demonstrate a spirit of great courage to stabilize the people's minds and the current situation.

The Press Should Not Report News That Stimulates Public Anxiety

The perceived danger of the current situation far exceeds the actual facts, and the rumors that are spread are often exaggerated and do not reflect the truth. During my recent inspection tour, I passed through Peiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shanghai. In Peiping and Tianjin, newspapers daily reported on the panic buying in Peking, Shanghai, and other places, how the people were panicked, and how social order was almost impossible to maintain. Later, upon returning to Shanghai, I learned that although there had been panic buying in Shanghai, the situation had returned to normal after only two days. However, the northern newspapers exaggerated the situation. Similarly, the Shanghai newspapers reported on how serious the panic buying was in Peiping and Tianjin. In fact, in Peiping, except for one incident of people scrambling to buy grain at Tianqiao, the other markets were very calm. This example shows that many things in society today are not actually serious; they are merely exaggerated, causing mutual anxiety. I hope that the press will pay special attention to this and not report news that stimulates public anxiety as a means of increasing circulation. Instead, they should assume the responsibility of leading public opinion under the premise of national and ethnic interests, and jointly seek social stability and progress.

Military Authorities Should Act Proactively and Not Be Constrained

In military affairs, for the past three months, the national army has been at a disadvantage almost everywhere. The reason for this is that the military authorities are too concerned. The most important thing in military affairs is to be proactive. As the ancients said, "The key to successful deployment lies in the mind." The military authorities must not be constrained or interfered with by any party, so that they can act as they wish and command freely. To remedy this deficiency, everyone must trust the commander-in-chief and grant them full command authority. Only then can they comprehensively plan for attack and defense, speed and delay, adapt to strategies, concentrate forces, and seize the initiative. Military affairs must not be constrained by politics, which would lead to passivity or failure.

As for the international situation, the current situation is indeed very tense, but we still have strong confidence in the United Nations. We must be self-reliant and strong, and respond to changes with constancy. Therefore, we feel even more the need to complete national unification.

The Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans Must Work Together as a Whole

In summary, I believe that the current situation is indeed dangerous, but I am absolutely not pessimistic. As long as responsible comrades in all departments understand the shared relationship of success and failure, life and death, and everyone unites in will and works together, the situation can be turned from danger to safety, and the military can turn defeat into victory. In particular, the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans must work together as a whole in the future, closely cooperating and coordinating under the overall national policy, so that the constitutional government can fulfill its function for the country and strengthen its ability to quell the rebellion and build the nation. The resolutions and opinions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans must be earnestly adopted by the Executive Yuan. The Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, for all motions proposed and decided, must also consider the actual possibilities for the nation and the actual difficulties of the Executive Yuan. Only through such mutual assistance and cooperation can we complement each other. I hope everyone will share the difficulties, concentrate our efforts, and take concerted steps to complete our common mission of quelling the rebellion and building the nation.

### On the Importance of Hygiene Exhibitions

— Pan Gongyi

Before we hope for a comfortable life, let us first ask ourselves if we have any healthy habits. Before we shout for national success, let us first ask ourselves if we have a healthy body. Because enjoying comfort relies on a healthy body, and building and prospering the nation relies even more on a healthy body. Without a healthy body, everything is in vain.

Strengthening the nation begins with strengthening the body. Citizens with first-class bodies can create a first-class nation. Now, if we want to join the ranks of the top five powers and demand international equality, our own bodies must first be equal to others, must first be strong. A comfortable life and national success rely on a high degree of culture: a golden age of culture must be preceded thirty years earlier by a golden age of health.

The cultural life of the entire Chinese nation is inherently highly variable. Why has the variability decreased since the Qin and Han dynasties? Why has it become even more uniform since the Five Dynasties, and why has creativity become increasingly narrow? Comparing Qin, Yu, Lu, and Jin a thousand years ago with today's Qin, Yu, Lu, and Jin, why is there such a vast difference in cultural creativity? How does Jiangxi from the Northern Song Dynasty to the early Ming Dynasty compare to today's Jiangxi? Why are Suzhou in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era and present-day Suzhou as different as two places? Aside from some common economic and political explanations, does it not at all raise the issue of the quality of talent?

Did our nation's ancestors who opened up the magnificent rivers and mountains not rely on strong bodies? Shennong and the Yellow Emperor personally tasted hundreds of herbs; they themselves were medical and hygiene experts. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, was himself a physician and absolutely advocated national conservation. In ancient times, our nation's emperors and sages were tall and long-lived. Tang was nine feet tall, King Wen was ten feet tall, and Confucius was nine feet six inches tall, each with a dignified and imposing appearance. The handsome men in the Book of Songs are Gongshuduan, and the beautiful women are Zhuang Jiang, both being large, strong, and beautiful. The Yellow Emperor himself lived to be 240 years old, and he said: "The upper lifespan of a person is 120, the middle lifespan is 100, and the lower lifespan is 80, otherwise all are premature deaths."

Ji Shuye in his Discourse on Nourishing Life, also said: "If guidance and nourishment are properly managed to fulfill one's nature and life, one can obtain over a thousand years at best, and several hundred years at worst, which is attainable." According to today's science, the lifespan of an organism is calculated by multiplying the years required for growth by seven. The age of growth is when our leg and arm bones meet, which is just 30 years old. Multiplying this by seven gives 210 years. However, our average lifespan is only 30 years, which is more than half that of civilized countries. Why is this? As Shuye said:

"The world does not observe, only sees grains, indulges in sights and sounds, eyes perceive black and yellow, ears seek lewd tunes, flavors sear their internal organs, sweet wines damage their stomach and intestines, fragrances rot their bones and marrow, joy and anger contradict their righteous qi, thoughts and worries consume their spirit, sorrow and happiness harm their plain essence. To drive such a frail body, those who alter it are wrong. Easy to exhaust is the body, and internally and externally it receives enemies. The body is not wood or stone, how can it enter? Those who indulge themselves to the extreme, do not regulate their diet, causing a hundred diseases; are not tired of lust, leading to exhaustion; are afflicted by wind and cold, and harmed by a hundred poisons, encountering these disasters."

In the Hong Fan chapter of the Book of Documents, what about the "Five Blessings": first, longevity; second, health and tranquility; third, wealth; fourth, love of virtue; and fifth, a good end. Which of these does not promote hygiene and health? Wealth and morality are products of health, and a good end means dying without illness, which is naturally an effect of hygiene. The Book of Documents is the highest theory of political philosophy in ancient times. Whether this book is true or false, these great principles have always been written in ancient times. Just take the Book of Rites, almost half of it discusses the way of hygiene, and it particularly emphasizes mental hygiene. Fetal care is discussed in great detail in the Baobao chapter of the Da Dai Li Ji. The I Ching pays close attention to children's nutrition. Confucius discussed the I Ching in the Zhouyi Xugua: "Things are born inevitably in ignorance, so they are followed by ignorance. Ignorance means young. Things that are young must be nourished, so they are followed by nourishment. Nourishment is the way of food and drink." Mencius taught us about safety education long ago: "A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall." Confucius taught us the way to ride in a carriage: "When boarding a carriage, be sure to stand upright and hold the reins. Do not look back in the carriage, do not speak quickly, and do not point with the fingers." Many superstitions and seasons in our customs have deep meanings of health education. For example, weighing people on the Beginning of Summer embodies the meaning of a health check; the "Thanking the Kitchen God" on the 24th of the twelfth month contains the meaning of cleaning: originally it was for epidemic prevention, and also for public health. Such examples are countless, all of which are sufficient to prove that hygiene is the foundation of the nation.

In the second twenty years of the nineteenth century, English and French manufacturers mixed two different types of glass together, resulting in the birth of the modern complex microscope. As a result, Pasteur discovered the phenomenon of fermentation, and then learned the cause of silkworm disease, finally proving that disease is transmitted by bacteria. Hygiene ushered in a great revolution. In 1876, the German doctor Koch announced the life history of Bacillus anthracis, and six years later discovered the transmission of tuberculosis.

In 1796, the English doctor Jenner invented vaccination. In 1873, the American doctor Trudeau defeated tuberculosis with a healthy lifestyle. Since then, hygiene and hygiene organizations have become important, and public health has made great progress. Disease and mortality rates have sharply reduced. Before the war, public health in various countries still focused on controlling diseases. Today, however, the style has greatly changed, with great effort being put into prevention work, while also paying attention to medical treatment. Among the prevention work, health education is the most effective undertaking. Our hygiene exhibition in Shanghai this time is an important part of public health education. It is hoped that this exhibition will be suitable for the national conditions, be able to concisely and systematically cultivate citizens' hygiene habits, instill hygiene appreciation, and create a hygiene concept, so that everyone recognizes that unhygienic is shameful, is barbaric; this is related to life, related to national destiny, and related to the happiness of all mankind. At the same time, it is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will receive this baptism of hygiene and spread it to the whole country.

### Minister of Finance Wang Returns to the Capital, Reports to the President and Premier Weng Today on His Trip to the United States, Will Formulate a Plan to Guide Floating Capital

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu returned to Nanjing at 8:40 PM on the 11th. He will meet with the President and Premier Weng on the 12th. At the station, Wang told reporters that his trip to the United States to attend two international financial conferences went very well. The greatest achievement of the meetings was the confirmation in principle of two important points: (1) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has focused on reconstruction work in the past, but will pay equal attention to development in the future. (2) In the past, more attention was paid to Europe, but the Far East and South America will be given equal attention in the future. All countries attending the conference unanimously agreed to the above two principles, and the technical details of implementation will be the responsibility of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will consist of 14 members, including five ex officio members appointed by representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and India, and nine other members already selected by the member states. Regarding the issue of China's payment of its share of the International Monetary Fund, Wang said that it has not yet been paid because the foreign exchange rate after China's currency reform has not yet been determined. According to regulations, the amount of shares China should pay should be one-tenth of the foreign exchange held by China when it joined the International Monetary Fund. At that time, China had more than US$500 million in foreign exchange, so China should pay more than US$50 million in shares. China's exchange rate will be proposed at an appropriate time, and whether to pay the shares first or propose the exchange rate first will be decided freely by China. Wang also said that when he met with the finance ministers of the United States and the United Kingdom during the conference, they all believed that China's currency reform was a timely move, and they all believed that the situation after China's currency reform was very good, and they believed that currency reform was the beginning of China's implementation of a self-help plan. When reporters asked him what new hopes he brought back this time and whether he had raised the issue of loans with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Wang said that he did not go for loans this time, and loans could only be requested after the Executive Committee was established and the shares were paid. When Wang arrived in Nanjing, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, Li Tang, and responsible persons at all levels went to the station to welcome him.

[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Wang Yun arrived in Shanghai from the United States at 10:15 PM on the 10th. According to his remarks: Regarding the issue of foreign aid, I believe that it can go hand in hand with self-help. At this stage, military aid to China is particularly important, so when I was in Washington, I publicly declared that China needs US$500 million in military aid each year. There are also many people in the United States who agree with this view. When reporters discussed the issue of currency issuance with Wang, the Minister of Finance said that his hasty return was mainly to deal with floating capital. Although the current issuance is close to one billion, two-thirds of it is in urgent need of circulation. In the future, a plan will be formulated for overall management. Regarding the Legislative Yuan,

### Unfortunate Incident on National Day; Three American Soldiers Beat Elementary School Students with Sticks

More Than Ten Elementary School Students Injured

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] An unfortunate incident occurred in the capital on National Day in which American soldiers beat elementary school students with sticks, injuring more than ten people. After mediation by all parties, the matter is expected to be resolved smoothly. On the morning of the 10th, the boy scouts of the Xinsheng Elementary School (on Linsen Road), which is run by the Catholic Church, were gathering to participate in the civil servants' sports meet when they were attacked by several American soldiers who seized their wooden sticks and beat them randomly, injuring more than ten students including Wang Baoxun, Liu Jiazheng, Sun Ziwen, and Hu Wei. Tu Jing, the son of Legislative Yuan member Xu Gongshui, was also among them. Subsequently, American military police arrived in a car and took the three American soldiers away. The American soldiers involved in the incident were related to the Sacred Heart Church of the Jesuit Society. Father Hao of the church, after being persuaded by the director of the East District Police Department, has apologized to Xu Zheren, the principal of Xinsheng Elementary School, and promised to compensate the injured students for their medical expenses. According to Principal Xu, Father Hao did come to the school and said, "If it is our fault, I apologize to you," but the matter of compensating for medical expenses has not yet been realized.

### The Ministry of Finance Gives Concrete Answers to Various Issues Raised in the Petition of the Money Industry; The Determined Minimum Capital Amount Will Not Be Changed

[Three newspapers, Nanjing, 11th] Zhu Yuan, Assistant Officer of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, upon the order of Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, met with Qin Runqing, Shen Rixin, Wang Yizhai, and other representatives of the National Money Industry Petition Group, who requested the government to relax the capital amount and deadline for increasing the capital of banks. (A) Regarding the increase in capital, it can be divided into four points: (1) The minimum capital amount will remain unchanged in accordance with the "Regulations on Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks." (2) The deadline for increasing capital will remain at two months, but will be calculated in accordance with the "Regulations on the Effective Date of Laws." (3) The provision that the cash portion of the increased capital must be deposited in the Central Bank for three months will remain unchanged. If various banks have legitimate uses in the future and request to use the funds, the applicable method for using them will be followed. For those whose cash increase exceeds 50%, the Ministry of Finance will approve the use of the excess on a case-by-case basis. The funds deposited in the Central Bank will be paid interest by analogy with the deposit reserve. For places where there is no Central Bank, the Ministry will negotiate with the Central Bank separately. (4) Regarding the asset appreciation portion, for assets purchased after the 27th year, the original calculation formula stipulated that the national wholesale price index for June of the 37th year should be used. Now, with reference to item C of the fourth clause of the Supplementary Measures for Financial Consolidation, it has been changed to calculate up to the first half of August of the 37th year, that is, when assets appreciate, it will be allowed to calculate according to the price index in the first half of August of the 37th year. The original request to allow shareholders to use assets other than cash to offset the payment of shares is not approved. (B) Regarding the exchange margin portion, the exchange margin will still be paid according to the regulations of the Central Bank, but during the capital adjustment period, it may be deducted from the amount of cash deposited in the Central Bank for the increase in capital. However, after the three-month period for the cash increase deposited in the Central Bank expires, the exchange margin portion will not be returned. (C) Regarding the interest rate portion, a temporary reply will be given. After receiving the reply from the Ministry of Finance, the representatives of the Money Industry Association proposed that the situation in the pacification area and the areas close to the bandit areas was special, and requested a flexible approach. Assistant Zhu promised to convey this.

[Another telegram] After receiving the reply from the Ministry of Finance, the representatives of the National Money Industry Association left Beijing in batches. Qin Runqing and Shen Rixin left for Shanghai by car on the afternoon of the 11th.

### Prices Fall in Peiping and Chengdu

[This newspaper, Peiping, 11th] Prices in Peiping have been falling yesterday and today, with gradually increasing supply and panic buying gradually becoming a thing of the past. Only a very small number of grain stores still have to sell a small amount of stock at the limit price daily, due to the competition for purchases by special elements, which has repeatedly created dangerous situations. With the understanding of the authorities, merchants can make a fortune again, but it is only the few public utilities and small civil servants such as the trolley company who are suffering, as they are not allowed to raise prices and cannot create a black market, while the latter have used up the whole month's expenses in ten days.

[This newspaper, Chengdu, 11th] Prices in Chengdu began to fall on the 11th due to the permission to release materials transported from Shanghai. Cloth and department stores fell, while grain prices remained stable. The Chengdu Youth Army specially organized a meeting to support the new economic policy, mobilizing the people to fight against unscrupulous merchants.

### Guangdong Province's Purchase of Hong Kong Exchange Case; The Guangzhou National Assembly Representatives Association Passes a Resolution; Sends a Telegram to the President Requesting a Thorough Investigation, Saying the Amount and Whether It Is Illegal Are in Doubt

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 11th] Since Chen Ce issued a statement regarding the purchase of Hong Kong exchange by Guangdong Province, saying that someone used his name to send a telegram, the Guangzhou National Assembly Representatives Association held a meeting to discuss it. Chen also attended the meeting. As a result, an amendment was passed on the spot to telegram the President, the original text of which is roughly as follows: According to reports, the province's bank actually withdrew 5 trillion yuan from the Central Bank on that day. Whether this purchase was only for 590,000 Hong Kong dollars, and whether other personnel took the opportunity to purchase for profit, and whether the purchase procedures were illegal, is indeed in doubt. Please send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth to dispel doubts.

### Song Ziwen's Remarks

Said That He Has Telegraphed the Central Government Again to Send an Investigation Team

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] Regarding the rumors that Chairman Song Ziwen of Guangdong Province used his position to purchase Hong Kong dollars for personal gain on the eve of the currency reform, this reporter specifically visited Song today and received the following statement: When I went to Beijing in early August, I obtained a loan of 5 trillion legal currency from the Central Bank for Guangdong Province, worth about 1.6 million gold yuan, which was specifically for purchasing rice for distribution needed by the province. On that day, I also obtained 20,000 tons from the 100,000 tons of Siamese rice purchased by the Ministry of Food to allocate to various provinces. However, Minister Guan specifically stated on that day that the Central Bank would not be able to provide foreign exchange for the purchase of the above Siamese rice, so the Guangdong Provincial Government should find its own foreign exchange funds. Moreover, the batch of Siamese rice should be purchased before the end of October. All of these matters were specifically instructed in a telegram from the Ministry of Food afterward. When I returned to Guangzhou from Beijing on August 16th, the Guangdong Provincial Bank had already started using part of the Central Bank's loan on behalf of the Guangdong Rice Procurement Committee to purchase foreign exchange to pay for the Siamese rice purchase. Until August 19th, when the Central Government suddenly announced the currency reform, the province's bank had only purchased a total of 592,335 Hong Kong dollars in foreign exchange in Hong Kong. The province's bank also stopped purchasing Hong Kong dollars from that day on. Afterward, rumors spread, saying that people in the provincial government had used the provincial bank to purchase Hong Kong dollars for personal gain. I immediately telegraphed the actual situation to Premier Weng and requested a thorough investigation. I then received a reply from Premier Weng saying: "It is not inappropriate to seek public benefit with public funds. The Executive Yuan fully understands the nature of this purchase of Hong Kong dollars, so it believes that a thorough investigation is not necessary." Previously, at the press conference on the first anniversary of my inauguration on the 2nd of this month, the General Manager of the Provincial Bank also reported the process of purchasing Hong Kong dollars orally and in writing. Although this matter has been explained and clarified above, there are still many rumors, making me embarrassed. Therefore, I have telegraphed the Central Government again, requesting them to send fair investigators to Guangdong to investigate. If it is found that any civil servant has used their position to seek personal gain, they should be severely punished. However, if it is found that the allegations are unfounded, those responsible for the accusations should also be severely punished as a warning.

### The Case of Communist Spy Zhu Mianxue and Others Is Remanded to the Special Criminal Court of the Capital for Retrial

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After communist students Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei from Central University, and Tao Yuancheng and Tang Shixian, members of the Nanjing City Work Department traffic group of the Communist Party, were sentenced to imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court of the capital, Zhu and others appealed to the Central Special Criminal Court on the grounds that the sentence was too heavy, and the original prosecutor appealed on the grounds that the sentence was too light (details in the second edition of this newspaper on the 5th).

The con man repeatedly claimed to be appointed by Vice President Zhang to conduct economic inspections at the Pingming Silver House outside Di'anmen and several large cloth shops. After talking with the various cloth shops once, he falsely claimed that the Economy Inspection Office would distribute dozens of bags of flour to the shops at the limit price, but the result was all bran. After inquiring with the authorities, it was learned that they had been deceived.

### Material Supply Bureau Responds to Criticism of Handling U.S. Surplus Materials: Western Newspaper Comments are Inconsistent with Facts

[Central News Agency, This City] In response to recent commentaries in Western newspapers regarding the government's handling of U.S. surplus materials, the Material Supply Bureau provides the following clarification based on facts:

"Recently, Western newspapers in Shanghai have repeatedly criticized our country's handling of U.S. surplus materials. These comments, arising from inaccurate reporting, are inconsistent with the facts.

Regarding the achievements of our government's surplus material handling organization, the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau has successively shipped approximately one million tons of equipment back to the country from Pacific islands, or has already sold it on the islands. All island operations are expected to be completed within a few months. Of the materials already shipped to Shanghai, 450,000 tons have been processed to date, approximately half of the total received. The handling of other items such as landing craft, small ships, communication equipment, and food has also reached the expected rate. The remaining few materials that have not yet been processed are being actively sorted, transported, and sold.

Considering the actual situation of the above-mentioned handling, we express regret that the above-mentioned Western newspapers have made hasty comments without investigating the truth and relying solely on inaccurate reports. Some comments state that our government has neglected the storage of surplus materials, allowing them to be exposed outdoors, corroded, and rusted, and that such losses could have been avoided if warehouses had been built. All of this is a disregard of the actual situation. All materials that should be stored in warehouses have been properly handled by us. Those stored in the open air are mostly large, bulky, and non-perishable machinery and equipment, or there are cases where the quantity of materials is enormous, the exchange time is short, and it is necessary to use open spaces. Even the U.S. agencies holding the materials, despite having perfect technical equipment and ample space on the islands to build huge warehouses, still piled up equipment in the open air. For this reason, the 'rusted and corroded' materials seen by foreign reporters had already been rusted long before they were transferred and sold to our country, because they had been left on the beaches of various islands for two years, buried in mud and eroded by wind and rain. Now it is said that these perfect materials became waste after being delivered to our country, which is absurd.

In most people's minds, surplus materials, even if new, should at least be in usable condition. In fact, the materials sold to us by the U.S. were far less impressive than imagined. When we signed the contract, we hoped to obtain usable or salable items, but after receiving them, we realized that we had only obtained mostly waste. In particular, the materials declared as surplus by the U.S. holding agencies in recent months are all poorly stored, exposed for a long time, or stolen and dismantled waste products. For example, the Shanghai office of the U.S. law firm hired by the Material Supply Bureau recently sent people to investigate Okinawa Island. Their report stated: 'Hundreds of motor vehicles have no engines or wheels, and important parts of cranes, tractors, and road graders have been dismantled.' These wastes are still declared as complete locomotives and construction equipment, and transferred to our side. From this, it can be seen that the damaged surplus materials are obviously not the responsibility of our government and handling agencies. They cannot understand the difficulty of our country in handling these materials and rashly criticize us for failing to fulfill our responsibility for storage, which is unfair."

### Berlin Blockade Lifted, Foreign Ministers' Conference Reconvened: Three Powers Insist on Basic Principles, Neutral Countries' Mediation Still Underway, Britain Releases White Paper Accusing Soviet Union of Actions in Berlin

[News Report] Paris, November 11 (Broadcast): A U.S. spokesperson stated that the United States has never considered abandoning the principle of simultaneously lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, he continued, the United States has not taken any position that would preclude such a resolution. This does not necessarily mean that the U.S. supports or intends to support the principle of simultaneous actions. The spokesperson stated, "The three powers are united in their views regarding the position and approach to the Berlin crisis. Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who is attempting to mediate the dispute between East and West on the Berlin issue, plans to meet with Vyshinsky again, hoping to obtain the Soviet Union's response to the compromise proposal."

[News Report] Paris, November 11 (Broadcast): British and American spokespersons stated that the notes from Britain and France to the Argentine Foreign Minister reiterate the basic principles of the Western powers' hope that the Security Council will resolve the Berlin stalemate. The notes clearly indicate that the Western powers are not prepared to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue, as the Kremlin wishes.

[United Press, Paris, November 11] A Western spokesperson stated on the 11th that the three Western countries have hardened their position on the Berlin crisis and insist that the Soviet Union must first lift the Berlin blockade before they are willing to negotiate with it on the German issue. Previously, it was reported that the West was prepared to accept a compromise plan, lifting the Berlin blockade on one hand and convening a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German peace treaty on the other. The West has announced its new developments while the United Nations is hesitating to act on the Berlin issue. Informed sources said that the Security Council has extended its meeting until the middle or end of this week to await a response from Soviet Representative Vyshinsky to the compromise proposal. The West's new actions appear to have nullified the compromise proposal put forward by U.S. Representative Jessup in the Security Council last Wednesday. Jessup concluded: "When the blockade is lifted, the United States will immediately attend a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss any issues related to Germany with the Soviet Union."

[News Report] London, November 11 (Broadcast): The British government released a 40,000-word White Paper on the 11th, reporting on the negotiations of the Berlin crisis and stating the British government's position. The statement accuses the Soviet Union of attempting to drive the Western powers out of Berlin, imprisoning thousands of Germans in concentration camps, and attempting to undermine Europe's economic recovery. The statement is largely the same as the one issued by the United Kingdom on September 27, but is more detailed. The main points are as follows: (1) The Soviet government has no intention of reaching an agreement except on its own terms. (2) The Soviet authorities in Berlin are condoning a small group's attempt to overthrow the legitimate Berlin city government. (3) The Soviet Union is attempting to force the Western occupying powers to abandon their rights in Berlin under pressure. (4) Accepting the Soviet Union's terms would be tantamount to immediately incorporating the Western occupation zones of Berlin into the Soviet economic system, stripping the Western occupying powers of their rights and obligations, and placing the entire city of Berlin under Soviet control.

### Marshall Flies Back to Paris, President Truman Accepts Secretary Marshall's Advice, Announces Cancellation of Plan to Send Special Envoy to the Soviet Union

[News Report] Washington, November 11 (Broadcast): Marshall flew back to Paris on the 11th to attend the United Nations General Assembly, hoping to mend the rift in Western unity caused by Truman's plan to send a special envoy to Moscow. Truman is scheduled to fly from the National Airport at 1:00 PM on the 11th.

[United Press, Paris, November 10] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup met with British Representative Cadogan and French Representative Parodi on the 10th. American representatives in Paris are still extremely concerned about Truman's consideration of sending Justice Vinson to the Soviet Union. They are eager for Marshall to return to Paris to assure Western European countries that the United States is no longer considering actions outside the scope of the Security Council. The general mood indicates that there will be a nervous attitude toward possible actions by the United States until after the U.S. election.

[United Press, Washington, November 10] President Truman revealed after an emergency meeting with Secretary of State Marshall on the 9th that he had abandoned his plan to send a peace envoy to Moscow. Truman stated that he proposed sending Justice Vinson to the Kremlin because "I still have a great desire to establish peace in the world, and I am particularly concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the atomic energy issue." He asked Marshall whether it would be useful to send Vinson on a peace mission "to make the Soviet leaders understand the seriousness and sincerity of the American people's feelings about this matter." Truman stated, "Secretary of State Marshall has described in detail to me the situation he faces in Paris. Due to his report and the possibility that any unilateral action, no matter how good, may be misunderstood at present, it has been decided not to take this step." Marshall later told a press conference, "If the Berlin blockade can be lifted first, we are very willing to hold a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the Berlin issue and the German issue." Marshall continued that he had discussed with the President the "danger of misunderstanding" among Western countries if the United States took any unilateral action to resolve the Berlin issue. This danger is currently most important because it could hinder the "strong cooperation" and "absolute unity" that Western countries currently maintain in Paris. Asked if the President fully supported his position, Marshall replied, "Full support." Marshall revealed that the plan to send Vinson to the Soviet Union had been abandoned during the transatlantic conversation between Truman and Marshall on the 5th. He further stated that he believed that the international control of atomic energy plan would not be established unless the Soviet Union had a desire for peace.

### Southern Country Representative Supports Soviet Foreign Policy

[United Press, Paris, November 11] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj, who was purged by the Cominform together with Marshal Tito, warned Western countries on the 11th that they should not try to defend the Southern country "from Soviet control." This is the first time that the Cominform infighting has been raised in the UN General Assembly. Kardelj firmly defended Soviet foreign policy, praising it as a policy of peace, and denouncing Western foreign policy as aggressive, aimed at dominating the world.

### Increase in Ground Strength Obtained Through U.S. Equipment

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, November 10] Recent large-scale exercises by the Turkish army have ended and were reviewed by President Inönü today, with the participation of the U.S. military delegation and foreign military committees. Observers here say that the exercises prove that the Turkish army has made great progress after obtaining equipment from the United States.

### Political Committee Debates Disarmament Issue, Our Representative Clarifies Stance: Any Plan Difficult to Accept Without Guaranteed Security

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11] At this morning's meeting of the UN General Assembly Political Committee, Chinese Representative Chiang Ting-fu expressed his views on the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, stating that the Chinese delegation does not believe that a plan that deviates from the spirit of the Charter can effectively enhance peace and security. He continued, "I would like to solemnly point out that any disarmament plan will not succeed unless an international army is established at the same time." He also stated that the work of the Committee on Conventional Armaments would have made more progress if the Soviet Union had not resolutely obstructed the work plan of the Committee at every stage of the discussion. Chiang Ting-fu then cited domestic events in China as an example, stating that before the end of this war, the Chinese government, despite the obvious threat from the Chinese Communists, tried to maintain domestic unity and implemented disarmament immediately after the end of the war. After the victory over Japan, the government immediately demobilized, intending to reduce wartime forces by one-fifth. Without the Communist rebellion, China would have been able to allocate a portion of its manpower and financial resources to rebuild its war-torn economy. Chiang concluded that China's armed forces are not related to aggression against any country and are used solely for domestic security. However, any disarmament plan is difficult to accept without proper consideration of domestic security conditions. The debate on disarmament will continue this afternoon.

### North Korea Requests UN General Assembly Permission to Attend Meetings

North Korean Police Shoot U.S. Soldiers

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, November 11] According to Pyongyang Radio: Pak Hon-yong, Chairman of the North Korean People's Assembly, has submitted a request to the Chairman of the UN General Assembly to send official representatives to attend and participate in the discussions at the UN General Assembly when the Korean issue is discussed.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, November 11] The U.S. military here announced that an incident occurred on the 9th in Kaesong, 45 miles from the 38th parallel boundary, in which four members of the North Korean police force shot at U.S. military personnel.

### British Commonwealth Conference Opens: Dominions to Express Views on Western European Union, Nehru Advocates Forming Southeast Asian Federation

[United Press, London, November 11] The British Commonwealth Conference, chaired by British Prime Minister Attlee, opened at 11:30 AM on the 11th at No. 10 Downing Street. The first item was to welcome the arrival of the Commonwealth politicians in London. Attlee said: Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King could not attend and expressed "deep regret." He emphasized that the participants are "equal" in status and especially welcomed the Prime Ministers of the three Asian countries "that have become independent countries within the Commonwealth since 1946" - Nehru of India, Ali Khan of Pakistan, and Senanayake of Ceylon. The conference will hold a closed-door meeting in the afternoon, where British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will explain the long-term impact of the European Recovery Program on the development of the Commonwealth in the eyes of the British government. Officials from the Commonwealth Relations Office said: Although the Dominions do not oppose the Marshall Plan and the Western European Union, their representatives have been instructed by their respective governments to request certain guarantees on economic and defense plans, so "there will undoubtedly be very frank remarks during the meeting", but military issues will not be discussed. British Defense Minister Alexander, Air Force Marshal Tedder, and War Minister Shinwell all attended to welcome the dignitaries from the Dominions. It is generally recognized that the attendance of former Chancellor Dalton at the conference is very important, as Dalton has always advocated organizing an African alliance in imitation of the Western European Union to block loopholes in the anti-Soviet Union front. It is reported that Cripps will explain that it is a mistake to think that Britain must choose one between Western Europe and the Commonwealth and abandon the other. The British government argues that the Commonwealth needs the Western European Union, because if Britain is isolated, it will become a burden on the Dominions. The organization of the Western European Union joint defense group itself is not a new plan, but part of the original plan for regional groups set by the United Nations. Each member of the Commonwealth must take a share of the responsibility. The British government has stated that there is currently a general plan for Commonwealth defense. At the same time, London officials said: It is a mistake to speculate that Nehru intends to announce that the Indian government is preparing to withdraw from the Commonwealth. Nehru will declare to the conference that India and Ceylon require the establishment of independent republics, and their mission is to study whether this constitutional difference can be applied to the Commonwealth. Nehru will also propose "organizing a Southeast Asian Federation" as a group in the world's economic and strategic integration. Personnel from the Commonwealth Relations Office said that the position of South Africa is also the same, as it is still unclear whether the new Prime Minister Malan intends to remain a Dominion and maintain Commonwealth relations.

### Promoting Productivity While Maintaining Price Limits - Important Speech by Spokesperson of the Supervisory Office - Mutual Adjustment and Supply of Materials within the Circulation Area - Manufacturers Should Supply Goods to the Market as Much as Possible - Distribution of Daily Necessities for Public Servants and Teachers Next Month

[Reported by this newspaper] A spokesperson for the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisory Office received reporters at 6:00 PM on the 10th and made the following statement:

(1) In order to implement comprehensive economic controls, the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisory Office has sent letters to all provinces and cities to abolish all local measures prohibiting the export of goods, so that materials in this area can circulate as much as possible and adjust to each other, so as to avoid the phenomenon of each acting on its own. Shanghai will give priority to supplying manufactured products to the provinces and cities under its jurisdiction, and the provinces and cities under its jurisdiction will also supply Shanghai with raw materials as much as possible. The quantity of daily necessities required by each province and city should be listed by the local trade associations and reported to the Supervisory Office for overall planning and reasonable allocation. The prices in various places should be based on Shanghai's "August 19th" price limit. If there are unreasonable prices, they can be adjusted appropriately according to local conditions. (2) The first phase of the general registration and inspection of essential goods in Shanghai has been completed. The measures for the export of goods have also been promulgated. All daily necessities needed in various places, such as yarn, cloth, sugar, soap, tobacco, and paper, can be ordered from the relevant trade associations in Shanghai, and transported out of the country after approval by the Economic Supervisory Office. However, in order to avoid raising prices, merchants, whether near or far, shall not freely compete to purchase in Shanghai. Except for materials legally allowed to be exported, no goods shall be smuggled. The inspection work at each transportation station has been strengthened to prevent leakage.

Assisting Factories in Purchasing Raw Materials

(3) The Supervisory Office attaches great importance to the production of each factory. The government has specific measures for the domestic and foreign raw materials needed by each factory, and will assist in purchasing them as much as possible, so as not to reduce factory production, and guarantee its legal profits. This measure will be planned and implemented within this week. (4) The manufacturers of daily necessities registered in this general registration should supply the market as much as possible. If it is found that there are goods in short supply on the market that are hoarded and not sold, they should be punished as hoarding. The name and quantity of products manufactured by each factory should be registered with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and wholesale them as much as possible, and must not be hidden, otherwise they will also be punished as hoarding.

Strictly Investigate and Punish Black Market Transactions

(5) The work of price control in Shanghai had initially achieved success, but since last week, there have been villains stirring up trouble, spreading rumors to undermine the credit of the gold yuan, and even some people have used large amounts of funds to purchase materials, disrupting people's minds and causing instability in the market. The Supervisory Office firmly stated that this phenomenon will never be allowed to exist, and the "August 19th" price limit policy will continue to be strictly enforced, and special efforts will be made to eliminate the black market. In the future, anyone found to be engaged in black market transactions of gold, silver, and foreign currency shall be immediately sent to the local Special Criminal Court, and shall be severely punished in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Gold and Foreign Currency Transactions, in addition to confiscating the gold, silver, and foreign currency. The informant will receive 40% of the total amount as a reward after the case is solved. Anyone engaged in black market transactions of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rice, flour, sugar, oil, and other daily necessities and other industrial raw materials, in addition to confiscating all their goods, shall be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. If the circumstances are serious and it is found that there is suspicion of disrupting finance, they will also be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for strict handling. The informant of the above-mentioned black market for daily necessities and industrial raw materials will receive 40% of the total value of the goods as a reward after the case is solved.

A Small Amount of Wool Yarn Will Be Rationed Appropriately

(6) Goods such as wool, cloth, cotton yarn, and edible oil should be purchased according to the quantity stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, with an identity card or household registration card, and must not be destroyed. No store shall raise prices under any pretext. From November 1st, workers, students, and public servants and teachers will be rationed daily necessities in accordance with the "August 19th" price limit. The price of wool yarn will not be adjusted for the time being, but it has been found that the stock of wool yarn in the city is not abundant, and it has been decided to distribute it to schools and cooperative societies of various agencies first, and priority should be given to elementary school students. Detailed measures are being drafted. (7) The amount of cotton yarn allocated to the cotton yarn re-weaving industry has been increased to 30,000 pieces this month to maintain production. (8) The source of wheat for each flour mill in this city is scarce, and the Central Farmers Bank is now assisting each factory to purchase in large quantities. If the supply of flour required in this city is insufficient, it will be supplied by the Central Trust Bureau.

Confiscated Materials Begin to Be Sold

(9) Since the start of the inspection work, all confiscated materials will be sold in succession starting this week. Most of the proceeds from the sale will be allocated to the local government for the purpose of relieving refugees and rewarding poor students. (10) Recently, there have been villains spreading rumors on the market to undermine the credit of the gold yuan. In addition to strictly ordering the military police to investigate at any time, it is hoped that all citizens will not be deceived by them, and will unanimously assist the government so that social life can be stabilized.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously stipulated that citizens must purchase edible oil with a household registration card, limited to one catty per person per month, in order to prevent edible oil from being purchased for hoarding and smuggling.

### Special Tribunal Indicts 182 Defendants for Endangering National Security; Allegedly Conspired with Bandit Leader Ding Xishan's Forces to Disrupt Order

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Tribunal yesterday indicted 182 defendants in a national security case, marking a new record for the number of defendants in a single case before the court. The defendants, including Wang Zhongyi and others, are all related to the bandit leader Ding Xishan, who has already been killed. The composition of the 182 individuals is extremely complex, with the majority being workers from companies and factories such as the British and French Power Companies, the Shanghai Telephone Company, China Textiles, China Silk, Eizhong Tobacco Company, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, Mayar Silk Factory, Pathé Company, Tiangong Chemical Factory, and Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory. In addition, there are Wang Zhongyi, the owner of Gongji Xincheng Tobacco Paper Shop, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhu Pinliang, Fang Shenghong, the director of the record department at Pathé Company, Zhou Hongyuan, the chairman of the Zhanghua Factory Trade Union, and Tao Yunshan, the chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union. Among them, 31 are women.

According to the indictment, "The defendant Wang Zhongyi participated in a Communist bandit organization, went into hiding in Shanghai, and attempted to collaborate with the bandit forces to disrupt order, with the aim of undermining the national system and overthrowing the government. After Ding Xishan led his troops to raid Jiangnan in March of this year and was surrounded and killed, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department persuaded Hong Guankang, a key figure who escaped the encirclement, to surrender and allowed him to atone for his crimes.

Roundup in One Sweep

Through Hong's investigation, it was discovered that the defendant Wang Zhongyi was the person who introduced the bandit leader Ding to the Communist underground in Shanghai. His address was initially unknown, but then they encountered the defendant Wei Zhongmou, who was also a cadre of Ding's forces and had a kinship with Wang. Wei was deceived into believing that after Ding's death, the connection had been severed, and Wei was asked to seek contact with Wang. The bureau then devised a plan to have Wei lead undercover officers to Wang's Gongji Xincheng Tobacco Paper Shop, where they found a list of Communist bandits on the upper floor. Personnel were dispatched to track them down, and Zhou Yunlong and 130 other defendants were arrested. The other 54 defendants, including Tao Yunshan, fled out of fear of punishment after the case was exposed and later surrendered themselves. The bureau transferred them to the court for interrogation. Except for Xu Rongren, who died, and Zhuang Jianan, whose crimes were deemed insufficient for prosecution, the Special Criminal Tribunal, after investigation, determined that the evidence against the 182 defendants was conclusive. Wang Zhongyi was charged with violating Article 2, Section 3 of the Emergency Decree for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Security During the Suppression of Rebellion, and the remaining 181 defendants, including Zhou Yunlong, were charged with violating Article 3 of the same decree. Public prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 8, Section 1 of the same decree, Article 2 of the Special Criminal Tribunal Trial Regulations, and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

### Gao Keng Mine Situation

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 6th by Air] Coal mines in Pingxiang have a history of more than 40 years, but a "gulf" exists between the coal mines and the people of Pingxiang, which has not yet been eliminated. There are still many unnecessary difficulties imposed on the mining company. For example, recently, when a 1,000-kilowatt generator belonging to the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau was being moved from outside the city gate to the train station, it had to cross a small bridge. The local head of the baojia demanded an exorbitant bridge toll of 6 billion from the mining company, threatening to prohibit passage otherwise. The mining company offered to rebuild the bridge if it was damaged, but the offer was rejected. The issue has remained unresolved for months. The mining company had no choice but to take a detour, spending an extra half-month and a large amount of transportation fees, and it still hasn't reached the train station. This is one example of how it affects coal mine construction. The coal smoke emitted by the Wang Jiayuan Coking Plant flies everywhere. The owners of the mountain and wilderness grasslands have even demanded that the mining company purchase these useless lands because the coal smoke has fallen on them and made them unsuitable for "cultivation." When the Quanjiangyan Power Plant planted electric poles to supply electricity to the Gao Keng mine, they dug holes less than one meter wide, and the landowners demanded several dou of grain for each pole's usage.

There are countless similar demands. The mining company tries every possible means to maintain good relations with both parties in order to promote its own business. However, the people of Pingxiang believe that the mining company's employees are treated generously, which has stimulated the lives of the local people.

Miner's Illnesses: There are 4,000 people engaged in mining in Anyuan and Gao Keng (excluding private local mines). A serious problem currently is the medical equipment and the health of the miners. The mining company has established a clinic in Gao Keng, which is headed by Dr. Liu Zhantai. The internal facilities are rudimentary due to limited funding and housing. It is really difficult for them to cope with the medical needs of these employees day and night. On average, there are 400 outpatient visits every day. They also have to cope with home visits within 40 li of the mining area and free consultations for the local people. Sometimes, Dr. Liu has to return from visiting miners' homes late at night. One day, a family member of an employee of the Quanjiangyan Power Plant had a miscarriage. Because there was no midwife available, and Dr. Liu was a man, he could not enter the house. He had to stand outside the window and instruct his wife to perform the operation through the curtain. The baby was born, but it had stopped breathing. Fortunately, it was resuscitated with artificial respiration. Now it is a chubby little baby.

The common illnesses in the mining area are dysentery and malaria, mainly caused by drinking water, mosquitoes, and eating coarse rice. According to the clinic's diagnosis statistics, dysentery and malaria account for 80% of the patients, and some have died from malaria. Recently, there was also an incident of coal poisoning among the miners. Fortunately, it was diagnosed and treated in time, and no tragedy occurred.

Improving Diet: The miners' lives are laborious, and they can only afford a rough meal for a single person with their earnings. Now, most of the underground workers in Gao Keng and Anyuan are from Hunan. The natives of Pingxiang only work as a sideline during the agricultural off-season.

They are now eating coarse rice, which is harmful to their stomachs and causes dysentery and malaria. Therefore, Dr. Liu of the clinic emphasizes improving the miners' diet. He would rather spend a few more coins on the miners' welfare to avoid incurring considerable medical expenses. As long as the welfare undertakings can be strengthened, so that these workers who are buried underground all day long can get proper entertainment and their spirits can be properly entrusted, it can also reduce the bad habit of "gambling and eating everything."

The average miner has no proper organization or entertainment outside of their work in the coal mine. Therefore, after the monthly salary is paid, they gamble and eat as much as possible. As long as they have enough money left for a pack of cigarettes, they will spend it all before going down to the mine to work. Currently, the average income of an ordinary miner is about 20 yuan in gold coins, which is only enough to maintain a single person's life. What's more, there are so-called "contractors" and "cooperative contractors" above these coolies, who not only have to get a share of the wages from the miners, but also receive a salary from the mining bureau.

The mining area is in a wilderness of deep mountains and forests. There are only a few brick office buildings, Western-style houses, and the chimneys of the power plant constantly spewing out wisps of smoke, still maintaining the original form of the Chinese countryside. As for the construction of culture and education, it still needs to be redoubled.

Gao Gong Moves to Pingxiang: Currently, Gao Keng has a "Gao Gong" school, funded by the Ministry of Education and managed by the Department of Education, with mining and mechanical engineering departments. It was established in Gao Keng to train mining and metallurgical talents. However, the rudimentary housing has prevented this highest institution of learning in the mining area, which has only one year of history, from developing. This semester, it has been agreed with the Pingxiang County Council to move the school to Pingxiang, temporarily using the County Council as the school site to continue recruiting two new classes of students.

Miner's Children: The coal mine workers' children's school is also located in Gao Keng, and currently has more than 300 students. The children of the mining company's employees only account for one-third of the students, and the majority are students who have dropped out of school nearby. They only charge a small fee for the books they bring themselves, and everything else is provided by the mining company. There were originally two bao schools in the area, but they have been closed and all the students have been taken over by the employees' children's school.

Currently, the biggest trouble for every employee of the mining bureau is that, in their spare time, in addition to the above-mentioned lack of proper entertainment, it is not easy to see even a good newspaper. The fastest it takes to see a Changsha newspaper here is four days, and a Shanghai newspaper takes a week to arrive. Before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was open to Zhuzhou, it was even slower. The fastest it would take would be ten days. Magazines and other publications have to be bought in Pingxiang. Sometimes, even a toothpick or a bar of soap is not easy to buy in Gao Keng.

Pingxiang Culture: However, the reporter must point out that Pingxiang is a county with a higher level of culture in Jiangxi. It now has two provincial secondary schools and seven county and private middle schools. The scale of the county elementary school is not easy to see in other counties in Jiangxi, with more than 1,000 students. The educational expenses are entirely based on public grain. Currently, a teacher in the county middle school and the Ao Middle School receives 200 shi of white rice per year. If converted at the current price, it can be compared to a specially appointed official. However, among these teachers, there are some who have served as department heads or professors in universities. Because they are mostly from Pingxiang, they are required to serve their hometown as usual, and can also engage in personal further studies and writing in their spare time from teaching.

The development of national education has not only met the standard of one school per bao, but even one bao has as many as four or five national schools, and the national education fund is entirely derived from public assets. They do not need to hold field tax additional school grain to maintain it. The quality of teachers is mostly from high school or normal school graduates. There is no lack of national education teachers in Pingxiang. On the contrary, the future of many middle school graduates has become a problem. Now, they mostly find a way out in township work. Many bao chiefs are appointed by middle school students. Therefore, if it is said that the three countries have the possibility of changing their pro-Greek policies, then the possibility of the southern country is greater and more peaceful. This is credible and without any objections. (End of full text)

### Tragic Incident in Fengtai; Mole Crickets Ground into Flour; Four Die from Poisoning; Fourteen Others Hospitalized and Still in Danger

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] A shocking poisoning tragedy occurred in Fengtai Town, southeast of Beiping. Zhang Zhan'ao, a 66-year-old resident of Machang Village, had a family of ten, including his wife, sons, daughters-in-law, relatives, and hired laborers. Due to the harvesting of peanuts and corn, they hired eight new laborers, making them very busy every day. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang were in charge of cooking at home. On the 7th, while making pancakes at noon, they mistakenly used mole cricket powder, an insecticide, as white flour and kneaded it into the pancakes. After the sixteen people finished their work and had lunch, Zhang's youngest grandson began to show signs of poisoning, vomiting and diarrhea. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Zhang and the relatives and hired laborers working in the fields returned one after another, and there was chaos with shouts, vomiting, and diarrhea. At this time, Mr. Zhang realized that they had been poisoned and shouted for help, alarming many neighbors. The Zhang family was sent to the railway hospital for treatment, but it was too late. Four people who had been severely poisoned died, and the remaining fourteen are still in danger.

### International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent in Europe for This Newspaper

Recent Developments in Yugoslavia

[Continued from page 5 of this newspaper on the 9th] When the United Nations investigated the Greek border conflict last year, it concluded that Yugoslavia provided the most aid to the Greek rebels among the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. The Balkan Committee's inspection in March also confirmed that the so-called "Greek Democratic Provisional Government" led by Markos had its radio station located within Yugoslavia. Therefore, in the international handling of the Greek issue, Yugoslavia's attitude is of utmost concern. Moreover, Yugoslavia's geographical location between Albania and Bulgaria makes its position crucial, as even a slight move can affect the entire situation. However, since the friction between Yugoslav leader Tito and the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau) in June of this year, there has been a sense of impending crisis and complete transformation. Recent reports indicate that Yugoslavia's aid to the Greek rebels has decreased compared to the past, and the so-called "Greek Democratic Provisional Government" radio station seems to have been moved out of Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, on the surface, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Greece has not improved, and its non-cooperation with the Balkan Committee remains unchanged. However, it is generally believed that Yugoslavia's democracy has declined and its economy is extremely fragile after the war, especially in terms of coking coal and gasoline, which require 300,000 tons annually and must be supplied by Albania and Romania. Now that these two countries have refused to supply them, Yugoslavia must find alternative economic solutions unless it reconciles with Moscow. However, the past rift is deep, and it is doubtful whether they can restore their old friendship. Furthermore, the discord between Yugoslavia and Greece originally stemmed from the issue of the Macedonian region. Yugoslavia hopes to turn the Macedonian region into a puppet autonomous regime in order to annex it into the Yugoslav Federation at an opportune moment, while the Greek rebel leader Markos hopes to establish a communist regime based in Macedonia. Bulgaria, due to geographical, historical, and ethnic ties, has always been interested in Macedonia, and its desire to intervene has been growing. Therefore, although the three parties share a common attitude of hostility towards the Greek government, their dreams differ, and hidden problems are deep-seated. Although Tito's break with Moscow stemmed from placing national ideology above international communism, it was also due to the inability to coordinate his country's interests with those of his allies, which is particularly evident in the case of Greece. Recently, there have been widespread reports that the situation on the northern border between Yugoslavia and Greece has improved, with soldiers on both sides talking to each other in a very friendly manner. However, given the deep-seated animosity between Yugoslavia and Greece, and the current unstable situation in Yugoslavia, it seems premature to say that Yugoslavia can immediately lay down its weapons and become a saint. Nevertheless, considering that Yugoslavia is a member of the United Nations and maintains diplomatic relations with Greece, the level of its assistance to the Greek rebels is still lower than that of other nations.

### General Commodity Prices - A Frenzied Buying Spree Sweeps Across Shanghai

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Finance and Economy, the Shanghai market, which had been stable for more than a month, has seen a frenzied buying spree in the past week, with people rushing to buy goods, breaking the long-standing calm. Government-sold goods and goods from some large stores were opened early in the morning, and large numbers of customers were waiting outside, rushing in and buying up the goods within two to three hours. Among these customers, there were of course peddlers, but there were also those who were buying for their own consumption. This phenomenon is a great irony to the credibility of the Gold Yuan. We should not only scold those who are snapping up goods, but also analyze the reasons for the buying spree in order to eliminate it at its root.

First, the most fundamental reason for the buying spree is of course the excessive and loose amount of speculative capital, which has never found a proper outlet. According to the second announcement of the Supervisory Committee for the Preparation and Issuance of Gold Yuan, as of September 30th, a total of 956,752,494.40 Gold Yuan had been issued. According to the National Bank, out of the issuance of over 900 million Gold Yuan, the expenditure for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies amounted to approximately US$150 million, equivalent to 600 million Gold Yuan; the exchange of Legal Tender and Northeast Coupons amounted to approximately 50 million Gold Yuan; and the net income from import and export settlements and remittances from overseas Chinese amounted to approximately US$20 million, equivalent to 80 million Gold Yuan. The remaining 220 million Gold Yuan was used for treasury and other business expenditures after the currency reform. Although the authorities have intentionally pointed out that financial expenditures accounted for a smaller portion of this huge issuance, the harm caused by speculative capital in the market is indiscriminate regardless of its source.

Second, in order to increase tax revenue and balance the budget, the government has announced supplementary measures for reorganizing finances, stipulating that the collection of commodity tax, domestic tobacco and alcohol tax, and mineral tax may be adjusted. The Economic Control Commission of the Executive Yuan decided to first implement changes in the collection of taxes on cigarettes, flue-cured tobacco, tinfoil, imported beer, domestic alcohol, imported tobacco leaves, and domestic tobacco shreds on October 1st. The increase in these taxes was allowed to be added to the price of goods by merchants. Since the 3rd of the month, Shanghai has adjusted prices based on the central government's increase in cigarette and tobacco leaf tax rates, with cigarette prices increasing by 100% to 111%, and alcohol prices also being adjusted accordingly. Having suffered from high prices for many years, the people's psychology is extremely fragile. Therefore, they believe that since tobacco and alcohol taxes can be adjusted, other tax rates and even the prices of state-owned enterprises may also be adjusted, leading to a buying spree. Third, since the implementation of price controls, Shanghai's control has been strict, adhering to the 819 price limits, while the control in other areas has been lax, exceeding the 819 price limits. Goods in Shanghai have long been seeking to escape to other areas, but due to control regulations, they cannot be moved in large quantities. Under these circumstances, scalpers have emerged, accumulating small amounts into large quantities, which has also had a significant impact on the formation of the buying spree.

Fourth, according to general judgment, since the implementation of price controls, prices in Shanghai have been at a relatively low level in terms of Gold Yuan, causing raw materials and local products from other areas to be hesitant to come in. Within Shanghai, raw material prices are higher than finished product prices, and factory prices are higher than retail prices, leading to a shrinking of production and a shortage of supply. This is one of the reasons for the current buying spree and is a barrier that must be overcome for the implementation of the new economic plan in the future. In terms of the commodity market last week, due to the buying spree and the scarcity of supply, many goods were suspended. The cotton yarn and cloth market had already decided at the end of the previous week to suspend trading and discuss cotton yarn and cloth allocation methods as follows:

(1) In order to prevent the rise in cotton yarn and cloth prices, the authorities ordered the cotton yarn and cloth markets to suspend trading from today and strictly cracked down on intermediaries.

(2) Every citizen of Shanghai will be allowed to purchase 1.5 zhang (unit of length) of cotton cloth from October onwards, with the purchase date stamped on their national identity card for identification. They will not be allowed to purchase again within three months.

As a result, the cotton yarn and cloth market was completely shut down and without trade from the beginning of last week. In terms of the grain market, rice arrivals were scarce, and the northern market was suspended for several days, while the southern market was in a semi-suspended state. On Tuesday, only 441.5 shi of rice arrived in the southern market, 43 shi on Wednesday, and 453.5 shi on Thursday. On Friday, both the northern and southern markets had slightly more arrivals, but transactions could still be done. The flour market remained completely suspended, and edible oil was also ordered to be suspended. Although miscellaneous grains were not completely suspended, very little trading took place. In terms of daily necessities, cigarette prices have been approved to increase, while soap and matches only had sporadic transactions. Under price controls, very few large-scale transactions were made. Following cigarettes, there are discussions to increase the price of woolen yarn and kerosene by 50%, but the management office has not yet approved it, and the market is in a stalemate.

In the face of last week's frenzied buying spree, the most pressing measure for the authorities is of course to start with restricting purchases. However, the implementation of a comprehensive fixed allocation system, although advocated for a long time, cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, they have no choice but to retreat and deal with it piecemeal, including:

(1) Implementing the purchase of cloth, wool, and woolen yarn with identity cards. Each person is limited to purchasing 1.5 zhang of cloth every three months, one set of woolen clothing material per year, and 1.5 pounds of coarse woolen yarn or 1 pound of fine woolen yarn per year. After the purchase, the store will stamp the national identity card, and no further purchase is allowed within the specified period. The Social Bureau has already notified relevant guilds that this method of limiting purchases with identity cards will be extended to silk, shirts, socks, soap, and other daily necessities in the future.

(2) In order to limit consumption, it is stipulated that a "no meat on Friday" campaign will be enforced.

(3) The Paper Industry Association has obtained approval from the Social Bureau to restrict paper purchases. Those who already have paper allocation quotas, such as bookstores and printing industries, are not allowed to purchase paper from paper stores. Paper will not be supplied to other areas for the time being, and individual paper purchases are limited to 5 reams.

The wholesale price index classified by usage last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index classified by processing degree last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index classified by country of production and sales last week is as follows:

After the Shanghai Economic Supervisory Office expanded its jurisdiction area under the order of the Executive Yuan, it held an economic control meeting in Beijing on the 7th and passed: (1) Measures to strengthen economic control and liaison in this area, (2) Measures to regulate the supply of important materials in this area, (3) Measures to strengthen economic management in this area. Among them, the main point of regulating the supply of materials is to universally implement a fixed quantity allocation system for daily necessities in all provinces and cities, strictly inspect and register the quantity of materials, and lower the prices in production areas to the 819 standard. For market prices that are too high, reasonable adjustments can be made with the approval of local governments based on costs and legitimate profits. At the same time, the government and merchants will cooperate to purchase from production areas to replenish the source of materials. It is also reported that the central authorities are discussing the implementation of a comprehensive allocation method, which will imitate the British wartime allocation system, universally inspect and register materials in consumer markets and production areas, and then allocate them at fixed quantities and prices based on the actual number of people and consumption volume.

### Currency and Finance - Goods Are Being Rushed to Purchase, but Credit Remains Loose - Capital Supply Is Abundant, and Underground Interest Rates Continue to Fall

Last week, the loose credit situation in the city not only did not ease but even intensified. After the price of tobacco and alcohol doubled, there was a widespread phenomenon of rushing to purchase goods in the market. At the beginning of the week, the demand for bills of exchange increased for a time, and depositors in the industry's firms also withdrew their deposits to purchase goods. However, on the one hand, the deposits of consumers in the firms decreased sharply, while on the other hand, the deposits of stores increased significantly. For example, after the settlement of accounts of firms after No. 60 Taishifu, although there was a shortfall of 450,000 yuan on Monday, there was a surplus of 1 million yuan on Tuesday, which shows that the capital supply within the industry is generally abundant. After Wednesday, transactions in various industries were sparse, and the demand for bills of exchange declined again. As a result, the supply of capital in the market far exceeded the demand, and speculative capital had no way out and had to flood the market.

It is estimated that the speculative capital gathered in Taishifu has exceeded 600 million yuan. Therefore, the authorities also panicked and ordered national banks to stop announcing exchange surpluses from Tuesday in order to suppress the floating public sentiment. At the same time, it is reported that the publication of underground interest rates in the market will also be banned; however, on the one hand, the announcement of exchange surpluses is stopped, and on the other hand, it is reported that national banks still maintain an average daily deficit of several million yuan, which is also one of the main reasons why credit remains so loose.

As a result of the rush to purchase or escape goods, the inventory of many stores has become scattered, but as far as the entire market is concerned, since the price benchmarks have not been raised, speculative capital has only been transferred from the hands of some people to the hands of others. Therefore, rushing to purchase goods not only does not reduce speculative capital, but also increases the threat of loose credit due to the further approach of goods to the consumption field. As for the sales of short-term treasury bonds and shares of state-owned enterprises, which can tighten credit temporarily, the sales volume in a week was only about 10 million yuan, so it will naturally not have any effect on tightening credit. It is reported that this situation is a manifestation of the inability of speculative capital to contract and the inability of the government to control it. Indeed, an extremely severe test has been placed in front of the new currency system.

The underground interest rate last week, although it once rose to between 6% and 9% per month due to the increased demand for capital at the beginning of the week (it was between 4.5% and 5.4% at the end of the previous week), it then fell back to around 5% from Wednesday. As for the interest rates posted by the silver and money industry, they fell again on Tuesday, with deposit interest rates falling from 1.5% to 1.35%, overdraft interest rates falling from 4.8% to 3.9%, and interbank lending rates falling from 3% to 2.4%. The discount rate for cash was around 2-3 yuan per yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6-9%. According to reports, the results of the exchange of national banks were 4.28 million yuan on Monday, and 4-5 million yuan on Tuesday, falling to about 1 million on Wednesday, and still maintaining a deficit of several million yuan on Thursday.

The results of the exchange of foreign banks showed a surplus of 1.17 million yuan on Monday, about 800,000 yuan on Tuesday, and still a surplus on Wednesday and Thursday. The capital of commercial firms remained consistently loose. The settlement of accounts of firms after No. 60 Taishifu showed a surplus from Wednesday to Thursday, except for a deficit of over 1 million yuan on Monday, which shows that the capital supply is abundant.

Last week, the domestic remittance rates of commercial firms were relatively stable. The remittance rate to Guangzhou was 24 yuan, to Xiamen 2 yuan, to Chongqing and Kunming 12 yuan, to Hankou 10 yuan, and to Beijing and Tianjin 5 yuan. There was no change in the official exchange rate. Due to the lack of sources of ornamental gold, the gold shops in the city have voluntarily stopped buying and selling gold jewelry.

The market price in Hong Kong was HK$309.5 per tael of gold at the end of the previous week. It rose to HK$316.5 on Monday of last week and then rose to HK$319 on Wednesday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was HK$5.21 at the end of the previous week, rising to HK$5.25 on Monday of last week and then rising to HK$5.33 on Wednesday.

### Industrial and Commercial Trends - Industry and Commerce Under Price Controls

The Economic Control Commission of the Executive Yuan recently approved the tax rates for seven types of goods, including cigarettes, flue-cured tobacco, imported beer, tinfoil, domestic alcohol, tobacco shreds, and tobacco leaves, in various parts of the country, which will be increased by an average of 70% to 100% from October 2nd. According to Supervisor Jiang, this will increase the government's revenue by 34 million Gold Yuan per month, which shows that the adjustment of tax rates is imperative for the government. The recent surge in the purchase of goods in the city, and the adjustment of tobacco and alcohol prices, should be one of the immediate causes. From this, it is not difficult to see that although the government's income has increased, the industrial and commercial sectors have once again been hit by turbulent waves. In addition to this, in order to increase the government's income, the Ministry of Finance has also increased the import tax on cotton and the export tax on cotton cloth. The Textile Export Committee believes that this will strike a blow to the textile industry and has requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance to reduce or exempt the taxes; it is obvious that reducing tax rates will affect the government's income, so the success of the tax reduction application is also difficult to be optimistic about.

In order to increase its income, the government's state-owned enterprises were also brewing price increases last week; as a certain legislator said, if state-owned enterprises do not raise prices, the government will not be able to survive, obviously, state-owned enterprises have no choice but to raise prices.

In addition to this, the public utilities in Taishifu have also encountered difficulties. According to reports, since the prices of public utilities were frozen, various companies have experienced great difficulties due to the increased cost of gasoline allocation. Furthermore, as far as the coal needed for public utilities is concerned, although the coal allocated for October has been allocated from the Shanghai supply, the future source of coal is said to be that the coal from Qinhuangdao can no longer be transported. Although there are 500,000 tons of coal in stock at the Kailuan Coal Mine, only 20,000 tons can be transported this month due to traffic obstacles. Other coals, such as those from Huainan and Tanggu New Port, are also transported in small quantities, and the amount of coal stored here is less than 40,000 to 50,000 tons. For this reason, the public utilities have sent a telegram to the central government requesting the restoration of subsidies, but it is feared that there will also be problems with whether the subsidies can be approved. If this is the case, then public utilities will also be forced to adjust prices following state-owned enterprises.

To ensure that the price control policy is consistently unchanged, a sufficient supply of raw materials is naturally one of the main conditions. The Economic Supervisory Office has also made its best efforts in this regard, such as restricting the export of materials, conducting general warehouse inspections, and textual propaganda, etc.; but the authorities' control over materials is also very urgent. For example, the Chinese Farmers Bank has acted as an agent for the Ministry of Food to purchase flour for six times, purchasing a total of 3.62 million bags. Also, the China Trust Bureau has joined forces with oil mills to start purchasing rapeseed. According to a report from the Central News Agency, the Bureau has sent personnel to production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and expects to collect 65,000 dan (unit of weight) of rapeseed within a month. Whether the industrial and commercial sectors can be allocated a portion of the materials purchased by these many authorities is, of course, a problem, and as for other raw materials needed for production, it is said that currently, apart from the fuel part, where the Diesel and Gasoline Allocation Committee of the Transportation Management Commission has decided to supply all the needs of the industrial sector, procurement is very difficult. Not to mention other things, such as the raw materials for the wool textile industry, according to the current Economic and Social News, the raw materials stored by the 77 member companies of the wool textile industry in the city are only enough for more than a month. Furthermore, as for the production of vegetable oil, according to the authorities of the Central Vegetable Oil Factory, although the output in September was similar to that in August due to the sufficient inventory of raw materials, there will be problems with the output in October due to the lack of raw materials.

Although the far cause of this large wave of purchasing materials is of course the continuous outflow of Gold Yuan, the immediate causes are the increase in tax rates on some goods and the scarcity of supply of production raw materials; the future of the industrial and commercial sectors is obviously full of difficulties, because even if the inventory of industrial raw materials is indeed as the spokesperson of the Economic Management Office said, sufficient for several months of use, if there is no appropriate limit to the issuance of Gold Yuan and the adjustment of tax rates, then the so-called "psychological factors" of purchasing materials may still be a difficult to cure chronic disease.

### Fuxing Cup Mini-Football Tournament Concludes: Samsung Wins Championship

The Samsung mini-football team defeated Central Aviation with a score of 1-0 on Double Tenth Festival, winning the Fuxing Cup. Because it was National Day, the audience was enthusiastic, so both sides played especially well. Although Central Aviation lost, their strong offense and excellent performance were praised by the audience, and success or failure should not be the only measure of their quality. Referee Fang Rongfu enforced the rules impartially, earning high praise. Zang Wenbin and Zhu Yishi assisted on the sidelines and were also deemed competent. After the match, Samsung immediately carried away the silver cup amidst the sound of firecrackers. The second Fuxing Cup League, which lasted for three months at the Municipal Sports Ground, has now concluded.

Samsung adopted an offensive strategy after the start of the match. In less than a minute, Lin Dianyi crossed the ball, Xiao Ziwen charged in from the left side, and kicked the ball into the upper right corner of the goal, giving Samsung the first and final goal. This shot was crisp, strong, and extremely beautiful. After seven minutes of stalemate, Chen Shiquan, the defender of Central Aviation, committed a handball in the penalty area. Xiao Ziwen took the penalty, and the ball was fast and powerful. Dong Jincai calmly blocked it, winning enthusiastic applause. Afterwards, Central Aviation used the tailwind to put pressure on Samsung, but to no avail. After changing positions, the competition became more intense, but both sides moved very clearly and played beautifully. Although there were many close calls on both sides, due to the strict defenses, the outcome did not change until the end of the match. Samsung returned in triumph with a score of 1-0.

### A Little Trip to Gusu

— He Ku

It's been half a year since I went to Suzhou, and things are a little different. There are very few rickshaw pullers by the train station, probably because they have long been swept away by the throngs of incoming passengers. I barely managed to hire a horse-drawn carriage, which charged two yuan to go from the station to the Guanqian Street bus stop. When I arrived at the bus stop, the people waiting for the bus were already packed together in a large crowd. As soon as the bus arrived, everyone rushed up. The entrance was narrow, making it difficult to squeeze in at once. Several soldiers climbed in through the bus windows. The situation was very dangerous. Although I had accumulated more than ten years of experience squeezing onto trams in Shanghai, it was difficult to compete with them. Just then, the horse-drawn carriage I had taken earlier came back to solicit business, saying, "Why don't you just take the horse-drawn carriage?" As a result, I jumped into the carriage, of course...

On the section of road between Guanqian Street and Xumen, the horse-drawn carriage had an obligation to give free rides to special figures. They would jump on for a while and then jump off. If you didn't let them ride, they would glare at you angrily. But once past Panmen, when the carriage was on the highway, the hitchhikers disappeared.

There are particularly many flies in Suzhou. Buzzing, they constantly circled the horse-drawn carriage. From Suzhou all the way to Mudu by bus, they wouldn't leave, flying away and then coming back. It's late autumn, but the potential power of flies in Suzhou is still very strong. As soon as you get to a restaurant in Mudu, it's full of flies, flying around the tables, just like the commotion of the tourists.

Up on Lingyan Mountain, things were still the same. On the mountain, I saw a large fat man touring the mountain, with a bamboo sedan chair carried on the shoulders of four strong country women. The large fat man was still panting for breath from the bouncing of the bamboo sedan chair. My companion said that this wasn't a large fat man touring the mountain, but rather we were seeing the City God making an inspection tour. The scene was indeed about seven parts similar.

At the top of the mountain, there were people selling Coca-Cola, asking for three jiao five fen. I asked them if they could sell it at the price limit. The reply was that there was no price limit here. What a place for black market transactions beyond the law!

Only halfway up the mountain could you see a distant view of the lake, with faint sails and sandpipers. It was just a bit too far away, giving only a sense of vastness and lacking a sense of intimacy. This is why Lingyan Mountain is ultimately not as good as Yuantouzhu.

From Lingyan Mountain to Tiger Hill was another long horse-drawn carriage ride. The people in the carriage shouted about being lonely. The coachman said that it was all the fault of you Shanghai people these past few years, "Wanting to be fast, fast!" That's why there's no more business for horse-drawn carriages. Actually, the scene of galloping along the deep autumn highway to the sound of hooves isn't bad. The flies were still hiding on the coachman's back and next to the passengers. The horse-drawn carriage was like the palm of the Tathagata Buddha, and the flies couldn't fly out. Later, I used a bamboo hiking stick to fiercely eliminate them, and after more than ten minutes of waving it in the air, the flies actually retreated completely and no longer harassed the surroundings.

The degree of inclination of the Tiger Hill Pagoda is almost comparable to that of Pisa. The entire scenic area has entered a state of decline, lacking artificial cultivation and maintenance. Even scenery gets old. On the other hand, the small river on Shantang Street reminded us of the lingering charm of the folk tale "Three Smiles Romance." One of my companions, a descendant of the recluse Tang Yin, was quite proud of his handsome appearance, which he attributed to the inheritance from his "grandmother."

The horse-drawn carriage entered the city, and a young soldier jumped on again at the entrance of Guanqian Street. The coachman said that he would stop at the Xuanmiao Temple, but the soldier replied, "I only need a ride to the Xuanmiao Temple." He spoke with a Sichuan accent, so I started chatting with him in the Sichuan dialect. He said that he had been a soldier for ten years and was too poor to afford the expenses to return to his hometown even once. Those who ride the carriage are certainly annoyed by the hitchhikers, but other than hitchhiking, they really don't have the money to pay for the carriage. And they regard hitchhiking as entertainment. Even on the short stretch of road from Chayuanchang to Zhengshanmen, they enjoy "hitching" as a form of entertainment.

The shops closed one after another at six o'clock, which reminded me of the gloomy atmosphere of Suzhou during the war years. The guests at Songhe Lou were getting more and more crowded. Fortunately, the waiters were skillful and would answer impatient diners politely, so the customers had no reason to get angry with them. It was still early to go to the train station after dinner, so I slipped to the Daguangming Theater in Beiju to watch an hour of "Princess Shui Lian," which was just a way to kill time.

I left the theater at exactly nine o'clock and returned to Guanqian Street. I saw that the front of Songhe Lou was heavily guarded, with a large crowd of onlookers. It was said that someone had come to eat but couldn't be served, causing a big scene, and several people were injured from a distance. Fortunately, we had eaten dinner earlier and were not caught in the crossfire. Such is the scenery of troubled times.

### Remembering Zhao Yaosheng

— Lu Danlin

A few days ago, the Ta Kung Pao Chengdu special dispatch reported "Sichuan Elder Zhao Xi Passed Away." The passing away of an established man could not help but make one sad.

Zhao Yaosheng (Xi), whose pen name was Xiang Song, enjoyed great fame for his poetry, calligraphy, and painting for several decades. In the late Xuantong period, he was transferred from compiler of the Hanlin Academy to Supervisory Censor of Jiangxi Province. At that time, it happened that Sheng Xuanhuai, the Minister of Posts and Communications, had requested and was approved to borrow foreign funds and advocated that the railways be nationalized. The Qing chiefs accepted Sheng's memorial and announced the railway policy, stipulating that trunk lines should be nationalized and branch lines should be built by merchants according to their capabilities. All previously approved railway cases were cancelled, and resistance would be treated as a crime of violating imperial orders. Therefore, the railway turmoil in Sichuan was provoked. Mr. Zhao and Ou Jialian, standing in their position as censors, filed an impeachment against Sheng Xuanhuai. As a result, Zhao's honest reputation spread throughout the country. Not long after, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown. He lived in Hangzhou for some time, then returned to his hometown of Rong County, Sichuan, using composing poetry, writing lyrics, writing calligraphy, and painting to pass the time. He also worked hard to improve Sichuan Opera, often adapting old plays, re-editing the plot and lyrics, such as changing "Capturing Wang Kui Alive" to "Love Investigation" and the like, is one example.

There were several elders in Sichuan, such as Yan Kai, Fang Xu, Song Yuren, Yin Changheng, Liao Ping, and Xu Zixiu, etc. Society called them the Five Old Men and Seven Sages. He was also one of them. More than ten years ago, they often jointly expressed their opinions on provincial administration and local undertakings to fulfill the responsibilities of local elders. During the period of warlord separatism, rising and falling one after another, each occupying one side, doing all kinds of evil, but they were very respectful to these old men. Once, civil war broke out in Sichuan and fighting broke out in Rong County, but the military commanders on both sides agreed not to fight in the alleys near the East Gate, because Mr. Zhao lived in the East Gate. Zhao wrote in a letter to his friend Fei Jun, "My county is in the mountainous area. This time, nearly 300,000 soldiers on both sides will be exhausted even to eat millet. ... Seven or eight hundred people die at once (about 50,000 casualties on both sides). I was fortunate to be protected by the generals on both sides. The books and inkstones inside the door were still neatly arranged, unaware of the events. However, sitting in the sea of artillery fire, the sound of bullets was like rain, and the sound above my head was like the cry of a hungry kite. Machine guns and mortar shells were fired, and the alley battles in the city shook the mountains and the ground. Refugees often gathered in the cold house, and sometimes soldiers also did. At that time, it could be called Xin Taiping Zhai, and after thinking about it afterwards, my soul was terrified."

Mr. Zhao's poetic skills were profound, vigorous, and concise, and he wrote very quickly. Those who don't know him think that his poems are the result of hard work, but in fact they are spoken offhand without any refinement. When Yang Zengluo was transferred to Sichuan, Zhao wrote thirty bamboo branch poems to see him off, describing the scenery from Hubei to Chengdu when entering Sichuan. Chen Yan asked Zhao to write them on a horizontal scroll, and Zhao added four more poems at the beginning and end to give to Chen. The next day, Chen visited Zhao, and Zhao's farewell poems had expanded to sixty. Chen and Yang were deeply impressed when they saw them.

More than ten years ago, in my correspondence with him, I mentioned Cheng Baijia's recent situation. They used to be extremely good friends, but later lost contact, and both missed each other very much. After reading my letter, Mr. Zhao immediately wrote two seven-character quatrains for me. The poems said: "As time passes, the setting sun approaches, and the red trees of the old year have undergone several frosts; the green bird from the cloud has no news, and the intestines are broken as the mottled turtle ties to the Land Wolf. A letter tells of Baijia due to the wind, and the old friend is still drifting on the shore; at Maple Bridge, there is a little rain, and don't ask Wu Niang for lotus flowers!"

Liang Qichao devoted his life to writing essays and did not write much poetry. Later, when he wrote poetry, he most admired Mr. Zhao. Therefore, whenever he wrote poetry, he would definitely send it to him for revision. From Liang's posthumous works, there are several five-character long lines sent to Zhao Yaosheng, which shows Liang's great respect for Zhao.

### Jie Lian Huan - Remembering the Past in Jinling

— Nei Shaohong

It's late autumn in Moling, and the Milky Way casts its shadow, with a faint moon trace; tracing the old traces, after calamities, the desolate palaces and temples are far away on the mountains, covered with grass. A clear heart reflects under the silent sky. Considering hundreds of years have passed, does the Stone know whether the times are cold or warm? The night in Qinhuai turns with the sound of the leak, listening to the singing of the businesswomen, singing in resentment. They only resent the meat-eaters scheming, so they defend the Huai River and block the river; the old path is in front of us, don't make another miscalculation! Who will I teach this peach blossom at the bottom of the fan to re-enact?

### Mulanhuajian

The dark clouds are not resolved, and the autumn rain beats all night long. The guest sleeves are cold, and the thick feelings want to be sent, ten thousand strands and thousands of lines. Full of Xiao, blowing and sinking the islands, can't bear the remaining fragrance, the waves wipe out the duckweed. Looking at the Hua Gai of pearls, I'm waiting to listen to the rain. Tomorrow, I'll break the lake bridge. The long pavilion willow is far away. I guess who can tie up the goodbye, and only leave a goodbye dream, the dream is also boring. The sound of Sheng Xiao, passes on the hidden complaints, I'm afraid to urge the return to the dark soul! There is still some awakening that has not been bought, and then the wine warms the flag.

### American Snippets

— Zhong Jian

Today, women employees in the United States no longer work solely for needle and thread money, 84 percent work to support themselves or their families. This is a report by Secretary of Labor Schweilenbach.

The U.S. Army shoe has changed its style, with an added eighth of an inch to the small toe side of the toe, the purpose of which is to "improve foot hygiene." This is the first style change since 1912.

A report by the Federal Security Agency: The U.S. birth rate has been rising year after year, with 3.91 million babies born in 1947, 440,000 more than the previous high of 1946.

Inflation in the United States has not yet ended. Private universities cannot balance their income and expenses, and have raised tuition fees. Yale University's annual tuition has risen from $450 to $600. Tuition at Columbia University has increased by one-third, and dormitory fees have increased by 17 percent.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced: U.S. living expenses rose seven-tenths of a percent in May of this year, up 70.5 percent from the 1935-1939 average.

### Fake Fingerprints

— Nanwu

Modern detectives attach great importance to fingerprints. A fingerprint on the handle of a pistol can often strongly indicate who the murderer is. Even if the person identified as the suspect vehemently protests their innocence, the judicial authorities often pay no attention—who told them to leave that fingerprint?

However, in recent years, American detectives' views on fingerprints have changed considerably. The reasons are: (1) fingerprints can actually be faked; (2) sometimes other people's fingerprints can be used to commit crimes, while the person whose fingerprints are used remains completely in the dark, without any knowledge. In other words, it used to be "planting evidence," and now there is "planting fingerprints."

Not long ago, a jeweler in Chicago was very interested in faking fingerprints and often created several sets of fake fingerprints as a pastime in his spare time. Later, he was imprisoned for endangering public safety and got along very well with the prison warden. He told the warden that he could fake fingerprints and hoped the warden would allow him to publicly demonstrate this unique skill for legal circles and criminology experts to use as a reference. The warden, after hearing this, thought it was complete nonsense and ridiculed him for a while. The jeweler had no choice but to resign himself to his fate and continue serving his sentence.

A few days later, he went to see the warden again. When he entered the warden's office, he found it empty. It turned out that the warden was still on his inspection round and had not returned. There was a safe in the office. The jeweler had a sudden idea, opened the safe, took out some money, and quietly walked away. The next day, the warden discovered that some banknotes were missing from the safe and was shocked. He immediately called the police. The detectives looked through a microscope and found clear fingerprints left by the thief on the safe door—upon closer inspection, they turned out to be the fingerprints of the warden's son!

Just as the warden was feeling ashamed, angry, and not knowing whether to laugh or cry, the jeweler walked in. He returned the money to the warden and specifically stated that his purpose in doing this was to let the detectives know that fingerprints can be faked and can be "transferred." The warden naturally felt relieved after hearing this, and the shrewd and capable American detectives gained a new understanding of fingerprints from then on.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Social General Living Conditions reported in this newspaper on the 6th, rickshaw drivers can earn ten gold yuan per day! That is 300 yuan per month, which is much better than a senior official (those with a salary of 600 yuan only get a little over 120 yuan). There is also a saying in Peiping that "those who pull rickshaws have a better life than those who ride in them." Two-wheeled rickshaws (commonly called "foreign cars," also known as "rubber tires," what Shanghai calls "yellow package cars") in Peiping have been almost completely eliminated, and "three-wheelers" are everywhere. Those who work in this profession are called "stepping on three-wheelers," but they still ask those who hire them, "Where to?" This is partly due to habit, and partly because "stepping to where" is not a proper phrase.

Bargaining for rickshaws in Peiping has always had its own special unit of currency. In the early years of the Republic of China, people always spoke of so many "zi'er." More recently, it was three or five "zi'er" for short distances and ten or twenty "zi'er" for long distances. The so-called "zi'er" refers to copper coins, which are called "copper plates" or "copper jiaozi" in the south and "copper zi'er" in the north. The abbreviation is "zi'er," and this is used as the unit of measurement. However, the rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane quote prices in "mao." The minimum fare is one "mao," which is one jiao of silver. This is because pulling foreigners is particularly aristocratic, and passengers who pay with "mao" don't care about the price. Secondly, the rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane are relatively clean and luxurious, and the rickshaw drivers are also more energetic and efficient, probably because they cater to foreign customers. Chinese people who hire rickshaws in Dongjiaomin Lane naturally follow the foreign practice of pricing in "mao," so there were two units of currency at that time: "mao" and "zi'er." This remained the case until before the Anti-Japanese War. Although the cost of living gradually increased and prices rose, from several "zi'er" to several dozen "zi'er," and from one or two "mao" to three or four "mao," it never deviated from "mao" and "zi'er." Although banks or stores may account for a few "mao" and a few "fen" or even "li," rickshaw drivers never used the term "fen." Beyond "zi'er," it was "mao."

The current situation is somewhat different, because the asking price is either "several mao" (gold yuan) or "several tens of thousands" (legal tender). These two units, "wan" and "mao," never have denominations of a few "fen." It is expected that after the old legal tender is completely phased out by the end of November, only "mao" will be used as the unit of currency.

Currently, hiring a "three-wheeler" for the shortest distance costs at least one "mao." From Xuanwumen to Xidan Archway, it costs two "mao." Yesterday, I saw an interesting incident of hiring a rickshaw. The asking price was only "two mao," but the counter-offer was "fifty million yuan." Other cases of bargaining for goods with an asking price of "one yuan" and a counter-offer of one hundred and twenty million yuan (i.e., four jiao) are common, which is amusing.

The public buses in Peiping have been suspended due to unsustainable losses, and the buses have been auctioned off to pay off debts. The trams are barely maintained, but are mostly dilapidated and in need of repair, on the verge of collapse. When it comes to "getting around," one can only rely on one's own two legs.

Three-wheelers have become a scarce "commodity." From the North City to the South City, it costs one yuan or eight "mao." It is not surprising that each person earns more than ten gold yuan per day. Three-wheelers are not as physically demanding as two-wheeled rickshaws, so it is not too tiring to travel north and south more than ten times a day.
