### Final Accounts to Be Handled in Two Phases; Measures for Closing the First Half of This Year's National Treasury Revenue and Expenditure; Ministry of Finance Invites Relevant Agencies to Discuss and Implement

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 19th] The Ministry of Finance has recently stated that since the central general budget for this year is prepared in two phases, the final accounts should also be handled in two phases. However, at the end of the first half of the year, the revenue agencies failed to deposit all the taxes collected into the treasury before the end of June, and the supplementary budget bill and the emergency order for the allocation of funds could not be signed and allocated before the end of June due to the timing of approval. Moreover, during the period of suppression of the rebellion, traffic in various places was sometimes blocked, and the branches of the treasury in the rebel areas were moved around, resulting in the monthly statements of the national treasury not being delivered on time. All receivables and payables cannot be closed at the end of the first half of the year. Therefore, a draft of the measures for closing the national treasury revenue and expenditure for the first half of the 37th year was drawn up, and relevant agencies such as the Auditing Department, the Accounting Department, the Central Bank, and the National Treasury Bureau were convened to discuss and decide on its implementation. The main points of the content are as follows: (1) For all budgets or expenditure bills and emergency orders for the first half of the year, if the funds have not been fully allocated by the end of the first half of the year, the Ministry of Finance may issue payment orders before July 20, and all levels of the national treasury shall prepare and issue them before August 5, which will still be counted as the expenditure for the first half of the year. If the funds have not been allocated after the deadline mentioned above, and the agencies still need to use them, they should go through the procedures for transferring the year. (2) The total deposit of the national treasury revenue for the first half of the year, the deposit for the ordinary expenses of various agencies, may continue to be used before August 10. The remaining amount that has not been used after the deadline and belongs to the first half of the year should be returned by the using agencies according to law and included in the total deposit of revenue for the lower year. The remaining amount belonging to the advance allocation of expenses for the second half of the year will continue to be used in the second half of the year. (3) The remaining amount of various expenditures managed by the agencies themselves should be submitted to the nearest national treasury before August 10 and included in the total deposit of revenue for the second half of the year, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (4) The public treasury checks issued by various agencies for the deposit of ordinary expenses for the first half of the year, which are remitted from place A to place B and are still used in the national treasury, may continue to be used before August 10. The remaining amount that has not been used after the deadline shall be handled in accordance with Article 2. (5) The special fund deposits that have not been used by August 10 will be added to the use in the second half of the year. (6) For all funds allocated by emergency orders, if the bill has not been prepared by the end of the first half of the year, the competent authorities should prepare a summary estimate before July 20 and submit it for approval, with the end of July as the final approval deadline, and the national treasury should enter the accounts separately before August 10. (7) The accounting reports of the total deposit of revenue of each branch treasury (all payments and receipts before August 10 of the 37th year) should be sent to the district branch treasury before August 15, and the district branch treasury should complete the work before the end of August.

### Deterioration of the Berlin Crisis

The Berlin crisis, although it once tended to ease when the Soviet Union partially lifted the ban on East-West traffic in Germany during the Tito's rebellion in Eastern Europe, it has been deteriorating ever since, and there is a tendency to turn sharply downward. Even British Defense Minister Shinwell said: "The situation in Berlin is really explosive. Fortunately, no one is willing to fire the first shot at present." From these few words alone, one can see the deterioration of the Berlin crisis.

Looking at the recent series of shocking events: The first is the arrival of sixty American Superfortress bombers in England. The American air force personnel who arrived in the United Kingdom with the Superfortress have reached as many as 1,500, and will use the air force bases of Britain and France; no matter how the United States explains it, it is still a demonstrative action against the Soviet Union. The second is that the foreign ministers' meeting of the five Western European Union countries opened in The Hague yesterday, and the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will also send aircraft to participate in the Berlin airlift to show the unity of action of the Western European group of countries. The third is the new American plan to open the blockade of Berlin by force, and to implement economic sanctions against the Soviet Union if necessary. Once Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have expressed their approval of this plan, a new note will be submitted to Moscow, once again demanding that the Soviet Union immediately lift the blockade of Berlin, otherwise the Western allies will take action in accordance with the planned plan. On the Soviet side, they are also taking threatening measures against the Berlin airlift, and will occasionally conduct exercises with transport planes and fighter planes over Berlin, and will close two of the three air corridors in Berlin, so that the Western allies can no longer use air transport to supply Berlin. Looking at the general trend, the Soviet Union is determined to go its own way to the end, and the Western allies are unwilling to compromise. The Berlin crisis has indeed reached the stage where both sides are showing their cards.

Since the West German agreement was signed in London, the Western European allies immediately implemented currency reform in West Germany, forcing the Soviet Union to take strong action in Germany, and adopted a "cold encirclement" strategy against Berlin, cutting off the water and electricity supply and railway traffic in the British, American, and French zones, causing a serious crisis in Berlin, in an attempt to drive the forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France out of Berlin, in order to offset the impact caused by the West German agreement. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement" of Berlin immediately caused a serious reaction from the Western allies. The US State Department openly accused the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement" of Berlin as a "unilateral act of challenge." General Clay, the commander of the US Army in Germany, also said in a firm tone: "The Soviet Union is now implementing its final pressure in an attempt to drive us out of Berlin; but in any case, unless resort is made to war, any action taken by the Soviet Union will not succeed." Judging from General Clay's words alone, it can be seen that it is simply impossible for the Western allies to make concessions to the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin.

No one can deny that the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is enough to constitute a serious threat to European peace; therefore, after the Soviet Union implemented a "cold encirclement" of Berlin, the British and American authorities had long demanded that their respective governments deal with the Soviet Union strongly. The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France also attached great importance to the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement," and in May, they wanted to take joint action against Moscow, demanding that the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally lift its "cold encirclement" of Berlin, and wanted to warn the Soviet Union that if it insisted on its current strategy in Berlin, it would inevitably cause serious consequences. But just as the three governments were about to lodge a protest with Moscow, the European Communist International Information Bureau suddenly resolved to expel Yugoslav Marshal Tito from the party, which not only cracked the "iron curtain" in Eastern Europe, but also caused a deterioration in the relations between South and the Soviet Union; therefore, the Soviet Union's sight was shifted from Berlin to Belgrade, and it partially lifted the ban on East-West traffic in Germany, easing the Berlin crisis. However, it was not long before the relations between South and the Soviet Union gradually became clear, and the Soviet Union's actions in Berlin not only "returned to its old ways," restoring the "cold encirclement" of Berlin, but also intensified, and even wanted to prevent the Western allies from airlifting Berlin. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France were forced to lodge a protest with Moscow on July 8.

The main points of the protest by the three powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, when combined, include the following: (1) Pointing out that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin has created a serious international situation; (2) Suggesting that the four powers conduct negotiations to discuss the conditions for lifting this blockade, but the four powers must reopen negotiations after the Soviet Union first lifts its blockade of Berlin; (3) Declaring that any occupying country that wants to implement a blockade against the residents of Berlin is unacceptable; (4) Revealing the contents of the secret agreement between the three giants of Du (Truman), Shi (Stalin), and Qiu (Churchill) on June 14, 1945. Stalin had given a firm guarantee that the US military had the right to enter Berlin via railways, highways, and air. Today's Soviet blockade is a breach of promise. A week later, the Soviet Union submitted a reply, refusing to lift the blockade of Berlin, and attributed the responsibility for creating the current situation to the Western countries. The opinions of both sides are completely different and there is no hope of compromise, forcing the Western allies to consider the "next step."

This "next step," after careful consideration by the three powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, if they want to break the blockade of Berlin, they must take the following steps: (1) Submit the Berlin blockade incident to the Hague International Court of Justice for handling, in order to establish the legitimacy of the three Western powers' presence in Berlin and the right of supply convoys to pass through the Soviet-occupied zone to Berlin. If both sides have the spirit of abiding by international law and treaties and have the sincerity to resolve the issue peacefully, then this step is the most ideal; but in the era of strong power that despises the law, the establishment of legitimacy and its rights by the International Court of Justice is actually meaningless. (2) The United Nations Security Council should handle this incident in accordance with the provisions for investigating threats to international peace. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has long been considering "asking the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis," but it has not yet materialized, because this move is of no help in lifting the Berlin blockade. This is because the Soviet Union has the power of veto in the Security Council and can exercise its veto power over any decision. (3) Take strong retaliatory measures against the Soviet Union, break the blockade of Berlin by force, and if necessary, take military force to test the Soviet Union's blockade strength, or implement economic sanctions to force the Soviet Union to submit. However, this kind of behavior is inevitably too dangerous and may cause unexpected consequences.

In summary, the Western allies have almost no way to deal with the Soviet Union's "cold encirclement." Peaceful methods are difficult to work, and strong measures are too dangerous. Where to go and what to do is really worthy of serious consideration by the Western allies. However, what is called the Western allies will inevitably follow the lead of the United States, and the United States' opinion is enough to influence everything. The US government has decided to convene a special meeting of Congress, and Republican members have also asked to discuss US-Soviet relations. As for how to save the new crisis in Berlin, we should seek a way out of desperation. People all over the world who are holding their breath and waiting for the situation in Berlin to turn from danger to safety are all hoping that the US Congress can take decisive and firm measures.

### Lao Jun Miao Oilfield in Gansu Province: Monthly Production of Over 700,000 Gallons of Oil; New Facilities Being Prepared for Implementation

[By Airmail from Lao Jun Miao on the 15th] The Lao Jun Miao Oilfield of the China Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Gansu-Qinghai Branch was originally reorganized from the Gansu Oilfield. The mine was established during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the lack of equipment, everything was done as best as possible with old and scrap materials. The wells that were drilled were also overproduced due to the urgent need for oil during the war and are on the verge of depletion.

Since the victory, military transportation in the Northwest has still been in demand for oil. CPC's assistant manager Deng Kequan was sent to preside over the mine, Deng actively sought improvements, added new refineries to improve the quality of finished products, drilled new wells to supplement the supply of crude oil, and extensively explored oil fields to lay the foundation for the petroleum industry. However, in the past two years, transportation has been inconvenient, materials have been difficult to transport, prices have been rising daily, and funds have often been tight. Fortunately, the person in charge has been farsighted, and the employees at all levels have worked together with one heart. In a very short period of two years, they were able to complete two cracking distillation oil refineries, add more than 2,000 meters of new wells, expand the mining area by more than four times, and discover several new oil wells in Gansu and Qinghai provinces.

Since October of last year, the monthly output of the mine has maintained a record high. Last month, the production of more than 700,000 gallons was even more astonishing. President Weng sent a telegram of congratulations. The oilfield of the mine covers an area of 3,000 acres and has drilled 39 wells, of which 15 are currently producing oil. Ten new wells are planned to be drilled this year, and there is confidence that oil will be produced before October.

The mining area covers an area of approximately 70 square kilometers, with more than 6,000 rooms of various types of houses. The employees and their families total approximately 9,000 people. The current monthly expenditure is approximately 94.3 billion, most of which is used for expanding the business and purchasing and transporting foreign equipment, which is not included. The salaries of the employees are less than 100 billion. In addition to the production and management departments, the mining area also has a hospital, bathhouse, theater, newspaper, primary and secondary schools, industrial training classes, and daily necessities manufacturing departments such as ceramics, bricks, tiles, civil engineering, and flour. Clothing, food, housing, transportation, culture, and entertainment are all equipped, so although the employees are in the deserted Gobi, they can still work with peace of mind, and most of them are willing to dedicate themselves to the petroleum industry. In addition to the "Public" and "Sincerity" mottos of the National Resources Commission, the mine also adds "Striving," and the loyalty, diligence, and conscientiousness of the employees of each department are very touching.

### Promotion of Zhejiang Agriculture to Temporarily Use 25 Counties as Demonstration Areas; Three Parties Jointly Form Committee; Chen Yi Concurrently Chairman

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 19th] After Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Group came to Hangzhou, they agreed with the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the evening of the 18th to jointly form the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee. It was decided to set up a committee of seven members, with Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi concurrently serving as chairman, Construction Department Director Gong Peicheng concurrently serving as general manager, and Jinling University College of Agriculture Dean Zhang Zhiwen concurrently serving as technology director. Twenty-five counties will be temporarily used as demonstration areas, and it has been decided to choose them from the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou-Ningbo-Shaoxing-Jinhua and other areas. The three parties have signed the agreement, and the funds can be remitted soon. Zuo and others will transfer to Shanghai and return to Nanjing on the 19th.

The biggest difficulty currently facing the mine is still the difficulty in restoring transportation, the inability to transport a large number of materials, and the inability to maintain an equilibrium between oil prices and costs. The new measures for the mine in the future are to establish lubricating oil plants, asphalt plants, justice gas plants, cement plants, 20,000 KW power plants, and steelmaking departments. It is estimated that all the product equipment that the petroleum industry itself should have will be completed by the end of next year. In short, the authorities are confident in the reserves of the mine, and its scale is one of the best in the country today, and its future is infinitely bright.

### New Xiang County Magistrate Li Kuiguang Accused of Colluding with Bandits by the Assembly

[Report from our Xinxiang, 18th] The local assembly recently accused Li Kuiguang, the magistrate of Xinxiang County, to the Twelfth Pacification Zone Headquarters, of colluding with bandits and providing them with supplies. According to the assembly's statement, on the 27th of last month, the magistrate secretly dispatched Shi Xiupu, deputy leader of the Hetuo Town Security Detachment, to hire laborers to transport thirteen boxes of "79" bullets out of the area. At the blockade checkpoint, he presented an official certificate sealed with the county's official seal, falsely claiming that they were to resupply the Hetuo Town training team. The checkpoint guards allowed them to pass. At 6 PM that afternoon, they arrived at Hetuo Town and hid the bullets in civilian homes, planning to transport them across the Wei River to the bandit area during the quiet of the night. However, this was detected by Yuan Chuanbiao, captain of the Sixth Company of the Second Training Team of the county government stationed in Hetuo Town, who devised an ambush. At 11 PM, the criminals carried the bullets across the river, advancing towards the bandit area, and were intercepted. Shi Xiupu and one soldier were arrested on the spot and handed over to the county government for investigation. However, after receiving the case, Magistrate Li secretly concealed it. It is rumored that he even released the criminals in an attempt to cover up the evidence. The Twelfth Pacification Zone has now dismissed Li Kuiguang from his post for investigation. Zhang Guozhen, head of the first section of the county government, Shi Xiupu, and Zhang Xinyin, the head of Hetuo Town, have been detained for legal proceedings. Xia Zhiying, head of the economic section of the pacification zone, has been appointed as acting magistrate.

### Handling Fishing Boat Supplies: Management Committee Approves Measures; Distribution Conference to Be Held in Shanghai at the End of the Month

[Local News] The Management Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee recently held its fifth general meeting in Nanjing. A spokesperson for the committee told reporters yesterday that the main resolution passed at the fifth general meeting was the handling of fishing boat supplies. The committee currently has over 20,000 tons of shipbuilding timber, which had previously been decided to be sold. However, technical problems have arisen, delaying the sale. It is now proposed that the Ministry of Transportation purchase the timber, which has been approved by the fifth general meeting. The proceeds will then be distributed to coastal provinces and municipalities based on the proportion of wartime damage and the state of fisheries to build new fishing boats. The fifth general meeting also resolved that the distribution plan and technical issues for fishing attachments such as fishing nets, ropes, and diesel engines will be discussed at a meeting on the distribution of materials for building fishing boats to be held in Shanghai on the 28th. Preparations are currently underway. Participants will include representatives from the coastal provinces and municipalities, as well as representatives from fishery organizations. As for the northeastern provinces, which have long coastlines and developed fisheries before the war, fishery materials should also be distributed. However, due to the difficult situation in the area, the fifth general meeting decided to reserve 20% of all fishery materials (including the proceeds from the sale of materials). However, if the situation in the area does not stabilize by the end of this year, the materials will be reallocated for other uses. The spokesperson also explained to reporters that the committee plans to invite the US Economic Cooperation Administration to invest in cooperation to make good use of the committee's transportation, industrial, and mining equipment and materials.

In addition, the Sui-Shu decided to request the central government to establish a financial administration in Chongqing for control.

Chengdu

[Report from our Chengdu, 19th] With the issuance of large denomination currency, prices in Chengdu fluctuated. However, due to the extreme shortage of cash and tight credit, and the provincial government's dispatch of economic police to closely monitor the market, the market's reaction was not as violent as expected.

### Western European Five-Nation Foreign Ministers Secretly Consult on Countermeasures to the Berlin Crisis: Bidault Advocates Restoring Four-Power Talks; North Atlantic Joint Defense System Also Studied Carefully

[United Press, The Hague, 19th] French Foreign Minister Bidault, in opening the Brussels Treaty conference on the 19th, called on other European countries to join the European Union. He deeply hoped that the Western European alliance would be expanded into a pan-European alliance. In the midst of the Berlin crisis, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held their first meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here to review the progress of the alliance. The meeting is expected to quickly resolve the report on the implementation of military joint defense, and then solemnly discuss Germany and the strategy to deal with the Soviet Union's threat to force the Western allies to withdraw from Berlin. Bidault is expected to urge the resumption of four-power talks, first restoring the Allied Control Council, and finally reopening the Foreign Ministers' Conference. After Bidault's speech, reporters were asked to leave the meeting, and the secret meeting continued. The meeting in the afternoon of the 19th was extremely secret, discussing the Berlin crisis. Dean, a German expert from the British Foreign Office, flew here from London this morning to attend the afternoon meeting. Some officials hinted that the final result might be to convene a Foreign Ministers' Conference specifically to discuss Germany, but no one was willing to state this and weaken the power of negotiations with the Soviet Union. The morning meeting decided to establish a special economic and financial committee to meet in the afternoon to find practical solutions.

[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] The foreign ministers of the five Western European Union countries began a two-day secret meeting at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 19th. The Berlin crisis and the North Atlantic Joint Defense Plan provisionally drafted at the seven-nation talks in Washington are the main topics of discussion. The foreign ministers of the five participating countries are British Foreign Secretary Bevin, French Foreign Minister Bidault, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Boetzelaer, and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, who are participating in the meeting as members of the Western European Union Consultative Committee. Dutch Foreign Minister Boetzelaer, in his capacity as host, gave a welcome speech, stating that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg would always be grateful to Foreign Secretary Bevin for making the Western European Union a reality. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also welcome this opportunity to fully participate in the actions taken by Britain and the United States regarding the Berlin crisis. When talking about the military joint defense agreement of the Western European Union, Boetzelaer said that if this treaty is necessary to defend Western Europe, there should be no further hesitation and it should be made a reality as soon as possible. Bevin then rose to deliver a response, hoping that the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg would fully cooperate with Britain on the German issue, and believed that the United States would also welcome this cooperation. Bevin emphasized that the primary task of Western European countries is to maintain their own freedom, but at the same time they should not forget Germany's responsibility as a Western country, and should never allow violent forces to run rampant there. He continued, "It has only been six months since I first raised the issue of the Western European Union in the House of Commons, and now such progress has been made, which is gratifying. We are all trying to build this great alliance, and we must share the glory of this work." After the opening ceremony was completed, the foreign ministers of the five countries began to solemnly study the North Atlantic regional defense system drafted by the representatives of the seven countries of the United States, Canada, Britain, America, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in Washington, and the report of the Western Happy Alliance Permanent Military Committee. They took a break for lunch, and continued to discuss the general international situation from the standpoint of the Western European Union policy in the afternoon. Bevin will also hold separate talks with Bidault to exchange views on the Berlin crisis. When the British Embassy hosted a banquet for Bevin last night, the Canadian Ambassador to the Netherlands, the South African and Australian ministers to the Netherlands, and the diplomatic representatives of India and Pakistan were all present. Bevin reported on the situation of the Hague conference and promised to fully inform the British Commonwealth countries of the meeting.

### The Evolution of the Berlin Situation Forces Focus: Soviet Goals in the Ruhr; Future Actions of the Three Powers Contingent on the Outcome of the Hague Conference

[United Press, London, 19th] British official sources stated today that the Western Three Powers will refuse to participate in any discussions with the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin blockade. This applies to the Berlin issue and all other issues. The Three Powers, Britain, the United States, and France, are expected to express this position in their response to the Soviet Union's reply from last week. The Western response may be delivered to the Soviet ambassador in the capitals of the three countries this weekend or early next week, obviously after British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from the Hague Conference on the evening of the 20th. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office, during a routine briefing for journalists, stated that the three countries have not yet decided on the next step, or even whether they intend to issue another note to the Soviet Union. However, he also said that this statement does not mean that they do not intend to issue another note, "Every possible step is being considered now."

The spokesman reiterated the first protest, stating that there can be no further discussions between the Four Powers until the Berlin blockade is lifted. He said that this refers specifically to the Four Power Command Meeting in Berlin. Other official sources stated that the West "absolutely will not" agree to discuss the German issue with the Soviet Union elsewhere, such as a foreign ministers' conference, until the "cold siege" of Berlin is lifted. One person stated, "If so, then we will be at a disadvantage in negotiations." Although the focus of discussion has shifted to The Hague, British Undersecretary Strang, Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli are still continuing discussions on the Berlin crisis in London. Informed sources say that one of the options currently being considered by Britain, the United States, and France is to issue a final ultimatum to the Soviet Union. Another is to dispatch armored vehicles or armed truck convoys to break through the Berlin blockade with food. Appeals to the Security Council and the International Court of Justice have also been discussed.

[United Press, Berlin, 19th] Political observers state: The evolution of the current situation in Berlin has reached a focal point. However, the basis of the contention is undoubtedly the issue of permanent control of the Ruhr region. The Soviet Union hopes to develop the Ruhr, which can be seen from its repeated demands for the Four Powers to jointly manage the Ruhr region, but the Western Powers have repeatedly refused.

The situation in Berlin is, in essence, political. The Soviet Union's use of obstructive tactics in the Berlin Four Power Command Meeting to force the Three Powers to establish a West German merger zone is aimed at immediately driving the Three Powers out of Berlin. If the Soviet Union can control Berlin, it means that it has grasped the center, which is recognized by these eighty million German people as the capital of Germany. The second step is to instigate satellite parties scattered throughout Germany to demand that Germany "unite" under the Soviet-controlled Berlin government. If this move succeeds, then the Soviet Union will almost certainly control the Ruhr region. The Allies are also aware of its purpose and know that, with a feigned show of strength, Berlin is merely its starting point. The second step for the Soviet Union is to drive the Allied Powers out of the entire territory of Germany. Therefore, political observers believe that the West will risk war to insist on staying in Berlin.

### US Air Master Aircraft Enhance Berlin Airlift

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Reliable sources say: Seventy giant Air Master aircraft will soon be transferred from the United States to Germany to enhance the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. These aircraft can carry ten tons of cargo each time. If they make three round trips a day, the airlift volume can be increased by 2,100 tons per day. There are already sixty Air Master aircraft serving in Germany. Also, according to the Soviet-controlled Berlin radio station, about ten miles of the Berlin-Helmstedt railway tracks have been dismantled. Soviet officials stated last week that many of the sleepers on that line were rotten and needed to be replaced, but the repair work will be completed as soon as possible.

### Tens of Thousands of Men and Women Imprisoned in Soviet Concentration Camps in Germany

Indoctrinating Lenin and Marx

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 18th] The British Occupation Zone's "World Daily News" today published an article on the situation in the Soviet Buchenwald concentration camp. It stated that "In April 1948, 10,000 people were detained in the concentration camp by the Soviet secret police, including 170 women. Most of those imprisoned in the concentration camp were members of the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party, as well as civil servants, etc. The charges were mostly for serving as spies for the Western Allies. Those imprisoned do not know when they will be released. Work is also prohibited in the concentration camp, and they have nothing to do all day long. The daily ration is 300 grams of bread and two bowls of clear soup. Those imprisoned are completely isolated from the outside world. Every three months, they are issued a book on Marx or Lenin, and the prisoners are ordered to read it. Every month, Soviet officials come to the concentration camp to give speeches, the content of which is all about politics, the Soviet revolution, the Soviet Union's reforms, the historical relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, etc.

### Sixty American Superfortresses All Arrive in England

[Reuters, Lincoln City, England, 19th] Fifty-eight of the sixty American Superfortresses stationed temporarily in England have already arrived in England. The last two arrived at their destination today. The British people warmly welcomed the return of their wartime allies to England.

[United Press, Scampton, England, 18th] According to an announcement by the Air Force Information Office: American crew members are staying in Scampton. The Washington and Mahan aircraft are on standby. Major General Warley, the representative of the commander of the US Air Forces in Europe, LeMay, arrived here from Germany yesterday to command the US aircraft. American crew members were busy today organizing aircraft and unloading boxes, which contained repair materials and other equipment.

### British Giant Transport Aircraft Automatically Flies Long Range

Two Thousand Miles in Twelve Hours

[United Press, Los Angeles, 18th] A US Air Force four-engine transport aircraft has completed its third automatic long-range flight. The aircraft flew 2,100 miles from Wilmington, Iowa, to here in less than twelve hours. During that time, the ten crew members ate, played chess, slept, and did nothing, never touching the controls.

### Southern Countries Boycotted by Romania Turn to Britain and the US to Purchase Oil; Poland Refuses to Attend South Communist Congress

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th, United Press] Diplomatic sources say that Yugoslavia is planning to jointly purchase oil from Western countries, because Romania and Albania are boycotting Yugoslavia and refusing to sell gasoline. Before the conflict between Tito and the Kremlin, the gasoline needed by Yugoslavia came from the Soviet Union. Informed sources say that Yugoslavia has finally contacted agents of British and American Near East oil companies in Trieste to purchase oil. It is reported that the two sides have reached a temporary agreement, but the final arrangements for the transaction have not yet been completed. At the same time, US officials say that there is now more evidence to prove that the Soviet Union hopes to overthrow Tito through continuous economic pressure. It is predicted here that the struggle between Tito and the Kremlin will produce new developments at two meetings to be held in Belgrade in the next twelve days. These two meetings are: (1) the South Communist Congress to be convened on the 21st; (2) the ten-nation Danube River Navigation Freedom Conference to be convened on the 30th.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 18th] The Polish Communist Party announced its refusal to attend the South Communist Congress, which will open in Belgrade on Wednesday.

### The French Parliament's Vote of Confidence: Schuman Can Overcome Difficulties

[United Press, Paris, 19th] Former French Prime Minister Herriot assumed a heavy responsibility on the 19th, just in time to save the government at the last minute, enabling it to safely pass the afternoon's vote of confidence. Herriot, in his capacity as an elder statesman, attempted to make his Radical Socialist Party more moderate on the issue of reducing the military budget. He urgently summoned three party leaders, former Prime Minister Daladier, Minister of Justice Maritain, and Gassier, to discuss the matter for an hour. There was no announcement after the meeting, but it was rumored that they believed that they could persuade party members to change their opinions, reach a compromise, and maintain the current government. Herriot's actions made the situation suddenly optimistic.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] The National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the 19th on Premier Schuman's request regarding the national defense budget. General observations predict that the government can obtain a relatively large number of confidence votes, because in the current tense international situation, the Socialist Party and the Radical Party are unwilling to bring down the government due to cutting the defense budget. Schuman had a long-distance telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Bidault, who is currently in The Hague, yesterday to discuss the domestic political situation.

### The Soviet Air Force's Strength Is Comparable to That of the United States, but It Lacks Navigation Equipment

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The "World Aviation Yearbook" states: The Soviet Air Force's strength is similar to that of the United States. The Soviet Union has a large and modern aircraft industry, but it lacks airfields and navigation equipment. This yearbook is a new publication that provides a detailed description of civil and military aviation in countries around the world, covering about 100 countries in total. The Soviet Air Force is estimated to have 　 one thousand aircraft and 400,000 personnel. Among the aircraft, there are hundreds of jet aircraft and at least one hundred B29 Superfortresses. 42% of the military aircraft are fighter planes. The Soviet Union's strategic bombing force, i.e., long-range bombers, is weak, and there are no aircraft carriers that can be used as forward bases. There are hundreds of airfields, but less than fifty are well-equipped. Even airfields in larger cities lack complete runways, hangars, and adequate passenger terminals. Snow removal equipment is poor, and some airfields cannot be used in winter. Almost all air routes lack lighting equipment and can only be flown in daylight.

### British, American, and French Commanders Confer on Plans to Establish West Germany; Deny Considering Armed Breakthrough of Blockade

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] The British, American, and French military governors in Germany met this morning at British military headquarters in Berlin to discuss further implementation of the plan to establish West Germany, and to consider the counter-proposals made by the prime ministers of the eleven West German states regarding the London Conference recommendations. French military governor in Germany, Koenig, arrived by special plane from West Germany to attend the meeting. As the Berlin crisis becomes increasingly tense, former US Intelligence Minister, Major General Donovan, made a speech in Berlin yesterday, advocating economic sanctions against the Soviet Union and its allies. He said that although the airlift system is a temporary measure, the United States must make a resolution, even at the risk of war.

[United Press, Berlin, 19th] A US official spokesman denied on the evening of the 19th that the British, American, and French military governors would discuss plans to dispatch armed escorts or trains through the Soviet occupation zone to break the blockade.

### US Delegation Departs to Attend Danube River Conference

[Our News] New York, 19th broadcast: The US delegation left the United States by plane today to attend the ten-nation conference discussing navigation on the Danube River. US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, will wait in Paris for the delegation to go to the meeting together.

### Truman, Marshall, et al. Confer on Berlin Crisis

### Major Victory for UN Organization: Arab League Accepts Ceasefire Order; But Still Refuses to Recognize the Existence of the Jewish State

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Arab League Political Committee, after holding a secret meeting in Aley, Paris, officially announced from Beirut the Arab acceptance of a truce in Palestine. Arab figures stressed that although the Arabs accept the truce, they still refuse to recognize the existence of the Jewish state.

It further stated: Although newspapers and public opinion oppose accepting the truce, the Arab League decided to accept the truce because it was inconvenient to ignore the will of the Great Powers. After the Arab League Political Committee formally accepted the truce, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi telegraphed Bernadotte's headquarters on Rhodes.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] The Arab League countries tonight telegraphed UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, declaring their acceptance of the Security Council's Palestine ceasefire order, but with three conditions attached: (1) During the ceasefire period, the Jewish side will stop immigration; (2) Arab people can return to their homes during this period, and their lives and property must be protected; (3) The ceasefire period must be determined. The telegram was sent by League Secretary-General Azzam. The Jewish authorities had accepted the ceasefire order before the Arab League, but they will definitely oppose the three conditions of the Arab side being accepted by the UN mediator or the Security Council.

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The fact that the Palestine ceasefire order was accepted by both the Arabs and the Jews is generally regarded as the biggest victory for the UN organization. Although the UN had previously facilitated ceasefires twice (once in Indonesia and once in Palestine), they were both in the form of appeals, unlike this time when the Charter was formally invoked to issue an order. This is a major test of the Security Council's power. The notification of the Arab acceptance of the ceasefire order arrived a few hours after the stipulated deadline of 3 p.m. (standard time).

### US Trains South Korean Troops: This Local Force Is Rapidly Expanding; The Korean National Assembly Will Elect the President and Vice President Today

[United Press, Seoul, 19th] The United States is quietly building a local army in South Korea, the size of which is still a secret, but anyone with a little discernment can see that this army is rapidly expanding. Soldiers in green uniforms are often seen drilling in the fields, and small numbers of soldiers sing and walk in pairs on the streets of Seoul. This organization is nominally called the "Korean Constabulary," but the distinction from the regular army is not very clear. The Constabulary often says that when the US military withdraws, it will leave behind US Army and weapons, because the United States has guaranteed to maintain the Korean state and grant it military power.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The Korean National Assembly, after a two-day recess, is scheduled to secretly vote to elect the President of the Republic of Korea tomorrow morning. The organization of the Korean government can thus become more concrete. The election of the Vice President is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon. Negotiations between the various political parties on the selection of the Prime Minister and one Minister of the State Council (i.e., the Cabinet) are expected to take two weeks to reach an agreement. Therefore, the organization of the government can be completed around August 15. According to the Korean Constitution, the Ministers and the Prime Minister are all appointed by the President, but the selection of the Prime Minister requires the consent of the National Assembly. Dr. Syngman Rhee and Yi Si-yeong (former State Councilor of the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing) are expected to be elected as President and Vice President. Seo Jae-pil, who was originally a strong rival of Syngman Rhee, has now stated that he will not participate in the election, and will refuse to accept even if elected.

### UN Organization Agrees to International Military Police Guarding Jerusalem

Bernadotte Is Planning This

[United Press, Lake Success, 19th] Informed sources stated today that the UN organization will begin recruiting international volunteers in the next few days to go to Jerusalem to assist in policing. UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte arrived on Rhodes today after flying there today, and his initial task will be to discuss this matter with his staff. Bernadotte consulted with representatives from the United States, France, and Belgium on this plan last week, and it is said that he hopes to first send 250 volunteers, and eventually expand to 1,000 to 1,500. The United States and France have agreed in principle to allow the UN organization to recruit 355 people from each of those countries.

[United Press, Rome, 18th] UN Palestine mediator Bernadotte arrived here today by special plane from the Dutch capital via Geneva. He will stay overnight and fly to Rhodes tomorrow.

### Intense Fighting in Northern Palestine Between Arabs and Jews

[Our News] Haifa, 19th broadcast: Large-scale warfare is continuing throughout northern Palestine. The Arab army ignored the truce order and launched a strong counter-offensive in the area of Jenin. At the same time, Syrian troops are also pressing towards the Jewish positions on the southern shore of the Sea of Galilee.

### Katayama's Request to Dissolve the Diet Shocks the Japanese Political World; Rumors that the Cabinet Will Convene an Extraordinary Session of the Diet in September

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The statement by the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Tetsu Katayama, expressing his desire to request the dissolution of the Diet after the opening of the upcoming Extraordinary Diet, has shocked the Japanese political world. For Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, who clings to his position, it is as if cold water has been poured on him. Katayama's statement, made in Sendai in northern Honshu, has aggravated the crisis of the Ashida Cabinet. Katayama's statement indicates that the Social Democratic Party intends to cooperate with the Democratic Liberal Party, the largest opposition party, after the start of the Diet session to request the dissolution of the Diet and pass this motion. The attitude of the occupying authorities on the issue of dissolving the Diet is still unknown. In short, since this motion still depends on the attitude of the General Headquarters, it may be rejected and not be submitted to the Diet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] According to sources close to the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Cabinet is preparing to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet in early September, and seems to have decided to face the major issue of dissolution on the day of the convocation. Most of the bills to be discussed in the Extraordinary Diet are related to labor issues, and on these issues, the opinions of the Democratic and National Cooperative Parties are diametrically opposed to those of the Socialist Party.

### Japanese Communist Party Leader Seriously Injured in Assassination Attempt

Injured in More Than Thirty Places by a Hand Grenade Explosion

The motive for the assassination is unknown.

### Prospects for the US Presidential Election (Part 2)

— Our Special Correspondent, Mao Shuqing

The Democratic Party's current unfavorable campaign situation is not only due to Truman's lack of prestige. Tracing back to the Roosevelt era, diplomatic errors have been gradually revealed by Republican public opinion. Every time Americans mention the Berlin incident, every time they mention the Czech coup, they are indignant at the so-called "Yalta Secret Agreement." The widely circulated "Saturday Evening Post" had a long article on the Czech coup, which was entirely due to the Yalta Secret Agreement stipulating: "The capitals of all countries east of the Elbe River occupied by the Nazis will be liberated by the Soviet Red Army." As a result, General Patton was outside the gates of Prague but still waited for the Soviet Union to occupy it first, leading to today's consequences. A recent editorial in New York's largest-selling "Daily News" stated that today's stalemate in Berlin was also caused by the Yalta Secret Agreement stipulating that the capitals east of the Elbe River would be liberated by the Red Army. Every time the American people think of the shame of the Yalta Secret Agreement, they express disappointment in the Democratic Party's foreign policy. During the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia last month, someone publicly cursed Roosevelt, from Roosevelt to Truman.

Secretary of State Marshall's stubbornness and disorganized actions are also a major reason for creating an unfavorable situation for Truman. On the Palestine issue, the Truman administration's foreign policy has changed repeatedly, and in the end, it hastily made an inappropriate "recognition," disappointing the Jewish people in the United States. Another example is Ambassador Smith's "exchange of notes" in Moscow, which aroused great resentment from Britain and France, all of which were extremely unwise and reckless actions. Its wavering foreign policy towards China has aroused great criticism from the Republican Party. From whatever angle one observes, the reckless diplomacy of Truman and Marshall has made the American people feel weary.

On the Republican side, Dewey, in his many speeches before the National Convention, was simple, concise, and clear in his diplomatic principles. But Dewey modestly told any reporter friends: "I am not familiar with diplomacy. Everything should be consulted with my advisor, Dulles." In Dewey's list of future cabinet members, the position of Secretary of State first belonged to Vandenberg. If Vandenberg does not take the position, Dulles will be asked. This gave the American people a clear and exciting impression.

If one speaks purely in terms of foreign policy and policy toward China, Dewey's election would be beneficial to China. Dewey mentioned speeding up aid to China in every speech. In his fourteen-point program, "Aid to China" was specifically designated as one point. Dewey also reminded American diplomats to respect the leadership position of China's President Chiang, which should be a prerequisite for all aid, which is a very wise view.

### Disruption of Power Plant Case: Yesterday's Verdict, Two Sentenced to Death, One to Lengthy Imprisonment; Wu Shishen and Four Others Sentenced for Treason

[Our Report] Wang Xiaohe, a standing director of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's industrial union, along with ten others, were accused of participating in the Communist Party. On March 30th of this year, they allegedly placed iron filings into the ground shaft of a converter, attempting to cause the machine to explode and create chaos. After investigation by the garrison command's special criminal court prosecutor, a public prosecution was filed. Following a trial by the court's judges, the verdict was announced yesterday as follows: Wang Xiaohe, for continuous incitement with the intent to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Wu Guozhen, for intending to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to death and deprived of civil rights for life. Zhang Shibao, for assisting with the intent to undermine suppression of rebellion and disturb public order (attempted), was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. Wu Shishen, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years. Tan A Si, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for two years. Chen Longgen and Shi Jingen, for participating in a group with the intention of destroying organizations and seizing national territory, were sentenced to one year of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for one year. Huang Hongxun was exempted from punishment. Shen Hongsheng is at large. Zhao Jingen awaits further secret handling.

The facts of the case: Wang Xiaohe and others had previously joined the Communist Party. On March 26th of this year, Wang Xiaohe, Huang Hongxun, Wu Shishen, Shen Hongsheng, and others secretly met for the first time at Wu Shishen's home. Wang proposed using bombs to destroy the power plant, but Huang Hongxun opposed it. Shen Hongsheng also argued that using violence to damage the generator might not garner public sympathy and advocated for a mass struggle approach. The meeting ended without a resolution. Later, Shen and Wang secretly agreed to use "AA" as a secret code. Eleven days later, Shen sent someone to Wang, instructing him to find a way to place iron filings to damage the Yangshupu power plant. Once the machine exploded and the electricity stopped, Shanghai would be plunged into darkness, causing workers to leave the factory and petition the government, creating a situation of terror. Wang first instructed Jiang Xinggen, a worker in the factory's shed department, to place the iron filings, but Jiang was too afraid to do so. He then ordered Wu Guozhen and Zhang Shibao, workers in the oil room, to do it. On March 30th of this year, Zhang Shibao found the iron filings and handed them to Wu Guozhen, who placed them in the ground shaft of converter numbers 2 and 3. On April 1st, around 1:00 PM, Wang Feiyun, an intern technician, inspected the machine and discovered the anomaly. He reported it to the factory's engineers, who managed to salvage and clean the machine. The defendants' conspiracy ultimately failed. Afterward, the garrison command learned of the situation and arrested the defendants one after another, transferring them to the special court for investigation and prosecution. The case was then transferred to the criminal court for trial, which has now concluded with the verdict as stated above.

### Eight Locations Raided in Gold and Foreign Exchange Profiteering Case; "One of the Four Kings," You Minsheng, Narrowly Escapes

[Our Report] The police bureau's detective brigade dispatched teams yesterday to raid nine establishments involved in the private exchange of Hong Kong currency and black market gold. However, You Minsheng, a well-known black market gold tycoon and manager of the Fusheng and Fuchang cigarette shops on Sichuan Middle Road, managed to escape after hearing about the raids. It is reported that You, along with Hu Xinyi and Shen Wenjie (who were arrested recently), and another person surnamed X (still at large), are known as the "Four Kings" of black market gold.

### Relevant Authorities Agree on Principles for Inspecting Private Warehouses

[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from the Municipal Assembly, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Garrison Command, and the Police Bureau yesterday morning to discuss the issue of inspecting "private warehouses." After deliberation, it was decided that "private warehouses" storing nine types of daily necessities exceeding three months' worth of business needs would be subject to inspection. The key points for implementing warehouse inspections, previously approved in principle by the Municipal Affairs Council, have been finalized by the Social Affairs Bureau and will be announced today. [Our Report] Warehouse inspections in this city are being conducted by five teams from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Gendarmerie Corps. After two days of inspections, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that due to the vast area and the mountainous stockpiles of goods, it was difficult to conduct a thorough inspection in a short time. He has mobilized representatives from all districts through the Civil Affairs Bureau and encouraged workers in civilian ships, steamships, docks, transportation, loading, and unloading to report large hoarders who break up their stocks to evade inspection. If verified, the hoarded goods will be auctioned off, and informers will receive 20% of the proceeds as a reward to encourage them.

### Grain Merchants Call on the Mayor to Request Instructions on Controlling Various Markets

[Our Report] Responsible persons from the rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oil cake markets in this city, as well as representatives from grain and oil merchants, numbering more than ten, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday morning to request instructions on how to control the various markets after the issuance of the large denomination banknotes. Mayor Wu immediately and earnestly advised that all industries should exercise self-restraint. Rumors of the issuance of large denomination banknotes have been circulating for a long time, and the prices of various commodities have already risen to their limits. Now that the large denomination banknotes are being issued as needed, commodity prices should not fluctuate further.

### Director of Social Affairs Bureau Urges All Industries to Exercise Self-Restraint on Commodity Prices

[Our Report] After the issuance of the large denomination banknotes, reporters interviewed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau regarding the impact and countermeasures for factories and commodity prices. He stated that he had summoned the responsible persons from the rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains markets to urge them to restrain commodity prices and refrain from arbitrary price increases. The amount of legal tender issued has reached a level of malignant inflation. From the perspective of factories, employers are struggling to pay huge wages, but the workers' earnings are not enough to make ends meet. Both sides are dissatisfied. However, in his opinion, low wages are still better than unemployment. Therefore, during this difficult time, labor and management should coordinate and understand each other in order to overcome this challenge.

### Social Affairs Bureau Issues Emergency Order Instructing Dyeing and Weaving Workers to Resume Work

[Our Report] The labor-management dispute in the dyeing and weaving industry in the Hudong district has not yet been resolved, and some workers continue to strike.

It is reported that for factories that delay wage payments by half a month, employers may accept the workers' demands to pay wages based on the cost of living index for the current month.

### Two Airline Companies May Receive Special Foreign Exchange to Purchase Fuel; Passenger Registration Difficult to Resume in the Short Term

[Our Report] Airfares have been approved by the Ministry of Communications for a 150% increase. However, passenger registration for the two airline companies is difficult to resume in the short term. The suspension of flights between Beijing and Shanghai and the reduction of flights will also continue for the time being, as fare adjustments are not a fundamental solution. Minister Yu in Beijing has discussed with Premier Weng the possibility of providing the civil aviation industry with a special allocation of foreign exchange to purchase gasoline, which may soon be realized. The adjusted fares from Shanghai to various locations are as follows: Beijing, 137,500,000 yuan; Chongqing, 182,800,000 yuan; Lanzhou, 197,000,000 yuan; Guangzhou, 187,900,000 yuan; Nanjing, 13,000,000 yuan; Hankou, 94,500,000 yuan; Hong Kong, 224,900,000 yuan.

### Names of Victims in Macau Plane Crash Gradually Revealed; Coca-Cola Manager Dies; Famous Clergyman and Family Perish

[Our Report] A "Catalina" aircraft of the Cathay Pacific Airways flying from Macau to Hong Kong crashed into the sea shortly after taking off from Macau on the 17th due to an engine explosion. Among the 26 passengers, only one, Huang Yaomin, was rescued. It has now been learned that among the deceased passengers, after identifying the bodies recovered, it was discovered that Wu Shouwen, the Shanghai China Manager of the American Coca-Cola Company, and Nelson, the head of the Lutheran Church China Relief Association, who had been in China for many years, were also among them. Mr. Wu had worked for Coca-Cola for more than ten years. Recently, his entire family had moved to Hong Kong. He had sold his house in Shanghai. He himself took his wife to Hong Kong to visit his seven sisters, who were all on summer vacation, and to investigate the Coca-Cola market in Macau to plan the company's sales network in South China. Unexpectedly, he encountered this tragic accident.

Mr. Nelson's trip was originally a vacation. His entire family went with him, including his wife, his sixteen-year-old eldest daughter, and his nine-year-old youngest son. The entire family perished together.

The body of Mr. Situ, the district manager of Texaco Oil Company, was found on the 17th and has been buried in Macau. Huang Yaomin, the only survivor of the accident, is recuperating in a Macau hospital. He stated that an engine exploded before the accident. Many fishing boats are still working to recover bodies.

### High Court Orders Retrial of Two Defendants in Embezzlement Case Involving Administrative Relief Personnel; Hou Aichang Forcefully Denies House Was a Gift; Jiang Renlin Defends That Reserve Funds Were Once Short

[Our Report] In the case of senior Administrative Relief personnel accused of group embezzlement, the District Court's initial trial sentenced Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin to three years of imprisonment each. The remaining defendants, Dong Chengdao and others, were acquitted or had their cases dismissed. Hou and Jiang were dissatisfied and requested a retrial. After review by the High Court, the parts of Hou Aichang's case related to electric fans and cotton were approved, and the court deemed that the judgment regarding the house donation was erroneous, and ordered a retrial by the District Court.

Yesterday morning, the District Court, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu, heard the case. In addition to summoning the two defendants, Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin, witnesses Wu Zhiwei and Deng Zhonghe were also summoned to testify. Hou stated in his defense: "Since I began handling the allocation of materials, I have only sold 710,000 pounds of wool. Apart from Zhongfang, Anle and Zhanghua received equal allocations. However, Zhanghua only represented a small portion. In the third allocation, Zhanghua gave up their share because the wool was coarse and unsuitable. At the same time, Anle's equipment and production volume were better, so their needs were greater. As for the house issue, the prosecutor's claim that it was a gift from Deng is not supported by evidence. They also did not consider the evidence I presented. Deng was a sub-landlord and could not give someone else's house away. Later, because there was no lease agreement, I wrote a letter to replace the lease." Witness Deng Zhonghe testified: "I have a close relationship with Wu Zhiwei, so I let him live in the house on Yuyuan Road. The rent was calculated in US dollars per month. The prosecutor's claim that I gave the house to Hou Aichang is biased." Regarding the wool allocation, he stated that Anle's production volume was eight to ten times greater than that of Huazhang. The wool used was coarse wool, but the business actually lost money, so there was no commission. Hou's brother-in-law, Wu Zhiwei, then testified regarding the house issue. Defendant Jiang Renlin then stated: "The reserve funds for managing welfare affairs were specifically used for inland visitors staying in hotels. I was in charge of these funds. Because they were temporary advances, I did not need to seek approval from superiors. Later, when the accounts were checked, there was no shortage. There was even a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan. When dealing with welfare affairs, it is inevitable to offend people." The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Garrison Command's Investigation Department Ceases Economic Inspection Work; Unfinished Matters Submitted to Relevant Authorities for Handling

The Songhu Garrison Command previously assisted government authorities in implementing measures to suppress commodity prices, as the soaring prices in this city posed a threat to public order. It is now learned that the central government will establish an agency to manage the city's economy. The Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus are responsible for routine management. Military agencies' handling of price controls was originally a temporary measure. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Garrison Command specifically stated that the government has other means to manage the city's economy. The Command will only collect economic intelligence. All other work will be handled by the relevant authorities, and the Command will no longer carry it out. The Investigation Department has been ordered to cease economic inspection activities immediately. Unfinished matters will be organized and submitted to the relevant authorities for handling. Proposes Further In-Depth Discussion

Legislator Xi Yushu, taking leave due to the passing of his mother, is in Shanghai and unable to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting in Beijing. He has submitted written suggestions regarding the temporary property tax issue: (1) Do not make a formal decision during this session.

(2) Submit the current draft to the government for referral to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with relevant departments, to jointly compile a budget for the property tax based on the regulations. It is also necessary to study the following key issues. (A) The possible amount that can be collected. (B) The timeframe within which the full amount can be collected. (C) Whether there are obstacles to collecting taxes on Chinese citizens' property abroad and foreigners' property within China. (D) How much the tax revenue would actually contribute to balancing the budget. Submit these findings to the Legislative Yuan for reference before the session resumes to provide a basis for discussion.

Mr. Tang Bochang, a reader of this newspaper, recently celebrated his sixtieth birthday. Friends and relatives sent congratulatory gifts. Mr. Tang, realizing the difficult times, did not want to engage in excessive celebrations.

### Eight Major Public Utilities Face Losses of Over One Trillion This Month; Authorities Are Currently Studying Methods to Maintain Operations; Monthly Fees May Be Adjusted Twice in the Future

The eight major public utility companies in this city, including the British Shanghai Waterworks, Shanghai Electric Power, Shanghai Telephone, British Tramway, French Water and Electricity, Gas, Shangchuan and Shangnan Railways, and the Municipal Ferry, are now facing a serious crisis. Company representatives have stated that they are on the verge of collapse in the short term. There are two reasons for this: (1) The implementation of the new foreign exchange policy from July 1st; (2) The publication of the cost of living index every half month. With commodity prices soaring, the total shortfalls for all companies this month are over one trillion yuan, with the French Yongdian Company having the largest deficit, exceeding 600 billion yuan. After the release of the index for the first half of the month, which showed an increase of over 90%, the companies used funds originally intended for purchasing materials to pay wages, making it impossible to purchase materials. The public utility companies jointly submitted a written request to the Public Utilities Bureau for assistance the day before yesterday. Director Zhao summoned representatives of the French Water and Electricity Company for talks at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon. It was decided to report the situation to Mayor Wu and seek a loan from the Central Bank to alleviate the immediate crisis. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao are currently studying fundamental solutions for the coming month, which may include: (1) Adjusting prices twice a month. (2) Collecting a certain amount in advance from major users at the beginning of the month, with a final settlement to be made later.

### Fare Evasion Reaches 50 Percent

[Our Report] The Public Transportation Company's gasoline quota for July has been reduced by another 20 gallons per vehicle, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the operation of each route. According to Mr. Wang Zongshan, the head of the Traffic Group of the company, since routes 7 and 2A were suspended, the company has faced criticism from various sectors. However, the company also has its own difficulties. If the gasoline problem cannot be resolved, not only will these two routes be unable to resume service, but other routes will also consider reducing the number of vehicles or suspending service altogether. The company's peak operation involved 245 vehicles on all routes, but this number has now been reduced to 212 vehicles. As for fare evasion by military personnel, it has not only not decreased but is increasing daily. According to recent observations and statistics, fare evasion accounts for more than 50% of the total ridership.

### News Media Workers Encounter Difficulties in Purchasing Special Ration Rice

[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee grants special rationed rice to news media workers. Starting this month, special ration certificates have been issued, stipulating that recipients can purchase rice from any grain ration store within the district specified on their family ration book. However, some rice stores in various districts have refused to sell the rice. These stores may not be aware of the regulations, misunderstand the meaning of special rationed rice, or even intentionally create difficulties. The affected news media workers are frustrated and hope that the Civil Food Allocation Committee authorities will investigate and implement effective improvements as soon as possible.

Upon hearing the news, a reporter from this newspaper personally went to the Shentaijiu Rice Store, No. 30, East End, Luzhouan District, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Zhongzheng South Road, at 1:40 PM yesterday afternoon, carrying a special ration certificate along with his family ration book to purchase rice. As expected, the store refused to sell the rice, claiming that they had "not received notification." Despite the reporter's gentle explanation, it was ineffective. The store refused to call the Civil Food Allocation Committee for clarification. After more than half an hour of negotiation, the store finally agreed to send an apprentice to the Xieda Rice Store on Chengdu South Road to inquire. Xieda said that "it could be sold," but the Shentaijiu Rice Store still refused to sell the reporter the special rationed rice, despite the complete paperwork. Similar situations have reportedly occurred in the Songshan, North Station, Jing'an Temple, Putuo, and Changshu districts.

### Five Fugitives from Songjiang Arrested One After Another in Shanghai

[Our Report] The Songjiang County Police Bureau sent a document to Shanghai Police Bureau on the 18th, requesting assistance in arresting a group of fugitive criminals.

### From Emperor Taizong of Tang to the Flower and Tree Industry: Establishing the 12th of Each Month as a Gathering Day Based on a Myth; Zhou Zhi, a Veteran of the 1911 Revolution, "Leading All Flowers"

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Legend has it that Emperor Taizong Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty was extremely fond of flowers. On the 12th of the second lunar month, a date associated with Yin energy, he "ordered" all flowers to bloom. As a result, they blossomed as he wished. Empress Wu Zetian also "commanded" it once, but while all the other flowers bloomed, only the peony refused. Therefore, it was banished to Luoyang. It is said that the peonies in any other place are not as good as those in Luoyang, though no one can say why. The flower and tree industry has designated the 12th of the second lunar month as the birthday of the flower deity. Aside from explaining this through the aforementioned myth, there is no other "historical basis" for it. This year, the Flower and Tree Industry Association of this city held a grand temple fair for the flower deity, who had been sheltered in western Shanghai during the war against Japan. The deity was brought back to the association's old location on Liyuan Road in Xiejiao. Every year on this day, there is a grand sacrificial ceremony. However, to facilitate communication among association members, it is now stipulated that gatherings be held on the 12th of each lunar month. Members burn incense before the flower deity while also discussing association affairs. The day before yesterday was the 12th of the lunar month, and the reporter happened to attend the meeting, collecting a great deal of interesting information from many of the association's leaders.

Gardening for Forty Years

Huang Yueyuan, the chairman of the association, can be considered a giant in the flower and tree industry. A veteran of the 1911 Revolution, he has devoted himself to the study of flower and tree gardening for nearly forty years. Huang Yuan on Kangping Road in this city is the result of his hard work, filled with rare and precious plants. In addition, he has a large garden in Zhenru covering over three hundred acres. He admits that the value of the flowers and trees alone is inestimable today.

Regarding roses alone, his garden has over eighty varieties, totaling more than two thousand plants. He even managed to obtain six plants of the newest 1948 rose variety, bred in the United States the year before last, competed for last year, and sold this year. He achieved this by having his child bring a carpet to his American friend while studying in the United States. He has now propagated them to eighteen plants. Each plant is currently worth about five US dollars. Other common varieties also sell for thirty to fifty cents. The value of these flowers, which come in purple, yellow, bright red, vermillion, and other colors, with beautiful shapes and pleasant fragrances, and which are highly favored by foreigners, is enough to leave us speechless. Good rose varieties are often named after world celebrities by Americans, including Roosevelt, Truman, and even Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the First Lady of China, totaling more than a dozen. Huang's garden has managed to collect every single one of them, making them even more precious.

Producing Many Floral Masters

There is also the rare black and yellow peony. Because it was previously open to the public for viewing, it was stolen completely. Now, Huang has hidden it away in a secret room and is reluctant to show it to anyone. Other potted plants include the so-called "Twelve Golden Hairpins" and "Five Great Pines." To those who are addicted to flowers, seeing good flowers and trees can make them forget to eat and sleep. Living among them is like being surrounded by books, a joy that others can never experience.

Among the trees, the most precious is the "Eight Great Camellias": pine, snow, boxthorn, plum, winter jasmine, yellow jasmine, euonymus, and cypress. Among them, the pine category includes the northern Chinese *Pinus bungeana* (white bark pine) and the Japanese five-needle pine. The cypress category includes *Chamaecyparis obtusa* and *Juniperus chinensis*. A *Juniperus chinensis* three *zhang* tall is worth fifteen taels of gold. Huang has a five-hundred-year-old *Chamaecyparis obtusa* that he says he has cultivated for over forty years and would not sell for any amount of gold. In order to arrange the flowers and trees in a pleasing and beautiful way, many famous floral masters have emerged. The Japanese have done a lot of research in this field. It is said that the flower arrangement in the Great World entertainment center in the early years of the Republic of China was done by the Japanese. There are still such talents in Shanghai today!

A Flower Basket Costs Tens of Millions

Regarding the source of flowers for street vendors and the city's 117 flower shops, they are traded at the association every day. The more valuable flowers from the Caohejing area in the southern suburbs and the herbaceous flowers from the Caojia Garden area in the northern suburbs are transported to the association by flower farmers before four o'clock every morning and sold freely to members until six o'clock. There is also a transaction around four o'clock in the afternoon. When there are festive occasions, the liveliness here is beyond description. Although flower farmers try to raise prices, sales are still brisk. Currently, the most common flowers are freesias, lotuses, carnations, and tuberoses. Outsiders cannot tell the difference between good and bad, but their asking prices can vary by four to five hundred thousand yuan per dozen. When the flowers reach the stalls and flower shops, their value increases again. The Changchun, Yuquan, Huamei, and Xiahui flower shops on Lin Sen Middle Road are the largest in the city. The price of a flower basket can range from one million to tens of millions, but only foreigners can afford such high prices.

Writing this, I am reminded of something. Huang Yueyuan told the reporter: He has many camellias in his garden, but their tender branches are always eaten by many rough-colored small insects. He has experimented for over thirty years and used various medicines without success. He now wants to solicit "secret tips." Whoever can contribute a truly effective method of eliminating the insects will receive one hundred million yuan in legal tender as a reward.

### Domestic Film Companies Jointly Request to Settle Foreign Exchange Monthly for Purchasing Film Stock

[Report from this newspaper] Domestic film producers in this city have recently experienced difficulties in importing film stock. They have jointly requested the government to approve a monthly foreign exchange allocation of US$60,000 to purchase film stock from abroad and to ease restrictions on the import of film production equipment. Their petition states the following reasons: Domestic films have a market in Southeast Asia, so the foreign exchange paid for purchasing film stock can still be recovered from Southeast Asia and even far exceed the amount spent. For example, in February and March, the government provided foreign exchange of over HK$70,000 to purchase film stock, while the foreign exchange recovered by the film industry from the Southeast Asian market exceeded HK$160,000. In addition, 30% of the government's entertainment tax revenue comes from domestic films, and films also have educational value. Therefore, the film industry's foreign exchange purchases should be given special treatment.

### Delayed Parole Due to Official Procedures: Prisoner Released After Serving Full Term; Submits Petition to the City Council

Shen Junping, a prisoner recently released after serving his full term, submitted a petition yesterday to the Human Rights Protection Committee of the City Council, urging the simplification of official procedures so that paroled prisoners can have the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves sooner. According to him, among the more than fifty prisoners in Shanghai Prison who have been approved for parole this year, only three have been released before the end of their sentence after approval by the Ministry of Judicial Administration due to slow official procedures. Last winter, two months before the end of his sentence, he and twenty-six other prisoners were approved by the prison affairs meeting to be included in the first batch of parole candidates. The prison authorities submitted a document to the High Court in January to be forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval. It was not until March 7 that the Ministry order was received, approving the parole of Zhang and two others. During the parole ceremony, it was learned that Zhang and the two others had received special favor as a result of the High Court selecting them from the list of twenty-six and submitting their names to the Ministry in advance. The remaining prisoners, due to the "miracle" of official procedures, are still longing for the grace of parole, which remains as elusive as a reflection in a mirror.

### Rainfall Breaks Records: Midsummer Like Early Autumn

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, due to the continental high-pressure system covering the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the temperature in this city has dropped sharply. The average daily temperature is only around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is significantly lower than the average temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit in mid-July last year. Therefore, although it is still midsummer, mornings and evenings are already like early autumn. The clear west wind is refreshing and quite cool on the face. Furthermore, the amount of rainfall in this city in the past month is also likely to break historical records. In June, only the last ten days saw 119.7 millimeters of rainfall, while the highest total rainfall for the entire month of June in history was no more than 183.1 millimeters. In July, as of the 15th, 123.0 millimeters of rainfall has already fallen, while the highest total rainfall for the entire month of July in history was only 148.0 millimeters. According to the weather forecast, there will still be intermittent heavy rain in this city within the week, so it is almost certain that the rainfall for this month will exceed historical records. Due to excessive rainfall, the arrival of the cold southern air currents has been slower, and the climate has become abnormal as a result. The consequences will affect the expected harvest of crops. Yesterday's temperature: minimum 23.2 degrees Celsius (73.7 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 28.7 degrees Celsius (83.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

Unexpectedly, with a loud bang, it immediately exploded, and iron fragments flew everywhere, injuring Fang's lower jaw, chest, and other areas. An apprentice, Zhao Cailin (15 years old, from Changshu), was also injured in the head. Both were taken to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the old copper tube was actually an anti-aircraft shell, and Fang Xuebao did not recognize the object, causing the disaster.

### Peng E, the "Tiger General" of Siping, Who Emerged from the Barrage of Bullets with his Life

— Yang Yiming, Reporter from this Newspaper

[Suzhou, 18th of this Month] I remember back in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, Xie Jinyuan, regimental adjutant, and Yang Ruifu, battalion commander, of the 524th Regiment of the 262nd Brigade of the 88th Division, led eight hundred brave soldiers to hold steadfastly to the Sihang Warehouse, covering the retreat of the main force. These awe-inspiring, tear-jerking soldiers of the Sihang Lone Army were renowned throughout the world and almost became legendary heroes. This spirit of bravery, skillful fighting, and disregard for death has been fully preserved and expanded by General Peng E, the successor to the regimental commander, enabling the prestigious 88th Division to fully display its traditional glory when Peng rose to the rank of division commander and defended Siping.

Numerous Military Achievements

Han Xianyuan, commander of the 524th Regiment, soon died in action in the battle of Huatai in Nanjing. His successor was General Peng. Starting in the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, 1938], he fought along the Longhai Railway, on the outskirts of Wuhan, and in various locations in southeastern Shanxi, rising through the ranks to become the commander of the 87th Division due to his military merits. During the counteroffensive in the 33rd year [of the Republic, 1944], Peng led his brave soldiers on an expedition to Yunnan and Burma, fully demonstrating the fighting power of the Chinese Army. He was praised by the supreme leader for his contribution to the capture of Mangshi and Ruili.

After the victory, Peng was appointed as the surrender commissioner and garrison commander of the Nantong and Haimen areas in northern Jiangsu. He properly handled the surrender of prisoners and the suppression of bandits. Soon, he was transferred to the Northeast, recovering Bamiencheng and Liaoyang, Tongliao, and other places. In May of the 36th year [of the Republic, 1947], Peng was transferred to his original position as commander of the 88th Division, stationed in Siping. Before long, the communist bandits attacked, and he led his troops in a bitter battle for forty-two days, directing the battle with blood-soaked wounds to his leg and back, finally repelling the stubborn bandits. This time, Peng gained full practical experience regarding the geographical situation of Siping and the conditions for attack and defense, which was the main reason why he was able to successfully lead his troops in breaking through the encirclement after completing his mission in the second defense of Siping.

Fighting Alone

In February of this spring, the communist bandits gathered six columns, five independent divisions, and one artillery brigade, possessing new weapons such as heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks. They launched another frenzied offensive in the Northeast, first capturing Kaiyuan and gradually completing the encirclement of Siping. At this time, Peng led his troops to garrison Siping, ordered to hold firm in order to cover the assembly and southward retreat of the Jilin-Changchun army and ensure the overall situation in the Northeast. He led only two infantry regiments of his command to meet the enemy bandits, who were fifteen times more numerous. They fought valiantly, making the bandits pay the highest price for every inch of land.

However, after the mission was accomplished, the lone army was already in the midst of heavy encirclement, and the original plan to evacuate by air had become a bubble. On February 29, the communist bandits began their general offensive on Siping, with dozens of heavy artillery pieces bombarding the city in turns, and using tanks to cover the charge. The battle was extremely fierce. The bandits infiltrated and broke through everywhere, like a flood. By March 13, all strongholds had fallen into the hands of the bandits, and the city was a sea of fire. News of the Siping lone army, which everyone was concerned about, was cut off.

Successful Breakthrough

On March 15, the bandits broadcast their war results to the world, saying that the Siping garrison had been completely annihilated and the defending general, Peng E, had been killed in action. This news could certainly confuse or mislead at the time. Peng's friends in Shenyang had already begun preparing to hold a memorial service for Peng. Suddenly, shocking news arrived: Peng had actually led his troops through the bandits' two hundred and forty *li* multi-layered encirclement and broken through! This cannot but be called a miracle. Peng and Deputy Division Commander Huang Wenhui, with only nineteen guards left at their side, arrived in Tieling on the evening of the 16th, truly surviving nine deaths to find one life, exhausted and on the verge of collapse. Subsequently, the brave soldiers who escorted the breakthrough arrived one after another, and the total number of officers and soldiers who broke through actually amounted to more than 1,300.

Leg Wounded

This news drove Shenyang into a frenzy. The memorial service being prepared was immediately changed to a welcome ceremony. The Shenyang, Changchun, Tianjin, and other newspapers all reported on this event like a myth, praising Peng as the "Tiger General of Siping." Not long after, Peng was summoned to Nanjing because his leg was wounded by shrapnel, and he was hospitalized for treatment. Peng is a native of Hunan, 38 years old, and a graduate of the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. He has a sturdy body and abundant energy. Although the injury to his leg soon healed, he still walks with a slight limp.

On the 5th of this month, Peng was assigned to Suzhou to take over as the commander of the Youth Army's 202nd Division. After the initial deployment was completed, he hosted various sectors of society and put forward the slogan "To Love the People, One Must First Protect the People." The 202nd Division was originally a well-established new army. Now, under the leadership of this vigorous young general, it is bound to have even more heroic and greater achievements.

### Golden Leopards Appear in Wushan Township, Fenghua

[Report from this newspaper, Ningbo, 19th] In the Lujia Dun area of Wushan Township, Fenghua, groups of golden leopards have been discovered for days, scurrying around nearby villages and devouring livestock. Villagers are panicking and forming hunting parties to kill them.

### Wang Lingji Plans to Not Confer Titles on Local Chieftains for the Time Being

[Report from this newspaper, Chongqing, 18th] Regarding the titles of Su Yonghe and Suo Guanhuan, the two headmen in western Sichuan's Li County, Zhu Shaoliang had instructed Wang Lingji to handle them carefully. Wang has now reported that in addition to Su Yonghe, there are other powerful headmen in the county, including the Zhuokeji chieftain, Suo Guanhuan, and Gong Gao Yangping, the headman of Heishui. If only Su were given a title at this time, then Suo and Gong, who are evenly matched with Su, would not yield to each other. Not only would they not be willing to accept his restraint, but they would also compete for dominance, causing feuds to deepen and disturbances to increase. Although the situation of suppressing the rebellion is currently tense, the province is still peaceful, and it is not easy for the communists to cross the border and use the border people to cause trouble. There is no need to eagerly confer titles on the border people, which would create complications.

### Quzhou Daily Actively Preparing for Publication

[Report from this newspaper, Quzhou, 17th] In order to cooperate with the needs of the [current political situation] and promote cultural undertakings, the Shanghai Reconstruction Publishing House, at the request of Director Tang of the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters, has come to Quzhou to establish the Quzhou Daily. It will be published in broadsheet format and is scheduled to be published on August 1. A large amount of printing equipment and a radio station have been brought to Quzhou and are being actively assembled.

### Residents' Representatives in Each District of Changsha Launch Temporary Rent Reduction Movement

[Report from this newspaper, Changsha, 19th] Rents in Changsha are calculated in rice. The municipal government's method of reducing rents was vetoed by the Municipal Council and could not be implemented. The temporary method of paying rent at 70% of the original amount has also largely failed to be implemented, and citizens are dissatisfied with this situation. On the 18th, residents' representatives from each district convened a meeting to organize a liaison association and launched a temporary rent reduction movement. They also harshly criticized the Municipal Council and will convene a residents' congress at the necessary time to exercise the right of recall.

### Blood Stains the Huai River

— Wei Ming

[Wuhu News] The summer sun arrogantly displays its might. The wheat is golden, and the farmers diligently harvest in the wheat fields, their dark faces revealing smiles. Indeed, months of hard work will determine their food and clothing for the second half of the year. However, the communist bandits on the other side of the river also covet these necessities of life. They have no sympathy or pity, especially since they barely managed to escape from Huaibei during the spring offensive and are now eager to launch another "robbery."

Dream of Grabbing Grain

The 34th Brigade of the 12th Column of the Communist East China Field Army was defeated by the elite Qingshen troops from Guangdong during their incursions in Huainan in March and April of this year. Senior communist cadres were either killed or captured, and even Brigade Commander Liao Chengmei went missing. As a result, they had to retreat to their old base in Qingyang for reorganization. However, just over two months later, threatened by food shortages, the communist chieftains pressured the ignorant masses to return to a battlefield with no hope of victory.

Of course, the communists' aim in crossing the river this time was to seize grain. On June 27th, they set out from Qingyang with a regiment's worth of strength. On July 1st, they stealthily crossed the Huai River, taking advantage of our troops being scattered to protect the people harvesting their crops, to launch a surprise attack on a village called Zhouji in Nanshan Riverbank of Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, north of Maba, south of Qianyang Village, also known as Houliang Village. They had determined that we had only a company stationed near Qianhouliang Village, and only four rifles in the self-defense team at the township government more than ten miles away. So, they first eliminated the self-defense team. At the same time, another group of bandits prepared to ambush our reinforcements, while the majority of their forces split into six groups to attack our company led by Commander Chen. The communists were determined to succeed. At about 1:00 AM, they began with a concentrated barrage of dozens of rocket and mortar shells, followed by an all-out assault from all directions. Fortunately, Commander Chen had foreseen this and made preparations. In addition to sending teams during the day to protect and assist with the harvest, he had repaired fortifications overnight and dug communication trenches between each shelter, enough to cope with a sudden attack.

The first to bear the brunt was Squad Leader X's squad on the left flank. Because they came like an overwhelming wave, the entire squad heroically sacrificed themselves in the battle.

As a result, the communist forces gradually approached, heavily besieging Qianhouliang Village, indicating that the bandits had used all their forces. The fighting between the two sides became more intense. First, Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Wei Guiting was wounded, and Commander Chen Shaoxian personally went to command. The fire of hatred burned in the hearts of every man. At this time, more than twenty of our brothers were injured, and most of the company's ammunition was depleted. The sky was still dark, and the bandits fired incendiary bombs with rocket launchers, burning our positions. The flames lit up half the sky, and the moon hid in the layers of clouds as if weeping.

Intense Fire Net

The bandits launched a more fierce attack. However, every inch of advance came at a huge cost. Explosions rumbled continuously, interspersed with painful cries, weaving together a most tragic lament. Our soldiers fought back even more alertly and calmly. Four hours had passed, and the tense emotions made every soldier forget their fatigue. When the bandits launched their fifth attack, the casualties increased. However, they still struggled desperately. The two sides simply fought with hand grenades. Our Platoon Leader Liu Zhengzhong was killed in action, and Platoon Leader Li Jiasheng was wounded. Commander Chen Shaoxian was also gloriously wounded in both hands. However, our fighting will became even more determined. The shameless bandits shouted outside in a contemptuous manner, "Surrender!" Several brothers casually replied, "Okay! Come and get it!" (All answers were in Cantonese). When the bandits approached the bunker, a few loud explosions sent them to their satisfying end. Thus, the remaining bandits, seeing the strength of our position, predicted that the intelligence was inaccurate and there must be more than a company of men.

Just as the morning light dawned, the bandits ultimately failed. So, they made a desperate attempt at a sixth offensive, which was also the final and most violent charge. Our reinforcements arrived from both sides, which was beyond the bandits' expectations. Although the bandits had deployed troops in advance to ambush our reinforcements on the road, Major General Lei Xiumin of our Qingshen troops had predicted the enemy's movements like a god and instructed a battalion sent to reinforce to march on a small road. This allowed them to arrive in time without obstruction and encircle the bandits.

When they realized the danger of being surrounded, it was as if a flying general had descended from the sky. Only then did they flee in panic. However, a spring dream was nothing but empty. The bandits abandoned more than 250 corpses near Qianhouliang Village. We captured more than 30 communist officers and seized a large number of weapons. There were also six bandit boats sunk by us while crossing the river, with no fewer than a hundred people buried in the belly of the fish. In total, in this battle, the communist army suffered another serious blow.

Visiting Major General Lei

The summer breeze brought news of the victory, awakening the spirit of the entire Huainan people. The people of Huainan rejoiced, and gentry, students, merchants, etc., all rushed to comfort the wounded soldiers.

After receiving the news of the victory, the reporter immediately ran to the headquarters to visit Major General Lei. He still came out to meet me with his usual amiable and approachable manner. He seemed a bit tired, which showed that while the soldiers at the front lines were fighting hard last night, this diligent general was always strategizing and directing the battle.

Then, Major General Lei objectively analyzed the factors of victory in this battle. He said, "This time, we won with fewer troops because Company Commander Chen was intelligent, brave, and had made preparations early on, and the fortifications were well-built. Secondly, the command was appropriate, and the reinforcements obeyed orders, sneaking in from a small road, catching the enemy by surprise. But the most important determining factor was still the devotion of the officers and soldiers. All the officers and soldiers had unwavering faith and were determined to sacrifice their lives for righteousness. This should be credited to our Chief of Staff and Director Qiu of the Political Work Office." And immediately introduced me to Deputy Clan Leader Li, Chief of Staff Liang, and Director Qiu, all three of whom were very amiable and spoke very politely, especially to their leader - Major General Lei - and their guests. They were so sincere and respectful that it felt like being in a harmonious big family. Talking about Platoon Leader Liu Zhengzhong, who died in this battle, he was from Xingning, Guangdong, and graduated from the 153rd Brigade Sergeant Team. He was usually very kind to people and patiently taught the brothers. In battle, he always led by example, making our brothers have to admire him and follow him more bravely. Who wouldn't be saddened by his sacrifice?

We walked home with joy and light steps. The soft sunset shone on the Huai River, brilliantly reflecting golden light.

### Siamese Twins from Jiangxi Exhibited in England, America, Germany, France, and Other Countries at the Age of Nine with Their Father; Refused Surgery by Doctors in the United States

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Nanchang Dispatch, 16th] Liu Shengjie and Liu Shengdi, the "Siamese twins" from Jiangxi, are strange yet real figures. Both are male, with their ancestral home in Tangjiangwei, Nankang County, Jiangxi, and are currently sixty-two years old. When this reporter was a young elementary school student, I saw them walking down the street in Tangjiang, arms linked. Sometimes, when they disagreed, they would fight each other, and their only weapon was to scratch each other's faces. So, their faces were sometimes injured, with green and purple marks. However, after a while, they would reconcile as before. The only connection between them is a fist-sized lump of flesh in the rib area, which can sometimes stretch to a distance of about an inch, but this is not a common occurrence. After they were born from their mother's womb, their mother tried to separate the twins with thread, but the blood stopped flowing, and they were on the verge of death. At the age of nine, their father took them abroad, where they were exhibited in countries such as England, America, Germany, France, and Italy, and participated in the Panama Exposition, where they received honorable awards and pounds sterling.

In the United States, a doctor once offered a million US dollars for them to undergo surgery for scientific research. However, at that time, a pair of "conjoined male and female wonders" had died due to surgery, which scared them. So, they resolutely refused the American doctor's request.

At the age of nineteen, they returned to China with their father and a translator. During the journey, they learned to speak fluent English, but they could only speak and not write, probably due to the hindrance of being twins and lack of practice.

After returning to China, they went to major cities in the country, such as Beiping, Hankou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Later, they settled in their hometown, Tangjiangwei. During this prime of their youth, they gambled and worked in their hometown.

Now, their parents have both passed away, and they have two "single" younger brothers who work as farmers.

Regarding their lives - diet, daily life, and marriage - are also strange events of strange people. For example, in terms of diet, as long as one person drinks alcohol, the other will also get drunk. Also, if they drink a large amount of tea, both will urinate a considerable amount at the same time. However, if one person eats, they cannot both be full at the same time. And the hand gestures they use when eating are also different. One uses his natural right hand, while the one on the left uses his left hand in the opposite way. Each uses their left or right hand to support the bowl. When speaking, they can answer each other separately and have no empathy. If one gets sick, both feel unwell and sleep in the same bed. However, taking medicine is not necessarily one dose each. The final hurdle in the future—death—what will happen? Asking them has no answer. If one of them dies from illness, and the other cannot die at the same time, what should be done? So, some people joke: since they were born together, they will also die together and should be in the same coffin.

In the process of their lives, there is also an interesting period of sexual life. They each married two wives. Every night, six people slept in the same bed and had their own "interesting dreams." Now, each only has one wife, and both have children. Liu Shengjie's son is in his twenties, and his daughter is in her teens. Liu Shengdi only has one son, who is seventeen years old this year. They are all farming at home.

Now, they are exhibiting in Nanchang for a ticket income of 150,000 yuan, and plan to go to Shanghai to satisfy the public's view, using the strange phenomenon of physiology as a way of life. This is one of the strange things in the world today.

### Financial Products Stimulated After the Issuance of Large Denomination Customs Gold Units; Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Down, Food and Daily Necessities Skyrocket; Tightening of Credit in the Afternoon Causes Slight Price Decrease

[Our News] The Central Bank issued large-denomination Customs Gold Units (CGUs) yesterday, including denominations of 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000. The 250,000 CGU notes are still being printed, and their issuance is pending. As of yesterday, the number of large-denomination notes circulating in the market was not large, and they were rarely seen even in banking circles. However, the news of the issuance of large-denomination notes has given considerable stimulation to the financial and commodity markets. In the morning, eight Chinese stocks, including Yong Yarn and Xinhe, hit their limit up. The price of white rice soared by 20%, breaking through the 40 million mark, with the highest retail price reaching 44 million. The prices of other miscellaneous grains also skyrocketed. The yarn and flour markets, due to the Mayor's verbal instructions that the increase should not exceed 3%, were immediately suspended. Looking at the price situation in the market yesterday, prices rose sharply in the morning due to confusion, but fell back in the afternoon due to tight credit. The market interest rate was as high as 75%, but due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, the large discount on commercial paper has disappeared.

The retail prices of daily necessities rose sharply due to panic buying by citizens, averaging about 30% higher than the previous day. Soap rose the most. For example, Huangxiangmao soap rose from 400,000 to 600,000 per bar, an increase of about 50%. The second highest was cigarettes, which rose by about 40%. By evening, there were signs of decline due to the tightening of credit. Qualified persons speculated that the National Bank will sell a large amount of materials and tighten credit in the next few days. Yesterday, the Yarn Control Committee decided to sell 5,000 bales of yarn, ordering Fangjian to temporarily list them for allocation, in order to achieve the effect of cooperation. Half of the high prices in the market yesterday were caused by psychological factors, and prices will fall back within a few days. However, the retail prices of some merchants have deviated from the controlled market prices and are likely to maintain an upward trend.

### Rice Prices Skyrocket; White Rice Once Broke the 40 Million Mark

Due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, the rice market was volatile, and owners took the opportunity to raise prices. In the early market, white rice was as high as 40 million, and Gao thin rice was as high as 41 million, an increase of about 5-6 million yuan. Later, due to the news that the prices of other goods in the industry did not rise much, the market turned soft, and the closing price fell back by 2 million yuan. The closing price of white rice was 38 million, and the closing price of thin rice was 39 million, an increase of about 4 million yuan. However, the market quotations only showed an increase of 1-1.5 million because the authorities limited the increase to 3%. The amount of goods arriving at the north and south markets was only 1,958 shi.

The authorities strictly instructed that flour should not be increased in price due to the issuance of large-denomination notes, causing transactions to be suspended. Midway, the flour mills jointly supplied 7,540 bags of various brands of flour at a price of 11.48 million (including a donation of 20,000), 29 bags per household. Other transactions were not officially opened. Outside the market, the dark price of Lao Che flour reached 13.5 million, and Bingchuan 13 million, but the transactions were very rare, and the later market was also weak. Wheat bran was quoted at 8.5 million. The prices of wheat were not agreed upon by both sides, so there was no opening.

Miscellaneous grains saw that the issuance of large-denomination notes had become a reality, and the market was very firm. The early market could not be opened at all. The owners of soybeans negotiated prices themselves, with Zha beans at 19 million and Che beans at 20.6 million, and then opened at this price, an increase of 1.5 million. Corn had little inventory and was easy to raise, rising sharply by 20%. Red sorghum and mung beans both rose by 4-5 million, broad beans increased by 2-3 million, Yuan wheat did not trade much, and sesame and peanuts each rose by 5-6 million under the absorption of foreign merchants and the support of the owners.

The authorities ordered that edible oil should not fluctuate excessively and limited the increase to 3%. As a result, transactions were difficult to start. Later, Dayou Oil Factory supplied soybean oil to the street at a limited price of 79 million, but because it was not enough to distribute, it was cancelled. Later, each factory supplied soybean oil at a price of 80 million, with only a small amount available on the market. Zhongzhi Oil Factory supplied Chongqing Jingsheng vegetable oil at a price of 75 million. Jilong raw oil was traded at 100.5 million, and raw vegetable oil at 78 million. Cooked vegetable oil, etc., rose by 5-6 million. Soybean cakes rose sharply at first, once trading at 9.2 million, and then quickly retreated to 8.6 million, an increase of 5-600,000.

### Artificial Silk Initially High and Then Flat

The artificial silk market initially rose yesterday and then returned to flat. Jin Sanma of No. 120, at the opening in the morning, shouted a high price of 2.6 billion yuan, and retreated to 2.5 billion yuan to trade. Subsequently, due to the tightening of credit, the market became weak, and the price gradually declined. The spot price at noon fell to 2.33 billion yuan, and the next-day period shouted 2.47 billion yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, the price was 2.44 billion yuan. In the end, due to oversupply, the closing price fell to 2.3 billion yuan, resulting in no increase or decrease compared with the price on Saturday.

The price of factory-made silk yesterday was high at first and then low, and finally was 100 million yuan stronger than last Saturday. Gao scattered lots opened at 2.5 billion yuan in the morning, and spot payment was traded at 2.4 billion yuan. In the afternoon, it fell to 2.35 billion yuan, with a two-day period. Gao scattered lots in the morning had several lots open at 2 billion yuan, and the market also recovered slightly in the afternoon.

Silk

Yesterday's market fluctuated greatly, and the final result was a slight increase compared to Saturday. The opening price of real silk quilt covers in the morning was around 1.5 billion yuan, with the largest increase to 1.6 billion yuan, and there was a lack of supply. Subsequently, due to the low stock market and the slight recovery of raw materials, the market weakened, and finally fell to 1.4 billion yuan, and then further fell to 1.38 billion yuan in the afternoon. There were no transactions for the checkered crepe de chine, and the asking price was around 4.3 million yuan.

### Tea Market Shows Tightening Trend

The tea market yesterday continued the high prices of the previous week. After the opening, it appeared in a brisk manner. In the process of issuing large-denomination notes, everything rose. The tea industry also did not want to be outdone, and the asking price went straight to the sky. The trend entered a crazy stage. However, at the end, the situation turned slightly milder. Because credit was unprecedentedly tight and borrowing was difficult, the owners of the goods took the lead in spitting out the goods, showing that they were unable to rise again, but it still rose quite a lot compared to before.

### The Gold Control Bureau Sent Personnel to Strictly Investigate the Huge Amount of Notes of the Banks

[Our News] After the Central Bank announced the issuance of large-denomination Customs Gold Units, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, in order to prevent speculators from disrupting the financial market, specially sent a large number of personnel to the note exchange in the morning to check the development of large-denomination notes, and immediately questioned the account name and purpose of the notes at any time, in order to prevent them from engaging in speculative activities. At the same time, the Bureau paid close attention to the dynamics of bank deposits and loans.

### Cotton Spinning Industry Dissatisfied with New Policy on Selling Yarn

The Flower Yarn Cloth Management Committee, in conjunction with Fangjian Company, sold cotton yarn in the market of the Yarn Trade Association yesterday, in order to stabilize the yarn and cloth market in the midst of the issuance of large-denomination notes. This time, the price was clearly set, and the quantity was announced in advance, which was a special feature. On the one hand, Fangjian Company still allocated yarn according to the quotation and allocation method. The person in charge of the Yarn Control Committee once talked with the person in charge of the cotton spinning industry and the person in charge of the cotton trade, asking them to work together to stabilize the market. He also said that the quotation and allocation had always been dissatisfied by the replication industry, and that special corrections would be added. However, Pan Shihao of the replication industry raised his opinion on the spot. (1) The yarn market must enter the market with its entry certificate, and the number of certificate positions is limited, and the factory has not obtained it. (2) In the allocation of yarn in the market, the allocation number of Fangjian is still the basis. The allocation and sale of yarn by Fangjian is unfair and unpopular due to the loss of sorting. It is really inappropriate to be limited to the old rules this time. The Yarn Control Committee expressed its importance to this opinion, but said that there was no solution in the short term. According to Pan, the sales and management methods of yarn and cloth should be thoroughly improved in order to be fair, universal, and benefit the people. In Beijing, he exchanged opinions with President Weng of the Executive Yuan. A few days ago, he also responded to the invitation of Wang Lanseng, the chairman of the Yarn Control Committee, to discuss concrete plans.

### Large Denomination Notes Stimulate Buying; Chinese Stock Market is Encouraged

Although the Chinese stock market rose fiercely yesterday, it was difficult to sustain it. When the market opened, 11 stocks rose to the limit. Yong Yarn opened at a discount again. The authorities sold materials and tightened credit, and there was a small rebound after the market became brisk. The ending was tired.

In the early morning, stimulated by the large-denomination Customs Gold Units, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, and Huafeng sought to open high to the limit up. After the opening, Yong Yarn carried out discount transactions, with the highest reaching 500 yuan. However, No. 126 and No. 187 supplied at high prices, and the market began to rebound. However, No. 89, No. 213, and No. 154 maintained and repeatedly forced the limit up, but it was difficult to sustain. Credit tightened further, and No. 145 and No. 207 sold for 11,600 yuan, while No. 43, No. 131, No. 89, and No. 129 accepted, rising to 11,810 yuan. Fangjian changed its yarn allocation policy, and hung up the brand several times a day. No. 169 and No. 237 sold for 11,300 yuan, and No. 220 and No. 22 took advantage of the low to absorb, and the noon closing price was 11,400 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, Meilin Lian and Di rose to the limit, Guohuo Xinhua Hengfeng rose by 10%, Yonggong Matches Tongyi Huaxin were flat, Xinyi Jinglun Rongfeng slightly frustrated, and the rest rose slightly to not more than half.

In the later market, Yong Yarn opened at 11,700 yuan, and No. 126 and No. 160, etc., all came out. Miscellaneous brands were surprisingly soft, and immediately retreated to Tunjun 1,200 yuan. Although it was replenished by No. 169, No. 160, and No. 154, etc., and rose to 11,430 yuan, the market was still extremely unstable. Although there was no result in the exchange by the National Bank, it was still forced down by No. 137, No. 180, and so on. After circling, the closing price was 11,250 yuan. Compared with the morning, Meilin Yongye Lanhua was still suspended, Jinglun rose by half, Tongyi rose slightly, and the rest were slightly frustrated. In the off-market, the unlisted stocks were popular because Dasheng Wuzhou and the bank culture stocks rose by half, and the rest were still stable.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, the miscellaneous brands turned out to be excellent, but Tong Bing was forced by credit and saw a unique weakness, with a transaction of 2-3 million. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1.26 million, retreated from 1.28 million to 1.1 million, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with last Saturday, A and B rose by 20,000 yuan, C fell by 30,000 yuan, D rose by 40,000 yuan, and E rose by 60,000 yuan.

### National Bank to Establish Special Counters to Recover Small Denomination Notes

### Yarn Control Committee Cooperates with Tightening of Credit - Mass Sales of Cotton Yarn Yesterday - Also Stipulates Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method

[Our Report] To curb cotton yarn market prices and cooperate with the Central Bank's policy of tightening credit, the Yarn Control Committee has accepted the Bank's entrustment and began mass sales of cotton yarn yesterday. To meet the needs of the mass sales, it has separately stipulated eight articles of the "Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method." According to the implementation, all cotton yarn quotation sales originally held in the market will be temporarily suspended. However, the China Textile Construction Corporation will continue to distribute cotton yarn to the re-manufacturing industry on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as usual. The Committee's measures were implemented in both markets yesterday, with good results. The full text of the method is recorded below.

Another report: In order to cooperate with the government's policy of selling materials, the Yarn Control Committee originally planned to sell 5,000 bales of cotton yarn and 50,000 bolts of cotton cloth, aiming to contract 10 trillion in currency. However, due to poor acceptance from all parties, the number of sales was limited. A total of more than 2 trillion in currency was contracted. Ninety-six households were approved to purchase 386 bales of cotton yarn, recovering a total amount of 50,004,000,000 yuan. In addition, yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation, following its usual practice, sold 1,048 bales of cotton yarn, plus 1,527 and one-half bales of 20-count yarn, recovering a total of 1,447 billion in currency.

### Yarn Prices Rise Initially then Fall

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation: Due to the issuance of large denomination notes, people generally expected prices to rise. Bulls competed to search for yarn, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The market atmosphere was sharp and increasingly constant. Subsequently, after the authorities announced that the yarn price increase could not exceed 3% of Saturday's price, the Yarn Control Committee also announced that users needing various counts of yarn could apply to the Textile Construction Corporation for unlimited distribution. It was also heard that off-market trading was under strict control by the authorities. Furthermore, due to a large number of materials being sold on the market and tight credit, people became timid and buying intentions turned weak. Short-selling pressure was frequently applied, and the market fell.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn initially called for 1.9 billion, and once rose close to the 2 billion mark. However, due to Textile Construction Corporation's selling, it eventually settled at 1.82 billion, up 70 million yuan from Saturday's closing. 21-count Double Horse spot yarn still closed at 1.35 billion, with the next-day price unchanged. Other counts of yarn mostly showed more gains than losses. A total of 45 transactions were made.

Another report: It was heard that the Yarn Control Committee hung a sign in the market, selling 2,207 bales of 20-count Golden City yarn, etc., at prices between 1.29 billion and 1.33 billion. As a result, various parties switched to buying and selling.

### Strict Prohibition of Cloth Merchants from Raising Prices

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation: Due to the issuance of large denomination notes, people were confused, but credit in the market remained tight. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 54 million in the market (outside the market, transactions were made at prices as high as 55 million to 60 million).

After 10 o'clock, orders were issued to strictly prohibit unauthorized price increases. The rate of increase should not exceed 3% of the weekend price, and the market was closed early. With the Textile Construction Corporation's bid price for Dragon Head fine cloth at 46.5 million, the supply source was available. People's sentiment suddenly turned weak and tired. Traders successively sought to sell, and finally closed at 53 million yuan, up 5.5 million yuan from Saturday. Five Blessings Trumpet Children's cloth also rose by 5.5 million to 6 million yuan. Other crepe and bleached cloth saw robust trading, and prices also followed, rising by 3 million to 4 million yuan, or even as much as 7 million yuan. Dyed cloth and Shilin cloth were affected by frequent increases in dye prices, and factory prices were slightly increased. Market prices rose again by 4 million to 5 million yuan, with the largest increase being 13.5 million yuan.

### Temporary Cotton Yarn Distribution Method

The Yarn Control Committee yesterday stipulated the temporary cotton yarn distribution method as follows:

(1) Temporary cotton yarn distribution will adopt a method of selling at posted prices and fixed quantities. Each time cotton yarn is sold, the count, brand, unit price, and quantity will be publicly posted, allowing customers to request purchases. During the daily cotton yarn market trading hours, the quantity and unit price of each sale can be increased or decreased based on the market supply and demand situation, for one, two, or more postings.

(2) The targets of temporary cotton yarn distribution are limited to re-manufacturing factories and yarn merchants who originally had the qualifications to participate in quotation and approval sales.

(3) If cotton yarns have the same count but different brands, but their market value or quality is similar, they can be grouped together and sold at the same price. The brand of cotton yarn allocated to each customer in the same group will be determined by the distribution agency, and customers are not allowed to choose freely.

(4) Each yarn purchasing customer should obtain blank purchase request forms (format as before) in advance from their respective trade association, pre-fill in the manufacturer's name and the Textile Construction Corporation registration number, affix a seal, and have the trade association stamp it for certification, so that it can be filled out at any time when purchasing yarn in the market, to avoid the procedures of the distribution agency verifying the seal.

(5) After each cotton yarn sale is posted, each customer should fill out the purchase request form that has been processed in advance according to the previous article, indicating the group of cotton yarn requested for purchase and the quantity requested for purchase (which should be in Chinese capital letters, such as "forty-five bales," etc.). Within the specified time, the form should be personally deposited into the designated marking cabinet for that group of cotton yarn in the pre-arranged market. Late submissions will not be accepted. Each customer is limited to one submission of a purchase request for each group of cotton yarn for each posting.

(6) If the total number of cotton yarn for sale in each posting is greater than the number requested for purchase in that posting, all will be allocated according to the number requested for purchase. If it is less than the number requested for purchase in that posting, the distribution agency will consider the situation and take one of the following methods for approval:

1. Temporarily increase the total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group, so that all can be allocated according to the number requested for purchase.
2. Reduce proportionally according to the number requested for purchase.
3. Divide the original total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group equally among each requesting customer, but not exceeding the original number requested for purchase by each customer.
4. Appropriately reduce the number requested for purchase by customers with larger quantities, to the extent that it does not exceed the original total number of cotton yarn for sale in that group.

(7) The purchase approval form for temporary cotton yarn distribution should be collected from the Textile Construction Corporation from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM on the same afternoon. The amount payable should be prepared in the form of a cashier's check and sent to the Central Bank before 12:00 PM the next morning, based on the purchase approval form.

(8) Matters not stipulated in this method will be handled in accordance with past yarn distribution precedents.

The representatives came from Shenyang, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, and most of them had abandoned their jobs and had no food or lodging.

### Exclusive Interview with Schools No. 6 Private Shanghai Law College

Brief History: The college was founded in October 1926, originally named Shanghai Law University. It established three departments: university, specialized, and preparatory. In the spring of 1928, it added a banking specialty. In the summer of the same year, it moved to its self-built school building on Jiangwan Road. In the autumn of 1929, it suspended the preparatory department in accordance with the University Council's organizational law and established an affiliated middle school. It was also decided to rename it Shanghai Law College from 1930. In the winter of the same year, it was approved by the Ministry of Education for registration. The affiliated middle school was closed in January of the following year. In June, the banking specialty was changed to a commercial specialty, with banking and statistics/accounting groups. When the War of Resistance broke out, the school building was occupied, and classes were started in Wangjiasha. When the Pacific War broke out, it moved to Tunxi, Anhui, and established a branch in Wanxian, eastern Sichuan. After the victory, it moved back to its original site on Jiangwan Road and established a journalism specialty. In the autumn of 1946, the branch was closed, and Fucheng College was established separately. In the autumn of 1947, in order to rectify the departments, the commercial and journalism specialties stopped recruiting new students.

Present Situation: The college currently has five departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Accounting and Statistics, and Banking. The Law Department is divided into three groups: Judicial, Administrative Law, and International Law. In the second semester of 1947, there were 139 faculty and staff members and 1,128 students. The main faculty and staff members are as follows: President and Director of the Banking Department Chu Fengyi, Dean of Academic Affairs Cao Xinhan, Dean of General Affairs Yang Jingji, Dean of Student Affairs Zhu Chun, Director of the Law Department Li Liang, Director of the Economics Department Sun Huairen, Director of the Political Science Department Zhu Wen, Director of the Accounting and Statistics Department and Director of the Commercial Specialty Chu Yifei, and Director of the Journalism Specialty Li Qiusheng.

Enrollment: The registration dates for new student entrance examinations this summer are August 3 and 4, and the examination dates are August 7 and 8. The location is at the college address, No. 574, Jiangwan Road.

### World Games Torch Carried by British Ship from Corfu to Italy; Grand Celebration Held in Corfu's Capital

[Reuters, Corfu Island, 18th] After arriving at Corfu Island from Olympia, the World Games torch was carried by the British ship "Whitesand Bay" from the island to Bari at the southern tip of Italy. There, it was handed over to Italian runners to continue its journey. The torch was carried to the southern end of Corfu Island by a Greek destroyer from the port of Katakolon today. Forty-three Greek runners each ran one kilometer to the capital of Corfu, arriving at the city square. Many Greek officials and well-wishers were present. A runner used the torch to light candles on an altar, and then used those candles to light a new torch, which was carried onto the British ship. After arriving in Bari, it will be passed on by Italian athletes.

[United Press, Athens, 18th] The World Games eternal flame relay has completed its 125-mile journey across Greece by land and sea, and today it was taken from Corfu Island to Bari, Italy on a British warship. Thousands of residents of Corfu's capital celebrated the torch ceremony in the central square. Athletes, honor guards, and girls were dressed in ancient costumes and paraded. Young athletes competed for the chance to run the final leg of the torch relay. Eighteen-year-old youth Kalidis won the 3,000-meter race and carried the torch from the square to the dock, where another long-distance champion took it and carried it to a small motorboat alongside the British warship, handing it to British Lieutenant Commander Bullockis. Bullockis will hand the torch to Bari relay runners on Sunday.

### Third Open Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Begin in Early August; Seven Championship Titles to be Divided Between Men's and Women's Singles and Doubles

According to the Municipal Sports Association's Tennis Committee, the league matches for Group A are scheduled to conclude on August 4th, and those for Group B are scheduled to end on August 11th. To ensure a smooth transition, the Third Open Championship will begin in early August. For ease of management, all matches will be held at a single venue, following the practice of open tournaments in other countries, with a set schedule. It is expected that several championship titles will be decided within two weeks. This season's competition will include men's advanced, intermediate, and beginner singles, men's doubles, women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles, for a total of seven events. The competition regulations will be announced soon. It is planned to complete four groups within two weeks, and the remaining three groups within the following two weeks, with the entire event concluding in early September. Registration is likely to begin within the week.

Furthermore, given the high cost of tennis balls, it has been agreed that old balls (i.e., balls that have been used for two or three sets) may be used for beginner and intermediate singles matches. New balls will be provided for the semi-finals and finals. The age limit for participation in beginner singles will be 18 (changed from 20 last year). Those who consider their skills to be excellent may also participate in the intermediate group. The tournament will continue to use the elimination system. After the Open Tournament concludes, a youth tennis evaluation competition may be organized, with no score kept. Judges will observe the various strokes and evaluate the score. This can promote the youth's study of various hitting methods, and progress will be faster. The specific methods will be studied in detail before being determined.

### The World Games Venue: Wembley, The Development of Our Country's Stadium

[Special Article from This Newspaper] The 14th Olympic World Games will be held in London from July 29th to August 14th. Athletes from 62 countries will show off their skills at Wembley Empire Stadium. King George VI of England will also personally preside over the grand opening ceremony.

25th Anniversary

This year's World Games in Wembley also celebrate the 25th anniversary of the world-famous sports center, the Empire Stadium. Wembley was completed in 1923 at a cost of £750,000, and has a large indoor sports field, as well as a modern outdoor sports field. The following year, the British Empire Exhibition of 1924-25 was held here, with dignitaries and celebrities gathering, making it a grand event.

The Earliest Dog Racing Track

For two years after the close of the conference, no one cared for the stadium. In 1927, the operators planned a renovation and built the earliest and most perfect dog racing track. In 1929, automobile racing was introduced to British audiences. Since then, things have gone smoothly, and Wembley has become the center of British sports, hosting international and major football matches, and the British Football Association's football finals.

In 1934, host Sir Irwin spent 200,000 pounds to build the most complete gymnasium and swimming pool. Thus, in addition to football and track and field, swimming, water polo, boxing, wrestling, ice hockey, bicycle races, indoor track and field, lawn tennis, table tennis, skating and other sports competitions have been staged here. 、

Shelter for Wartime Refugees

The god of war once silenced Wembley for a while, and only dog racing and charity football matches were held in the big sports field. However, before long, Wembley changed its ways and became lively again. The gymnasium was temporarily used as a refugee transit station and shelter, sheltering refugees from France, Belgium, and Gibraltar. Later, it was converted into wartime workers' dormitories and a storage depot for mobile golden house materials.

After the victory, Wembley was transformed again and restored to its pre-war prosperity. Sports fans, after years of spiritual hunger, poured in to enjoy the various competitions here, including dog racing, auto racing, hockey, skating, boxing, table tennis, and more.

Renovation Work Completed

Wembley has completed its renovation work to cope with the first post-war World Games. On the track and field, in addition to the first-class seven-lane track, a special practice track will be built. Other facilities such as hotels, lounges, changing rooms, parking lots, etc., are also available.

The main artery connecting all departments of the conference—the telephone switchboard—will have three seats, prepared to use the fastest and most agile way to deliver the conference news to the various news agencies and the British Broadcasting Corporation at any time, to convey to the world. The transportation of the conference will make full use of radio command.

In short, Wembley and Britain are doing their best to enable the first post-war World Games to achieve the highest goal of connecting the feelings of people of all countries and eliminating the barriers between nations. (Xin)

### Forgetting

— Shufeng

Ancient Chinese books rarely have indexes or catalogues, so finding materials relies entirely on memory. If you can't remember something at the moment, you have to rummage through boxes and move a lot of books. Often, for a story or an example, you have to spend the whole day digging through piles of books, flipping through this one and that one. Sometimes you find it by chance, but sometimes you search for a long time and still come up empty. Sometimes you clearly remember seeing it in one book, but after searching for a while, you suddenly remember that it was in another book. By the time you find it, you're already dizzy. So, in the past, whenever I had free time, I would find books that could be classified and spend a lot of time compiling a catalogue or index. It was really because I had suffered enough from this kind of pointless frustration that I thought of this "planning ahead" method.

Living in the secular world, one inevitably has to strain one's brain every day. Unfortunately, no one has the ability to remember everything, and there are always some things that one simply can't remember so much, and eventually forget completely. Although the word "forget" is not listed among the seven or eight emotions, everyone has it, and it can be said to be an innate instinct. We are not hermits who live in the mountains and forests, leisurely and carefree, who can ignore the chaotic world altogether. Nor can we disregard all gains and losses, see the human world as a superfluous growth, get rid of all constraints, and become carefree people. All of this is because we still cannot forget the various things in this world.

It is said that when a soul reincarnates into the world, it must first drink some "Meng Po Soup" to forget all the trivial matters of the previous life, so that it can be reborn as a human being. For example, when a person dies, the family members always silently wish the deceased "peaceful rest," meaning to tell the deceased to forget all the hardships and worries of the world and rest peacefully in the afterlife. This kind of saying is certainly absurd and unfounded, but it does have a point in explaining that "forgetting" comes with birth and ends with death.

However, King Fuchai of Wu in ancient times, in order to avenge his father, "had him stand in the courtyard, and whenever he went in or out, he would say to him: 'Fuchai, have you forgotten that the King of Yue killed your father?' Then he would reply: 'No, I dare not forget.'" After three years, he avenged Yue. Unfortunately, Fuchai was still too forgetful. Once he had avenged himself, he became complacent and ignored the honest advice, forgetting that Goujian was enduring hardship and biding his time. As a result, King Wu ultimately lost his reputation and his country. Therefore, the danger of forgetfulness should not be ignored.

Seeking revenge for every trifle is certainly not good, and not dwelling on old grudges is certainly appropriate, but this magnanimity should have a limit. At least one should always be aware of oneself, and not forget everything immediately after suffering a loss, lest one end up raising a tiger and indulging it, causing endless troubles.

### Collapsing Cliff

— Yiyun

In recent months, I have constantly suffered from strong winds and storms. Recently, the typhoon struck, which made me feel even more threatened. I recall that during the Anti-Japanese War, I initially took refuge in Wanxian, eastern Sichuan, to avoid enemy air raids. I rented a room in a mountain temple. The temple was located on a precipitous cliff, and from the foot of the mountain to the temple, one had to climb more than 700 steep stone steps. Behind the temple was a stone cave that could accommodate more than a hundred people. In the event of an air raid, one could take refuge there. Living in the mountains was quiet, without the noise of the city. Looking into the distance to the big river and looking down over the entire region, I thought it was a paradise. Unexpectedly, in the spring and summer, heavy rain fell often, and the wind was also strong. Lightning flashed like fire, shooting in through the window. In the light, I often saw sparks flying. Then came thunder, as if it were close at hand, deafening. Sometimes the thunder rumbled back and forth, incessantly. I once climbed to the roof, but then it suddenly burst, and the sound was so loud that the roof tiles would sometimes be shaken off. The power of nature was extremely terrifying, but what was even more terrifying was the outbreak of mountain torrents. On all sides, to the left, right, front, and back, the waterfalls on the mountains all poured down, carrying mud, sand, and rocks, like ten thousand horses galloping. Coupled with the strong wind and heavy rain, the sound was even more violent. At that time, a loud noise suddenly arose, like the sky collapsing and the earth shattering. All the mountains shook. When the monks in the temple heard this sound, they would always say to themselves, "I don't know which cliff has collapsed again." The entire territory of Wanxian is mountainous, and the mountains are all stone, high and steep. Building houses against or halfway up the mountains, one must choose places where the mountain stone is complete and not crossed by mountain springs before one can live there. Otherwise, when it rained heavily, the stone would be washed away by the mountain torrents and fall from the top of the mountain, and the house below would be turned into powder. Although the locals knew the terrain and were able to choose solid stones to live near, the mountain stone would gradually decay over time due to rain and wind erosion, and flying disasters could still not be avoided. To the left of the temple where I lived, there was a large temple that had been destroyed twice by falling rocks. Once, a stone as large as a square table crushed the front half of the main hall. Fortunately, it was during the day, and most of the lodgers were out, with only a few injured by falling tiles. The other time, the fallen stone was smaller and destroyed the kitchen, but fortunately it was late at night, and there was no one in the kitchen. A merchant from Hubei built a house under another cliff, but because he did not know the terrain, the entire cliff collapsed during the rain, and the whole family was killed under it. A friend of mine lived near a cliff. One day, during a heavy downpour, he suddenly heard a rumbling behind the house, and gravel hit the wall. He thought to go out and observe, and saw mountain stones continuing to fall, with several large stones wriggling and rolling down the mountain. He immediately shouted for his family to run away. Just as the whole family came out, the boulders crashed through the wall and entered. A farmer built a thatched hut below my temple. One night, during a heavy rain, he heard a loud noise. The next morning, he went down the mountain and saw that the stone steps halfway up the mountain had been destroyed by a huge stone. The stone was as large as a house, making it difficult to walk on the road, but the farmer's thatched hut was unharmed, because it had passed over the roof. It was also quite dangerous. We were often startled and said that falling stones in the mountains were worse than enemy bombs, because enemy air raids had warnings that could be avoided in advance, but this came down suddenly, and there was no time to avoid it. Therefore, people in Wanxian often said, "Crushed by stones," just as we people from Jiangnan say, "Struck by lightning." It can be seen that the disaster of collapsing cliffs has frightened people for a long time.

### Sea Red Mansion Poetry Records

— Xu Banmeng

Mr. Zheng Yimei sent me Huang Yuan's crane feathers and said that the crane was still well, requesting a poem to praise it. Therefore, I composed this and sent it to Mei'an in the summer of Wu Zi.

I always remember the white crane dancing,
Opening its wings and feathers, sweeping away the heat,
Looking forward to Jiugao for a thousand years,
A wild cloud in the sky for eternity.
The frosty feathers on its waist add to the whistling,
How many grey hairs accompany the clear sky,
Knowing that you still have the joy of riding in a carriage,
The dusty coast of Shanghai is rich in food.

A branch of orchid is worried, the jade is lush,
The elegant and secluded fragrance stains the tip of the pen,
Who would believe that the ink turns over, the scales move,
The azure dragon angrily rolls up the cold sea waves.

The past events shine, the dreams of Guangxu and Xuantong are warm,
Clear singing and beautiful dancing, snow leaving traces,
Do not let the crimson building age,
Melt the everlasting soul of Jiangnan.

### Lady Hengbo's Ruby Seal

— Qian Dacheng

Shen of Changshu, of the Rice Studio, is rich in collections: calligraphy, paintings, antiques, and carefully copied rare editions, encompassing everything. The owner, Shen Baoyi, once showed me Gu Hengbo's ruby seal, as large as a child's fist, weighing several ounces, its color as bright red as a rose, radiating precious light. It was stored in a box made of Phoebe zhennan wood, on which was carved a postscript: "Zheng Zhenduo collected this seal for twenty years, and I only obtained a rubbing. Later, I exchanged it with the He family of Daozhou for their ancestors' calligraphy, regretting that I had no chance to see it. Now, Xi Li has come to the capital and showed me this seal. I borrowed it to admire for a few days, because treasures are not always in the same place, and it has changed hands three times in a few years. I write this casually." Xi Li was Fei Nianci, the historian. It is known that this seal was once collected by Pan Boyin of Suzhou, and the He family of Daozhou was a descendant of He Shaoji. Shen obtained it from Zhao Gumou. Baoyi generously gave me a rubbing and asked Master Yang Wuyang to write four poems on it. The third poem says: "The fragrant orchid and water iris are known for their charm, and the jade of the seal is collected after the devastation. The inkstone is made from Taohe stone, a wonderful combination (Shen Shiyou collected the Azure Inkstone, which has a poem by Ma Xianglan). The ruby seal is the seal of the Jiangyun Tower (The Gu family of Yuanhe collected the tooth seal of the Jiangyun Tower, which is as smooth as ruby and is also a treasure of the world)." Hengbo's name was Mei, also known as Meisheng, and her style name was Meisheng. She was Gong Dingzi's concubine and could write ink orchids. After Dingzi surrendered to the Qing, his wife refused to accept the Qing imperial mandate and yielded it to Hengbo. Hengbo later changed her surname to Xu, hence the name Madam Xu. She also came from a brothel, comparable to Madam Liu Rushi. In the late Ming Dynasty, famous courtesans emerged in large numbers, each relying on a prominent official to enhance their status, and the prominent officials used famous courtesans to show their romance. In reality, this only shows that they did not care about national affairs and were addicted to pleasure! How are today's famous courtesans and so-called social butterflies any different?

Earlier, I wrote an article about Peking University alumni, and then I saw an article titled "Old Stories of Peking University" signed by "Jiefu" in this edition. I thought it was a response from a fellow student, but I didn't know who it was. Later, Mr. Xu Xingbai from Ningbo and his wife, Ms. Li Chuqin, came to see me with a letter, and I learned that it was Li, a classmate from the engineering department (Yinwenji, currently working at the Qiantang River Bridge Engineering Office), and Li Chuqin was his daughter, and Mr. Xu was his son-in-law. Both husband and wife work in the Joint Logistics Theater Troupe, stationed in Beiping. They are simple and peaceful, and can be called excellent young people. Jiefu is one of the Cantonese classmates. The letter mentioned Qu Shuji (Guozhu), who was the head of the engineering class mentioned in my alumni notes. He was diligent and honest, and a very interesting person. His nickname "Potato" was well known. After graduation, he has been serving in the engineering field. Before the incident, he was recuperating from stomach problems in the Zhongshan Mausoleum in Nanjing. During the Anti-Japanese War, he traveled to Hefei, Anhui, and was injured by bandits. He escaped to Shanghai with difficulty, experiencing all kinds of hardships and terrors, both physically and mentally exhausted. He eventually died, which is very sad. Chen Zhiji once founded Guangdong National University, and Lu Songfang and Li Boxian served as professors, all Cantonese classmates from Peking University in those years. I still remember once watching a play called "Red Double Jubilee," where the old beggar Jin Song said that Mo Ji was lucky to be just a "scholar." When he came to his house to drink soy milk, what would he use to provide for the "gentlemen from the university"? According to the old lyrics, a scholar would come to drink soy milk, but what if a licentiate came? The imperial examination was abolished at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the clown changed the words accordingly, replacing it with students from the university. Although it was a humorous joke, it was enough to show that the school's prestige was unparalleled at the time. Because the school arose to replace the imperial examination, and "University" was the only university in the entire city at that time, there was no need to add a prefix to distinguish it. Just mentioning university, everyone knew it was our school, just as in the Peking Opera world, mentioning "The Big Boss" meant that everyone knew it was Cheng Changgeng, without needing to add a surname. Also, in the play "Yun Sheng Shop," Wang Mingfang (the scholar who was looking for a place to stay) asked for an upper room. The shopkeeper replied that the upper room (i.e., the special grade room) was for the Cantonese gentlemen to live in, because the old Beijing people knew that Guangdong was known for its wealth, and Cantonese officials in Beijing, such as Ruilin, returned fully loaded. Moreover, the guild halls built by various provinces in Beijing, especially those of Guangdong and various counties, were more magnificent and solid in architecture than those of other provinces. Therefore, the clown made a joke, also revealing a glimpse of people's feelings and customs, all of which is worth remembering.

### Taiyal People

— Dongfang Jibai

In Taipei, Hsinchu, Hualien, Taichung and other places in Taiwan, there are Taiyal indigenous people scattered. Because of their peculiar way of life, people generally regard them as uncivilized. In fact, there are also many intellectuals among the Taiyal people who have moved to the plains. They speak fluent Japanese and write smooth Japanese, and some have become school teachers.

According to statistics, there are 47,503 Taiyal people in Taiwan, second only to the Taiwan Ami people. Their eyes, noses, faces, skin color, and language are very similar to those of Southeast Asians, especially the language, which is very similar to the Malay language of Southeast Asia. It is said that when Japan launched the Pacific War, it conscripted Taiyal people from the mountainous areas of Taiwan to fight in Southeast Asia, and they were able to communicate with the local Malays. Based on this, it is very believable that the Taiyal people originally belonged to the Southeast Asian Malay system.

Their main food is sweet potatoes and millet. Most of them do not have bowls or chopsticks when eating. Men take hunting as entertainment, like watching a play or a movie. When they are about to set off, if they see a bird flying in the same direction as them, they consider it auspicious. If the direction the bird flies in is crosswise to the direction people are going, it is inauspicious. If they hunt a wild animal (such as deer, wild boar, etc.), the head and liver must be offered to the chieftain, a foreleg is given to the discoverer, another foreleg and the internal organs are given to the shooter, the local police and public educators each get a hind leg, and the remaining parts are shared equally by everyone in the village, regardless of whether they participated in the hunting. This practice of equally distributing goods is one of the characteristics of the Taiyal people. If you bring a box of matches and give it to them, you should give them out stick by stick to everyone around you, as they consider this to be fair. Also, land reclamation is done by everyone contributing labor and working together. After the land is reclaimed, everyone enjoys it together. Benefits are shared equally, and people help each other. There are no big landlords, no big tycoons, and no thieves or beggars.

They do not have currency, and they usually barter goods. They do not know what the use of banknotes is. They have no concept of numbers, from one to ten, hundred, thousand, and then ten thousand, and then they cannot explain it.

They are very hospitable. When drinking, two people share one cup and drink together, face to face, to show intimacy. When you step into a native village, you can see many young men and women hugging and kissing in public, or men and women playing the same harmonica. Their social life is extremely free, but they attach great importance to the chastity of men and women. If unmarried men and women engage in adultery, they will be severely punished.

More than a decade ago, Taiyal men and women tattooed some patterns on their faces—face tattooing—for beauty. Now, their aesthetic vision has shifted, and this custom no longer exists.

The Taiyal compatriots are hardworking, simple, honest, brave, not humble, not fraudulent, value reputation and know shame. They have many advantages; it's just that compared with people on the plains, their lives seem too simple. (Written in Taipei)

### Old People's Village

— Huanren

When a person reaches old age, they only have these two paths in front of them: either to sit and wait for death, or to muster their spirits to work, so as to obtain happiness and health in work. In Kent, England, there is an old man named Josiah Alfred. He is a doctor, a lawyer, and a philosopher. He once said a famous quote: "The organization of society is such that only work is the path to health and happiness. Anyone who wants health and happiness, only work." Therefore, when he saw that most of the old people were only walking down this path of melancholy and weakness, waiting for death, he immediately gathered a group of old people and organized a village in a very desolate place called Doddington, so that these old people could re-engage in the work that young people can do. These old people were also people who used to have work, but because of their age, they were rejected by factories or other business institutions. But after they arrived in the village, their ability to work was immediately displayed. They could make bamboo and wood utensils, build walls and pave the ground, and do work such as gardening and farming. They lived in the houses they built themselves and ate the food they grew themselves, but they did not have wages, because they worked for health and happiness. When they finished working, they would sit together outdoors to smoke, sing, and play. They could do whatever they wanted. Their lives were truly spent in happiness and health. Alfred also gave them some pocket money and deposited some money in the bank for them, to be given to them when they left the old people's village. They were free to come and go, without any restrictions. Currently, this desolate and deserted place in Doddington has become a prosperous and happy old people's village.

The United States government agencies consume a lot of paper, so the government has set up its own paper mill to supply this paper. The various records and reports consumed more than 25 tons of paper just when investigating the responsibility for the Pearl Harbor incident.

During World War II, a total of 100 U.S. military generals were killed, wounded, or captured.

According to the New York Herald Tribune, the cost of printing a banknote by the U.S. government is seven cents (i.e., 0.07 dollars).
