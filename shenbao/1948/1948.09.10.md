### Establishment of the Constitutional Supervision Committee: The President Encourages All Members to Assist the Government in Alleviating the People's Suffering and Leading the Nation to Prosperity and Strength

[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] The Constitutional Supervision Committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Hall on the 9th at 10:20 AM. 1,170 committee members attended, presided over by Chairman Mo Dehui and Vice Chairman Hong Lanyou. Both the President and Vice President were present, making it the grandest event at the Assembly Hall since the closing of the National Assembly. First, Mo Dehui delivered the opening remarks, stating that he was extremely excited about the establishment of the committee and the enthusiastic participation of all members. He especially noted the presence of the President and Vice President as an unparalleled honor for the committee. Currently, over 2,900 committee members have registered to participate. The committee's mission is twofold: to supervise the government's implementation of constitutional governance and to cooperate with compatriots to assist in its promotion, thereby achieving the goal of democratic politics. The committee's work is roughly divided into three areas: (1) constitutional research, (2) investigation of constitutional governance work, and (3) promotion of constitutional governance. All are extremely important. The future success of constitutional advancement and the satisfactory achievement of democratic politics depend heavily on the responsibility of this committee. Especially at a time when constitutional government and suppression of rebellion are being carried out simultaneously, the efforts of all committee members are essential. After Mo's speech, the President was invited to speak. The President wore a traditional Chinese robe and mandarin jacket, similar to the attire he wore on the day he assumed the presidency. The President first pointed out that today marks the third anniversary of Japan's surrender, and the establishment of the committee is announced today. He expressed his deep satisfaction that, in the three months since the closing of the National Assembly, the representatives have continued to uphold the spirit of the National Assembly, assisting the government in achieving the tasks of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. He then encouraged all committee members to uphold the principle that the people and the government share the same fate, and to assist the government in alleviating the people's suffering and leading the nation to prosperity and strength. The speech lasted five minutes. At 10:40 AM, the ceremony concluded. Before the members departed, Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, announced that the committee would hold its first meeting on the 11th.

### Full Text of the President's Speech

The full text of the President's speech at the meeting is as follows:

Chairman, Vice Chairman, and all members: Implementing constitutional governance is the ultimate goal of nation-building throughout our Founding Father Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life. For decades, the entire nation, both internally adhering to the Founding Father's aspirations and externally responding to global trends, has strived tirelessly. With the completion of the constitution and the establishment of a solid foundation, the first session of the National Assembly, established in accordance with the constitution, was convened this spring. Subsequently, the Legislative and Supervisory branches held meetings successively, and the nation entered the path of constitutional governance. We could have followed this smooth path to focus on advancing the work of nation-building, to catch up with the prosperity of democratic nations. However, the Communists, relying on their violence, launched a full-scale rebellion, and the harm has deepened, causing increasing suffering to the people. It is the government's responsibility to punish wrongdoing, comfort the people, and stabilize the foundation of the nation, and therefore, it must actively suppress the rebellion to eliminate this national scourge. Suppressing the rebellion militarily is no different from continuing the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, which is a matter of national survival and honor. The government recently decisively reformed the currency system, ending the malignant inflation of the legal tender to eliminate economic threats. It also actively investigates Communist spies behind the lines to eliminate the sources of chaos and stabilize the localities. All these measures are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and of great benefit to the military suppression of the rebellion. The sooner the military suppression of the rebellion is pacified and concluded, the more urgently we can implement constitutional governance and build the nation. Your committee was organized and established based on the resolution of the National Assembly. All committee members are representatives of the people, coming from the grassroots. They have a particularly detailed understanding of the people's suffering, and their sincerity in caring for the people and serving the nation can be seen from their enthusiastic participation in the constitutional supervision work. The people, the nation, and the government are originally one entity, sharing the same fate. Only through mutual trust and assistance, with seamless unity of spirit, can government measures achieve twice the result with half the effort, can the people's suffering be easily alleviated, and can national prosperity be readily achieved. The path of constitutional governance has countless intricacies. At the beginning, it is inevitable that there will be obstacles. It is hoped that all committee members will uphold their loyalty to the nation, bear in mind the difficulties of the nation, and provide more assistance to the government's policies. How should we implement new initiatives and carry out constitutional governance during the period of suppressing the rebellion, so that we can assist and complement each other? And how should we remedy the shortcomings of the current constitution, so that it can be perfected? I hope you will carefully study and present detailed recommendations for our consideration, so that we can work together to establish a good democratic constitutional government, realize the Three Principles of the People, and place the nation on a rock-solid foundation. Let us encourage each other. On the occasion of the establishment of the committee, I express my sincere thoughts. I hope you will understand.

### The President Summoned Weng and Others to Review Financial and Economic Measures

[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] President Chiang Kai-shek summoned Premier Weng Wenhao, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun, and Vice Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan to his official residence at noon on the 9th. He inquired about the implementation of the recent emergency financial and economic decrees and raised some important current financial and monetary measures for review. Yu Hongjun and Xu Baiyuan arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th and reported to the President on the situation of supervising the reporting and registration of foreign exchange and gold and silver deposited in various commercial banks and firms in Shanghai to the Central Bank. Weng, Wang, Yu, and Xu spent over two hours at the President's official residence, and had lunch with the President before leaving at around 2:00 PM.

### Premier Weng's Tea Party to Host Members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, With Many Focusing on the Treatment of Public Servants and Teachers

[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] Premier Weng Wenhao held a tea party at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 4:00 PM on the 9th to explain the situation after the promulgation of the emergency financial and economic decrees and to host members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans in Nanjing. Premier Weng and the heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan attended, and over 600 members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans were present. First, Weng reported on the implementation of the emergency financial and economic decrees, hoping that all members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans would support it. Then, Finance Minister Wang reported on the implementation of the emergency decrees in various places, saying that the general response was very good. Because the Gold Yuan has sufficient preparation and strictly controls its issuance, he believed that it would achieve complete success. After Weng and Wang finished their speeches, Legislative Yuan members Fang Zhichao, Fei Xia, and Supervisory Yuan member Jin Yueguang delivered speeches respectively, expressing their support for the emergency decrees, but raising some opinions. Fang Zhichao said: (1) Currently, there are three kinds of currencies circulating in the market with the issuance of Gold Yuan, and the exchange of gold and US dollars has led to the government issuing a large number of new banknotes, so it is proposed to shorten the period for the use of legal tender to avoid the proliferation of speculative capital. (2) In this method, there are regulations for state-owned and public-owned enterprises and tax rates to be adjusted at the appropriate time, so the cost of goods will inevitably be high, and prices will naturally increase accordingly, but the treatment of workers and public servants and teachers is frozen at "August 19," which is unreasonable, so it is proposed that they should also be adjusted appropriately. Jin Yueguang's opinions are: (1) The government should sell a large amount of materials to absorb speculative capital. (2) The government should exchange gold pounds and rupees in the same way as other foreign currencies. (3) Thoroughly establish a solid credit for the new currency system to promote it smoothly. At the meeting, most people advocated for adjustments to the treatment of public servants and teachers, and the meeting adjourned at the appointed time.

The various commercial banks and firms were ordered to first report and register their foreign exchange, gold, and silver to the Central Bank. As of the afternoon of the 9th, the Ministry of Finance received a long-distance call from Shanghai reporting that more than 300 units had reported and registered to the Central Bank, and although the exact figure of the total amount has not yet been calculated, it is estimated to reach 100 million US dollars.

Why Does the Soviet Union Provide Convenience to Rebels?

[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] When answering a reporter's question at a press conference on the afternoon of the 9th about "What is your opinion on the death of Feng Yuxiang this time?"

Since he had publicly stated that he would return to China to lead a rebellion in order to overthrow the Chinese government, the question immediately arises as to why the Soviet government still provided him with convenience to go to the Soviet Union? Before this point and other facts are clarified, I intend to reserve further comments.

### The Ministry of Finance Rectifies Tax Revenue, Expected to Increase Substantially

[Our Nanjing, September 9th Dispatch] According to the Ministry of Finance: In the past, local finances were unable to control expenditures due to high prices, especially the monthly adjustment of living subsidies for public servants and teachers, which accounted for more than 70% of the total local expenditures each year.

Editorial

### Hirohito's War Responsibility and the Emperor System

The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal has concluded, without making any decision on the question of whether Emperor Hirohito should bear war responsibility. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 7th, American prosecutors, fearing that most Japanese people would be deeply disturbed and consider it a national humiliation if their emperor were put on trial, made every effort to avoid the court discussing whether the emperor should bear war responsibility. At the same time, during his trial, Hideki Tojo also tried his best to defend the emperor, attempting to absolve him of responsibility. In his testimony, he said: "Declaring war on Britain and the United States was my doing, and has nothing to do with Emperor Hirohito, or any official or civilian. I, Tojo, will take full responsibility for everything." Based on this, it is feared that the emperor's war responsibility will quietly disappear.

However, judging by common sense, anyone with even a slight understanding of Japanese politics knows that the "Emperor System" is a cover for all Japanese aggression forces, and that to achieve true democratization of Japanese politics, it must be abolished. The last National Assembly passed a proposal asking the government to determine the principles of the peace treaty with Japan, which also stated that the "Emperor System" is the core of Japanese militarism and should be abolished. In fact, all the Allied nations advocated abolishing the "Emperor System" at the Potsdam Conference. The Potsdam Declaration stipulated that "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." Isn't this clearly referring to the Japanese Emperor System and Emperor Hirohito? However, when the Allied nations demanded that Japan accept the Potsdam Declaration unconditionally, things changed. Japan submitted a revised clause in its reply: "The aforementioned declaration does not include any demand for the Emperor to lose his special authority as a sovereign ruler." To comply with Japan's request, the Allied nations replied: "The fate of the Emperor rests with the Japanese people." Thus, the question of whether to abolish the "Emperor System" was temporarily put on hold.

The United States government and public have always had different views on this issue. Joseph Grew, former US Ambassador to Japan, suggested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on December 22, 1944, that the "Emperor System" should be maintained. He said: "Japan's 'Emperor System' is the only political factor that maintains 'stability.'" The Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo, based on the same reasoning, and believing that the Emperor would be the only medium through which the Allies could control the Japanese people, not only feared that putting Emperor Hirohito on trial would provoke a strong reaction from the Japanese people, but also spared no effort to cover up and justify his war responsibility. Allied General Headquarters advisor George Atcheson said: "We must face reality, the Japanese people still worship the Emperor." Later, when the Allied Headquarters guided the Japanese in drafting a democratic constitution, although all the Emperor's political rights were stripped away and national sovereignty belonged to all the people, the "Emperor System" was still retained, and the Emperor was only changed to a "symbol of the state."

In our honest opinion, if the Japanese people can sincerely and genuinely adopt a British-style constitutional monarchy and turn the Emperor into a British-style emperor, merely regarded as a "symbol of the state" with no power to act, then this matter should be a question for future Japanese constitution-making. I remember that at the Cairo Conference on December 1, 1943, our leader President Chiang Kai-shek also issued a statement on the Emperor issue: "If the Japanese people rise up and launch a revolution, punish their warmongers, and overthrow the government controlled by the warlords, then the countries participating in the Cairo Conference will respect the wishes of the Japanese people themselves and allow them to freely choose the form of their government." This speech was fully agreed upon by President Roosevelt at the time. Now, the United States and China can only abide by this promise on this issue.

Therefore, the question of whether to retain or abolish the Emperor System can be decided by the Japanese people freely and of their own will. However, we must point out that Emperor Hirohito's war responsibility should not be confused with this issue. The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal's avoidance of discussing the Emperor's war responsibility is undoubtedly a major mistake. Emperor Hirohito is the "No. 1 war criminal," and must bear full responsibility for both the war of aggression against China and the war against the United States. He should not be allowed to shirk responsibility or quibble. During the war, American newspapers all referred to Hirohito as the "No. 1 war criminal," which is excellent ironclad proof. Recently, a public opinion poll conducted by the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun showed that many Japanese people advocate Hirohito's abdication. Their intention is to preserve the Emperor System and avoid being burdened by the issue of war responsibility. The Japanese people themselves admit that Hirohito should bear war responsibility, which is strong proof of this. Because even if Japan retains the Emperor System, it does not necessarily have to retain Hirohito's throne, who should be held responsible for the war.

In short, the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal's avoidance of discussing the war responsibility of Emperor Hirohito is a major dereliction of duty due to excessive accommodation to reality, and it has completely lost the meaning of severely punishing war criminals. We should stand on the side of justice and draw the attention of the US government and the Allied General Headquarters in Tokyo to this.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Defense Minister He Yingqin held a tea party at 5:30 PM today to commemorate the day, September 9, 1945, when he represented the Supreme Commander in Nanjing to accept the unconditional surrender of the Japanese army in the China war zone. He invited senior staff members of the Army General Headquarters at that time and journalists who participated in the surrender ceremony. At 8 PM, he was invited by the Central Broadcasting Station and the military broadcasting stations of Guangdong and Guangxi to deliver a speech to compatriots across the country. In his speech, He first stated the historical significance of this day of accepting the surrender and recalled his pleasant mood at that time, believing that China could be revived after eight years of arduous resistance and that world peace could be permanently established. Who knew that although foreign invaders have been eliminated in the past three years, communist bandits have risen again. He said in a sorrowful tone: "Because of the full-scale rebellion of the communists, national construction has been hindered and the great cause of revival cannot be unfolded. We cannot help but feel infinitely sad and infinitely distressed today as we commemorate this historically significant day!" He also said: The purpose of the eight-year arduous war of resistance was to achieve national equality, and the current campaign to quell the rebellion is also for the freedom and equality of the nation. He said: "In order to ensure the integrity of national territory and the unity of government orders, the current suppression of communists is essentially a continuation of the eight-year war of resistance."

Awakening Compatriots to Suppress the Rebellion with All Their Strength

He also stated that the government had repeatedly tolerated the communists at first, hoping that they would repent, because the country had undergone eight years of war of resistance, and material resources were scarce and people's livelihoods were extremely difficult. However, the communists betrayed their ancestors and acted perversely, expanding the rebellion instead. The government was forced to issue a decree to suppress the rebellion. At this point, he called on compatriots to use all their manpower and material resources to support the suppression of the rebellion. He said: I am deeply aware that for the past eleven years, from the War of Resistance to the suppression of the rebellion, compatriots across the country have made their utmost efforts to shoulder the burden of manpower and material resources. However, the current work of suppressing the rebellion has not yet been completed, and we must further intensify our efforts to shorten the period of suppressing the rebellion and start national construction as soon as possible. We know that the communists are not bound by laws and regulations and do not care about the suffering of the people. They can use all kinds of high-handed and brutal means to concentrate and control all the manpower and material resources in the controlled areas to engage in rebellion. Therefore, the current scale of military suppression of communists is exceptionally large, and the consumption of combat is even greater than during the War of Resistance. The officers and soldiers at the front endure all material difficulties and fight bloody battles to prevent the spread of the Red disaster. Compatriots in the rear should not sit idly by, but should take out all the manpower and material resources to support the suppression of the rebellion. Modern warfare is total war, not just a simple military war. Especially in the suppression of communists, compatriots across the country must work together in their respective positions, so that the communist disaster can be quelled as soon as possible and social order can be restored. On this day of commemorating the surrender, we can recall how we united as a nation to defeat a powerful enemy. At the same time, we should especially encourage each other on how to work together to ensure the fruits of our victory in the future. I believe that compatriots across the country will be of one mind and support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion under the overall goal of giving priority to suppressing the rebellion, contributing their wealth and strength to the best of their ability, and using the belief and determination that the War of Resistance will be victorious to guarantee that the suppression of the rebellion will be victorious and the country will be built successfully. I dare say that the violent Japanese warlords could not achieve their attempt to destroy our country, and no traitor can ever hope to overthrow our government and destroy our country.

### Remembering the Past and Looking Forward to the Future with a Myriad of Emotions

He concluded: "Three years have passed since the surrender. In terms of the domestic situation, the communists are harassing us, and all construction has not made significant progress. In terms of the world situation, the Cold War between the two major blocs has not ended, and the United Nations organization cannot completely resolve various international problems. Remembering the bright future of our country and the world at the time of surrender, we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions. However, we must strive for the freedom and equality of the nation at all costs. We must strive to promote the stability of the world regardless of all difficulties. I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will work together, strive together, and be loyal to the country in their respective positions, seeking construction in the midst of the rebellion, seeking stability in the midst of turmoil, quickly suppressing the communist disaster, reviving the country, and further promoting the permanent peace of the world together with all democratic countries."

### Two Lakes Supervisory Office Holds Tea Party: Elder Statesmen of Hubei Offer Candid Opinions; Insist on Strict Handling of Mao Jiaqi and Thorough Investigation of Wang Dongyuan's Accounting

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] The Two Lakes Supervisory Committee Office today held its first tea party, inviting incumbent supervisory committee members in Hubei and elder statesmen of Hubei Province. During the event, they conducted a two-hour review of two issues: punishing corruption and reforming the economy. Speakers included Zhang Nanxian, Li Shucheng, Hu Zhongmin, Ai Tongying, and over ten others, all of whom were impassioned and moved to tears. The summarized opinions from all parties are as follows: (1) To exercise supervisory power effectively, corruption must be thoroughly exposed. To severely punish corruption, the corruption and dereliction of duty by judicial officials must be addressed first; otherwise, corrupt officials cannot be brought to justice, and investigations are futile. Therefore, the case of Prosecutor Mao Jiaqi's acceptance of bribes should be prioritized as the first target of the Supervisory Committee Office. (2) To swat flies, one must first swat tigers; to swat tigers, one must first disregard personal relationships. While it is necessary to investigate the uncleared accounts of the fifty-plus county magistrates in Hubei, the uncleared accounts of the provincial chairman should be investigated first. Cases such as Wang Dongyuan benefiting himself by giving away received materials must be thoroughly investigated.

### Berlin City Council Harassment Incident: Soviets Reject US and French Protests; Soviet Air Force Holds Large-Scale Exercise in Air Corridors

[United Press, Berlin, 9th] Soviet authorities today rejected the Western powers' accusations that the Soviets surrounded the Berlin City Hall, drove the City Council into the Western sector, broke into the military liaison office, and arrested 40 West Berlin police officers, causing two days of terror. As the Soviets refused to consider the Western powers' military commanders' protests, Soviet fighter jets were conducting exercises over Berlin, making crossing flights in the Western powers' air corridors. Soviet Berlin Commander Major General Kotikov rejected the US protest, deeming it baseless. The US note was personally delivered to Kotikov by US Berlin Commander Colonel Howley, who protested the Soviet troops and East German police's intrusion into the US liaison office within the Berlin City Hall on the evening of the 6th, arresting 20 West Berlin police officers, and the Communist Party members' humiliation of British and American journalists present. The French note was delivered by French Commander-in-Chief in Germany Koenig to Soviet Deputy Commander-in-Chief Major General Khvatkov. The note protested the Soviet military's violation of the Yekelovsnikov agreement's promise of safe passage, arresting 19 West Berlin police officers withdrawing from Berlin City Hall to the French sector, but this was also sternly rejected by Khvatkov. He coldly responded to the French request to release the arrested German police officers, stating that the matter was entirely a German affair and unrelated to the Soviets. The Soviet rejection of the above two notes was announced by the Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur, which is registered with the Soviet authorities. This new incident in the Berlin "Cold War" is occurring simultaneously with the breakdown of the Four-Power military commanders' Berlin talks, which have been indefinitely postponed due to the failure to resolve the currency issue. A well-informed source stated: The Soviet Union demands that the entire city of Berlin accept the Soviet East German mark, and that all financial matters be managed by an advisory committee.

[United Press, Berlin, 9th] After notifying the Four-Power Air Navigation Safety Center that it would conduct exercises with more aircraft in the Western air corridors for seven days, saturating the corridors, the Soviet fighter jet squadrons roared over the US-occupied zone of Berlin at noon today. The Soviet Union is using exercises as a pretext to threaten the Berlin airlift, which is generally regarded as part of the Soviet plan to seize the entire city. At least ten Soviet aircraft flew over Berlin at noon, which US authorities estimate were at an altitude of over 10,000 feet. They also stated that if the Soviet Union maintains this altitude, the exercises comply with the Four-Power regulations and are beyond reproach. US officials at the airlift starting point of Wiesbaden stated that the Soviet attempt to disrupt the US airlift with exercises is doomed to failure. "The air corridors are quite wide, so accidents are difficult to occur, unless the Soviet Union intentionally collides, but it would also risk crashing."

### Truman Supports Marshall's Policy: Determined to Uphold Rights in Berlin; States Will Not Negotiate Under Pressure

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 9th Broadcast: President Truman today endorsed Marshall's announcement of a tough policy to resist the Communist actions in Berlin at a press conference. Reporters raised many questions, but Truman refused to answer. He said that while continuing to strive to resolve the US-Soviet dispute, the United States must uphold its rights in Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference yesterday that the Berlin City Hall incident should be blamed on "German and foreign" Communist elements, whose aim is clearly to subvert democratic institutions, and we must resolutely resist them. However, Marshall refused to answer whether the United States will take retaliatory measures of an electrical nature. He stated that the four-power military commanders are currently studying the report of the Transportation and Currency Committee and hope that the commanders' meeting can continue and that the municipal incident will not affect the Moscow talks. Marshall reiterated that US policy is to not negotiate under pressure.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Diplomats here believe that the riots in Berlin, instigated by the Soviets, have made the tense situation more critical, and any accident could occur as a result. It is believed here that the Berlin unrest indicates that the Kremlin, regardless of the talks in Moscow and the Berlin blockade, is still determined to drive the Western powers out of Berlin. Experts in foreign affairs here do not claim to understand the Soviet Union's motivation for suddenly acting perversely in that area, especially when the four-power military governors' meeting has reached a concrete stage. However, they list the following possibilities: (1) The Soviet omnipotent Politburo may believe that negotiations to lift the blockade and implement a single currency are greatly disadvantageous to the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union may be using the political turmoil in France to buy time to gain favorable terms. People with experience in diplomacy with the Soviet Union have pointed out a third possibility, that the unrest is merely a smokescreen for the Soviet Union to suddenly lift the blockade, but this is only one possibility, and no one is hopeful about it. What diplomats here unanimously agree on is that the Berlin material industry is already fraught with crises.

### 100,000 Berlin Citizens Hold Large Anti-Communist Demonstration

### Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. Advocates Sending Paper Bullets to the Soviet Union

Promoting American Democracy

[Our Dispatch] New York, 9th Broadcast, Los Angeles News: Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. stated at a trading association meeting: "The only way to properly promote to the Soviet people is to organize a large fleet of American aircraft to fly over Soviet territory and drop leaflets behind the Iron Curtain to promote American democracy."

### Four Powers Discuss Italian Colonial Issues: Soviets Suggest Meeting Today; US Expresses Dissent Due to Time Constraints; Preliminary Meeting May Be Held by Deputy Foreign Ministers

[Our Dispatch] London, 9th Broadcast, Paris News: The French Foreign Ministry announced that France has accepted the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting and has invited the three countries' foreign ministers to meet in Paris, but the date has not been determined. However, according to Moscow Radio, the Soviet Union suggested that the meeting begin on the 10th.

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 9th Broadcast: The State Department today informally rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 10th to discuss the disposition of the pre-war Italian colonies, considering the "time too pressing."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] The British Foreign Office announced today that the British government has received a Soviet note suggesting a four-power foreign ministers' meeting be convened in Paris on the 10th to discuss the Italian colonial issue. According to well-informed sources, Bevin, who is preparing some suggestions before the UN General Assembly convenes, is expected to go to Paris tomorrow. It is also heard that he will suggest a preliminary meeting, attended not by ambassadors from the four countries, but by deputy foreign ministers from the four countries. It is said that British Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew will attend the preliminary meeting in place of Bevin, while the Soviet representative may be Malik, the head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly.

Divergent Opinions Between the UK, US, and Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] According to authoritative sources: The issue of the former Italian colonies should be decided by the UN General Assembly to be convened in Paris on September 21. The opinions of the UK and the US are generally consistent, namely: (1) Temporarily maintain the status quo of Libya to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean and prevent the infiltration of communism. (2) Return Eritrea to Italy, but allocate a corridor to Abyssinia to access the sea. (3) Return Somaliland to Italy. (4) Tripoli and Cyrenaica will temporarily remain under British military rule, as both the UK and the US believe it is necessary to retain naval and air bases there. The Soviet Union, however, advocates returning all former Italian colonies to Italy. One of the reasons the UK and the US disagree is that Italy's financial situation is unable to develop all of these lands. Therefore, observers here believe that due to the above differences, the four foreign ministers cannot resolve the Italian colonial issue, and this issue must be resolved at the current or next UN General Assembly.

### Selling Eyeballs at Reduced Prices: Hoping to Buy a Farm

Three American Youths Have Far-Fetched Ideas

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] Three American youths, due to empty pockets, have placed advertisements, willing to sell one eye each for US$5,000, but the surgical costs must be borne by the purchaser. It is understood that recently, a father of seven living in Rhode Island sold one of his eyes to a blind person, obtained $10,000, and was able to buy a farm. Now the three youths are selling at reduced prices, hoping to easily find buyers.

### British Conservative Party Split: All Dissatisfied with Churchill

Eden to Gain Leadership of the Party

[United Press, London, 8th] Churchill's leadership within the British Conservative Party, and his entire political career, are now being threatened by internal Conservative dissent. It has previously been rumored that a political disagreement occurred between Churchill and former Foreign Secretary Eden. Now, not only are there serious differences of opinion between the two, but the Conservative Party has also split into two factions. The dissenters are mostly young Conservative Party members.

This is undoubtedly the case."

### Uncover Unprecedented Large-Scale Currency Speculation Case: Two Well-Known Foreigners Detained; Confess to Having US$170,000 Deposited in New York

[Our Dispatch] The Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau yesterday uncovered an unprecedentedly large organization of foreigners engaged in private currency speculation. The protagonist is an Italian, Pilara, and involves Benaoviez, a British national and well-known tennis player who was formerly a broker at the Shanghai Public Exchange. In addition, it has been discovered that several large Chinese commercial firms are also involved in this case. After days of interrogation, clues have been obtained.

The Italian Pilara is the person in charge of the Shanghai office of the large Italian company Lovisco, with the office located in Room 101 of the Cathay Hotel and residing at 197 Lincoln Avenue. He usually engages in large-scale currency speculation. On the 3rd of this month, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau, acting on a tip, conducted an investigation and found US$5,000 in cash in his office. Suspecting him of buying and selling black market US dollars, he was taken in for questioning. Under strict interrogation, he revealed the truth. According to him, a large amount of US dollars was successively deposited in Chase Bank in New York, transferred to him by the Italian headquarters. The first deposit was US$104,440 on July 23. The second deposit on July 28 was for two amounts, one for US$37,042.48 and one for US$27,880. The third deposit was on July 31, with one deposit of US$5,405. The total amount was US$174,817.48. After depositing the money, he obtained a Chase Bank checkbook for use. He finally confessed that the person who had dealings with him today was a British national, Benaoviez. After the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau inspected his checkbook, there were a total of 25 checks. He had signed out six checks in his own name, but the Chase Bank records in New York showed that he had signed out as many as 15 checks.

### Involves Several Well-Known Chinese Commercial Firms

Subsequently, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau summoned Benaoviez for questioning. He admitted that in 1946, he did purchase a US$2,000 draft from Pilara for US$2,000 in cash, which was used to pay the coffee account of the American company Aenausend Clayden. Afterwards, he purchased another US$3,150 draft. Upon concluding that the facts were clear, the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau temporarily detained Benaoviez. At the same time, as the case involves several well-known Chinese commercial firms, and further investigation is required, an application has been made to the Special Criminal Court to extend the detention for seven days.

### A Letter Reveals Secrets: Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju Confess to Foreign Exchange Speculation, Amounting to Over 500,000 Gold Yuan. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Releases Details of the Case.

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the arrest of Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju for foreign exchange speculation, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters released the details of the case yesterday, stating: On the 7th of this month, based on confidential reports, the headquarters learned that the China Trust Company in this city was still engaged in large-scale illegal foreign exchange speculation after the currency reform. It secretly dispatched personnel to cooperate with the Gold Control Bureau to the China Trust Company at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, arresting its deputy manager, Dai Jiaju, and Hu Guoliang, manager of Datong Yarn Factory, who was implicated by Dai's confession. A letter addressed to Dai by Liang Rongchun was seized on the spot, detailing the exchange figures, totaling 702.4 billion Legal Tender, equivalent to 234,132 Gold Yuan. They were brought to the headquarters and interrogated overnight. According to Dai Jiaju's written record and confession: On September 3rd, he received a letter brought by someone from Hong Kong entrusted by Liang Rongchun (manager of China Trust Company), instructing him to pay 240,000 Gold Yuan according to the attached address. The funds were obtained from Hu Guoliang in the form of 135 gold bars, which were exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank before being paid out. On September 4th, he received another notification from Liang, instructing him to pay over 300,000 Gold Yuan according to the address provided. The funds were obtained from Hu Guoliang in two installments, totaling 84,000 US dollars, which were then exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank before being paid out. According to Hu Guoliang's written record and confession: He admitted to paying Dai Jiaju a total of 135 large gold bars and 84,000 US dollars in two installments, which were exchanged for Gold Yuan at the Central Bank and then transferred to Hong Kong. The payable figures in the seized letter were not included in this. Combining the above staggering figures and the detailed records in the seized letter of Gold Yuan being exchanged for Hong Kong dollars and gold being purchased, it proves that Hu Guoliang and others sold a large amount of gold and US dollars and then purchased them from Hong Kong, illegally profiting from it. The circumstances are very clear. This case is not only the most planned and massive foreign exchange speculation group uncovered after the Emergency Economic Measures, but also proves that it was a large-scale organization engaged in the black market of gold and currency in the past. The authorities attach great importance to this matter. In addition to the fact that Hu and Dai were transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation the day before yesterday (the 8th), Liang Rongchun, the manager of China Trust Company who remains in Hong Kong, is also being pursued.

### 22 Recipient Accounts Under Investigation

In addition, according to the seized letter, 22 recipient accounts were involved. The Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters summoned them for questioning on the 9th.

### Requesting Alcohol Before Execution: Still Deluding Himself About Sino-Japanese Friendship

[Report from our newspaper] Itaru Junnosuke (also known as Zhang Zongyuan), a Japanese war criminal who once served as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin, was executed by firing squad by the military court at Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison yesterday. Itaru Junnosuke was a long-time ambitious Japanese conspirator. He came to China in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, falsely claiming naturalization and changing his name to Zhang Zongyuan. He initially served as a major general advisor to Zhang Zuolin of the Northeast Army. After the September 18th Incident, he secretly went to Andong, colluded with local scoundrels, and instigated puppet organizations. He also wrote books such as "The Situation in China," "A General View of Policies Toward China," and "A General Outline of Emergency Handling of China," all of which were strategies aimed at destroying our country. In April of the twenty-first year, he became the deputy commander of the Anfeng area, allowing Japanese military police and his troops to capture and kill Chinese Catholic personnel and civilians in Badagou, Andong. After the July 7th Incident, he infiltrated Tianjin and, with the suggestion of the enemy chieftain General Terauchi, he recruited bandit troops such as Liu Peichen and forcibly conscripted militiamen to organize the pseudo Shandong Autonomous Allied Army, claiming to be the general commander of the army. He fought against the National Army in Daowei Town, Rizhao, and other places, implementing his conspiracy to control China with Chinese people. After the victory, he was detained by the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters and sentenced to death by the military court presided over by Judge Shi Meiyu. Yesterday, President Ning cabled to approve the execution. At 11:00 am, the court's prosecutor Shi Shishi, secretary Guo Zhenhuan, interpreter Wang Renming, and a squad of military police went to Shanghai Prison to set up the case, brought out the prisoner, and informed him that they were ordered to carry out the execution.

One of his wills was to his family, one was to Colonel Tanaka, and one was to Lieutenant General Ishiwara, still boasting about "Sino-Japanese friendship" and other words. After writing, he asked for alcohol, requested not to be handcuffed, and entrusted his tortoiseshell glasses and a fountain pen to Major General Sakuradaira. He was then escorted to the execution ground and killed with one shot.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The seventh session of the first Municipal Council convened grandly yesterday morning at its auditorium on Tanggu Road. After Speaker Pan led the ceremonial proceedings, he delivered the opening address. Subsequently, Mayor Wu gave a speech, followed by a response from Zhao Yangxiong. The ceremony concluded at eleven o'clock. Following a ten-minute recess, the first meeting commenced, during which Mayor Wu presented a policy report and answered questions from the councilors, adjourning at noon.

Excerpts from Speaker Pan's address: Today, as we hold the seventh general assembly, a brief reflection on the past two years and a review of the past twenty days will undoubtedly evoke various feelings. I would like to share my personal sentiments and hope to encourage my colleagues to strive to genuinely represent public opinion. The term of the Municipal Councilors has expired and should have been renewed. However, due to the promulgation of the Constitution and the pending revision of local autonomy regulations, the councilors' terms have been extended until the establishment of a Municipal Council elected in accordance with the Constitution. Therefore, we are holding the seventh general assembly today. Given this, we hope that the Legislative Yuan, currently in session, can expedite the completion of the general rules regarding local autonomy, particularly those concerning municipalities directly under the central government, so that our city can establish a municipal autonomy system in accordance with these rules after our nation implements constitutional governance. Secondly, how can a representative body truly represent public opinion? This is a question that deserves our deep consideration. Entrusted by the citizens who elected us, we must, on the one hand, strive for the minimum necessary municipal construction and, on the other hand, consider the maximum acceptable burden on the citizens. Navigating this difficult path to fulfill our mission is not easy. I believe that councilors should be open-minded, seek broad consultation, and welcome responsible reports and suggestions from any citizen as a reference for discussing issues. When necessary, we can consult with newspapers to conduct public opinion polls on specific difficult problems, ensuring that the decisions made by the council during the discussion of proposals align with the genuine majority opinion of the public.

Prioritizing Shanghai While Considering Property Prices Across Regions: Thirdly, the economic situation in our city over the past twenty days has seen a generally stable price level, thanks to the vigorous enforcement of price controls by the economic supervisors Yu and Jiang, as well as the municipal authorities. In all fairness, Shanghai has performed the best in the country during these twenty days. I sincerely hope that the central government, while prioritizing Shanghai, can also pay closer attention to the prices in major cities in South China, North China, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and strive to coordinate producer prices with distribution prices, and adjust production costs with retail prices, so that the Shanghai market can have a reasonable track to follow, and will not be affected by the collapse of other regions' defenses in the future, and will not lead to the shrinkage of production due to the stagnation of goods exchange.

Fourthly, the municipal government faced revenue shortfalls during the price fluctuations, and had to seek subsidies from the central government in July and August. The municipal public utilities also had to borrow money from the municipal government in August to cover their deficits due to the reduction of new prices. All of these issues should be adjusted and remedied after the currency reform. The municipal government is preparing to adjust tax revenues and revising its revenue and expenditure budget for September to December of this year in accordance with the new currency system, which will be submitted to this general assembly for our serious discussion.

Seeking the Truth of Facts to Obtain Fair Judgments

Finally, I have one additional point to make: the difference between the whole and the part is a basic understanding that should be had when discussing any event. For example, the term "corruption" cannot be applied to all officials. I dare not say that there is not a single corrupt official in Shanghai, but I dare say that there are many judicial officials, administrative officials, and military and police chiefs in Shanghai who endure hardship, maintain their integrity, and abide by the law, and should be respected and commended by the people. I dare not say that there are no government offices in Shanghai that deliberately delay public affairs, but I dare say that Shanghai does have highly efficient judicial and administrative organs that are deeply valued by foreign friends, but unfortunately have not received the attention of the citizens. Similarly, the term "奸商" (tricky merchant) cannot be applied to all merchants. Shanghai does have some lawless and self-seeking treacherous merchants, but most of the merchants in Shanghai still abide by the rules and seek profits through legitimate means. Therefore, I sincerely hope that my colleagues in this council will not pick up on one or two examples when discussing any case to generalize, so that we can seek the truth of the facts and obtain a fair judgment.

Mayor Urges Cooperation and Promotion of the Doctrine of the Mean

Excerpts from Mayor Wu's address: It has been two years since the first general assembly of the Council. The Speaker asked the Councilors to ask themselves what contributions they have made. Inspired by the Speaker, I reflected on my work over the past two years and felt deeply ashamed. Recalling that the City Government's efforts in the past two years have been deteriorating, just like the tightening of the war situation, but the various tasks can still be promoted as scheduled, relying on the close cooperation of the military and political parties, the unity and mutual assistance of the government and the council, and the full promotion of the spirit of the doctrine of the mean. Confucius said: "Cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world." The way to govern the state must also be inseparable from the doctrine of the mean. In today's epoch-making era, if we want to progress, all parties must cooperate loyally and seek the doctrine of the mean, then the difficulties can be safely overcome.

Policy Report

After the opening ceremony was completed, the first general assembly was held immediately. First, Mayor Wu gave a policy report, which lasted for forty-five minutes. Excerpts are as follows:

Civil Affairs

The organizational and implementation methods for the People's Self-Defense Force have been drafted, and the Self-Defense Training Committee is also ready. However, the key issue is how to coordinate with the volunteer police, and the source of funding is a difficulty.

Police Affairs

The problem of establishing a garrison brigade requires more than 160 trillion yuan before the central government promulgates new economic measures. After the currency reform, the budget requires more than 10 million gold yuan. The municipal government will convene relevant agencies to discuss and then submit to the meeting for discussion.

Social Affairs

To date, there are still more than ten work-relief centers continuing to operate public relief. As for the construction of the second phase of charity sale houses, it cannot be continued due to the sharp rise in various materials and the inability to budget. Regarding household rice distribution, restricted by the Sino-US agreement, the price can only be lower than the market price by 5%. In order to take care of the burden on citizens, it is divided into three types: ordinary rice distribution, poor people's rice distribution, and碎米 (broken rice), so as to reduce the burden on citizens.

Education

A. The number of schools and classes in this city from September to December of the 34th year (1945) was 18 middle schools with 175 classes and 86 national schools with 743 classes. In September of this year, middle schools have increased to 30 schools with 380 classes, and national schools have increased to 270 schools with 2,562 classes. B. Education expenses accounted for 8.28% of the total budget in the first half of the 35th year (1946), and 20% of the budget in the first half of the 37th year (1948), and the actual expenditure has been 22.57%.

Finance

In the former concession era of this city, the total annual income of the three institutions, the Municipal Government, the Public Concession Bureau, and the French Concession Bureau, was 46 million yuan, of which rent alone reached 15 million yuan. Now, the annual tax revenue of the municipal government cannot reach 92 million gold yuan. Reorganizing tax revenue is the top priority.

Public Works

The prices of various engineering materials have risen sharply. The expenditure of the Public Works Bureau for the four months from September to December this year is 700,000 gold yuan. Calculated in this way, the annual amount should be 2.1 million gold yuan.

Public Utilities

The municipal government, the council, and relevant units have jointly organized a public utilities open investigation and review committee. If you think it is necessary to inquire about public utilities, you can review them as much as possible. After the currency reform, the central government has carefully discussed the prices of public utilities in various parts of the country, and there will be an explicit announcement.

Land Administration

Regarding land consolidation, more than 90% of the city center area has been completed. Therefore, land value tax will be one of the important items in the city's tax revenue in the future. However, it can only be effective if prices are stable.

Health

Health expenses are very tight. The epidemic prevention work relies on US aid to continue. Fortunately, cholera did not occur in the city this summer.

Mayor Wu's conclusion made two points: (1) The municipal government should strive to cooperate with the new economic plan formulated by the central government to stabilize prices. (2) Under the principle of vigorously practicing economy, we should strive for a balanced budget.

### Four Councilors Inquire; Mayor Answers One by One

The inquiry began at 11:30. Mayor Wu answered one by one as follows: Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Zhang Zhihan, he replied: (1) Regarding the matter of reducing cars, the municipal government should set an example, and my opinion is completely consistent, and it will be thoroughly implemented. (2) Regarding the matter of depositing public funds in the municipal treasury, the municipal government ordered its subordinates to comply with it last month. Anyone who should pay but does not will be punished with the crime of corruption. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, he replied: (1) It is actually difficult to recover the racetrack, and there is no money to purchase it. It was previously proposed to exchange it with the Jiangwan racetrack, but it was not approved by the central government, and land is currently being sought for exchange. (2) Regarding the construction of the art museum, the owner, Hardoon, has handed over the land deed to the Land Administration Bureau, and it is currently being designed and sampled. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Fei Shusheng, he replied: (1) The central government's unified case on public utility prices is because all localities have the same difficulties, so it should be resolved by the central government in a unified manner, and the local government can only obey the central government's orders. (2) Regarding the issue of subsidies after the price reduction of public utilities, a public investigation and review committee on prices has now been established. If there are any opinions on the increase or decrease in the income and expenditure of various companies, you can submit them to the meeting for public discussion and resolution. (3) Regarding the economic emergency measures promulgated by the central government, the municipal government will do its best to cooperate and implement them. No matter how big or small the stores are, those who are found to have raised prices will be strictly dealt with. I hope citizens will report them. Regarding the inquiry from Councilor Fan Xipin, the mayor showed Deng Zhonghe a letter and photo of Wan Lilang when soliciting special donations. Is it appropriate to solicit donations in this way? The mayor replied: Showing photos in the Deng case was because Deng had been solicited many times, but he only agreed to donate 30 billion, which was far from the purpose of the solicitation committee. At that time, Zhu Zhengwen had a letter to the municipal government, reporting that he had already reported to the District Prosecutor's Office, and attached a letter and photo. I think that since he is suspected of being a traitor, it is in line with the central government's special donation rules, which stipulate that those who make a fortune from national disasters are the main targets of solicitation. Therefore, I showed him the photo, hoping that he could automatically donate money. As for the charge of being a traitor, I know that he has been accused, and the municipal government does not need to overstep its authority. In response to Councilor Fan's inquiry, the mayor should show courage, and in the past, he always practiced Taijiquan, and in the future, he should practice Shaolinquan. The mayor's reply was simple and straightforward: "I don't have enough talent and strength, and I really want to learn." After answering, he returned to his seat, and the speaker announced the adjournment of the first general assembly.

### Second Meeting This Afternoon; Inquiries to the Nine Bureaus

[Report from Our Newspaper] Today's morning break, from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. this afternoon, continue to hold the second meeting, where councilors inquire to the Finance, Education, Land Administration, Public Utilities, Public Works, Police, Social Affairs, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus and listen to their replies. The speeches at the conference hall during the period of the council general assembly will still be broadcast by the Xindu Radio Station, which is hosted by the council, so that citizens can listen.

### "Restoration King" Ultimately Becomes a Prisoner; Ignorant Imperial Thought Urgently Needs to be Eradicated; The Lanzhou Security Authorities Strictly Investigate

— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Binglin

[Report from Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 6th (Airmail)] On the 4th of this month, the Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court announced a special case that has never been made public. From this incident, it can be seen that the rural areas of the Northwest today are still stagnant in the ignorant and ignorant "era of theocracy," and many people's minds still harbor "imperial thoughts."

Descendant of the Deceased Qing Dynasty Deceived by Bandits

Last spring, in Linxia County, Gansu Province, there was a 23-year-old young farmer named Ma Yunlin. He was a descendant of the deceased Qing Dynasty (originally named Aisin Gioro Pu Cun). Under the instigation of the treacherous bandit Sang Wenbing and the local Taoist Chen Guhan, they agreed to establish themselves as the "Great Qing Restoration King." Chen Guhan was appointed as the military advisor, and they secretly gathered and met a large number of ignorant villagers. They issued "imperial edicts" and "conferred" a large number of "loyal and filial kings, commanders-in-chief of the six armies," "天下兵馬大元帥 (Grand Marshal of All the Armies of the World)," "內廉辦事北陽大臣忠爵侯 (Minister of Internal Affairs, Loyal Duke and Marquis of Beiyang),"... and "Longdong Commander-in-Chief," "Divine Martial Army Commander," "Battalion Commander," "Company Commander" and other positions, as many as fifty or sixty, creating a sensational momentum for a time. Although they have not yet openly recruited soldiers and horses, they have already hidden guns and other weapons, waiting for an opportunity to riot.

Plotting Wrongdoing, All Apprehended

Around September last year, the local authorities detected these conspiratorial parties, and the Fifth District Administrative Office arrested these "monarchs" and "ministers." Except for the active treacherous party members Sang Wenbing and "Commander" Zhang Tao San, who fled far away after hearing the news, the authorities captured "Great Qing Restoration King" Ma Yunlin, "Deputy Deputy Commander," "Battalion Commander," "Company Commander" He Yingqian (56 years old, farmer, Yongjing native), Lu Deli (34 years old, vegetable farmer, Linxia native), Kong Haizhou (56 years old, farmer, Yongjing native), Shi Guoyou (41 years old, farmer, Linxia native), Shi Youcun (45 years old, farmer, Linxia native), Zhao Yuanbi (32 years old, unemployed, Weiyuan native) and other six people, and killed "Military Advisor" Chen Guhan. On the spot, they found the "印 (seal)" of the "Great Qing Restoration King" (9 cm long and 6 cm wide), and two seals of "Minister of Internal Affairs, Loyal Duke and Marquis of Beiyang" (13 cm long and 8.5 cm wide), seven "imperial edicts" finely mounted with yellow silk, two 能戮 (ceremonial weapons), one telescope, one bayonet, and broken waist guns, and eight-sound pistols, one each, and five bullets for pistols and rifles in total. They were immediately escorted to the Gansu Provincial Security Command. After a long period of interrogation, they were transferred to the Special Criminal Court in July of this year and prosecuted, and sentenced the other day.

Prisoners in the Ranks, Shrinking into a Ball

The once sensational "Restoration King" and his subordinates have now become trembling prisoners, quietly listening to the presiding judge reading the judgment: "Ma Yunlin, with the common intention of undermining the national system, prepares to carry out the act of riot, and is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. He Yingqian, Kong Haizhou, Lu Deli, Shi Guoyou, Shi Youcun, and Zhao Yuanbi, with the common intention of undermining the national system, prepare to carry out the act of riot, and are sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights each. Li Wujin is innocent, ... 印章 (seals), 聖旨 (imperial edicts) ... are all confiscated."

Directors of the Strange Drama, Each Displaying Ambition

The director of this "Restoration" strange drama was the treacherous bandit Sang Wenbing, who attempted to disturb the security of the Northwest, while the "military advisor" Chen Guhan wanted to take this opportunity to make some money. It is a pity that these "kings" and their "slaves" who were used by others not only became puppets but also had to go to jail. They complained to reporters: "Alas, we can't even draw the character 'eight' with both hands, how would we know how to be kings? It was all controlled by the dead Taoist. We are really wronged to be sentenced to imprisonment today! We want to appeal!" The ignorant appearance, the pitiful expression, and the feudal words such as "king," "marquis," and "imperial edict" are too far away, too far away!

The Legend of Divine Water Penetrates Poor Villages

In various parts of Gansu, illegal organizations such as the so-called "孔月敎 (Kong Yue Sect)" and "一貫道 (Yiguan Dao)" are currently prevalent. Generally ignorant villagers are alarmed and rushed to join them. Although the local authorities often investigate and ban them, these forces have penetrated into the lower classes of poor and remote areas, using the guise of 神道設敎 (establishing religion through the divine), making it difficult to detect. According to local newspaper reports: 隴西 (Longxi), Gansu, once appeared "紳水 (divine water)," which was said to be able to cure all diseases, even decades of old diseases. Men and women went to draw "紳水 (divine water)" in groups. The county government was afraid that treacherous bandits would take advantage of this opportunity to disturb local security, so it ordered the county health center and the chemistry teacher of Longxi Normal School to test it, proving that the water contained sulfur and could cure diseases, which was completely the effect of 科舉 (imperial examination). Therefore, superstitious legends occurred, and the "god" also revealed its secrets and became ineffective.

Yao 言 (Rumors) Still Rife in Zhang County and Longxi

But this "god" did not disappear. Recently, it has窜 (fled) to Zhang County and 隴西灘兒下 (Tan'erxia, Longxi). These two places have also spread mysterious legends: "A monster from nowhere剪 (cuts) chicken wings in the dead of night, and later directly cuts the bodies of children!" People heard these legends and were half-convinced. Children wore red cloth strips, and red paper pants were pasted on the tops of the gates, and even a盆 (basin) of 淸水 (clear water) was placed in front of the window, in preparation for the "monster" to fall into the 盆 (basin) if it was careless. During the period of suppression of the rebellion, the security authorities should conduct a thorough investigation of these unfounded legends, and social education should also be strengthened, otherwise it is no wonder that the ignorant people will be disturbed by conspirators and运士 (carriers).

### Hangzhou Solves Murder Case; Apprentice Kills Boss Out of Resentment

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] On the midnight of the 7th, the Hangzhou Police Bureau solved a murder case. The apprentice of Jiuda Incense and Candle Store on Dongjie Road, Xi Zifang, had been continuously sucked of his essence by the boss, Biao Shengmei. Because he was young and haggard and as thin as firewood, he insisted on becoming self-reliant. He asked Qiu to borrow five taels of gold to do business, but failed. He took a knife to avenge his revenge and killed Qiu. He was discovered by the police and immediately surrendered. The police bureau will send him to the court for interrogation.

### Flood in 41 Counties in Zhejiang

### Five Members of the Yang Joint Defense Team Arrested by the Xiang (township) Chief of Taixian County

Yang County Government Lodges a Serious Protest

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 7th] Yan Chao, Li Zhengcai and other five members of the Fourth Joint Defense Military Office of this county were arrested illegally by Yan Haiqiu, the Xiang (township) chief of Zhuangyao Township, Taixian County, while they were active on the border between Yang and Tai counties on the 11th of last month. Five short guns and 40 stone of 麦 (malt) were confiscated, and they were falsely accused of robbery. After being tortured to extract a confession, they were sent to the county and detained by the Taixian County Procuratorate for interrogation. The Jiangdu County Government repeatedly telegraphed for bail, but it was not accepted. Yan Chao died of injury on the 28th, and Li Zhengcai and others are now seriously ill in prison and their lives are in danger. The county government of this county believes that the county government of Taixian County deliberately made things difficult and tortured public officials to death with non-criminal means. In addition to reporting to the Commissioner's Office, it also sent Wang Shiqing, the deputy commander of the Self-Defense Corps, and Xue Guangzu, a councilor, to Taixian County for thorough investigation and serious protest. It is also reported that Cai Zhiyuan, the Xiang (township) chief of Haishan Township in this county, was arrested in Tai, but no trace was found.

### Revolutionary 元動 (Leader) Zhao Shu Died of Illness in Jinyun

[Jinyun, 6th] Revolutionary 元動 (Leader) Zhao Shu died of illness at Jinyun Health Hospital at 4:20 a.m. on September 5. He was 64 years old. In his early years, he followed the Father of the Nation and ran around for the revolution, participating in the campaign to overthrow Yuan and protect the law. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the party representative of the 26th Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was a National Councilor. He did not spare his efforts and was full of righteousness. He never managed his family property in his life, and he was desolate after his death.

### Harvest of Autumn Crops in Hebei; Farm and 物 (Goods) Appear on the Scene One After Another

[Report from Our Newspaper, Baoding, 7th] Hebei Province has a good harvest of autumn crops, and farm products in various regions have appeared on the market one after another. The vicinity of Central Hebei has suffered slightly from insect pests, and the harvest has been reduced by 30%. Counties near Pingjin and Tang have harvested 60%. Grains and 玉蜀黍 (corn) account for the majority.

### After the Derailment on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Repairs Were Completed Overnight

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 6th (Airmail)] Between Lilang Station and Bukij Station, 132 kilometers from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, a seventh express train derailment tragedy occurred at around 5:00 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, killing 28 people and injuring more than 90 people. This is an unprecedented disaster in the history of the railway. Du Zhenyuan, director of the Yuehan Railway, and Xie Wenlong, director of the Guangdong Construction Department, personally went to inspect the scene at around 5:00 p.m. on the 5th. According to Director Du: The traffic accident caused so many deaths and injuries, and I feel very sad. After on-site investigation, it was proved that the responsibility for the accident was entirely due to sabotage by traitors. The sleepers at the derailment site were newly replaced Siamese hardwood sleepers, with no rottenness at all. The roadbed also had no collapse. The steel rails and fishplates at the derailment site were not broken. The most important proof is that the fishplates and bolts connecting the two sections of steel rails at the accident site could not be found everywhere. The connection between the two sections of steel rails also had no twisted marks. It is obvious that the two sections of steel rails had lost contact before the derailment, and the fishplates and bolts were removed by traitors in advance, without any doubt. The Railway Bureau, in view of the inconvenience of suspending transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, worked overnight to repair the road, and the entire line has been operating normally since the 6th. The driving time will be temporarily implemented at 4:30 a.m. before September 1 to ensure safety.

### Transfer of Foreign Exchange by Commercial Firms and庄 (Shops) Extended to Noon Today; More Than 300 Units Declared and Registered Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] The declaration and registration work for the transfer of foreign exchange by commercial firms and insurance trust industries in this city to the Central Bank was originally limited to 4:00 p.m. yesterday. However, due to the facts, it was decided to extend it to noon today. More than 300 units declared and registered yesterday. Most of the larger firms and companies have completed the declaration and registration procedures. Some small firms have had their forms returned for reprocessing because they were not familiar with the procedures and many of the forms were not in compliance with the regulations. After the registration forms are collected today, Director Lin Chong will go to Beijing tonight to submit them to the Ministry of Finance for review, and then the ministry will issue an order to announce all the detailed figures.

[Zhong Shi She, Nanjing, 9th] Xu Botu, the former Finance Secretary, went to Shanghai for the transfer of foreign exchange assets of firms to state-owned banks, and returned to Beijing this morning after completing his work. He told reporters: All commercial banks in Shanghai are complying with government orders and have been declaring to the Central Bank since the 8th, which will be closed before 4:00 p.m. on the 9th, and there should be no problems in general. If there are those who do not comply with the law and dare to delay the declaration, the government will impose appropriate penalties. As for the total amount of foreign exchange transferred, it is still being collected and reported, and the total amount may not be as huge as rumored by foreign countries. Xu also said: At present, in order to stabilize the economy, the government is doing its best to implement the established policies, but it also depends on the public's psychological stability and confidence in the currency.

### Stores Still Not Buying Much, Rice Prices Trending Downward, Grain and Oil Markets Also See Declines

The rice market is shrinking again, with market momentum continuing to trend downward. Quotes in Xishi are weak, and rice stores are still not buying much. Coupled with clear weather, increased arrivals are expected. Therefore, although the market opened flat, it ultimately saw a slight decline at closing due to sluggish sales and a lack of confidence. In the southern market, the price was said to have fallen by three jiao early on. White japonica rice and thin japonica rice both reportedly dropped by three jiao. New indica rice opened at twenty yuan, and new japonica rice also saw a decline. Only white glutinous rice remained firm at the limit price due to scarcity. Prices in the northern market are still stable, but the market is also particularly weak. Arrivals in the two markets totaled three thousand and twenty shi.

Flour transactions were not numerous, and prices were slightly weak. The largest decline was less than one jiao, because reports indicated that flour was also prohibited from being exported. This will inevitably cut off retail sales in the interior, leading to a decline in confidence and a decrease in purchases. Old Che brand opened at the previous day's original price, and closed slightly lower by two fen. Bingchuan brand closed at seven yuan and two jiao, a decrease of five fen. Sales of miscellaneous brands were particularly sluggish, declining by four or five fen. Jiancheng brand fell by nine fen. Rumors circulated that the factory would be opening for bran, which was slightly weak by two fen. Wheat remained at the original price.

Grains

The market momentum turned weak. Soybean sales have completely ceased, and oil mill purchases have also decreased. Purchases of new beans on this street are also not good, and the market shows signs of weakness. Qingdao merchants are handling more corn, adding one jiao. Red sorghum sales to the north are smooth, and high-quality products are fairly stable. Inferior yuanmai is being used by alcohol factories, and the price has fallen. There were few transactions for both tea beans and broad beans. Sesame seeds and main kernels were both transacted at the limit price, with the former being firm and the latter being weak.

Edible Oil

Flat and weak. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil saw slight declines. Inventories on this street are mostly sufficient, so there are not many buyers in the market. Oil mills opened at a price two jiao lower. Datong soybean oil was forty-nine yuan and five jiao, and rapeseed oil was reduced by five jiao to forty-five yuan and five jiao. Raw oil is still firm because Qingdao has banned exports and inventories are low. Small Che sesame oil is also firm and expensive due to depleted inventories, opening at a net price of fifty yuan. Foreign merchants still have no appetite for soybean cakes, with the factory price at four yuan and six jiao, and returned goods reduced by one jiao.

[Our Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangling steamer arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying four thousand bags of rice and four hundred and fifty barrels of tung oil from Changsha. It is currently berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading.

Another Dispatch: The Yangtze River route has recently seen improvements in shipping. The Jiangling, Jiangning, Sanbei Ruitai, and other steamers are all transporting large quantities of yarn, cloth, and daily necessities to Han and Xiang.

### Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange Statistics for Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged by the Central Bank and entrusted banks in recent days has been quite low compared to the first few days. Yesterday's results were particularly good. The total amount of exchange was as follows:

Gold: 28,640.486 taels
Silver: 25,995.65 taels
Silver Dollars: 115,454.17
U.S. Dollars: 755,819.47
Hong Kong Dollars: 192,200.05

The total value was 9,204,418,945 gold yuan.

### Yesterday's Clearing Balance for Banks and Bureaus

Yesterday, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a total clearing deficit of 1.1 million in the exchange of bills among silver and money businesses. The Central Bank had a surplus of 140,000, the Bank of China had a deficit of 530,000, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 440,000, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 390,000, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 250,000, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a deficit of 370,000, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a balanced clearing. Commercial banks and firms had a surplus of 2.53 million in large exchanges and a deficit of 1.42 million in small exchanges. Foreign banks had a total deficit of 10,000.

### Cancellation of the Previous Six Measures for Short-Term Lending by Provincial and Municipal Banks

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the point that provincial and municipal local banks, if necessary, should provide short-term loans to local, normally operating banks and firms, the Ministry of Finance had stipulated six measures. It is now known that since the revised and promulgated measures to strengthen financial business control, there have been strict restrictions on the deposit and loan items of provincial and municipal banks. All six measures originally set by the Ministry of Finance have been explicitly ordered to be terminated by the Ministry.

### Last Week's Export Exchange Settlement Amount

The amount of foreign exchange applied for settlement for exported goods from Shanghai last week (August 29 to September 4) decreased slightly compared to the previous week. The total figure converted to U.S. dollars was $4,175,217.13. This included the amount for exported goods for which the government settled foreign exchange itself (i.e., frozen eggs, yarn, cloth, ore, sugar, etc.), totaling $1,032,537.73.

### Japanese Silk Fabrics to be Sold in India, Threatening Our Indian Market

The Silk Weaving Guidance Association Decides to Clear Stock Immediately

In order to increase exports and earn foreign exchange, the Central Bank led the organization of the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee last year, which processed and exported raw silk controlled by the government. Over 90,000 bolts of silk and satin were shipped to India for sale, of which one-third has been sold, and two-thirds remain. After the 10th of this month, the Indian ban on the import of raw silk and silk fabrics will definitely be lifted. Japanese silk and silk fabrics will be shipped to India, and our Indian market will face serious threats. All of these silks and satins should be sold as soon as possible to facilitate the closing.

Regarding this matter, the Silk Weaving Export Guidance Association specially invited relevant agencies yesterday to discuss the handling methods. Chen Shuzeng, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Manager Ma Jiping, Deputy Manager Sun Zurui of the Bank of China, Commissioner Zhou Dagang of the China Trust Bureau, General Manager Ge Jingzhong of the Silk Company, and more than ten representatives of the silk weaving industry attended the discussion. The result was a decision to clear the remaining stock in India in the near future. The selling price will be calculated based on the actual cost. In the past, silk and satin were sold in India at a limited price, with a minimum price of four rupees per yard. Now it will be below four rupees.

### Inexhaustible Supply from Enemy Code, Abundant Cotton Yarn, Market Prices Flat and Weak, Yong'an Yarn Factory Participates in Yarn Allocation for the First Time Yesterday

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quite lively due to the autumn sales season. Confidence among various parties was still relatively stable. The supply from various yarn factories in the market was inexhaustible. However, foreign merchants' appetite was sluggish, and some even turned from buyers to sellers. The prices of coarse and fine yarns mostly fell to the limit. Transactions have entered a normal track.

Another Dispatch: Yong'an Textile Company entrusted the Yarn Business Association to open sales of 400 packages of yarn of various brands from 10 to 60 counts. The association opened sales to its members by lottery at 3:00 PM. Regardless of whether there had been previous transactions, the lottery was drawn according to the number sequence. Each member received one package, and the payment was exchanged for the warehouse receipt by bank draft before 11:00 AM on the 11th.

The details are as follows: 140 packages of 10-count Jiahe yarn, priced at 488 yuan. 120 packages of 32-count Jincheng yarn, priced at 830 yuan. 60 packages of 40-count Jincheng yarn, priced at 859 yuan. 40 packages of 40-count double-strand Jincheng yarn, priced at 1,030 yuan. 40 packages of 60-count double-strand Jincheng yarn, priced at 1,250 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was rumored to have restricted exports, and foreign merchants were unable to ship goods. It was also heard that foreign firms required certification from the local industry association before purchasing goods. Therefore, the selling atmosphere in the market became more intense, and those holding goods were selling a lot. Coupled with the distribution period of the Fangjian Company, the supply was particularly smooth. Although retail sales in the market were strong, it was difficult for people to be optimistic in the end.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened with a drop of nine jiao and finally stood at 28 yuan, a significant drop of eight jiao compared to the previous day. Other sparse cloths also saw declines because the distribution price of Fangjian Company was slightly lower than the market price. Only Tiaoli Yuan biji was sought after, and the market was uniquely firm. Colored cloth and shilin cloth remained at the original price. Total transactions for the day were six hundred and sixty bolts.

[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company opened cloth as usual yesterday, resulting in a total of 14,340 bolts of cloth and 540 blankets being booked. A total of 257 households applied, including 26 factory households, who purchased 4,880 bolts of cloth, and 231 cloth stores, who purchased 9,460 bolts of cloth and 540 blankets. Fangjian Company received a total payment of 350,810 yuan.

Also, due to reorganization, the company will temporarily suspend yarn opening for one day today. All yarn to be allocated to the reprocessing industry on that day will be re-allocated on the 13th.

### Increased Sales Volume of Woolen Fabrics

The woolen goods merchants have always maintained normal supply for retail sales, and the recent sales volume has increased several times compared to before August 19. The reason for the decrease in wholesale sales is that the factory's allocation of goods is insufficient, so retail sales have had to be reduced. The prices of wholesale goods are normal.

### Yarn, Cloth, and Foreign Currency Exchanged for 80,000 Tons of Indian Cotton in One Month

According to news from the Textile Export Committee, the committee's handling of the exchange of yarn and cloth for Indian cotton has resulted in a total of 80,000 tons of Indian cotton being exchanged from July to the present. The amount of yarn and cloth shipped from our country was 45,000 pieces. According to this ratio, the adjustment of raw cotton for domestic textile factories is of great benefit. Especially during the period of scarcity, domestic yarn factories have almost entirely spun Indian cotton. After the establishment of the New Flower Yarn and Cloth Guidance Committee, the exchange of yarn and cloth for Indian cotton will be specially strengthened.

### Pinellia Ternata Sales Not Smooth

The new goods of the traditional Chinese medicine Pinellia ternata are already on the way. It is heard that this year's production in Sichuan is the same as in previous years. The production in Shiyang, eastern Zhejiang, is slightly lower than last year. The production in eastern areas has greatly decreased because most tenant farmers have wandered to other places and most have not started planting, amounting to less than one-tenth of previous years. Recently, sales of goods in the market have not been smooth, falling below the limit price to 158 yuan. However, the selected and unified grades are selling well and remain firm at the limit price. Peaches and apricots are becoming more susceptible to insects, and prices are collapsing to 59 yuan and 5 jiao, with the trend still declining. The production of Job's tears in Pucheng has also suffered a poor harvest.

### Lack of Change in Sales, Sparse Transactions in Domestic Tea

In recent days, domestic tea has lacked change due to alternating ins and outs. As for the foreign tea market, the trend has repeatedly shown a positive outlook. Upon consideration, the stock of various goods is increasingly depleted, and the raw tea such as fried green and baked green tea in the producing areas is increasing. Merchants feel that the cost of reproduction in the future will be high. Therefore, the supply is scarce, and the asking price is not discouraged. However, exporters are still happy to purchase, and the process is showing a situation of supply not meeting demand. Transactions are deserted, and the market has finally made progress. Recently, industry insiders said that the French economic delegation is very fond of the Zhenmei green tea and other teas that are popular in North Africa. If they start buying, they will sweep them away. Looking at the future, it can be said to be optimistic.

### Commercial Briefs

People are nervous about sugar, and they are selling out one after another, selling 17th-term raw sugar warehouse receipts for 28 yuan, and spot goods for 28 yuan and 6 jiao, each falling by one yuan sharply. White sugar and medium sugar have also fallen to the limit price one after another, with the former at 30 yuan and 5 jiao, and the latter at 26 yuan and 3 jiao. Local sugar continues to be traded according to the limit.

The Silk Beam Association has recently agreed to allocate 600 bolts each to Dachen and Huaqiang, and 300 bolts each to Meiya and Jinsun, for a total of 1,800 bolts, all allocated to members of the association's sales group at the 819 limit price of 36 yuan and 7 jiao.

Timber transactions remain calm. According to Fu, the price of fir in the producing area is still high, at about 9.5 fen to 1 jiao and 1 fen per foot.

Yesterday's cigarette market: Various cigarettes were traded slightly within the limit. Manufacturers distributed more goods. Each tobacco retailer sold various cigarettes well. Soap was slightly positive because retail sales were more than offset. Various soaps were slightly higher by 3 jiao to 5 jiao compared to yesterday, with Guben soap at 26 yuan and 5 jiao, and Xiangmao soap at 20 yuan and 5 jiao, both of which were traded.

### Academic Conference of the Beiping Research Institute, Hu Shi, Li Shuhua, and Others Give Speeches

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, September 9] The academic research conference of the Beiping Research Institute opened this morning. Li Shizeng represented Chairman Wu Zhihui, and the 19th-anniversary meeting of the institute was held in combination. Forty-three northern members attended. Li Shizeng gave the opening speech, tracing the origins of research institutes in China back to 1919. Vice President Li Shuhua reported on the general situation, recounting the work of the institute's nine research institutes, including physics, radium, chemistry, pharmaceuticals, physiology, zoology, botany, history, and the Northwest Botanical Survey Institute.

Li Shuhua Points Out the Achievements of the Research Institute

And especially pointed out that the Institute of Atomic Nuclei has been changed to the Institute of Atomic Energy, with Qian Sanqiang concurrently serving as director. The Institute of Physics is manufacturing optical instruments to meet the needs of various parties. The Institute of Pharmaceuticals has now identified that the three homologous isomeric molecules contained in "Changshan Salt" have particularly strong anti-malarial properties, exceeding quinine by 100 to 2,000 times. Li said that the scarcity of funds after the war has greatly affected the work. He hopes that the government will pay attention to this point and emphasized that Chinese scholars should bear a part of the world's responsibility. The institute discussed the issue of the research institute system in the afternoon and elected Wu Zhihui as chairman.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, September 9] The academic conference of the Ping Research Institute opened today. Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Yan Jici, director of the Institute of Physics of the Ping Research Institute, successively gave speeches.

Hu Shi Advocates Increasing the Number of Research Institutes

(1) Hu Shi: He believes that China is so large that, in addition to the Academia Sinica, there is only one local research institute, the Ping Research Institute, which is really too few. Therefore, he advocates that research institutes should be established in cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, and in regions such as Zhejiang, Southwest, and Northwest. Hu praised the Ping Research Institute for having more than 600 papers in a short period of 19 years, and its achievements are considered excellent in the world. Therefore, he lamented that China has only had modern universities and research institutions for 50 to 60 years, and the history is very short, and there is a general lack of money, but as long as we work hard, the development of Chinese academic research will still have a bright future.

The Method of Awarding Doctorates Should Be Put into Effect

Hu advocated that research institutes should accept apprentices and condemned the government for formulating the method of awarding doctoral degrees in 1933, but it has never taken effect, resulting in no one being able to obtain a doctoral degree from within the country for more than ten years. He also opposed the government monopolizing the matter and believed that it should be awarded by universities with research institutes. Hu requested that those who had participated in the master's degree examinations at Peking University and Tsinghua University could prove that their level was definitely not inferior to that of foreign doctors. The government should believe this fact. Therefore, during his recent trip to Beijing, in addition to attending the meeting of the Academia Sinica, he decided to submit this suggestion to the government, and especially hoped that President Zhang Boling, who came from a university, would promote it.

Mei Yiqi Emphasizes That Academic Research Has No Regional Boundaries

(2) Mei Yiqi emphasized that academic research should not have regional concepts and should pay attention to cultivating future generations, saying that there are only a few hundred people currently engaged in academic research in China. Finally, he hoped that everyone would cooperate sincerely. (3) Yan Jici: Yan pointed out that there are 30 to 40 times more people engaged in academic research today than ten years ago, but the equipment is getting less and less.

### Peiping Sports Festival - Commemorative Meeting Held - Speeches by Yuan Dunli and Ma John

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 9th] The Peiping September 9th Sports Festival was held at the National Theater under the direction of the City Education Bureau. Yuan Dunli and Ma John gave speeches, discussing the meaning of the September 9th Sports Festival and hoping that those in the sports community would correct the erroneous idea that "sports activities are only for those who study physical education." They emphasized strengthening amateur sports activities, without needing to discuss advanced theories, and should cultivate their own and the public's appreciation of sports activities, so that sports activities can penetrate into the people. Mr. Ma spoke about his understanding of sports, dividing it into three points: (1) Sports is not just about competition, but should recognize what kind of exercise is suitable for training what kind of physique and age group. (2) Do not use rigid methods for exercise, but determine new exercise styles based on the needs of the times. (3) Those in the sports community should use a fixed method to train themselves. He concluded by saying that the meaning of self-improvement is for others. Afterwards, the Physical Education College performed, and various ball games were held in the afternoon at the Sports Field of Fu Jen Catholic University.

Free Talk - Fat Talk - Lao Liu

Thirteen or fourteen years ago, when I had just graduated from university, before the war had started and when my family was still relatively well-off, my weight was 107 pounds. Ma John, a senior figure in the sports world, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Child, you're too light. Eat, eat more!"

Today, I've managed to find a small job where I'm neither rich nor starving, I'm busy every day, I often have to put up with other people's bad moods, and I have a wife and children, so my burdens have naturally increased a lot. And yet - strangely enough, my weight has changed to 187 pounds, and I've become the number one fat man in the office!

Whenever I run into friends on the street, they inevitably say to me with a smile, "Ah, you're fatter than before! A broad mind and a fat body, you must be having a great time, old chap!"

The day before yesterday, a group of my university classmates had a reunion dinner at the alumni association. One of them had just come from Peiping, and we hadn't seen each other for over ten years. When we started catching up, he said, "Everyone else is still the same, except for Lao Liu" - he pointed at me and said with a laugh - "Lao Liu, if I ran into you on the street, I wouldn't even dare say hello to you. After so many years, to become so 'grand', it's really unexpected."

To be honest, I myself find it unexpected. Looking at photos from the past, I was thin and tall, with something of the air of Yang Xiaolou; now, alas! I have to admit, I have something of the demeanor of Hao Shouchang. As for my circumstances, in these past ten years or so, have I ever had such carefree days as in university? Airplanes were strafing overhead, and if you went to look, the corrugated iron sheets were full of bullet holes. My family's financial situation is also much worse than before. Renting rice is unprofitable, and I've been robbed by thieves several times. I've never found a satisfactory job, and I've neglected my studies for so many years that I've forgotten a large part of what I learned in university. After "drifting" along for more than ten years, I've suddenly "drifted" into being a big fat man, which is really quite strange.

Yesterday, I saw a weekly supplement to the New York Herald Tribune at the home of a colleague. There was an article titled "Are You Too Fat?" As soon as I saw it, my heart couldn't help but be moved, and I quickly borrowed it to lie on the bed and read it carefully. I found an answer that I was eager to know - according to experts, being fat doesn't necessarily mean having a broad mind, and gaining weight is unrelated to getting rich; on the contrary, the more unhappy you are, the more likely you are to gain weight.

For example, Dr. Harry Gold, a professor at Cornell University Medical College, said: "The reason for obesity is often a bad mood. When people are unhappy, they often like to eat, saying that it can relieve boredom and sorrow, and as a result, they develop a habit of eating too much. This habit is not easy to break, and psychological treatment is necessary to help."

Dr. Carl Binger said: "Most fat people are fat because they eat too much. Why do they eat so much? Because they often feel hungry. And the reason for hunger is often anxiety. People who are anxious and worried often feel hungry."

Anxiety causes people to eat more. This saying cannot be said to be without reason. In Homer's epic "The Iliad", the warriors are overwhelmed with grief when mourning their fallen comrades, but after the mourning ceremony is over, they immediately eat and drink heavily. Homer uses many lines of poetry to describe how they prepare a grand feast and how they become drunk and full. When I read this passage many years ago, I couldn't help but laugh at it, but now it seems to be exactly what Aldous Huxley called "the whole truth".

A few days ago, I read the memoirs of a certain gentleman who said that after Yuan Shikai was dressed in the dragon robe, he gradually realized that the situation was not right. One morning, he got up early to read telegrams, and when he saw that the overall situation had reached a point beyond salvation, he couldn't help but become lost in thought - his right hand was holding the telegram, and his left hand was putting the steamed buns that were next to him for breakfast into his mouth one by one: he ate as many as eighty buns!

Whether the warriors in Homer's writings were fat is yet to be verified, but it is likely that they were not thin; Yuan Shikai's image is known to all through the coins: fat.

Among the characters in Shakespeare's plays, "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" can be considered melancholic, and European scholars who specialize in Shakespeare say: "Hamlet may have syphilis - he is a fat man."

Let's take a look at the rich people. If you want to talk about millionaires, you naturally have to go to America. Okay, look at the photos of Ford who passed away last year. Ford can be said to be rich, but he was a skinny, wizened old man! What about the oil tycoon Rockefeller? He was also thin! Not to mention anything else, everyone knows that Americans are rich, but isn't the symbol of America, Uncle Sam, a thin old man with a goatee?

Writing to this point, I can't help but stand up and look in the mirror. My fatness remains the same - alas!

On Hobbies - Why Bother

Life is valuable because of hobbies.

People need a normal occupation to maintain their livelihood; they also need one or more hobbies to regulate their lives, or, artistically speaking, to decorate their lives, just as curtains are used to decorate glass windows.

A normal occupation is like a person's pair of eyes, while hobbies are like the eyelashes that grow around the eyes. The function of eyelashes is not only to decorate the bright eyes, but also to prevent dust from entering the eye membrane. Life is also like this. When sand and mud are mixed into life, you will feel melancholy and annoyed. The only thing that can prevent dust from entering the eye membrane of life is a hobby.

Originally, the occupation that we are usually engaged in, when we first stepped into the office belonging to this occupation, even if there were words such as "interested in" and "willing to regard as a lifelong career" written on the application you filled out, after years of accumulation, there will inevitably be a day when you feel bored. There is a folk saying that "if you eat from one profession, you will be wronged in that profession," which is a conclusion obtained from accumulated experience. Why is it that you were determined to be interested in the beginning, but in the end you feel "wronged"? The key lies in the fact that once the occupation you are engaged in becomes a means of maintaining your livelihood, it is like the work of grinding rice into flour, and your Excellency is the donkey turning the millstone. "Bitterly hating pressing the needle and thread year after year, making wedding clothes for others!" This is the donkey's cry.

Regarding donkeys grinding flour, we can encounter this monotonous scene when traveling to small cities. A donkey whose eyes are covered with screens is tethered to the handle of the millstone, turning in a small circle, squeaking and groaning, what a monotonous chore! In the old days, there was a hired worker who did exactly the work of replacing a donkey - grinding flour every day, and the letters he wrote back home were mostly hidden complaints: "The hat is like the sea, the socks are like the river, the feet don't leave the door, but I walk a thousand miles a day. If there is a boat, I will walk home as a boat puller." The last two sentences indicate that the hired worker's income is meager, and if he wants to go home, he must wait for a convenient boat to go to the countryside and work as a boat puller for others. It is a universal rule in the universe that there will inevitably be resentment in an occupation that is engaged in for the sake of making a living; however, we must make a living, and there is no way to get rid of a normal occupation, so we can only pursue a way to regulate it, and that is to promote hobbies.

Someone's hobby may seem like a "wronged" occupation to others, but because people with this kind of hobby do not belong to the work of donkeys grinding flour, it is a pleasure to regulate life. Therefore, President Roosevelt, in addition to managing all kinds of affairs, used fishing as a way to regulate his body and mind, and angling became Roosevelt's hobby, even though in the eyes of fishermen who "fish for a living", angling is a heavy burden.

Gamblers are listless in the office, but as soon as four people get together to make a table, they appear energetic, and even if they gamble all night, they are not tired, as the saying goes, "When the dominoes click, the eyes become clear." However, we are against hobbies that are addicted to alcohol, because after indulging in them, they waste time and lose their jobs, and fall into the evil path of indulging in things and losing their ambition, and their behavior is no longer healthy.

Therefore, hobbies must fall within the category of "good hobbies", so that they can help normal occupations. They must be like machine oil, so that after people obtain them, they can make normal work progress smoothly and reduce the troubles of torment.

Therefore, I say: life is valuable because of hobbies.

Letters to the Editor

(1) Mr. Hu Yaguang writes: "The article 'Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran', which was published some time ago, was written after hearing elders talk about the childhood histories of successful people at home and abroad. In a moment of excitement, I wrote and sent it to this column without thinking, based on the principle of 'heroes not fearing humble origins'. Mr. Feng is one of the people I admire in my life, and there was no ulterior motive whatsoever. I would like to offer my sincere apologies to Mr. Feng and request that you correct the (mistake) on my behalf."

(2) The Municipal Health Bureau writes: "After reviewing the article 'Garbage', which was published in your newspaper's 'Free Talk' column on August 22, regarding the accumulation of garbage at 930 Lane, Liyang Road, which is detrimental to hygiene, we ordered the Sanitation Brigade to investigate and reply: 'Mr. Liu's residence at No. 8 in the lane is under renovation, resulting in a large amount of concrete being dumped in the lane, which is not garbage. We have ordered the soldiers to remove it completely.' We hereby request that you check and disclose this information. (The following is omitted.)

Evasion of Military Service - Gongsun Wu

Bai Juyi's poem "The Old Man with a Broken Arm of Xinfeng" has been listed as anti-war literature by some, and is also included in middle school Chinese textbooks. At that time, warlords were fighting each other, and there were anti-war calls among the people. Looking at it today, it is indeed a relic. The current regulations on punishing crimes that obstruct military service state: "Those who incite others to avoid military service shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years in peacetime and imprisonment of one to seven years in wartime." Therefore, even when discussing poetry and ancient history, one must be cautious. The previous regulations also state: "Those who intentionally injure their bodies shall be sentenced to imprisonment of up to three years." Those who fear the law should not imitate what the old man of Xinfeng did. The old man of Xinfeng must have broken his arm in the dead of night, knowing that it was illegal. The Tang Code states: "Or there are those who falsely accuse others of crimes in order to seek pushback; or intentionally commit minor offenses, even staying on the run; or intentionally injure themselves; or falsely claim to be ill." This shows that in the Tang Dynasty, there were many people who avoided military service, and their techniques were clever, and the government had strictly guarded against them. Some say, would those who would rather lose an arm be afraid of several years of imprisonment? Suppose there are those who cut off their hands and feet and then receive punishment, after the term of imprisonment is over, they will never be able to serve in the military. The law is sometimes exhausted, and if patriotism is strong, everyone will strive to serve, and there is no news of self-mutilation to avoid service. Therefore, it is better to guide people with virtue than to punish them with law.

Excerpts from the Continued Collection of Clouds Between the Titled Orchids (Part 1) - Jilan

There are petty people, and then we see gentlemen, but gentlemen do not cut off things, they are harmonious but different, and their pure fragrance is far away. (1)

Changshu Su

Someone asked a man from Luoyang to write an orchid for Mr. Yun Jian, saying that it must be exquisite so that it could be offered to a new noble; the gentleman said: this public is just a few pounds of meat. (1) It is better to buy more green and red and ask Shi Shi to paint peonies. The person said: What about me? The gentleman said: Slightly bony, should get a brush.

Ji Yuan

Guangchang fed chickens, and I waited on my mother. Soon I saw that the chicken was full and lying in the shade of the banana tree, so I arranged the paper to repay the kindness of the dust-free elegance! On the sixth month of the year of Wuzi, Bai Jiao wrote Ji Yuan for Brother Renguang.

Hui Yongchun Mei

The orchid has a famous big fortune, and Yun asked if he loved its flower but hated its name; there is a famous big one, and Yun Jian thought it was harmless.

Xiuqi an monk spoke to a layman one day about Huangshan Orchid, the leaves were one span long, and the fragrance was heard for ten miles, and the layman was already longing for it. Today, I use a large brush to write a huge painting, and the monk looked at it and said: It is exactly a realistic portrayal of a corner of the waterfall, when did the layman enter the mountain? Yun Jian wrote down the matter.

Exposed Root Orchid

Answering the spring light, Lu Sui is in the mud, so he pretends to be in this state, and the heart is not far away. I hope to show it to A Chang, so that he can be brave and decisive. I wish my heart were good!

Although Chu has talent, he threatens Shichuan; Shen Ni is in the village, a master Qiu is ear-ten steps away, there must be fragrant grass, the world sees dimly, who can see it again? I write this with sigh!

Da Yipin

The secluded fragrance has escaped, I don't know if I will go out of the mountain in the evening, so that the world can see this one product!

Shanghai Plum

The mountain wife did not know where she found a piece of paper, and looked at it and smiled secretly; when I released the scroll, I stretched it out in front of my eyes and said: This gentleman used to paint shepherd's purse! Now add vigor and call it orchid. The layman said: If I write Huangshan Plum, the lady will think it is a cattail, less seen, so much is strange, the same disease in ancient and modern times! In fact, the layman has not been to Huangshan, only heard the monk say it, haha! Fu Weng fills in the blank.

Stream Orchid

There are lush grasses in the Central Plains, and there are orchids in the remote streams, I do not look at you, I speak with eternal sigh!

Moon Pendant

The scorching heat of the day makes it impossible to sleep, and the cool morning has the fun of scattered flowers. Boil a pot of tea, carefully grind ink, stretch paper and catch a pen, and the happy women and children are in their dreams, and there are no early visitors to disturb them. I got this, so I sent it to my Ximing regret Wai, and those who touched the heat have not seen it!

The spring breeze is as old as ever, the orchid words are forgotten, and the clouds of Dongshan enter the gentleman's hall together!

Jilan

Dongpo Weng wrote flowers and bamboos, mixed with thorns, meaning that a gentleman can tolerate petty people; Fu Weng is a righteous thorn to protect the fragrant envoys, and if you ask Si Qing Weng, you should be the first. In the midsummer of Wuzi, after the rain, there was a little coolness, and suddenly a clear interest moved me, so I wrote this and casually inscribed it.

Emerald Canopy Lotus

I don't see guests for half a day, and I get several books and forget to see people and be happy! Send it to Yuan Weng Qing for appreciation. If Shi Ran sees it, he should be a pavilion.

Potted Orchid

The afternoon wine has not woken up, the hand is floating and the eyes are small, and the oath is made with Yan A, so I got this frame. Please do not judge each other by artistic matters, you should cherish this treasure for the world!

Yang Su Lotus

Or the news of hoeing orchids, "Summer" room is cold, thinking of Xiao Weng's sigh of no land, different times of the same pain!

Clear

I write my intentions, how can I follow the secular track to seek coloring? Try to taste it in leisure and silence, don't you see that you want to spit out words when you face each other? What should I report, I already know it, a chuckle!

Double Cluster Mountain Orchid

Many people eat poorly, and children's games have come to this point. A certain old woman said: If I can get Jian Yunwen to live in my hands, I will have no worries when I am old! Yun Jian Sheng said: But what if there are more children? If it is a golden hand, it will definitely be given away! Bai Jiu's playful writing.

Simple Brush Guan

People want to ask for more, but the son wants to ask for less, people want to persecute, but the son says, let's wait a while, saying that it is not Xiang Zu's confidant, so he is already happy with the orchid king!

Thorns

Scattered wood is born with my feelings, and I will offer my ink to it for a hundred years, Yun: I only got two, one of which will be kept as a legacy. If I can make my jasmine shine outside the thorns, and this heart is clear, Jiangshang is not in vain!
