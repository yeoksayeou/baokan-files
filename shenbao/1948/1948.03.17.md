### Director of the Committee on Policy Toward China Talks; The United States Will Ultimately Actively Assist China; The Far East Division is Controlled by Leftists and Must Be Clarified

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Mr. Colbert, the director of the American Committee on Policy Toward China, recently arrived in the capital for a visit and is scheduled to return to the United States from Shanghai on the 17th. Colbert met with reporters on the 16th and commented on the Sino-American relations: "The mistakes of the past American policy of 'wait and see' toward China will soon be paid for." When commenting on the communist parties around the world, Colbert said: "Whether in the United States, the Czech Republic, the Panama Canal, or China, the Americans have viewed the communists as enemies of the United States." Colbert said that Mrs. Luce, the president of the American Committee on Policy Toward China, believes that the Far East Division of the US Department of State is "controlled by leftists and sympathizers with communism, and this situation must be clarified in order to form a clear policy toward China." Colbert continued to explain that the reason why the American Congress has remained silent on the matter of assistance to China in the past is to avoid stimulating public sentiment. Currently, the US government is suggesting economic assistance to China, while the Congress prefers to provide both economic and military assistance to China at the same time. Colbert believes that in the future, both may be partially realized. Colbert emphasized that if the Republican Party wins in this election, the American assistance to China may become more active. The Republican Party's policy has recently been formally announced by the Republican leader, Governor Dewey of New York. Other influential figures in the Republican Party, such as Republican House Leader Martin, Senator Taft, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, all sympathize with military assistance to China. Therefore, once the Republican Party wins the election, it is expected that a large-scale aid plan for China will be implemented.

### The Soviet Union Rejects Our Protest; Chennault Refutes It

[United Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] Chennault declared here today that the Soviet Union had rejected China's protest about the shooting down of civil aviation airplanes by Soviet airplanes, arguing that it was without foundation. In reality, the shooting by the Soviet planes was completely unjustified. The Soviet claim that the Chinese airplanes entered the airspace over Lushun and thus "fired a warning shot" was untrue because the shooting incident took place 100 miles outside of the Lushun-Dalian area. The exact position was 38 degrees north latitude, 120 degrees 20 minutes east longitude. At the time of the Soviet aircraft's machine-gunning, the civilian aviation aircraft was not flying close to the Lushun-Dalian base. Mr. Chennault said he would have to stay on for several more weeks before he could return to Shanghai.

### Communist Countries Create World Disorder

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng said in a speech at the banquet of Taiwan Provincial People's Representatives today: "The politics of all countries have not stabilized after the war, and the economies have not recovered. The reason for this is that communist countries are obstructing them from within. The general situation in European countries is deteriorating day by day, which is caused by communist countries. Communist countries attempt to launch a third world war, intending to create an unstable situation in all countries, thereby manipulating the world situation. The Chinese Communist Party's rebellion has caused even more damage to China than to other countries. The Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Parties of various countries share the same ideology, that is, the conspiracy to seize power."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Price Stabilization Group of the Overall Economic Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 16th. More than ten people, including Zhang Jiaji, Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, Deng Feihuang, Liu Zhendong, He Haoruo, Zou Bingwen, Guan Jiyu, and Gu Yuzhen, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Chen Qitian. They discussed ways to stabilize and control prices and achieved preliminary results, which will be submitted to the Overall Economic Committee for discussion and decision on the 18th. At the meeting on the 16th, both the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Overall Economic Committee presented data on current price increases. Zhang Jiaji, Governor of the Central Bank, also put forward his opinions on price controls, arguing that the control mechanism should be strengthened and the banks should be strictly managed. Liu Zhendong held the opposite view, believing that managing the banks was not as important as using foreign deposits. Liu also suggested that some foreign personnel with no important duties should be recalled to save national foreign exchange. The committee members discussed for a long time and reached two preliminary results: (1) Strengthen the price control mechanism. The Price Committee of the Overall Economic Committee should be strengthened in the future. (2) Adopt a formulaic calculation method to make price increases tend to be stable, changing from soaring to moderate. The Overall Economic Committee has drafted a calculation formula for the price increase of eleven items, including rice, wheat, coal, cotton, flour, yarn, silk, and cocoons, which will determine the degree of price increase based on the interrelationship between (1) the cost of living index, (2) rice prices, and (3) foreign exchange prices.

(2) After the public funds of military agencies are transferred to the Central Bank or the national treasury agent, the Central Bank and the national treasury agent may overdraw the same amount to various banks. (3) The transfer procedures should be handled directly and the deposit institution should be notified. (4) The interest on the deposits of military agencies can still be maintained as before after being transferred to the Central Bank. (5) The deposits of state-owned enterprises may be exempted. The above methods can be implemented after approval, the purpose of which is to avoid the inflow of military and public deposits into the market and to stimulate prices.

Tax Laws Concern People's Burdens; Committees Engage in Fierce Debate

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 16th passed the Income Tax Law, Stamp Tax Law, and Commodity Tax Law, as well as the income tax thresholds and rates for the 37th year. Because these tax laws concern the people's burdens, various committee members spoke on the tax categories, tax rates, and tax amounts during the discussion. The dispute over the Commodity Tax Law was the most intense, with two-thirds of the committee members speaking. The Stamp Tax Law had the fewest amendments.

The Income Tax Law has a total of 163 articles, and reading it took one and a half hours. The first point of contention was the provision in Article 3 regarding the exemption of elementary school teachers' salaries from the second category of income. Wang Yuxiang proposed an amendment, stating that since elementary school teachers were exempt from tax, and university and middle school teachers also had difficult financial lives, they should all be exempt. Chen Guyuan, Liu Butong, Liu Keqiao, Chen Changheng, Sun Jiulu, and others opposed the amendment, arguing that this law was a regular law, while the difficult financial lives of university and middle school teachers were an extraordinary phenomenon. The current tax threshold was very high, and it would have little impact on them. Wang's amendment was rejected. Article 4, regarding the income tax on controlled enterprises, stipulated a tax rate of 5% to 25% of the total amount. Wang Yuxiang, Sun Jiulu, Chen Haicheng, Yang Zhaoyun, and others believed that this was too low and should be raised to 5% to 40%. Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chen Guyuan, Chen Changheng, and others argued that the tax rate was too high, and capital would easily escape. Zhang Zhaoyuan explained that the tax rate in the United States was as high as 90%, but other conditions made this tax rate easy to implement. Wang Yuxiang denied that high tax rates cause capital to escape, arguing that the main reason for escape was social instability. Finally, Liu Butong's compromise suggestion was put to a vote and passed, amending the rate to 5% to 30%. Article 157 was slightly amended in wording and then passed in its entirety. The income tax thresholds and rates were also slightly amended: (1) The tenth item of the first category of income tax on profit-making enterprises was amended to "for income between 5 billion yuan and less than 100 billion yuan, a tax of 25%." The eleventh item was amended to: "for income of 100 billion yuan or more, a uniform tax of 30%." (2) The second item of the comprehensive income tax deduction was amended to "the education deduction is 10 million yuan per person" (please refer to the first page of yesterday's newspaper).

The Stamp Tax Law has a total of 32 articles. The schedule of tax rates was omitted during the reading to save time. The main amendment was only to change "judicial organs" in the articles to "courts."

By the time the Commodity Tax Law was discussed, it was already late, so only the amended articles were read. Article 3, regarding the commodities subject to commodity tax, and Article 4, regarding the tax rates, both caused much debate. Liu Zhiping first spoke on behalf of the people of the North, arguing that it was unfair to tax wheat flour but not rice and that it should be abolished. Chen Changheng, who advocated taxing wheat flour, agreed to reduce it by half, but Liu Zhiping still did not agree. Finally, a vote was taken, and the original item "wheat flour, all machine-made wheat flour is included" was abolished by a majority vote, and the ad valorem tax rate of 2.5% was also abolished. When discussing the tax rates, Er Kang believed that some tax rates were too high and others were too low. Chen Changheng, Liu Keqiao, Cheng Yuanzhen, Liu Zhiping, Liu Tong, and others spoke in succession. The main points of contention were: cosmetics, tinfoil, and joss paper should be raised. Cement and sugar should be lowered. Finally, President Sun presided over the meeting and presented each item for discussion.

Draft National Defense Organization Law Returned to Executive Yuan for Re-Drafting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The National Defense Organization Law submitted by the Executive Yuan has been rejected by the Legislative Yuan. The original law was returned to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review because the proposed draft law completely violated the six legislative principles. The case had previously been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan's Military Committee and the Legal System Committee, which raised the above-mentioned opinions. During the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 16th, there was unanimous opposition, and it was decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting based on the review opinions. Peng Chunshi and Wang Qin and others elaborated on the contradiction between the spirit of the organization law and the legislative principles, stating that the original legislative principles were: (1) the military is subordinate to the government, (2) separation of powers and functions, (3) unification of the army, navy, and air force, (4) hierarchical division of responsibilities, (5) reference to the most advanced national defense systems in the world, (6) suitability to national conditions, but the spirit of the organization law was contrary to these six. Wang Jun also pointed out that the so-called unification of the army, navy, and air force was actually a unification of one person. In the national defense systems of various countries, there is no case where military training, military orders, and military administration belong to one agency. In our country, in addition to the Minister of National Defense, there is also a Chief of Staff. The Minister is not greater than the Chief of Staff, not smaller than the Chief of Staff, nor equal to the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff is not smaller than the Minister, not greater than the Minister, nor equal to the Minister. This is suitable to national conditions. Chen Changheng focused on the financial aspect, stating that the Audit Department cannot inquire about military expenses, but military expenses account for 70% or 80% of the annual budget. In this case, the Audit Department can be abolished and handled by the Ministry of National Defense. The budgeted number of soldiers is 6 million when reported. How many are there when fighting a war? Liu Zhiping even said: Such an organization law is neither beautiful nor heroic. It may as well be published in the newspaper for everyone to see. Finally, it was decided to pass according to the review opinions and return it to the government for re-drafting based on the legislative principles and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### On Rationing

— Chen Daisun

The comprehensive rationing of food in the five major cities, according to official claims: has already started in Nanjing and Shanghai in March, and is scheduled to start in Tianjin, Beiping, and Guangzhou in April. The initial four months of implementation are set as a trial period, but the government will strive to make this system a permanent method of controlling food sources. This is the government's first attempt at a food rationing system. The proposal for this plan stems from the US aid agreement to China. According to Article 2 of the Sino-US relief agreement, the Chinese government "should establish rationing and price control systems in major Chinese cities where the environment permits, in order to ensure that people of all levels, regardless of their purchasing power, should obtain a fair allocation of relief materials imported from abroad or produced locally." Because the US food supplied under this agreement is insufficient for comprehensive rationing, the decided method is that, during this trial period, half of the rations will be taken from US supplies, and the other half will be supplied by the Ministry of Food and the five municipal governments. The trial period is limited to four months because the US food provided under the US aid agreement is only for this short period of rationing.

If rationing is limited to US food, and the target of rationing is limited to a certain class of people, the purpose of rationing should be relief or subsidy. However, now it is full rationing - although during the trial period, only the citizens of the five cities are the target of rationing - and the government is responsible for supplying half of the rations in addition to US food. It can be seen that this method is to use US food as a foundation, implement rationing, with the aim of stabilizing food prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Our evaluation of this method and its future effectiveness should also be based on this purpose.

Quantitative rationing is indeed an important distribution system for controlling prices. Of course, we should not mistakenly believe that as long as there is a quantitative rationing system, prices will be stabilized. Price increases have various conditions. If the conditions exist, even with a rationing system, prices will still rise. But if there is no quantitative rationing to cooperate with the implementation of various price control measures, there will be loopholes in this system, and the results of price stabilization will be affected.

If this method aims at stabilizing prices, then (1) the so-called rationing must be strictly implemented as quantitative rationing, and (2) the government must have effective control over the supply of all food.

Strictly implementing quantitative rationing means that the total amount of food purchased by each person per month, regardless of the source, has a fixed address. The quantitative limit is based on the amount of consumption each person should have. The main use of the quantitative rationing system is to restrict consumers—especially wealthy consumers. In a free market, as long as consumers have money, they can use all their money to bid for goods. Consumers' intensified bidding is the reason for strengthening the price increase. Under the quantitative rationing system, the total amount that each person can buy has a limit, and having money cannot arbitrarily bid for goods. Part of the purchasing power in society is frozen and cannot become an effective demand for goods in the market. However, the minimum needs of the general public can be met equally. This method focuses on the allocation of food supplied by the United States and food supplied by the Ministry of Food and various municipal governments. The total amount allocated to each city each month from these two sources is actually less than the monthly consumption required by each city. Taking Beiping as an example, with a population of 1.7 million, assuming that each large household needs 30 catties of flour per month and each small household needs 15 catties, 970,000 bags are needed each month. However, the food allocation meeting decided on a ration of 15 catties per month for everyone, regardless of age or gender, totaling 580,000 bags. If the rations distributed by the government are limited to those supplied by the United States and the two types of official food supplied by the Ministry of Food and the Municipal Government, the people still have to rely on the free market for their needs beyond the 15 catties per person. Furthermore, if there is a quantitative limit on the purchase of official food, and there are still no restrictions on buying and selling in the free market, then this method is not strictly implementing a quantitative rationing system, because the total amount of purchases by the people is still not limited. The effectiveness of the quantitative rationing system will not be produced. Therefore, in order to strictly implement the quantitative rationing system, the total amount purchased by each citizen each month must be stipulated. If the method of purchasing with vouchers is adopted, and the total amount purchased per month is stipulated as 30 catties for each large household and 15 catties for each small household, then each voucher can not only be used to buy 15 catties of official food per person per month but also to purchase the difference in the general market. Of course, the municipal government can also be responsible for supplying all the food needs of all citizens. (In this case, the general market will be completely abolished.) Official food rationing is also quantitative rationing. However, this further method is not necessary.

Another aspect of quantitative rationing is that the government must have effective control over the supply of goods. The food control required by the food quantitative rationing system does not necessarily require the cancellation of the ordinary market, with official food supplying all the rationing. If the government must purchase the entire amount of food for rationing, then it is considered effective control. Although the rationing system is limited to the five cities, the capital required is considerable. In fact, the so-called effective control only refers to (1) unblocking food sources, so that food from outside the city can come regularly; (2) cracking down on hoarding and speculation; (3) eliminating the black market, so that food purchasers must purchase with vouchers and must not exceed the quantitative limit, so as to avoid having a quota but lacking food to ration, or having food to ration but being manipulated by speculators. In fact, the current government already has a large amount of official food in hand when promoting this method, and what it relies on is already very superior. The official food in hand is of course completely controlled. Since it controls a portion of the supply, the question is how to control the required difference. The points mentioned above are on the one hand administrative technical issues; on the other hand, they are law enforcement issues. The latter is more important. If the government cannot sanction the illegal activities of bureaucrats, wealthy families, and special figures: then speculation, hoarding, and the black market will still exist. How can effective control of the food supply be achieved?

There is also the issue of food prices. This method stipulates that the rationing price is equal to 95% of the market price and fluctuates with the market price. Some people suspect, since it is official food, why can't the official price be much lower than the market price, so that the common people can get some real benefits? Why does the official price have to fluctuate with the market price? The problem lies in the purpose of rationing. If the purpose of rationing is relief or subsidy, then a low price is justified. A low price is equivalent to giving a gift. Giving gifts is not impossible; it just depends on whether it should be given. As long as there is a need for relief or subsidy, then the government is willing to use the method of giving food to achieve this purpose, which is not impossible. However, if it is relief or subsidy, why is a no price is better than a low price. A zero price at least has one advantage, which is that the nature of relief or subsidy is more obvious. Furthermore, if it is to be the most relief, it should only benefit the poor, and the rich and the poor should not receive relief equally. If it is a subsidy, then those who need to be subsidized must have a reason for being subsidized in their work or position. With the single qualification of citizens of the five cities, there is no reason to be relieved or subsidized. Therefore, if the purpose of this method is relief or subsidy, then full rationing is unreasonable. Since it is full rationing, it should not be relief or subsidy. However, if official food fluctuates with the market price, then what is the use of stabilizing market prices? Originally, quantitative rationing should have a price limit policy to cooperate with it. This method is indeed lacking. We believe that this shows the realistic attitude of those who formulated this method. The effectiveness of quantitative rationing in stabilizing prices lies in restricting consumption to reduce effective social demand. If inflation is progressing very slightly, and other measures - such as cracking down on hoarding, speculation, the black market, etc. - are quite effective, the reduction in consumption may offset the impact of inflation. However, if inflation surges forward, the power of consumption reduction is too small in comparison, and the market price must continue to rise. The current situation is like this. We guess that the people who formulated the rationing method believe that under today's severe inflation, no matter what steps are taken, food prices will still rise in the future. If there is a price limit, the price limit may also need to be adjusted with the market price, then the price limit is equal to a mere formality. There is only one hope, that since the government has absolute control over a portion of the food, the elements and power of speculation that can hoard the remaining portion of the food supply can be greatly reduced. If the government can take this opportunity to strictly control the ordinary market that supplies this portion of food, and strive to eliminate hoarding and the black market, then after the implementation of the rationing method, although the natural price increase of food following the general price increase is inevitable, the sharp increase caused by human factors may be eliminated. The work of stabilizing food prices is not without a little help.

### Truman to Address Congress Today on Major US Policy Declaration: Military Preparedness to Resist Totalitarian Aggression

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] President Truman will address a joint session of the hastily convened House and Senate on the 17th, delivering a large-scale "preparedness plan" based on the principle of using American military strength to support its foreign policy. This plan will be used to ensure American security to guard against any consequences arising from the United States thoroughly implementing the Truman Doctrine and supporting any country in Europe resisting totalitarian aggression. Sources say that the Scandinavian countries are also included within the scope of the Truman Doctrine. The legislative measures that President Truman will recommend have not yet been revealed, but it is understood that President Truman is now under significant pressure to present a model plan to mobilize American resources to resist threats to the integrity of European countries. According to well-informed sources, the measures currently under discussion include rebuilding the national conscription system, restoring wartime control over industry, restoring the lend-lease program, and declaring a national emergency. Some compare the current situation to the fall of France in 1940, when then-President Roosevelt declared a national emergency and called on the entire country to implement a large-scale "preparedness plan." The fact that President Truman will address Congress was announced yesterday by White House Press Secretary Ross, but Ross did not clarify the reason for the President's address, only saying that the content of the address is related to the situation abroad.

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] President Truman will deliver a solemn and definitive declaration of American foreign policy to the joint session of both Houses. According to American tradition, the convening of a joint session is for the purpose of issuing historical declarations, and the fact that President Truman notified Congress shortly before the convening of the joint session further demonstrates the urgency of the declaration to be issued. In light of the widespread rumors and war stories of the past week, Congressional figures expect that what Truman will announce will be an extremely serious policy with major implications for the development of the European situation. The President's address to the joint session of both Houses shows that his policy will require legislative action.

Main Points of the Declaration

[Reuters dispatch from Washington, dated 16th] Sources close to the White House told Washington reporter Pearson that Truman's policy address to the joint session of both Houses would include the following affirmative responsibilities: (1) Soviet interference in the internal affairs of Greece, Turkey, Italy, France, and Finland will be immediately followed by American action; (2) Truman will declare that this action will not only be diplomatic severance but will far exceed the scope of severance; (3) The United States will publicly endorse the West European Union with a guarantee of military assistance; (4) Truman will request increased military spending to strengthen American military strength, especially air force strength, and will request an appropriation of three billion dollars to build long-range bombers that will penetrate deep into the Soviet Union in future wars. Pearson said that this declaration will include the final words that the United States will say.

### US Senate Unanimously Passes Law to Arm Merchant Ships at Any Time

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The US Senate today unanimously passed a bill permitting the arming of merchant ships in the event of a national emergency. The bill, once approved by the House of Representatives and signed by the President, will become law. The law authorizing the arming of merchant ships during World War II expired last year. The purpose of this bill is to make the authority to arm merchant ships permanent. The definition of a national emergency is stipulated as "any time the President determines that the security of the United States is threatened by the use or imminent use of force by any foreign government or organization against the United States, its citizens, its property, or its commercial interests."

The memorandum pointed out that although the differences between the East and the West have deepened, it is believed that an open conflict will not occur for the time being, as Western countries are not yet prepared for war, and the Soviet Union is only consolidating its security in Europe and does not want to take the most radical steps.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 15th] It is reliably learned that the Finnish government has instructed its delegation negotiating a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union to strive to ensure that, in the event of war, the Soviet Union may not send troops into Finnish territory without the specific request of the Finnish government, and that Finnish troops may only be used within Finnish territory in the event of war.

A report from the committee's advance personnel in Jerusalem reiterated that unless security is restored in Palestine, the UN General Assembly's partition resolution cannot be implemented. [United Press, New York, 15th] The United States, China, and France formally asked the Arabs and Jews who are facing each other in battle on the 15th whether they would agree to a ceasefire in the Holy Land.

The three countries also asked the six Arab representatives to the United Nations whether they would be willing to cooperate to make the ceasefire effective. The presentation of this motion to end the bloodshed in Palestine and seek an overall solution came after a closed-door meeting of the four powers on the Palestine issue.

### Wave of Labor Unrest in the US

100,000 Meatpackers Strike

[United Press, Pittsburgh, 15th] About half of the nation's bituminous coal grinders, 40 strong, went on strike today in support of Coal Miners Union President Lewis's demand for miners' pensions.

The strike gradually moved west from the eastern states at midnight (1:00 PM Shanghai time). Due to different time zones in different regions, this measure allowed the strike to begin at midnight everywhere. Picketing lines were organized when the strike began. The union said there were 140 slaughterhouses nationwide and 100,000 workers, all of whom were on strike. The first strikers were 3,000 workers in the New York area.

### FAO Closes

Address of Asian Branch Not Fixed

Japan and Korea May Be Listed as Members in the Future

[Central News Agency, Baguio, 16th, United Press] The four-week United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization conference has come to a close.

### The Future President of Italy Appears to Be None Other Than Nicola

[United Press, Rome, 15th] Political observers here predicted today that the parliament to be elected on April 18 will elect current interim President Nicola as Italy's first official president. However, Nicola, who is 69 years old, is weak and ill and has long intended to retire. If elected, he will definitely decline in order to retire. Nicola was originally a timid believer in parliamentarianism, selfless and impartial. People from all parties are happy to associate with him, so he has no political enemies in his life. Therefore, it is quite difficult to find another presidential candidate who can be accepted by all parties. Under these circumstances, all parties may unanimously ask him to reluctantly take on the burden.

### Shanghai and Tianjin Legal Communities Petition Judiciary to Postpone Special Criminal Court; Consider Creation of This Deformed Tribunal to Affect Constitutional Future

[Our report] With the Special Criminal Court being established and scheduled to begin hearing cases next month, the Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that proceedings should be postponed until the draft law is passed by the Legislative Yuan. Yesterday, it separately petitioned the Nanjing Judicial Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Judicial Administration, and National Political Council, stating, "Yesterday, according to reports in the Shanghai newspapers, the Special Criminal Court was established on the 11th of this month and began operating immediately. This association was shocked upon hearing this news. The draft of the Organization Law of the Special Criminal Court is currently in the review stage in the Legislative Yuan. The fact that the Special Criminal Court was established before the draft law was passed is a terrible precedent unheard of in Chinese and foreign judicial history. Moreover, in the year of constitutional implementation, the creation of a deformed trial system and the fragmentation of a gradually complete legal system is, we deeply believe, unacceptable. Furthermore, according to the draft regulations of the Organization Law of the Court, the applicable laws are those with the highest possible punishment being death or life imprisonment, with one trial being final and no appeal allowed. These are matters of the greatest importance related to the fundamental rights of the people. If a special court that does not conform to the organization of the courts engages in deformed trials, it will cause public concern and deepen popular grievances. The future of constitutionalism is unimaginable. This association, feeling endangered, cannot remain silent. We dare to contribute our humble opinion and telegraph to your Yuan (Ministry), earnestly requesting that you reconsider carefully and consult with the relevant Yuans and Ministries. Please order the Special Criminal Court to temporarily postpone proceedings until the draft law has been formally passed by the Legislative Yuan, in order to uphold the Constitution and promote the rule of law."

### Demanding Immediate Departure: Wounded Veterans Surround North Station; Station Master and Others Beaten; All Trains Delayed

[Our Report] Yesterday, one thousand and seventy wounded veterans from various northeastern battlefields arrived in Shanghai via the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhang vessel from Tianjin. Of these, 297 were sent to Danyang Rear Hospital for recuperation, and 773 were sent to Suzhou Rear Hospital. At approximately 1:00 PM, the Joint Logistics Headquarters dispatched personnel to the Railway Bureau Military Transportation Office to arrange for transportation vehicles. It was agreed that a temporary "Sanitary Train" would be added to transport the wounded veterans, with four additional dedicated cars to be attached to Train No. 52 departing at 4:40 AM this morning. Later, the wounded soldiers complained about the late departure time, so the cars were reassigned to Train No. 58 departing at 5:45 PM last night.

The wounded soldiers then demanded an additional two dedicated cars and a tea and water car. After lengthy negotiations, much time had passed, and the repeated loading and unloading of vehicles caused considerable inconvenience. As it was already dark, the train still had not departed. The wounded soldiers in the cars became impatient and repeatedly sent representatives to urge the station master to expedite the departure. However, the station authorities, constrained by traffic order and scheduling regulations, could not readily approve the requests, leading to a misunderstanding. At 8:40 PM, several hundred veterans swarmed and surrounded the station master's office, causing chaos. The on-duty station master and others fled. Passengers, seeing the severity of the situation, also scrambled to escape. The platform station master, Lu Xiu, was the first to be beaten and injured. Wang Ronglin, a station worker from the general station master's office, along with an electrician, a car inspector, and five others involved in car numbering, were also beaten and injured. At 9:00 PM, the general station master, Liu Shizhong, arrived upon hearing the news, and, with the assistance of Section Chief Liu of the Military Transportation Office, made every effort to persuade and assure that the train would depart immediately, preventing further escalation of the situation. However, within the three hours before the departure of the train, the dispute remained unresolved, and all arriving and departing trains at the North Station were blocked. All southbound trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line were held at Zhenru Station and other locations, while northbound trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line were congested between Xujiahui Station and the West Station. Eight trains, including Nos. 26, 80, 43, 56, 7, 22 (West Lake), 15, and 79, were either delayed in arrival or departure by varying amounts of time, ranging from one to two hours.

### Coal Briquettes Cannot Be Procured in Large Quantities; Universal Distribution Plan Abandoned

[Our Report] The Social Affairs Bureau previously planned to implement a comprehensive distribution of coal briquettes, with each of the city's 700,000+ households receiving one "dan" (approximately 50 kg) per month. According to Director Wu yesterday, this plan has been abandoned because it is difficult to procure an additional 200,000+ "dan" of coal. The bureau will only continue to distribute coal briquettes to 500,000 industrial and vocational workers.

### Cracking Down on Gold and Foreign Currency Operations on Qipu Road; Radio Transmitter Seized on Ningbo Road

The Economic Section of the Investigation Division of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a tip and cracked down on a black market gold trading operation at a building on Qipu Road. At the time, someone from Lao Tianbao Silver Shop on Chengdu Road, near Baike Road, was caught attempting to trade 14 taels of gold at the location. They were immediately arrested. A search of the account books at the address led to the detention of the main culprits, Luo Youcheng and Zhang Xiangguo. It is reported that the case will be fully investigated and handed over to the court within days. In addition, the Radio Monitoring Section of the Garrison Headquarters recently seized a radio transmitter at No. 109 Ningbo Road, which was used to broadcast black market gold and foreign currency prices. The main culprit, Ma Shuzhi, is currently being interrogated.

### Old Hongbao Buying and Selling Gold Jewelry; Evidence Confiscated and Fines Imposed

Yesterday, it was ordered that the items be confiscated and a fine of five times the business's turnover be imposed.

### Preventing the Outflow of Cash to the South; Financial Bureau Requests Assistance with Secret Investigation

[Our Report] In order to prevent the outflow of large sums of cash to the south, the Municipal Financial Management Bureau yesterday sent a letter to the Police Bureau requesting assistance with a secret investigation. Anyone found to be remitting cash over the 50 million yuan limit set by the Ministry of Finance will be arrested and prosecuted.

### Journalist Delegation Visiting Burma Scheduled to Return Home by Plane on the 19th

The Shanghai journalist delegation, previously invited by CNAC to visit Burma, is scheduled to return home by plane on the 19th.

### Famous American Photographer Prepares to Film at His Own Expense; Huang Zongzhan Arrives in Shanghai with Color Film; Seeks Lead Roles for "Rickshaw Boy"; Hopes to Introduce China's Inherent Culture and Morality

[Our Report] Huang Zongzhan, a world-renowned Chinese photographer residing in Hollywood, known for his skill in photographing glamorous female stars, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. Huang recently established Pan-American Film Company with his own funds, serving as its president. His first film project is planned to be an adaptation of Lao She's famous work, "Rickshaw Boy." The script has already been commissioned to a famous Hollywood screenwriter, Raoul, for US$15,000 and will be completed soon. Huang's visit is to scout for actors in his home country, as well as to collect materials in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places to prepare for filming. Huang will stay in Shanghai briefly before heading to Beijing on the 18th. It is said that "Rickshaw Boy" will be entirely cast with Chinese actors and actresses for the main and supporting roles. The dialogue will be in English. It was rumored that the female lead has already been decided on a certain Shanghai star, but Huang specifically denied this yesterday.

Huang continued, stating that he has been serving the Hollywood film industry for more than 20 years, and his personal regret is that while films from other countries can create a sensation when screened in the United States, Chinese films have consistently failed to be shown in American first-run theaters. He is determined to produce films with Chinese stories and Chinese actors and actresses. On one hand, he hopes to use the film to introduce China's inherent culture, morality, and the actual lives of his fellow countrymen to the American people. At the same time, he hopes to take this opportunity to cultivate some male and female actors in China, giving them opportunities to film in America in the future, hoping they can compete with British and American stars in the arts and gain recognition on the international film scene. He plans to stay in Beijing for two weeks, and he brought a lot of color film from the United States. After arriving in Beijing, he will select beautiful scenery and shoot extensively. He will then return to the United States via Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Manila, and will continue to collect exterior shots along the way to research which can be used as the film's background after arriving in Hollywood. When the film is shot domestically in the future, the props will be shipped from the United States and sent back to the United States for developing and editing after filming. He will use his 20 years of experience in filmmaking, the film’s narrative, production, lighting, and structure, all will be handled with a pure Chinese approach, abandoning the so-called "hype" commonly used in Hollywood, hoping that after the film is completed, it can become a quiet Chinese painting, so that China's inherent artistic spirit can be fully utilized and can also be widely promoted internationally in the future.

Desired Qualities for Male and Female Leads

"Rickshaw Boy" has very high sales in the United States, with 5 million copies currently sold, which proves that Americans are very interested in the book. If the film is completed, it will definitely cause a sensation. Pan-American Film Company has decided to spend US$500,000 to shoot the film. If the scale is large, it may increase funding. Huang's most important leading roles to be found in China are three: one is Rickshaw Boy, whose ideal conditions are a male aged 19 to 29, 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighing about 160 pounds, with a face that does not need to be handsome, as long as it is Qingxiu, honest, kind, full of wisdom, and not good at speaking. The other is Tiger Girl, a young girl aged 19 to 20, naive, but rich in quiet beauty. In addition, a female lead between the ages of 30 and 31 with a moderate figure is also needed, exquisite and pretty, but with a hateful appearance similar to the person in the book.

Having Gone Abroad at the Age of Five, Superstitions Remain

Huang Zongzhan has a strong physique, similar to that of a boxer, and speaks calmly, without the typical pretentiousness of Hollywood celebrities. His view of "beauty" is extremely cultivated and profound. Huang is from Taishan, Guangdong. At the age of five, he went to the United States with his parents to do business, studying at a middle school in Pasco, Washington for two years. He loved photography since he was a child. He once bought a "Brownie" with the money he earned from selling newspapers to take photos of his family. Because the "Brownie" lacked a "viewfinder," the characters in the photos were missing from the neck up. His family was used to superstition and blamed him. Huang then asked to buy a new machine with ten US dollars and continued his research, which greatly improved. Although Huang has lived in the United States for many years, the concept of superstitious beliefs from Guangzhou and Hangzhou still exists. Yesterday, when he was smoking cigarettes with reporters in the hotel, he still refused to light three cigarettes with one match.

Female Star Common Sense Soaring

In 1917, Huang entered Hollywood as a photographer through a classmate, starting with a weekly salary of ten dollars, and gradually rose to the position of following and carrying the camera. In his spare time, he used the lights in the arena to practice shooting portraits of stars with his own old camera and sold them piecemeal. Once, he accidentally took a photo of famous actress Mary Minter and sold it for five dimes. Mary was amazed when she saw it, thinking it was a miracle, saying that the results were so good that she had never seen it before. She asked if he was confident in shooting during the performance. Huang said he would like to try it. Mary immediately asked the director, and after that, each of her starring films specified that Huang must produce it. Huang then leaped into the film industry and sailed smoothly. Stars known for their sexiness for a time, such as Joan Crawford, Hedy Lamarr, Greta Swanson, Ann Sheridan, Marlene Dietrich, and Marlene Carroll, all hired Huang to make films. They firmly believed that Huang's production would definitely increase their charm, so Huang became the chief photographer in Hollywood, and many stars relied on Huang's films to become famous after receiving rave reviews from all parties.

Filming One Film Costs US$50,000

Because of his deeper experience, he is familiar with the personalities of various stars. The angles and poses do not need to be studied, and he knows them like the back of his hand, so there are few re-shoots or remakes. The standard price for filming in the United States now is US$50,000 per film, and someone once offered a high price of US$100,000 for 42 weeks of work a year. He believes that photographers must first take good portraits of people before they can make close-ups and locks. He believes that his most satisfactory works in the past are Mrs. Miniver, Objective, Burma!, Since You Went Away, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and The Fighting 69th. As for the three who are most confident in their beautiful bells, they are Joan Crawford, Hedy Lamarr, and Ann Sheridan.

### Zhang Xiangwen to Marry; White Hair Ties the Knot

[Our Special Report] It is still remembered that fifteen years ago, Xiong Fenghuang and Mao Yanwen were married at Moore Memorial Church. The combination of red beauty and white hair, as well as being a match made in heaven, was passed around as a happy story. Last year, the combination of Central Committee member Li Shizeng and writer Lin Sushan was also a perfect marriage. Recently, there has been another new couple who have been friends for 25 years, ultimately resulting in a happy marriage.

Speaking of these two, readers must be very familiar with them. The woman is Zhang Xiangwen, a famous doctor in Shanghai who has served society for 30 years as the director of Renhe Hospital and Shangxian Hospital. The man is Wang Gupan, a pioneer in the Chinese police force who has served as the director of the Capital Police Department, the director of the Interior Ministry Higher Police Academy, the director of the Zhejiang Police Academy, and the mayor of Xiamen before the war. Director Zhang is 52 years old this year. In the past decades, she has been focused on hard work, cultivating talents in obstetrics and gynecology, striving to serve society, and promoting new medicine, making significant contributions. She never thought of planning to form a new family. Therefore, when the news of her impending marriage suddenly spread, her relatives, friends, and students were very surprised. Because the news was extremely mysterious, both parties were very secretive until the Lantern Festival in the old calendar, when the two families held a reception, revealing a hint of information.

Mr. Wang is 64 years old this year, full of spirit and looks very young. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a member of the Central Police Academy's school affairs committee and managed German and Italian enemy僑 in Chongqing, which was deeply valued by the Central Government. He used his official俸 from previous years to build a church on Gele Mountain to preach the gospel. It is said that it was Zhang's idea. They are both Christians and initially met in New York City 25 years ago. At that time, Ms. Zhang was studying in the New World, and Mr. Wang represented China at the World Police Conference. The two hit it off at first sight. Later, they went their separate ways, both striving to do their best for society and the country. Speaking of their friendship, it is noble and sincere. Last autumn, Mr. Wang lost his spouse, and there was a lack of someone to take care of his domestic affairs, so he talked to Ms. Zhang about the issue of marriage.

According to Ms. Zhang, the original intention of marriage is not based on affection, but on the basis of decades of deep friendship to become husband and wife to avoid the boredom of old age for both parties. With a new family, she will not give up her own career, but on the contrary, will encourage the spirit of courage to serve the society and benefit the people. As for their auspicious date, there is no definite date now, but it will probably be in a month or two. (The picture shows recent photos of Mr. Wang and Ms. Zhang)

Not About Affection; Avoiding the Boredom of Old Age

### Social Affairs Bureau Director States That the Index Cannot Be Frozen; Believes That the Decline of Industry Is Unrelated to the Index

[Our Report] The Municipal Industrial Association previously stated that due to the increase in the cost of living index, many of the member factories were unable to afford it. The 18th joint meeting of directors and supervisors decided to request the government to rigidly stipulate that this month's wages should be calculated based on the cost of living index of the previous month in order to calculate costs. The various industries of this city have paid close attention to this proposal by the Industrial Association, and the General Labour Union has publicly expressed its opposition. According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, he has not yet received the official documents of the Industrial Association. Regarding this suggestion, he believes that the decline of industry is not caused by the index problem. The survival of factories lies in the sales of goods. Now, due to rising prices and the decline in people's purchasing power, the sales of factory products have become stagnant. The increase in the cost of living index is based on prices. If the index is frozen rashly, it will directly affect the lives of workers and indirectly affect social security. The Social Affairs Bureau does not intend to request instructions from the central government on this issue, but prepares to solve it directly. It is necessary to conduct serious research so that both labor and management can maintain the status quo without worrying about one thing and losing sight of the other.

### Aircraft Registration Is Only Intended to Facilitate Statistics

[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Business Office of the Telecommunications Bureau, the purpose of the bureau's registration of radios is to facilitate statistics, and there is absolutely no intention to control them, nor does it charge any fees. The registration procedure is also very simple. The first phase of registration is scheduled to end at the end of this month. The bureau is now doing its best to persuade citizens who own radios to register automatically, and there are no penalty regulations for the time being.

### China National Aviation Corporation Personnel to Go to the United States for Inspection; Take Off in Two Batches Today

In addition, the six Convair-240 passenger planes ordered by the company in the United States last year are expected to arrive in Shanghai successively in June and July of this year. The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has specially sent technicians from the aircraft group to the United States to conduct on-site research at the aircraft's manufacturing plant. The first batch of personnel to go to the United States is also scheduled to fly from Shanghai to San Francisco by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight on the afternoon of the 17th, and then transfer to the Convair-240 aircraft manufacturing plant.

It was decided that after the end of the winter relief association, the work-relief work will continue for four months, and the Shanghai Work-Relief Committee will be established. The existing work-relief shelters will be converted into work-relief centers at that time, and the number of work-relief refugees is planned to be expanded from more than 2,000 to 4,000.

[Report from our newspaper] Li Zhen, the "Yang Nannan" (foreign doll) dance hostess, and Shen Gongwei's romantic entanglement, for which Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, filed a case accusing them of adultery, was heard in court on the 21st of last month. The hearing continued yesterday morning at the court. Li arrived in court wearing a beige wool cheongsam, a mink-trimmed leopard print coat, a green scarf, and coffee-colored suede high heels. Mao wore a lake-colored wool coat, a lake-colored cheongsam, black high heels, and light makeup. Shen was brought from the Sinan Road detention center, still wearing a dark blue melton coat. At 9:20 AM, Judge Zhou Shitai took the stand and first questioned the plaintiff, Mao Xiuzhen. Mao stated yesterday that she still had feelings for Shen and would not pursue the matter further, declaring in court that she would withdraw the charges against Shen Gongwei, saying that Shen was young and seduced by Li Zhen, and asked the court to be lenient. However, she would continue to pursue the charges against the second defendant, Li Zhen, and asked the court to severely punish her, and would not withdraw the civil suit, claiming that Shen took out the jewelry at Li's instigation. The court asked if there was any evidence, and she replied that it was a domestic dispute and there was no evidence to provide. Then, Li Zhen testified that she had a relationship with Li in June of last year, and that the plaintiff, Mao, usually interacted with her, and it was not a recent occurrence. She stated that they as dance hostesses had a hard life, and had to be attentive to customers, and had no intention of interfering with Shen's family. She said that Shen and Mao colluded to bully her, which was heartbreaking. She also said that usually when Shen and her were together, she was the one spending the money, and she never saw Shen take jewelry from his house. Mao intended to extort money. Li became saddened as she testified, and tears welled up in her eyes and she sobbed. Subsequently, Shen's defense lawyer, Fei Xizhen, argued on his behalf regarding the private possession of a handgun, and Li's defense lawyers, Lu Shaozong and Lu Kuqing, argued on her behalf regarding the charge of adultery, saying that Mao had been permissive beforehand and tolerant afterward, and according to the law, had lost the right to sue. Attorney Fei stood up and requested that Shen Gongwei be released on bail, and the court agreed to release him on bail. Finally, the court ordered that the verdict in the case would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month. After leaving the court, Shen told reporters that there was no possibility of reconciliation with Mao Xiuzhen and that he was willing to spend dozens of gold bars to divorce Mao. When asked by reporters if he would live with Li, he smiled and did not answer.

### 被控冒領配給證　宋海屏昨受傳訊

[Report from our newspaper] Song Haiping, acting president of the China United News Agency, was accused by the former editor-in-chief of the agency, Hu Diya, of inflating the number of employees and fraudulently obtaining ration cards. The district prosecutor's office opened a court hearing yesterday afternoon and summoned He Zhuming, an employee of the agency, to testify. Prosecutor Liang Gengshun questioned them. According to Song, the agency has been closed for a long time and has not received rations for a long time, so Hu's accusation is not true. Hu insisted that Song embezzled the ration cards and claimed that he had a large bag of privately made seals for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining rations. As a result, the prosecutor ordered the defendant to provide a guarantor and ordered the bailiffs to search the Shanghai Law School (because Song also served as a professor at the Shanghai Law School) and the China United News Agency to see if there was any privately made seals as claimed by the plaintiff.

### 招商局登陸艇　營口歷險記　入匪掌·冒大砲火　負重傷·昂然歸來

[Report from our newspaper, Tianjin, 12th by Air Mail] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhong 105 landing craft, loaded with military supplies from Huludao to reinforce Yingkou on the 26th of last month, arrived outside Yingkou Port on the 27th and entered the port on the 28th. It was seized by the Communist bandits. Later, it was repeatedly forced by the Communist bandits to sail to Dalian, but it failed to do so due to the thick ice on the sea. On March 1, it was discovered by our air force. After that, the wheel risked escaping under heavy fire. When it escaped, the steering gear was blown up, the circuit was broken, and the front gun was leaking. The situation was extremely dire. On the 3rd, it was discovered by our Yongding warship, which escorted it to Huludao. On the 7th, it was towed to Tanggu by the Jiping. It arrived at 8:00 PM. The hull was scarred and many crew members were killed or injured. It has now entered the dock for repairs and will resume the heavy task of maritime transportation. The wheel has released the following account of its adventure:

Stopped on Ice

This wheel was ordered by "Beiji No. 1" (Note: This is a New Port icebreaker, which had just arrived in Tanggu and was transferred to Huludao to break the ice) and Director Zhao, together with Liaison Officer Wang, loaded 5,000 bags of military rice, 38 barrels of gasoline, 320 packages of pickled mustard, 37 bags of edible salt, and 30 tons of ammunition in Huludao. It left Huludao at 13:45 on February 26 and headed for Yingkou. Liaison Officer Wang and escort officers Wang, Yan, and Liu, as well as nine soldiers, accompanied the wheel under the guidance of the icebreaker "Beiji No. 1." It arrived outside Yingkou Port on the 27th and dropped anchor. Since leaving Huludao, it has been trying to contact the Yingkou radio station, but to no avail. At 18:20, it received a telegram from the Huludao Port Headquarters: "Quickly enter Yingkou Port." At 6:03 on the 28th, it weighed anchor and entered the port. At 10:00, because the Liao River was thick with ice (about six or seven feet thick), it could not move forward. At the No. 4 shore marker, it slowed down and maintained contact with the stern of the Beiji. Director Zhao and two escort officers first landed. At 13:30, it was discovered that there were more than 20 unknown troops with guns monitoring the area three miles to the right. After 14:00, a large number of unknown troops came, led by Director Zhao and others, and set up posts next to the ship. The wheel suspected the situation and only ordered Director Zhao to board the ship, but to no avail. Director Zhao boarded the "Beiji." At 14:30, the wheel took advantage of the low tide to reverse and turn around to withdraw and await orders. However, at the same time, gunfire erupted, focusing on the wheel. After a few minutes, the "Beiji" overtook the bow and Director Zhao used the radio telephone to order it to stop immediately, otherwise it would continue to fire. Liaison Officer Wang still believed that it was our army on the shore, because the need for food was urgent, so he took this action. He ordered the people on the ship to rest assured and forced the ship to stop, and then it ran aground on the ice. At 14:50, escort officer Yan and "Division Commander Wang" (Communist bandits) led the troops and boarded the ship via the "Beiji." After talking with "Division Commander Wang," it was learned that they had become prisoners. The ship's radio station was forcibly stopped from working, and at the same time, various public and private goods on the ship were seized. At 17:00, the unloading of rice and ammunition began.

Forced to Sail to Dalian

On the 29th, telegraph operator Lu Jiazhen was first taken ashore under escort. At the same time, Liaison Officer Wang and three escort officers and nine soldiers were also taken away from the ship under escort. At 17:50, under the surveillance of the Communist bandits, it was led by the Communist bandits to sail away from Yingkou, passing through Fuzhou Bay to Dalian. Later, because the "Beiji" was trapped by ice, the ship returned to Yingkou and continued to unload rice under duress. At 11:50 on March 1, it was again forced to leave Yingkou for Dalian. At 13:40, it anchored at the third buoy outside Yingkou due to insufficient tide. At that time, it was the first time that it was scouted from the air by our military aircraft, which then flew away. At the same time, the wheel's mate, Sun Jibo, suffered a nervous breakdown due to the threat of the Communist bandits. Later, it continued to sail. At midnight, because the sea surface was thick with ice, the ship could not move forward, so the "Beiji" ordered it to return to Yingkou. At 8:04 on the 2nd, it went to Yingkou again to unload rice. At 14:20, it was bombed by our military aircraft. The main mast was hit and destroyed, and the rear part caught fire. The Communist bandit captain stationed on the ship saw the thick smoke and ordered all the Communist bandits to leave the ship and go ashore. Eleven sailors, two waiters, and the mate (due to nervous breakdown) also landed with the Communist bandits. At 14:30, the Communist bandits left.

Escape from Fire

When putting out the fire, the crew saw an opportunity and tried to put out the fire on the one hand, and retreated at full speed regardless of the Communist bandit's intensive artillery fire. At that time, the steering gear was damaged by the bombing, the circuit was broken, and it was no longer effective. Fortunately, the two main engines, the lighting engine, and the gyrocompass were not damaged. Therefore, the direction was controlled by the front and rear operation of the two main engines. Unfortunately, at 15:25, it ran aground on the third buoy in the port channel due to insufficient tide. At 15:50, it was bombed by our military aircraft again. The large cabin was hit and the gasoline was burned. Machine guns kept firing. As a result, three pipe technicians, Qiu Renji (from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, 24 years old), Chen Yutang, (from Hankou, Hubei, 26 years old), waiter Zhou Shigen, (from Fenghua, Zhejiang, 33 years old), and sailor Ma Baohua, (from Tianjin, 22 years old) were all killed by the bombing while putting out the fire. Carpenter Wang Yongfa, laundry worker He Shifu, and waiter Zhang Yingzhou were also seriously injured while putting out the fire. Third Mate Xie Fengze and waiter Chen Chuzhou were also slightly injured? At 17:40, it escaped danger due to the rising tide. In the dangerous situation of being unfamiliar with the port channel, having no helmsmen or sailors, and leaking in the front cabin, fortunately, all the survivors were determined to coexist with the ship and had the perseverance to do what was known to be impossible. Under the spirit of overall cooperation, they worked all night and finally escaped the tiger's mouth.

Naval Escort

At 4:05 on the 3rd, it was discovered by the Yongding. Because it was unclear about the real situation of the ship, it opened fire and shot. The kitchen was hit first, but fortunately the bullet did not explode and there were no casualties. Otherwise, the result would have been unimaginable. At that time, all the employees thought that it was the Communist bandits driving the "Beiji" in, and they were disheartened and intended to commit suicide. At 6:01, the Yongding ship's lights were discovered, and all the employees clapped their hands and cheered, and were revived. At 11:50, two naval officers boarded the ship for inspection and inquired about the truth. On the afternoon of the 4th, under the protection of the Yongding warship, it was towed by the Jiping tugboat and brought to Huludao on the 5th. On the morning of the 7th at 6:00, it was towed by the Jiping wheel and sailed to Tanggu, arriving at 2:50 PM on the 8th to enter the dock for repairs. (Our reporter Li Shaolin)

### 鄖縣同鄉控金德配　並呈請嚴懲何承浩

[Wuchang, 14th by Air Mail] The fellow villagers association from Yun County in northern Hubei Province in this area stated that He Chenghao, the speaker of the county council and deputy commander of the People's Self-Defense Force in the county, took advantage of the name of defending the local area to control the military and financial power, forcibly concentrating materials, hoarding hundreds of billions of cash, and abandoning his post to flee when the bandits approached, plunging the 360,000 county residents into a deep abyss. Today, they specially received reporters to recount the various crimes of He Chenghao. In addition to submitting a request to the military authorities for strict punishment and revocation of He Chenghao's qualifications as a representative of the National Assembly, they also sent representatives to Beijing to petition and called on people from all walks of life to provide righteous support. According to the person in charge of the fellow villagers association, since September of last year, when Chen bandits invaded, County Magistrate Lu Shenggui also served as commander of the Self-Defense Force, and County Council Speaker He Chenghao also served as deputy commander, and mobilized more than 2,000 self-defense team members and guns from various villages into the city. He himself claimed to be the chairman of the Self-Defense Funds Committee and the chairman of the City Defense Donation Committee, and he plundered on a large scale, putting everything into his own pocket. The city defense donations alone amounted to more than 20 billion yuan. On December 27 of last year, Kong Congzhou, a bandit from Yunxi, launched an attack on Lang County. When the emergency was only forty miles away from the county seat, He Chenghao, who held great power, took the opportunity to leave the city for Anyangkou (45 li east of the city) on the morning of the 28th, claiming that he was in a bad mood. By 2:00 PM the next afternoon, the county government had quietly withdrawn, and the teams crossed the river one after another. Suddenly, there was great chaos in the city, and they scrambled to cross the Han River to escape. At that time, the ships under the river were occupied by the teams, resulting in a tragic incident of the military and civilians competing to cross the river. Countless people drowned or were shot to death, and the screams shook the sky, which was unbearable to hear. He watched across the river as the materials in the city were used by the bandits. On January 2 of this year, the bandits broke through the river defense, and the teams collapsed and fled. Government personnel and people fled for their lives, and many abandoned their children on the way, leaving them to their fate. The person in charge finally said that Jin Depei was a subordinate of He Shuihao and was appointed as the general commander of the river defense. He has been handed over to the Hubei Security Command for punishment. He Chenghao is still in Hankou, running around to get Jin acquitted. The association is asking the government to punish him.

The authorities dispatched a team to encircle and suppress them. The bandits were unable to resist and fled back to the original ship and sailed south. On the 14th, the authorities received information again that seven or eight bandits had been found in Qianbujing Qiaoxiang on the Songfeng border. The county government immediately dispatched a security team and the Zhuangxing Wuqiao and other township self-defense teams to encircle and suppress them. The bandits immediately fled west across the river (Huangpu River) upon hearing the news. On the 15th, it was reported again that the bandits had appeared. The authorities dispatched a team again to search. It is reported that the bandits may be the remnants of Ding Xisan, such as Li Baoshan, who are hiding in the Songfeng border.

[Report from our newspaper, Songjiang, 15th] On the morning of the 14th, more than 20 bandits were found in Zhangjiatang, two miles away from Yexie Town in the county.

### Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute Completes Two Experiments

[Report from this newspaper, Chengdu, 12th] Yang Xingrong and Ku Rongxi, staff members of the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute's Serum Factory, have been researching domestic animal pathology and various antitoxic serums for many years. Recently, they have collaborated with people in the factory to complete two extremely valuable experiments: (1) An efficacy experiment on bovine plague organ seedlings made from bovine lungs. This experiment is of great economic significance. Compared with the bovine plague organ seedlings made from spleen tissue and lymph nodes that were commonly used in the past, the cost is only half as much, but the efficacy is more than doubled. (2) Anthrax bacillus virulence test. This experiment is of great value in terms of academic theory. According to the unanimous view of the medical academic circles in the past, injecting bacteria into the blood vessels of domestic animals would be more toxic than subcutaneous injection, but the result of this experiment is just the opposite. It is inferred that the toxicity of anthrax bacillus to the domestic animal body is not in secreting toxins, but in the collective blocking of microvessels, which is a major revolution in veterinary medicine.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss Partially Opening Self-Provided Foreign Exchange.

Buyers, Aware That Sales in This City and the Suzhou-Wuxi Area Were Good and That Demand From French Africa Was Urgent, Paid High Prices. Transactions Increased, Prices Soared, and the Market Base Was Very Solid, With Continued Prospects for Growth. According to Industry Insiders, the New Dragon Well Tea Crop, Which Is Closely Watched by Shops in This City, Is Currently Being Produced in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province.

Yesterday, Tobacco Dealers in This City Were Eager to Add to Their Stocks at the Opening, and Asking Prices Were Stable. However, Due to Continued Large Clearing Differences in Banks, Credit Was Universally Tight, and Dealers Sold a Lot. Retail Investors Also Followed Suit, and the Market Was Very Active, With Odd Sources of Supply. It Was Also Learned That the Yizhong Company Was Handling Shipments to Counterparts in Nanjing and Other Places, Tightening Cash Flow Further and Causing Prices to Fall Rapidly.

Literary Reunion: Movie Script (6) Zhang Dao-lu. He Qi: Of Course I Wouldn't Do That, But No Matter What, I Will Never Forget You in This Lifetime! Jingye: Why Be So Stubborn? A Man Should Be Able to Pick Things Up and Put Them Down. As Long as You Can Raise Xiuzhen Well, You'll Be Doing Right by Me. Okay, Go! Please Don't Come See Me Again. He Qi: (Reluctantly Gets Up to Leave.) I Beg You to See Me One More Time at Least. Jingye: Impossible! You Know I Always Do What I Say. Please Leave! (He Qi Walks Away Depressed.) (After He Qi Leaves, Jingye First Sits on the Sofa Staring Blankly at the Sky Outside the Window and Cries. Then, He Can't Help but Lean on the Sofa and Sob Loudly and Cry.) 40. He Qi's Living Room. Two Days After Canyun Holds a Banquet and He Qi Returns Home. Canyun and Xiuzhen Sit on a Sofa in the Living Room, Flipping Through a Photo Album. This Album Was Brought Back by He Qi From Southeast Asia. Inside Are Many Landscape Paintings and Character Photos From Southeast Asia. Suddenly, They Flip to a Photo of an Infant. (It's the Same as the One Taken of Xiuzhen a Few Weeks After She Was Born.) She Points It to Xiuzhen to See. Canyun: Xiuzhen, Look, This Is a Photo of You When You Were Little. If Your Father Hadn't Taken It to Southeast Asia, We Wouldn't Have It Anymore. Xiuzhen: Xiuzhen (Looks Closely, Hesitates.) Mom, Is This a Photo of Me? Canyun: Yes, When This Photo Was Taken, You Were Less Than a Month Old. Xiuzhen: Mom, Why Is This Exactly the Same as One at Mr. Zheng's House? Canyun: (Finds It Strange.) What? Mr. Zheng Has One Just Like This? You Must Be Mistaken. It Can't Be the Same. Xiuzhen: Mom, I'm Not Mistaken. The Clothes Worn by the Child in This Photo Are Exactly the Same, and It Was Also Taken by "Wenhua Photography Studio." Canyun: Whose Photo Is Mr. Zheng's One? Xiuzhen: She Said It Was a Photo of Her Friend's Daughter. Canyun: (Can't Help but Be Suspicious.) Xiuzhen, Mr. Zheng's One Can't Be the Same as This One. Don't Talk Nonsense. (After Saying This, She Puts the Photo Album on a Table.) Xiuzhen: Mom, If You Don't Believe Me, I'll Go to Mr. Zheng's Place Tomorrow to Get It for You to See. Canyun: It Doesn't Matter If They Look Alike or Not. You're Not Allowed to Go to Mr. Zheng's Place to Say That. Xiuzhen: Then You Don't Believe Me. Canyun: It Doesn't Matter Whether I Believe You or Not. Go Upstairs and Write. Let Me Rest for a While. (Xiuzhen Goes Upstairs. Canyun First Sits on the Sofa in a Daze. Suddenly, She Gets Up Again to Take a Look at the Photo Album. Then, She Puts It Down. She's Very Impatient in the Living Room. She's Restless. After a While, She Sits Back on the Sofa. She Recalls How She Got Xiuzhen Back Then. How She First Met Jingye, and All the Mysterious Impressions of He Qi Meeting Jingye. Scene After Scene Quickly Passes Through Her Mind. She's About to Tearfully Break Down. Suddenly, He Qi Returns, Interrupting Her Memories.) He Qi: (Sees Canyun With a Very Resentful Look. It Seems He Can Tell She's Just Cried.) Yun, What's Wrong? Why Are You Unhappy? Canyun: (Forcing a Smile.) I'm Not Unhappy About Anything. I Was Just Going to Ask You, When You Came Home the Other Night, You Were So Happy When You First Saw Xiuzhen. Why Did You Suddenly Change Later? For the Last Two Days, Everyone Can Tell You're Lost in Thought. What's Really on Your Mind? Or Are You Facing Any Difficulties? He Qi: (Forcing a Smile.) Yun, Why Do You Think That Way? I'm Really Just Too Tired. There's Nothing on My Mind. Canyun, Qi, You Don't Have to Hide It From Me. You're in Pain, You're Confused, You Don't Know What to Do, Right? He Qi: (Getting Anxious) I Don't Know What You're Talking About? I'm Not Hiding Anything From You. Canyun: (Angrily) You Used to Treat Me Like an Idiot. You've Kept This Secret From Me All These Years. But Now Is the Time for You to Tell Me the Truth. He Qi: (Getting Even More Anxious) What Are You Talking About? What Secret? Canyun: (Firmly) Qi, Calm Down, Okay? If You Tell Me the Truth, We Can Discuss Anything. If You Don't Tell Me, Then Don't Blame Me. He Qi: I Have Nothing to Say. Canyun: I Think You Should Tell Me. She's Grown Up Now. If You Don't Make Things Clear, It Won't Be Good for Her Either. He Qi: (Looking Like He's About to Explode With Anger) Not Good for Whom? Canyun: Xiuzhen! He Qi: What Does This Have to Do With Xiuzhen? Canyun: Of Course It's Related. You Should Also Think About Jingye. He Qi: What Does This Have to Do With Zheng Jingye? Why Did You Bring Her Up? Canyun: Don't I Have a Reason to Mention Her? He Qi: What Reason Do You Have? Canyun: Xiuzhen's Biological Mother Is Zheng Jingye! She's Not Dead! He Qi: (Loudly With Anger and Rage) Who Told You This Nonsense? Canyun: (Suddenly Turns Gentle) Qi, You Know in Your Heart That This Isn't Nonsense, but the Truth. (Saying This, She Walks to He Qi's Side and Comforts Him.) As Long as You Admit It, I Won't Only Not Make Things Difficult for You, but Also Willingly Help You Overcome Your Difficulties. Do You Believe Me? (She Stares at He Qi Face to Face. He Qi Is Moved and Reluctantly Acknowledges It. He Doesn't Say a Word.) Come Here and Rest Quietly for a While. (He Qi Is Extremely Touched. He Looks at Her With Tears in His Eyes.) 41. Zheng Jingye's Living Room. Maid: I Told Mrs. He That You Were Busy and Couldn't Receive Her. She Said She Had Something Urgent That She Had to Discuss With You in Person. Jingye: (Worried, Hesitates for a Moment.) Please Ask Her to Come In. (The Servant Retires. After a While, the Servant Leads Mrs. He Into the Living Room. The Servant Then Leaves.) Canyun: (Steps Forward to Shake Hands With Jingye. Jingye Forcibly Smiles to Greet Her.) Mr. Zheng, I'm Really Sorry to Bother You Like This. But This Matter Has to Be Discussed With You in Person. Jingye: It Doesn't Matter. Please Sit Down. (Canyun Chooses a Chair and Sits Down. Jingye Also Sits Down on a Chair Nearby.) Canyun: It's Really a Coincidence. If It Weren't for Xiuzhen, We Probably Would Never Have Met. And You Probably Wouldn't Have Met He Qi Again. Jingye: (Wants to Answer, but Doesn't Know What to Say for a Moment, and Feels Quite Embarrassed. Canyun Continues.) Canyun: I Not Only Want to Thank You for Saving Xiuzhen, but Also Want to Thank You for Giving Xiuzhen to Me Back Then. I Raised Her, and I Got a Lot of Happiness and Comfort. Jingye: (Hearing This, Can't Help but Be Surprised. Of Course She Knows That Canyun's Words Have a Meaning. But She Still Hopes Canyun Won't Talk Anymore.) Mrs. He! I Really Don't Understand What You Mean by These Words. Canyun: You Love Xiuzhen Very Much, and I Also Love Xiuzhen Very Much. Now, Because of Xiuzhen, I Want to Talk to You About a Solution. But I Don't Have Bad Intentions, So Please Don't Misunderstand Me. Jingye: (Looks at Canyun With Great Unease, Feeling Mysteriously Disturbed.) Canyun: (Calmly, but Not Maliciously.) Mr. Zheng! I Know Everything About Your Relationship With He Qi and Xiuzhen's Background. Jingye: (Can't Endure It Anymore.) Mrs. He! What Are You Talking About?...I Canyun: He Qi Has Never Told Me the Truth. But Now There Is All The Evidence, and He Can't Deny It Either. Jingye: (Feeling Extremely Embarrassed, Hating He Qi in Her Heart.) Whether He Admits It or Denies It, What Do You Mean by Saying These Things to Me? Canyun: You Know That Ever Since He Qi Met You the Other Night, He's Been Listless All Day, Suffering and Confused, Restless. I'm Afraid He'll Cause Some Trouble. Jingye: How Can You Blame Me for That? Canyun: No One Is Blaming You, But We Have to Calmly Think of a Solution. Jingye: Think of What Solution? Canyun: I've Thought About It Again and Again, and There's No Good Solution. Now, the Only Thing I Can Do Is Leave He Qi So That He Can Be With You. Maybe That Can Save Him. It Would Be Even Better If Xiuzhen Was Raised by You. What Do You Think? Jingye: (Getting a Little Angry.) Mrs. He, If You're Here to Test Me, Please Don't Bother. If You're Sincere, I'm Sorry, but I Can't Accept It. Canyun: I'm Being Very Sincere. Please Don't Doubt Me. I Hope You Accept My Proposal. Jingye: If I Were Going to Do That, I Would Have Destroyed Someone Else's Family Ten Years Ago! Canyun: If You Had Wanted to Do That Ten Years Ago, You Might Not Have Succeeded. Jingye: Then Why Are You Forcing Me to Do That Now? Canyun: Because the Situation Is Very Different Now. For the Past Ten Years, I've Gotten His "Person," But I Haven't Gotten His "Heart." You Haven't Gotten His "Person," But You've Gotten His "Heart." I Really Don't Want to Live This Kind of Nominal Married Life Anymore. So I Hope That for the Sake of He Qi, for the Sake of Xiuzhen, You'll Accept My Solution. Jingye: No Matter What, I Can't Accept It. Speaking of Zhen, We Can't Do That Even More. Canyun: Why? Jingye: Because We Can't Make an Innocent Child Doubt Her Background and Be Negatively Affected. Canyun: But She's Already Starting to Doubt. Jingye: That Doesn't Matter. As Long as Everyone Insists That You're Her Real Mother, That's Fine. Canyun: Then What About He Qi? What Will Happen If Things Continue Like This? Jingye: Please Tell Him Not to Let His Mind Wander Anymore. One Mistake Is Enough. A Woman Sacrificed Half Her Life for Him. He Shouldn't Be Selfish and Have Her Sacrifice the Second Half of Her Life for Him. Canyun: I Hope You'll Consider It Carefully. Jingye: I Very Firmly Don't Want to Consider This Solution. Canyun: Won't You Think About It for Xiuzhen's Sake? Jingye: For Xiuzhen's Sake, It's Best to Make Her Believe That You're Her Biological Mother. (Just as She's Saying This, Mrs. Zheng Returns. After Everyone Greets Each Other, Canyun Takes Her Leave. Jingye Feels Very Painful.) Mrs. Zheng: Sister, What Did Mrs. He Come to Talk About? What Made You Unhappy Again?
