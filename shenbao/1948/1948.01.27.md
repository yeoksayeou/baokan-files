### Chairman's Instruction to the North China Petition Delegation: Determined to Secure North China and the Northeast, Encouraging Northern Compatriots to Overcome Hardships Together

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Chairman Chiang summoned Liu Yaozhang, Xu Huidong, Shi Zizhou, Li Zhuchen, Ji Dianchuan, and other five members of the North China Petition Delegation at 11:30 AM on the 26th, inquiring about the situation in North China. They first outlined the current situation in North China, stating that the military and political situation was improving. After Fu Zuoyi took charge of military affairs in North China, the army entered Hebei from Chahar and Suiyuan, with strict discipline and high morale, possessing strong and mobile combat capabilities. The people have high hopes for Fu Zuoyi, hoping he can plan long-term and complete the entire task of suppressing the rebellion in North China. The Chairman nodded repeatedly when asked about this. Liu and others stated that there was a considerable foundation in the political sphere. They hoped that after Chu Xichun took office, he could devote himself to organizing the masses, cultivating self-defense forces, and supplementing and training cadres. In terms of the economy, increasing production remains an important fundamental solution. However, to resolve the current crisis, some appropriate measures are also necessary. They also used actual figures to point out that loans are not a source of speculative capital, especially in North China, and the government should have flexible solutions for this. In addition, both remittance and advance exchange should be opened to benefit the people and stabilize prices. They expressed gratitude for all parties' assistance in solving the food problem in the North, but purchasing grain in large quantities requires 450 billion, which is truly unbearable for the North. The Chairman immediately approved the Central Bank to advance the funds. In terms of transportation, they emphasized that the railway east of Tianjin must be unobstructed, and the strongholds of Tanggu, Tangshan, Luanxian, and Qinhuangdao must be firmly defended. The Chairman stated that he had paid attention to this matter and had dispatched strong troops to the North to ensure the security of the line, in order to facilitate the southward transport and export of Kailuan coal and other materials. Finally, the Chairman greatly appreciated their hard work on this trip, which greatly helped the central government and local governments understand each other, and the government's military and political measures, offering deep encouragement. The Chairman reiterated the government's determination to secure the Northeast and North China. He instructed them to tell the northern compatriots to strive hard and overcome difficulties together.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Northern Petition Delegation, including Shi Zizhou, Xu Huidong, Li Zhuchen, and Ji Dianchuan, will take the night train to Shanghai on the 26th to return north. Liu Yaozhang is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 27th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] It is learned that the government has decided on the principle of opening industrial loans after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Large factories will not be granted loans, while small factories will be handled with discretion. According to last year's experience, after industrial loans were opened before the Lunar New Year, they were used for speculative business, creating speculative capital and greatly affecting the market, causing prices to soar by 14.2 times last year. Therefore, this decision was made this year.

### Petition Delegation's Executive Reporter Reports Results of Trip to Nanjing

Considerable Achievements Gained, Benefiting Northern People's Livelihood

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Since the North China Petition Delegation arrived in Nanjing, it has consulted with various relevant agencies on various issues, and most of them have yielded results. The delegation will leave Nanjing successively on the 26th and 27th. Therefore, it specially hosted the Nanjing press at 2:00 PM on the 26th to report the entire process and results of the petition. Liu Yaozhang first represented the delegation to thank the media for their sympathy and support, and then stated: Thanks to the assistance of all parties, this trip has achieved considerable success. In addition to greatly benefiting the people's livelihood in the North, the most important thing is to boost the morale of the people in the North, promote mutual understanding between the central government and local governments, and emphasize the overall situation for all parties. During the ten days of the petition delegation in Nanjing, it visited more than ten units of various levels of agencies, and the results obtained can at least enable the North to safely pass the Lunar New Year.

Political Situation and Food

Liu summarized the results of the petition as follows: Political Situation: Chairman Chu Xichun will take office and assume his duties in a short period of time.

Food Problem: 1. 300,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin in January, and thereafter 500,000 bags of flour and 30,000 dan of rice will be shipped north each month. There are no restrictions on secondary flour and coarse grains, and rationed food is also excluded. 2. The Central Bank will advance 450 billion yuan for grain purchase funds. 3. Thoroughly investigate and abolish permit fees and crack down on them. 4. The wheat flour from American relief supplies will be shipped north immediately. The Tianjin and Beijing Allocation and Sales Committee will be established soon to investigate the recipients and determine the amount of rations or revise the conversion rate of rice and flour based on prices before starting distribution in March. 5. Hebei will be added to the Ministry of Agriculture's production increase plan.

Loan Issues

Loan Issues: 1. The government will purchase finished products from manufacturers to replenish their working capital. Specific measures will be formulated and discussed in Shanghai. 2. Lengthen the period for advance exchange, and find ways to solve problems based on the actual situation of manufacturers. 3. Relax Central Exchange controls, and fully open them unconditionally for those purchasing and transporting cotton and grain. 4. For handicraft loans, find ways to support handicrafts such as lace and Jingtai blue. 5. Relax agricultural loans for North China allocation. 6. There must be a solution to the supervisory loan issue before the Lunar New Year, and further discussions will be held in Shanghai.

Import Export

Import and Export and Foreign Exchange Issues: 1. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has submitted the suggestion of an import and export chain system for consideration by the National Economic Council, and it may be adopted to implement designated import methods. 2.

The import quota for North China can be liberally approved. 4. Deferred exchange settlement can be handled flexibly for machinery imports, etc. 5. The Tianjin and Beijing Allocation and Sales Committee will consider and request instructions on using foreign exchange earned from exports to purchase foreign grain.

Material Supplies

Material Supply Issues: 1. Re-examine the allocation of agricultural and fishery equipment and materials. If the agricultural portion is uneven, re-examine and find ways to remedy it. In the future allocation of the fishery portion, the coastal areas should be an exception. 2. After the release of UNRRA relief supplies north of 34 degrees north latitude, 1,400 tons of rice have been shipped north, and 616 tons of cloth are also in the Ministry of Social Affairs' distribution plan.

Textile Industry

Textile Industry Issues: 1. The control measures for cotton yarn and cloth will not be implemented in the northern region for the time being. 2. China Textile has decided to postpone the sale of its factories. The issue of prioritizing the purchase of factories after relocation will be temporarily suspended. 3. A large quantity of Indian raw cotton will be imported soon, and part of it will be shipped to North China.

Military Expenditure Burden

The Executive Yuan will re-study the matter of returning the Mentougou coal mine based on newly discovered information and evidence before making a decision. Liu will hold further detailed discussions with the Executive Yuan on this matter on the 27th.

Only Know Hardship

After Liu finished his report, Shi Zizhou and Li Zhuchen spoke successively. Shi, with his gray hair, said in a grateful tone that he would convey the sympathy and support of public opinion and other parties to hundreds of thousands of people in the North. They would be moved to tears upon hearing it. Li, with his qualifications as a southerner, said: Northerners are honest and only know how to work hard and are not good at complaining. Last year, they received less than 50 billion in government work relief and advance loans, including those in arrears. He emphasized that the source of speculative capital is not industrial loans, especially not the pitifully small industrial loans in the North. The biggest source is war. As for how military expenditures become speculative capital, he said, "No need to say more." In addition, those with a little wealth deposit money in commercial firms, accumulating small amounts into large sums, which is also considerable. Therefore, stopping industrial loans and tightening credit only hurts the industrial sector, and the northern manufacturers who have always been law-abiding suffer the most. However, the government still insists on this decided policy and will not change it until after the Lantern Festival. After Li finished speaking, Liu Yaozhang briefly described their visit to the Chairman and the reasons for the withdrawal from Shijiazhuang. They dispersed around 4:00 PM.

They will submit the report after the investigation is completed within the next few days.

### US Purchases Rice from Siam to Relieve Our Country's Food Shortage

19,000 Metric Tons to be Shipped to China Before End of Next Month

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 26th] According to the US Embassy here: The US has purchased rice worth US$5 million from Siam, following the results of negotiations between the British Ambassador and the Siamese government, to be used as food relief for China. This amount is allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Council this year. This rice purchase plan began a few days before the Siamese coup in November last year. The US$5 million required for the rice purchase will be deducted from the US$27.7 million of the US aid to China program after the end of UNRRA. This approximately 19,000 metric tons of rice is expected to arrive in China before the end of next month.

### New US Military Advisory Group Leader General Keck Postpones Return to Country Until March

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The new leader of the US Military Advisory Group, Lieutenant General Barr (see Oka), and his entourage will fly to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 27th, and will visit the US Ambassador and Chairman Chiang on the 28th.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] US Navy General Keck was originally scheduled to retire and return to the country at the beginning of next month. Now, because his successor, General Badger, has not yet arrived in China, Keck will postpone his return to the United States until March.

### Control Yuan Discusses Civil Servant Treatment: Advocating Monthly Adjustment of Index

Decided to Suggest the National Government Reconsider

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Control Yuan held a discussion meeting on the 26th. Chairman Miao Peicheng discussed the matter of improving the treatment of public school personnel, and Yu Shude and others proposed that the newly revised method for adjusting the treatment of public school personnel is to adjust it once every three months. The in-kind allocation system will be cancelled, but in fact, the income in the first month may be slightly more than the sum of the salary multiple, living expenses, and in-kind allocation difference in the past. There will be no possibility of an increase in the second month, which is less than the increase in the difference in the past, not to mention the third month. Therefore, if the newly revised method for adjusting the treatment of public school personnel cancels in-kind allocations, public school personnel will suffer a loss. This is by no means the original intention of the Control Yuan and other agencies to strive to improve the treatment of public school personnel. Therefore, it is advocated that the index should be adjusted monthly to match the name of the cost of living index. Otherwise, the in-kind allocation system should be retained to maintain the livelihood of public school personnel. All the members unanimously agreed, and it was decided to make this opinion into a formal recommendation and submit it to the National Government for reconsideration.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the treatment of police officers, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs: The treatment of police officers throughout the country is based on the provisions of the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of the Police Officer System, paying the treatment from the 16th to the 8th grade of appointment. The living allowance is the same as that of ordinary civil servants.

### Sanhe Control Committee Members Visit Economic Council to Investigate Foreign Exchange Allocation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Control Committee members Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting visited Gu Yu, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, on the afternoon of the 26th to inquire about the allocation of foreign exchange for imported materials in the fourth quarter. Gu replied: The allocation and approval of foreign exchange are handled directly by the Executive Yuan, but the National Economic Council first examines it before approval, and the Transportation Control Commission is now responsible. Therefore, the allocation and approval of foreign exchange is not decided by the National Economic Council. Yu and others often put forward opinions, hoping that the government can take into account the general survival of factories in various places when allocating foreign exchange. For example, Tianjin only received 3.4% of the foreign exchange in the past, which is really too little, and hopes that the National Economic Council can provide relevant information on the allocation of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter. Gu often agreed to transfer it to the Transportation Control Commission for handling. Yu and others also went to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in the morning to report on the investigation progress of various departments. They will urge the departments to submit written materials quickly on the 28th to make the investigation immediate and practical.

### KMT Central Standing Committee Passes Resolution to Postpone the Seventh National Congress; List of National Representatives to be Announced, etc., to be Discussed Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The postponement of the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang has been discussed and decided by the Central Standing Committee on the 26th. The Fourth Plenary Session of last year resolved that the Seventh National Congress would be held on May 5, 1937. According to regulations, a notice should be issued three months before the meeting. The Central Standing Committee proposed it for discussion today, believing that the time was pressing and there was insufficient preparation, and decided to postpone it. However, the date of the postponement has not yet been decided. Regarding the issue of concessions to friendly parties and mutual concessions between comrades of our party in the election of National Representatives, the Central Standing Committee proposed it for discussion again on the 26th and decided to hand it over to the election team for further study.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The issue of the announcement of the list of National Representatives and the signing of the eligibility of nominated National Representatives was discussed for a long time at the Central Standing Committee on the 26th, but no conclusion was reached. According to statistics, those nominated by the Central Committee and elected accounted for 75% of the total, and the remaining 25% failed to be elected. Those who sign the nomination should be elected based on the number of votes, but they are bound by the provisions of the supplementary regulations for the election of the State Council, so their eligibility for election cannot be determined. At the same time, further discussions were held on the methods of concession to friendly parties, but no conclusion was reached. It was decided to convene a comprehensive team in the afternoon of the 27th to submit the list for discussion before sending it to the Central Standing Committee for a final decision. It is also heard that people from both the Democratic and Youth parties insisted on the number of candidates originally nominated. The Youth Party proposed the issue of "the party concedes the total amount to the party," that is, it is not a matter of a certain individual conceding to another individual, but a matter of the Kuomintang conceding to friendly parties. Therefore, under any circumstances, it must concede to the two parties. At the same time, if it is indeed impossible to be elected in a certain place, then the Kuomintang members must withdraw and concede to friendly parties in another place, so the total number often remains unchanged. People from both the Democratic and Youth parties also stated that the list of elected candidates must be agreed by both parties before it can be published, otherwise it will not be recognized. These issues will be discussed again at the meeting on the 27th.

### Signers and Nominees of National Representatives Petition the Central Standing Committee Separately

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Federation of Signers and Nominees of National Representatives and the central nominees who failed to be elected petitioned the Central Standing Committee in two different formations on the 26th. Representatives of the signers, such as Ma Wencao, were notified by the Central Party Headquarters in advance to go for talks. They were often received by Ma Chaojun, He Zhonghan, etc. They still proposed that the standard for election should be based on the majority of votes. Ma and others promised to convey it to the Central Standing Committee. Wang Qijiang received the central nominees who failed to be elected. They stated that if the Central Committee does not give them effective support, they will personally visit the President to ask for instructions, and then telegraphically invite the nationally nominated candidates by the Central Committee to come to Nanjing before March 10.

### Overseas Chinese in Macau Schedule to Elect National Representatives Within the National Border

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 26th] It is reported that Macau is scheduled to hold elections on February 21 to elect National Assembly representatives. It is also learned that the Nanjing Electoral Affairs Office instructed that it not touch on the election to be held outside Macau's borders, within our national territory.

### Kowloon and Shameen Cases: China and Britain Continue Negotiations; Chengdu Workers Go on Hunger Strike to Relieve Refugees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] China and Britain continued to have contact in negotiations on the 26th. British Embassy Counselor Rabaji visited Yin Baoyu, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the afternoon for about half an hour. The content is unknown. Our side is still waiting for the British reply on the Kowloon City issue and is still verifying the facts and considering the British note on the Shameen incident in Guangzhou. It is learned that before the British side responds to our protest on the Kowloon City issue, our side may not express any decision on the Shameen incident in Guangzhou. However, the British Embassy has not yet stated that they have received specific instructions from the British government regarding the Kowloon City issue. The development of negotiations on these two incidents seems to be pending. The consultations between the two sides may eventually be resolved at the same time.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 26th] Approximately 400,000 members of more than 40 trade unions in Chengdu went on a one-day hunger strike on the 26th to donate their day's food expenses to the refugees in Kowloon and to support the government in defending the integrity of the motherland's territory and the independence of its sovereignty.

### U Midden Arrives in Nanjing; Visits Director of Protocol of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Today to Set Date for Meeting with Foreign Minister Wang

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The first Burmese Ambassador to China, U Midden, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 26th and went to the embassy next to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to rest. The Burmese Embassy is the closest embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The two very similar national flags, fluttering in the wind, symbolize the progress of these two neighboring and friendly brothers.

### Soviet Ambassador Expresses Dissatisfaction with Allied Policy Toward Japan

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Soviet Committee Member of the Far Eastern Commission and Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, replied to written questions from the United Press on the 25th, expressing dissatisfaction with the progress of the Allied policy toward Japan in rebuilding democracy and preventing the resurgence of militarism. The United Press asked: What are your thoughts on the Far Eastern Commission's supervision of the Allied policy toward Japan? Ambassador Pan replied: "The Far Eastern Commission's greatest task is to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism and to democratize Japan. This is well known. The progress cannot be considered satisfactory and requires serious attention."

### Communist Bandit Stronghold in Dongtai, Dazhongji, Recovered

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 26th] The National Army troops under Li Mo'an in northern Jiangsu attacked the communist bandits in the Jianghai area of Dongtai with powerful forces, defeating the bandit 11th and 12th Columns in one fell swoop, successively capturing bandit strongholds such as Sancanghe and Panjiachang. They continued to pursue them for days and finally recovered the bandit stronghold of Dazhongji, killing and capturing many bandits and seizing a large number of supplies. On the 25th, the National Army swept around Dazhongji. After the bandits wantonly destroyed it, they fled in embarrassment. It is estimated that they burned down all the power generation and textile machinery and a large number of cotton, oil, cloth, and grain in the cooperative societies and Huainan Industrial Society in Yuhua Town and Xinpu Town. Note: The communist bandits' old strongholds in northern Jiangsu were Hede Town and Dazhongji, which have both been destroyed successively.

### Chairmen of Jiangsu and Henan Provinces Go to Xuzhou to Attend Pacification Conference

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 26th] Wang Gong, Chairman of Jiangsu Provincial Government, Mai Yunshan, Deputy Commander of the Security Forces, Shen Peng, Director of Civil Affairs, and Yao Yao, Director of Construction, arrived in Xuzhou by train at 8:00 PM on the 26th to attend the Pacification Conference of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, which will open on the 28th.

### Chairman Receives Yi Min, Promises 50 Billion for Construction of Xinjiang

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Yi Min, Director of the New Frontier Construction Department, and his wife visited Chairman Chiang and his wife at 4:30 PM on the 26th. The Chairman expressed his appreciation for the Xinjiang construction plan previously proposed by Yi. He promised to allocate 50 billion yuan to enable Yi to promote the plan to construct Xinjiang. At the same time, because the Xinjiang Governor's Office had confiscated the property of the people of Xinjiang in the past, the Chairman's approval of this large amount of money is equivalent to compensating the people of Xinjiang for their losses. Yi believes that this is of great importance to the morale of the people of Xinjiang. As for Yi's plan, he suggested organizing a Xinjiang Construction Guidance Group, with Lin Jirong as the leader. Lin is currently in Shanghai and cannot go to Xinjiang due to an incident. He is currently looking for a deputy leader to represent him.

### US Post-War Aid to China Totals 2.271 Billion US Dollars; US Foreign Policy Association Publishes Ray's Report

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The private research organization, the US Foreign Policy Association, published a report by member Ray on the 25th, estimating that the total value of major US aid to China after the war was US$2,278 million. Ray was the former director of the UNRRA China Branch and is currently a key member of the Marshall Plan Review Committee. According to his estimate, US military aid to China since the Japanese surrender was $844,729,000, most of which was military lend-lease materials and services, totaling $702,564,000 by the end of June 1947. A total of $970,107,000 was used for relief, reconstruction, and trade promotion. The largest item was the US contribution of $492,950,000 to the UNRRA relief plan, followed by the sale of surplus army materials, totaling $270,000,000. Under the heading of financial assistance, there was $150,000,000, which was the balance of the $500,000,000 war loan in 1942. The amount of educational and charitable funds was $30,450,000. The total of all items was US$2,278 million. Secretary of State Marshall's plan for continued aid to China, which was proposed last November, stipulates that it is US$300 million. Some parties claim that the plan may be announced in a few days, and the number may be expanded.

[Another Dispatch] The National Army troops sweeping the northwest of Baoyuan County encountered the bandits' Mancheng Independent Battalion this morning in the area of Nanbeiqicun, fifteen miles southeast of Mancheng.

### Scenery of Shenyang City

Most Residents Lack Coal for Heating; Bunkers Are Densely Distributed and Security Is Tight

[United Press, Beiping, 26th] The lives of most of the 1.5 million residents of Shenyang are extremely miserable. Except for necessary places such as military facilities, police stations, large hotels, and the residences and offices of foreign consular personnel, there are no electric lights. A curfew is in effect from 6:00 PM, making life even more unpleasant. Most restaurants close at 5:00 PM, and people have nowhere to go except home. At home, they can only use candles and kerosene lamps for lighting. Few can afford to use coal for heating, resulting in cold and unhappiness. Business is slow, and most shops close their doors at 3:00 PM. Some have closed permanently due to business failures or the owners leaving. Shenyang is preparing for street battles, with bunkers densely distributed and troops stationed everywhere. Military installations, police stations, wireless telegraph offices, and warehouses are all protected by barbed wire. Many factories show signs of having their machinery dismantled by the Soviets and being looted. Most of the doors, windows, and roof tiles are gone. The poverty of the residents is evident everywhere, with some selling all their indoor furniture. Occasionally, one sees共prisoners, some wearing military uniforms and others in plain clothes, being escorted to concentration camps by guards. Japanese houses have all been requisitioned for official use. The South Manchuria Railway Company is now the headquarters of the Northeast National Army, with excellent buildings and heating facilities. The former Yamamoto Hotel has been renamed the Railway Hotel, also with heating and electricity, and plenty of hot water. Bathing is available every Saturday.

Editorial

### Hasten the Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan!

Following the U.S. Army's request for $500 million in aid to Japan, the U.S. submitted a detailed memorandum to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, D.C., stating the necessity of helping Japan become self-sufficient and requesting the approval of all Allied nations. Although we have not yet received sufficient information to ascertain the attitudes of the Allied nations in general, we in China, having suffered from Japanese aggression for a long time and with particularly severe harm, have already expressed concerns about MacArthur's lenient policy toward Japan. The current news naturally makes us even more uneasy. We need not delve into how the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, D.C. will deliberate on this matter; from China's standpoint, since a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, the further expression of aid to Japan seems inappropriate in terms of both sentiment and reason. The generosity of the United States towards Japan has clearly exceeded the scope that a victorious nation should extend to a nation that still holds an enemy status. Therefore, we believe that whatever policy is adopted towards post-war Japan, a prerequisite is the convening of a peace conference with Japan and the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Hastening the convening of a peace conference with Japan should be our current goal.

Originally, the issue of convening a preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan had been fraught with waves and dangers in the correspondence between China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and it had recently reached a stalemate. If this stalemate cannot be broken, it will inevitably lead to a split among the Allied nations. Judging from the current signs, it is difficult to break the stalemate. The United States and the Soviet Union each have their own plans, and only China is isolated and hesitating amidst the two extremes. The government is distressed, and its diplomacy appears to lack vigor; the people are restless, and despite declarations and discussions, they lack support. However, in any case, we must seek to break the stalemate in order to hasten the convening of a peace conference with Japan.

Now, let us first examine the attitudes of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The four countries have never been in agreement on the procedural issues of the Japanese peace conference, and there are at least three different opinions among them.

The United States and the United Kingdom hold one opinion. The United States proposed its opinion in August 1947, and it has not changed or been revised since then. Regarding the procedure for the Japanese peace conference, the United States advocates that the eleven nations participating in the Far Eastern Commission jointly draft the peace treaty and vote on it by a two-thirds majority. The key to this proposal is to abolish the veto power and oppose using the foreign ministers' conference as a procedure for discussing the Japanese peace treaty. After the Canberra Conference, the United Kingdom adopted a consistent attitude, especially with Australia's active stance. The addition of Pakistan and Burma to the Far Eastern Commission makes it clear that the United States and the United Kingdom want to gain an advantage in procedure by a majority and to abolish the principle of unanimity among the four powers in substance.

The Soviet Union holds another opinion. The Soviet Union rejected the original proposal of the United States. It advocated that the foreign ministers of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union be responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty and that the veto power be reserved in procedure. The Soviet Union's purpose is to use the existence of the foreign ministers' conference as an institution for creating peace treaties around the world and to use the weapon of veto power to resist the diplomatic advantage of the Anglo-American front. On November 28, 1947, the Soviet Union replied to the Chinese note, agreeing with the Chinese suggestion that all decisions on the Japanese peace treaty must be agreed upon by the representatives of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. However, it emphasized that before the preparatory meeting, the four powers should hold a foreign ministers' conference in China to discuss the preparations for the Japanese peace conference. On December 5, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs again informed the Soviet Union, stating that the Far Eastern Commission should be responsible for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, and hoped that the Soviet Union would agree to China's compromise proposal. On December 30, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied to our note, without changing his previous position. However, he advocated that member states of the Far Eastern Commission other than the four powers should participate in the work of the various committees and subcommittees that may be established for the Japanese peace conference. This clearly shows that the procedure for the Japanese peace conference advocated by the Soviet Union is the foreign ministers' conference, and only the foreign ministers' conference is responsible for preparing the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty.

Outside of these two factions, China is conciliatory and intermediate. The Chinese opinion has been changed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the final version should be based on the content of the note sent to the United States and the Soviet Union on November 17, 1947, which suggests two points: 1. A preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should be composed of member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and the meeting should be convened on a date agreed upon by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, in order to draft a peace treaty and discuss matters related to the convening of the final peace conference; 2. Voting at the meeting should be by a majority of the member states of the meeting, but the majority must include the unanimous votes of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The key to this proposal is to maintain the organizational spirit of the Far Eastern Commission and to retain the veto power while upholding the principle of "unanimous consent." Therefore, the Chinese opinion is a reconciliation of the differences between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and it can also be said to be a revision of the above two factions. The United Kingdom has twice expressed its refusal to the Chinese proposal, and the Soviet Union and the Chinese proposal have in common the reservation of the veto power, but the opinions of China and the Soviet Union still have considerable differences on the issue of the four countries versus the eleven countries.

Among these three divergent opinions, the United States and the United Kingdom are in agreement, while China and the Soviet Union are each isolated and not entirely consistent. This is the key to the stalemate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. In the middle of this, China is neither generously supported by the Soviet Union, nor does it incur the aversion of the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite thinking that its advocacy has a grand banner and a proper drum, it still cannot avoid being isolated. The government and the people feel the same distress, and diplomacy does not show any vigor.

Chinese public opinion calls on the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union to use wisdom and broaden their horizons to seek compromise. The voice is loud, but it does not receive the slightest response. In fact, the politicians of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have well-thought-out plans. The United Nations General Assembly is interfering with various issues in the Far East (especially the Korean issue), and the discussion of the Liaodong Economic Conference shows clearly the Soviet Union's attitude that it is unwilling to bow its head under the diplomatic advantage of the Anglo-American front. Its attitude towards any issue is uncooperative. In the Soviet Union's view, the Japanese peace treaty is also of great importance. In the current situation, the longer the Japanese peace conference is delayed, the more beneficial it will be to the Soviet Union; the more free and convenient the Soviet Union's attitude will be towards a Japanese peace conference without Soviet participation. As for the United States and the United Kingdom, if they do not get Soviet cooperation, the Japanese peace conference will still be convened. Judging from the current trend of the United States controlling Japan, it is also possible to restore a state of peace with Japan unilaterally, without concluding any treaty. Although this is not a conventional way to end a war, there are precedents in history. The war between France and Mexico in 1867 ended in this way; and the end of the war between the United States and Germany in World War I was that the U.S. President approved the resolutions of both houses in July 1921, declaring the restoration of peace with Germany. It is possible for the United States to unilaterally make peace with Japan, but the reason why it has not done so now is that, on the one hand, the Soviet Union's offensive on the peace conference has not yet reached its peak, and on the other hand, it is expecting to fully win over China in a situation that is favorable to China. If China insists on "not participating in a peace conference without the Soviet Union," then the United States is very likely to be forced to unilaterally make peace with Japan. Judging from the rise of Stricker's anti-compensation theory, it clearly shows that the United States only wants Japan to become a bird and does not need Japan's compensation. Judging from Japan's secret plan for counter-demands in the peace treaty, as long as it does not have to pay compensation or pays less compensation, it may as well let it go. Therefore, it is even more convincing that the United States and Japan may make peace unilaterally. If the United States does this, the United Kingdom will not object. What Australia and the Philippines are fighting for is a small amount of compensation, and the issue is not serious.

In this bad situation, China's situation is the worst. No matter how skillful we are in dealing with it, we cannot "avoid being affected." In fact, China cannot make peace with Japan alone. First, it is difficult to enjoy the rights of a victorious nation by making peace alone. China's separate peace with Germany in August 1919 is a clear example. Second, China is bound by the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" of August 1945, which prohibits both sides from making peace with Japan separately and establishes a military alliance. Therefore, from China's standpoint, it should hope for the stalemate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty to be broken, and it does not want to see the Allied nations split or the United States make peace with Japan alone. Therefore, we hope that wise American politicians will take responsibility for rebuilding peace in the Far East, break the current stalemate, and follow one of the following two paths:

1. Accept China's compromise proposal and maintain the principle of unanimous consent of the four powers at the peace conference;

2. Convene a foreign ministers' conference of the four powers to attempt to discuss the content of the Japanese peace treaty. If the four powers can substantially coordinate, then the formal Japanese peace conference of the eleven Far Eastern nations can be resolved at the end.

Other than that, the stalemate cannot be broken; continuing it is detrimental to the cooperation of the Allied nations. We do not want to see the dangerous situation in Europe repeated in the Far East, and we especially do not want Japan to reap the benefits of counter-demands in the peace treaty in this contradiction between the United States and the Soviet Union. In today's situation, it is most beneficial to Japan: the United States and the United Kingdom are jumping, the Soviet Union is resisting, China is annoyed, and Japan is laughing! If "Japan fails in the war and wins in peace," that would be a complete defeat in strategy and political strategy for the Allied nations!

The current transportation volume on this road is about 1,000 tons per month.

### Tianjin Food Problem: Relief Measures Decided

Liang Ziqing Discusses the Process of Negotiating in Beijing

[Our Newspaper News] Liang Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Government, went to Shanghai via Beijing to solve the Tianjin food problem, and has repeatedly negotiated with the central authorities on the relation. It has now been completed, and he came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. He is scheduled to return to Tianjin within days. Yesterday, he especially met with the press in this city and described in detail the local situation and economic situation in Pingjin, and the main points of Liang's speech are excerpted as follows:

### Provide Four Major Principles

The main task of this trip to Beijing is to contribute four major principles for solving the Tianjin food problem to the central government. The task is to assist the North China Petition Group in providing the central government with five suggestions for relieving the economy of North China. The four major principles for solving the Tianjin food problem are: First, try to be self-reliant and request loans from the central government to purchase miscellaneous grains in the Northwest. It is estimated that the surplus of miscellaneous grains in the Northwest is about 10,000 tons, while Pingjin needs 17,000 tons each per month. Therefore, even if all 50,000 tons are purchased, it will only be enough for the food of ten thousand Jin for two months. The second is to request the expansion of the transshipment quota of flour in the Yangtze River area, and it is best to abolish the quota system. The third is to strive for the proportion of the 115,000 tons of food in the US relief agreement allocated to Pingjin. Regarding this point, the negotiation has already yielded results, and Director Miao of the Distribution Committee has promised to allocate 50,000 tons of flour to relieve Pingjin. The fourth is that Tianjin plans to exchange export materials for foreign food.

### Central Government's Two Measures

Negotiation Process: In terms of food, the central government's emergency measures are to transport 300,000 bags of flour to Jin before the Lunar New Year. The usual measures are to allocate 500,000 bags of flour to Tianjin every month starting from February of this year (excluding the quota for public officials and teachers). In addition, there is no limit to the transportation of miscellaneous grains from the Yangtze River area to the north. President Zhang of the National Bank has also agreed to give the Tianjin and Shanghai grain purchase general preferential exchange rates. The Ministry of Food has decided to thoroughly investigate the matter of charging a license fee of 150,000 yuan per bag for the transport of flour from the south to the north.

### The Difficulty of Implementing a Linked System

In order to solve the grain problem in Tianjin, a proposal has been made to implement a local import-export linkage system on a trial basis in Tianjin. This would involve exchanging Tianjin's exports, such as bristles, walnuts, soybeans, peanuts, sausage casings, and camel hair, for essential grains. It is estimated that under normal circumstances, these exports could generate US$10 million in foreign exchange each quarter. This amount could import at least 53,000 tons of flour, which would solve Tianjin's grain shortage for April and May. Currently, because imported goods must be purchased from the black market and exports are settled at the official exchange rate, the quarterly export value is only about US$2 million. If a partial import-export linkage system can be implemented, it can not only solve Tianjin's grain problem but also generate an additional US$8 million in foreign exchange for the country each quarter. At the same time, in order to take into account the central government's principles of controlling foreign exchange and overall allocation, a special exchange settlement method is proposed. However, Mr. Zhang, the President of the National Bank, believes that since all regions of the country have foreign exchange income, it is not possible to create a fragmented situation by allowing Tianjin to implement a partial trial. Moreover, import-export linkage would inevitably lead to an increase in imports and an increase in the price of export goods, causing a rampant black market for US dollars. Therefore, he believes that it is not feasible to consider.

### Ordering and Purchasing Finished Products

Regarding the issue of opening up industrial loans, Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the North China Industrial Association, has proposed four points: 1. Increase industrial loan interest rates; 2. Change the method of documentary bills; 3. Relax the loan amount to be sufficient for one month's turnover; 4. Extend the deadline to February or March. As a result of negotiations, the central government agreed to purchase finished products through orders. Mr. Liang particularly pointed out that last year, Tianjin alone received only 5.12 billion yuan in industrial loans for the entire year, which is vastly different from Shanghai, creating a state of economic bias. He sincerely hopes that this can be improved this year.

### Continued Clarification of Names of Dead and Injured Passengers in Shenyang Accident

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] Among the ten passengers who died in the China National Aviation Corporation's Pingfan plane crash, in addition to the eight already known, the remaining two have now been confirmed as Zhang Wenqing and Sun Tianxia (a boy). The two injured passengers, Chen Yukui and Liang Chaozong, have also been confirmed to be the aliases of Chen Shan and Liang Jinchen on the passenger list. As for the cause of the accident and the issue of responsibility, the personnel of the Civil Aviation Administration are currently responsible for investigating it on the spot.

### Cold Wave Attacks Various Places, Prices Soar, Many Corpses on the Roads

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 26th] Due to the severe cold weather, rivers are frozen, and the transportation of rice and grain is difficult, resulting in a rare supply. Coupled with the loose monetary policy, it has now created a shocking surge in prices. In the rice and grain market, black market white rice is 1,427,000, japonica rice is 635,000, wheat is 1,600,000, flour is 625,000, soybean oil is 3,300,000, and cotton yarn has returned to 36,350,000.

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 26th] A cold wave is affecting Taiwan Province, with cloudy and rainy weather in various places. Snow fell on Datun Mountain and Yushan this morning.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 26th] Snow fell in Fuzhou today, stopping slightly at noon. The north wind is fierce, and the cold is deep.

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 26th] The weather in Chengdu suddenly turned extremely cold on the 25th. Heavy snow fell in the evening, and by the 26th, the entire city had become a silver world. Prices also fluctuated accordingly, with rice, oil, miscellaneous grains, and all kinds of goods continuing to rise. Last night, there were more than a hundred frozen corpses on the streets, punctuating this tragic New Year scene.

### West Lake Freezes

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th] Hangzhou has been experiencing severe cold for several consecutive days. West Lake is completely frozen, with ice blocks everywhere. There have already been four or five deaths on the roads.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Shanghai exchange rate fell to 155 yuan this morning. There is still a lot of cash flowing from Shanghai. In addition to air transport, it is reported that a whole ship was transported south yesterday. A large amount of capital from the Northeast is flowing into Beiping. The private exchange business of various banks and firms amounts to hundreds of millions to billions of yuan per day. There is a severe shortage of food in the Northeast. Airplanes carrying family members of the Commission on Resources are flying to transport food for relief every day. Food prices in Beiping have risen sharply again, with white rice costing 22,000 yuan per catty.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 26th] The weather in Tianjin has turned colder again today. The ice conditions on the Hai River are quite serious, making navigation very difficult. All the icebreakers of the Hai River Engineering Bureau have been dispatched to work. The China Merchants Bureau's Min Zi No. 1317 icebreaker set off from Tianjin to Tanggu again on the 26th to rescue the Great Wall ship, which ran aground off Dagukou a few days ago.

[United Press, Qingdao, 26th] There was heavy snow here last night, and the temperature dropped to minus 13.2 degrees Celsius, breaking the record of the past eleven years. Part of the harbor is frozen, with ice four inches thick, which has delayed the work of unloading coal and transporting coal to the Shanghai Power Plant, etc. The city has been experiencing local power outages for four days due to a shortage of coal. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, prices have soared, especially for food. Flour, 45 pounds per bag, is now selling for 820,000 yuan, and Shanghai rice is 20,000 yuan per catty.

### China National Aviation Corporation's Ningxia Route Scheduled to Open on the 30th

Chongqing Route to Use "Sky Master" Aircraft

[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's Ningxia route has been officially scheduled to open on the 30th of this month. The route is from Beiping to Guihua, then to Ningxia, and finally to Lanzhou, with one flight every Friday. This route is of great value politically, and China National Aviation Corporation has been preparing for it for a long time. Due to various difficulties such as the extremely cold climate in Ningxia, the lack of gasoline, and the barren airfield, it has been delayed until now. Now the airfield military equipment and the aircraft de-icing equipment have been installed. Gasoline is transported from Beiping to Guihua for storage and transported at any time.

[Another Report] China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing flights have been using C47 twin-engine aircraft. Recently, in view of the difficulties in water transport on the Yangtze River and the congestion of passengers waiting for flights to Chongqing in Shanghai, it is planned to send a "Sky Master" four-engine giant aircraft on the 28th for a trial flight from Shanghai to Wuchang and then to Chongqing Baishiyi Airfield, so that it can carry more passengers and relieve traffic congestion. If the test results are good, more "Sky Master" aircraft will be added to the line regularly in the future.

[Central News Agency, Haikou, 26th] Transportation between Haikou and Yulin has always been extremely inconvenient. China National Aviation Corporation has recently decided that the Guangzhou-Haikou route will be extended to Yulin every Saturday, returning to Haikou and then to Guangzhou on the same day, with a ticket price of 1.6 million yuan.

### Allied Victory Public Bonds Must be Exchanged Before the End of March

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The fundraising operations for the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd year Allied Victory Public Bonds issued by the government during the War of Resistance have been completed separately. The bond certificates of each of these bonds have long since begun to be exchanged. However, due to wartime conditions, or due to inconvenient transportation, or due to relocation to other places, some subscribers in various places have not been able to exchange them. For the benefit of the subscribers, the Ministry of Finance has not only instructed the finance bureaus of various provinces and cities to announce separately that all subscribers must bring their original temporary receipts to the original handling bank to exchange for bond certificates before the end of March of the 37th year, and those who fail to do so after the deadline will be considered as donations to the country and returned to the national treasury for cancellation, but also issued a notice to inform the public.

### An Important Page in Ending the Great War: The Surrender of the "Kwantung Army" From Siberian Captivity Back to Japan

— Interviews with Captives

[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Correspondence] The Second World War has long passed, but how the arrogant and barbaric "Kwantung Army" quickly disintegrated during the surrender process of Japan remains a mystery to the world. Recently, a group of Kwantung Army prisoners of war who were sent back to Japan from Siberia arrived in Tokyo. Reporters interviewed them, and they revealed the situation at the time. Although it has become a thing of the past, it still has a certain value. The following is their conversation:

After Germany announced its surrender to the Allied Forces (April 1945), the Soviet Union began secretly transporting its troops to the Far East. By mid-July, the situation became particularly tense. The Siberian Railway openly entered a state of wartime transportation, and the situation along the Manchurian border became increasingly tense day by day. Although the Nomonhan Incident had occurred before, the Soviet Union had never assembled such a strong force. Among them, weapons, ammunition, food, materials, etc., were about five years of combat expenses. The Soviet Union had completed its plan to concentrate its forces in key areas of the country within a few months.

The entire Japanese army on Suban Island was annihilated, and the American forces landed on Okinawa Island and launched a more fierce offensive. In order to prepare for the defense of the Japanese mainland, the elite Kwantung Army troops in Northeast China were constantly transferred to Korea and Japan. Their strength was greatly reduced, but in preparation for the Soviet Union's attack, all of us held the spirit of "gyokusai" (honorable death) and actively constructed new defensive works along the line of the Xing'an Mountains - Muling - Laoyeling - Dunhua. At the same time, we used the mountainous areas to continuously build underground factories day and night to prepare for a long-term defense.

On August 8, near the front of the ×th Army (Bandaihe), about 200 Soviet soldiers illegally crossed the border. Because our army did not receive orders from above, we temporarily withdrew. On the morning of August 9, the Soviet army began attacking various places such as Hailar, Hunchun, and Dongning on the front of the 5th Army, and both sides entered a state of combat. At the same time, the military headquarters continued to report that the Soviet army had begun attacking various places such as Hailar, Hunchun, and Dongning. Subsequently, the major cities of Harbin, Fengtian, and Gongzhuling began to be bombarded and bombed. From that day on, Northeast China, which had always been considered a safe zone, unfortunately entered a combat zone.

However, in terms of troop strength, the Soviet Union's Far East Army at this time had 1.5 million, while we only had half that number, about 700,000 (34 divisions and 9 brigades). The Soviet Union had more than 5,000 aircraft, while we only had 500, of which 300 were still being repaired, so only 200 were actually usable. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had about 5,000 tanks, while we only had one regiment of tank units.

Most of our elite troops had been transferred to the mainland, and those who remained were mostly older, weaker supplementary soldiers around the age of 40. Therefore, each army could only hold its own position and wait for the Soviet army's attack in great panic. The Soviet Union's main attack was aimed at encircling the entire "Manchuria." With the cooperation of mechanized units and excellent air force, they launched a fan-shaped rapid attack across the entire territory. Therefore, only a few days after the war, the situation had reached Far Eastern Spring. At the same time, the Soviet Navy was actively conducting landing operations on the northern Korean front.

At that time, almost all cities that were military, political, and transportation centers were bombed. The major military and political figures of "Manchuria" retreated and evacuated one after another. Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, was escorted by the military and left Changchun on a special court train on August 13, arriving in Tonghua on the 14th. He resided in the private residence of the president of a certain coal mine. At this time, an underground palace was being built day and night on the eastern side of the road.

Such scenes of bombing, panic, evacuation, and chaos were rare in history. At the same time, strange rumors spread throughout Changchun: Japan has requested a ceasefire from the Allied Forces Command. The diplomatic aspect of the puppet Manchukuo has secretly negotiated a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

On August 15, the news of the surrender was broadcast by radio, but we had not yet received orders from the headquarters and were still carrying out combat operations. The headquarters convened an emergency meeting to carefully discuss the future actions of the military. At that time, there were both proponents of peace and war, but the majority were proponents of war. As a result, the leading group completely eliminated the will to cease fire. The three army headquarters (China Expeditionary Army, South Seas Expeditionary Army, and Kwantung Army) simultaneously issued strong telegrams to various places: believing that the morale of the soldiers was strong and the will of the central leadership was firm, holding the spirit of "gyokusai," overcoming difficult key points, and thoroughly annihilating the British and Americans. Furthermore, the young staff officers of the military headquarters used the following three reasons to encourage their subordinates: 1. Soldiers and citizens should be educated in the spirit of Nanko's loyalty and patriotism. Absolutely no contamination of the glorious history of Japan for three thousand years with the stain of surrender is allowed. Eastern Asia must fight to the last soldier. 2. The Peace Edict is not the true intention of the Emperor but a forgery by treacherous officials beside the Emperor. Rapidly dispatch a plane back to Nanjing to eliminate the traitors. 3. The 2.5 million spiritual defense forces on the Japanese mainland are on standby in excellent condition and will surely fight a decisive battle with the British and Americans.

In this extremely noisy and uneasy meeting, with the emphasis on war, the Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Hayashi and Commander-in-Chief Yamada Otsuzo tearfully pleaded with their subordinates: "Obeying the Imperial Order is the duty of a soldier. I hope that the officers and soldiers will abide by the Imperial Rescript, cease combat operations, and quickly disarm."

On August 17, the combat consciousness of each army was still extremely strong. Generals who transmitted surrender orders were considered "Soviet spies" and were killed with a single stroke of a knife. It was not until the 18th that combat operations gradually ceased.

Puyi, the puppet emperor of Manchukuo residing in Chebian Road, "informed" the military headquarters of the ceasefire agreement and requested "His Majesty's intention" regarding future actions. Puyi believed that it would be better to reside in Japan, so he urgently escorted the palace to Tian Airport, preparing to take a plane to Japan. However, just a moment later, dozens of Soviet fighter planes had landed at the same airport. Later, Puyi was guarded by the Soviet army, and we also immediately disarmed, experiencing a dark and hopeless life of defeat, living as forced laborers in Siberia. (Chen Luo)

### France Announces Currency Devaluation, Establishes Free Foreign Exchange Market, Declares that this Move is Transitional, Close Technical Cooperation between Britain and France to Avoid Adverse Consequences

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Paris News, French Prime Minister Schuman told the National Assembly today that in order to keep the country's factories open and prevent unemployment, the devaluation of the franc is necessary. The National Assembly began debating the franc devaluation issue today, and its decision will have far-reaching implications.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The French government issued a statement on the 25th announcing the official new exchange rate of the franc and the free buying and selling of foreign exchange, and explained its reasons for taking this step. The statement stated, "In order to achieve its goal of stabilizing the economy, the French government has previously implemented anti-inflation measures. The steps taken today have made the adjustment of the exchange rate necessary to complete these measures." The French government was initially hesitant and unable to decide whether it should devalue the franc or adopt a more flexible plan, but it finally abandoned the former method because the French government believed that it was too early to set a fixed exchange rate that could meet all needs at this time. An exchange rate that is too low will not achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy, and an exchange rate that is too high will hinder the French economy. The French government's statement also stated, "A transitional period of free buying and selling is necessary to allow foreign exchange to achieve its natural balance. The French government firmly believes that its actions will not hinder the efforts of other countries to achieve the same goals. The International Monetary Fund Conference approved important parts of the French plan, but it refused to approve the entire plan, which the French government deeply regrets. The French government is prepared to take technical measures and implement coordinated controls to avoid uneasiness among countries whose currencies are not convertible."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The French government issued a statement on the evening of the 25th stating that the French Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund has stipulated a new exchange rate for the franc, with one US dollar equal to 214.392 francs and one British pound equal to 864 francs. The steps announced by the French government are two: 1. The French Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund will allow the franc exchange rate to float by 80% from January 26. The exchange rate of the French franc against other currencies in the franc zone will remain unchanged, and the exchange rate of the French rupee against the US dollar and the British pound will also remain at the original price. 2. In addition to the official exchange rate, foreign exchange can be freely bought and sold under the following conditions: (A) Half of the foreign exchange earned from French exports is sold to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund at the official price, and the other half can be sold on the free market. Other foreign exchange, such as that from trade surpluses, foreign funds flowing into France, and foreign exchange held by foreign tourists in France, can also be sold on the free market. (B) The foreign exchange obtained from free trading can be used to pay for imported goods, but other imported goods necessary for the French economy are settled at the official exchange rate. (C) The trading price of foreign exchange in the free market should be allowed to rise and fall according to the amount of supply and demand.

[Reuters, London, 25th] According to announcements from Paris and London, Britain and France will immediately begin technical cooperation to reduce the repercussions caused by the relationship between the sterling area and the franc area. France also stated that the measures officially announced this time are not permanent, but only a step towards setting a unified exchange rate for the franc.

### British Government Determined to Take Necessary Measures: Finance Minister Reports to the House of Commons on the Paris Negotiations

[Report from Our Own Newspaper] London, 26th (Broadcast): Following his participation in a cabinet meeting today, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps informed the House of Commons that Britain will take all necessary measures to maintain the stability of the pound sterling's value, so as not to be affected by the devaluation of the French franc.

[United Press London, 26th] The cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to discuss the threat to the value of the pound sterling following France's announcement of the devaluation of the franc. Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps will present a report detailing the failure of his trip to France to dissuade the French government from abandoning its plan to devalue the franc.

[United Press London, 26th] Government bonds on the stock market suddenly plummeted today, causing widespread panic. The future of the pound sterling is difficult to assess, and most newspapers here believe the pound is on the verge of crisis.

[Agence France-Presse London, 25th] It is generally believed in London financial circles that the French government's decision on currency reform directly violates the Bretton Woods international monetary agreement. It is claimed that "the French government's action will set a dangerous precedent for other countries, sufficient to promote international monetary chaos. The French government may also be unable to control its domestic financial market. It remains highly doubtful whether allowing the French franc's exchange rate to float will cause funds stored abroad to flow back to the country. This method is likely to cause more illegal trading. Although gold still cannot be freely traded in the French free market, the value of the pound sterling against the US dollar will inevitably decrease due to the increase in illegal trading. French prices are already 40% higher than the world's average, but with the floating exchange rate, France can dump goods into the dollar area at low prices. At a time when Britain and France increasingly need to sign economic and political agreements, the French government's adoption of such measures is truly regrettable."

[Reuters London, 25th] According to Reuters' financial correspondent Campbell, the main reason for Britain's opposition is not the fear that exports will decrease due to the devaluation of the French franc, but the fear that the pound sterling will be hindered by the French free market. Britain and other countries are not afraid of their exports decreasing.

### Anglo-French Joint Communiqué Issued

[Reuters London, 25th] The full text of the Anglo-French joint communiqué regarding the French franc issue is as follows: French Finance Minister Mayer exchanged views with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in London on the 16th and 17th of this month regarding the French government's currency plan. Chancellor Cripps then traveled to Paris on the 23rd and 24th to continue these negotiations. Although the two governments' opinions on the methods to be adopted in this matter did not coincide, the talks in London and Paris have demonstrated the candor and close nature of the existing relations between the two countries. The French government has submitted its proposal to the International Monetary Fund in Washington, explaining that the measure it has chosen is the only way to cope with the current situation, and does not intend it to be a permanent monetary system, but rather a step towards establishing a stable currency system based on a single exchange rate, which is the goal of French fiscal and economic policy. The British side has also reported Chancellor Cripps' objections to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund issued a statement on this matter today, which the British and French governments have noted. The United Kingdom government has expressed a consistent stance on the Fund's statement. Although the British and French governments have different views on this matter, they are willing to continue to cooperate so that any measures required under the current circumstances will have only a minimum impact on business relations between the pound sterling and franc zones. The two governments agree on this point, and under this spirit of understanding, the two countries have decided that technical experts from both sides will immediately begin close cooperation.

### Reactions Within France

[Reuters Paris, 25th] The general French public has mixed feelings about the devaluation of the French franc. Sensitive individuals deeply fear that domestic prices will be stimulated and rise as a result. Leaders of the Socialist Party, some Radical Party members, and prominent economists have great doubts about the effects of the new system. Some point out that the political consequences it will cause, such as the opposition of the British government, will outweigh its economic benefits. Official sources sincerely hope that the differences between Britain and France will not lead to a deterioration in relations between the two countries. It is expected that when Prime Minister Schuman addresses the National Assembly on Monday afternoon, he will make a strong statement on these matters.

### French Perfume Price Reductions

[Associated Press Paris, 25th] With the impending devaluation of the French franc, French exporters are prepared to greatly reduce the prices of French-made wines, perfumes, and other goods, so their patrons will soon feel the impact of the devaluation.

### Arab-Jewish Battle Taking Place on the Seven Sisters Hills

[Associated Press Jerusalem, 25th] The civil war between the Jewish and Arab communities, which has been ongoing for eight weeks, has resulted in a death toll of 3,200 as of the evening of the 25th. In the meantime, Jews and Arabs have engaged in a major air battle over the opening of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway, currently taking place on the Seven Sisters Hills.

### International Monetary Fund Disapproves, But Will Still Cooperate with France to Revise This System

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] Managing Director Gutt of the International Monetary Fund issued a statement saying, "The International Monetary Fund cannot fully endorse the financial measures proposed by France, but will continue to cooperate with France in the future so that the country can ultimately change its decision. The Fund believes that France does indeed need to adjust the exchange rate of the French franc, and is prepared to cooperate with France to ensure that the exchange rate after the devaluation of the French franc is realistic. The Fund is very satisfied with the new steps taken by the French government last month in fiscal and budgetary matters to stabilize the domestic currency system. As for the issue of free exchange trading, the Fund has studied all possible alternative methods, but ultimately feels it difficult to endorse the French government's intention to allow foreign exchange earned from French goods exports to be sold in the free market.

This move will not only adversely affect the member countries of the Fund, but is also not necessary for the stability of the French economy. The Fund deeply fears that other countries will also compete to lower their own currency values as a result, causing trade to deviate from its normal course. The Fund is aware that the French situation is very serious, but believes that the solution lies in joint efforts to maintain the stability of currency values at a safe level. The Fund regrets that the French government has decided to implement its plan despite the Fund's opposition. The Fund will continue to cooperate with France to find an alternative to this foreign exchange system that meets France's needs within the scope of the International Monetary Agreement."

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] Managing Director Gutt of the International Monetary Fund declared today while hosting a group of news reporters that people should not be too agitated about the devaluation of the French franc. The Fund will not be taking retalitory action against France, and the results of the devaluation are difficult to predict. However, he added that it was gratifying that the French government had frankly informed them of all the steps they intended to take. Gutt acknowledged that a complex situation will be created if other countries do not understand their equal status in the French free trade market and therefore cancel trade agreements made with France. He admitted that the Fund's opposition to this matter was roughly the same as the opposition made by the United Kingdom, but refused to indicate whether this was due to the insistence of the United Kingdom. Gutt declared that France stated it will not apply to the Fund for assistance within the next year, and said that France will guarantee that this measure is only temporary.

### US Aid to France Plan Not Affected

[Associated Press Washington, 26th] France's implementation of the devaluation of the French franc, despite the opposition of the International Monetary Fund, does not appear to have affected the Marshall Plan or the assistance France receives under this plan today. However, it is generally believed here that France's move is an heavy blow to the Fund, which is still in its infancy, and it is feared that other countries will follow suit. The Fund was established to prevent economic warfare, so as to avoid armed warfare. US government officials declared today that the US government will continue its current aid to France plan, hoping that France and the Fund can resolve their differences on this matter.

[Reuters Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources revealed: The United States has expressed support for Britain's opposition to France's establishment of a free foreign exchange market. The United States also fears that France's system will not achieve the desired results domestically, and will worsen political relations in the coming months, eventually affecting the satisfactory development of Bevin's "Western European Union" plan, as well as the US Congress's review of the Marshall Plan for European aid. If Britain believes that France's system discriminates against trade with Britain, it may take retaliatory trade control measures against France. It is generally hoped that close talks between Britain and France can improve relations in Western Europe.

### UN Mediation Committee Announces: Indonesia and the Netherlands to Resume Negotiations; Both Sides Have Accepted Six Principles Unconditionally

[Associated Press Batavia, 25th] The United Nations Committee of Good Offices for Indonesia, consisting of Australia, the United States, and Belgium, issued a communiqué today stating: The Netherlands and Indonesia are expected to resume negotiations this Saturday. Both sides have unconditionally accepted the six principles proposed by the Mediation Committee as the basis for negotiations. A plane will soon be dispatched from here to Yogyakarta to welcome the Indonesian delegation.

[Reuters Batavia, 25th] The Dutch news agency reports that the results of the plebiscite held by voters on Makangara Island and nearby islands show that 95% of voters support autonomy. The new government will be led by Jokra Ningrat, and the representative of Makangara to the Provisional Federal Council of the Republic of Indonesia will be the Regent of Bangaron, Laimisi. Its organizing committee has requested the Dutch government to recognize the new autonomous state.

### Lie to Visit Prague

[Agence France-Presse Prague, 26th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie was originally scheduled to fly from Amsterdam to Prague this afternoon, but was unable to arrive as scheduled due to fog.

### Hull's Memoirs to Meet American Readers

Our Newspaper Obtained the Rights to Distribute in Shanghai

[Reuters New York, 26th] The New York Times began publishing the memoirs of former Secretary of State Hull today. The newspaper stated that any form of reproduction is not permitted. (Note: Our newspaper also began publishing it yesterday and obtained the rights to distribute it in Shanghai.)

### Britain Convening Seven-Nation Conference to Discuss Steps to Realize the Western European Union; Britain Focused on Enhancing Mutual Relations Between Colonial Territories

[Associated Press London, 25th] British sources have recently stated that Britain may convene a seven-nation conference in London to turn Foreign Secretary Bevin's Western European Union plan from words into reality. Bevin held lengthy talks with Italian Ambassador to Britain Gallarati on the 25th. It is understood that the two discussed the possibility of cooperation between Italy and Britain, France, Portugal, and the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). It is expected that the next major step will be negotiations between Britain, the United States, and France on Germany.

[Agence France-Presse Rome, 25th] Italy will participate with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg in the conference to be held in Brussels on February 2 to establish a customs union. The Italian delegation will be led by Grazzi, Director of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] Regarding the economic alliance between Britain, France, and the Benelux countries, Agence France-Presse has learned from reliable sources that the British and French governments will begin talks soon to discuss the future relationship between the British and French overseas territories. Since Britain and France will each be a member of the Western European bloc, and in order to enhance their economic cooperation with each other, they must stipulate the relationship between the territories of the two countries. The discussion program includes the following key points: 1. Transportation and mutual use of ports; 2. Common price policy; 3. Joint production plans, so that the various members of the British and French overseas groups can complement each other's production; 4. Trade between the members. Preparatory talks will begin in February.

[Associated Press Cape Town, 25th] South African Prime Minister Smuts officially stated today that if Foreign Secretary Bevin's Western European group plan is successful, all of humanity will greatly benefit from it.

### Stassen Decides to Participate in the Presidential Candidate Election

This Move is Tantamount to Challenging Taft

[Reuters Washington, 26th] Former Minnesota Governor Stassen told reporters yesterday that he will participate in the Republican primary in Ohio on May 4. As Ohio is the home state of Senator Taft, Stassen's move is tantamount to challenging Taft. Stassen said that his participation in the primary in Ohio is the only opportunity for the Republican Party to determine the relative strengths of Stassen and Taft based on election votes before the party convenes its convention in June to elect a presidential candidate. It is said that Stassen's decision was influenced by General Eisenhower's refusal to participate in the election campaign last Friday. This move also proves the inaccuracy of the claim that Stassen and Taft have a tacit understanding.

### MacArthur's Former Subordinates Broadcast in Support of MacArthur's Campaign

[Associated Press Madison, Wisconsin, 25th] Former Governor La Follette, who was the leader of the Progressive Party before its dissolution, and who served on the staff of General MacArthur during the war, broadcast on the 25th, launching the movement to elect MacArthur as President in Wisconsin. La Follette said that MacArthur is far superior to other candidates in promoting world peace and preventing American militarism. He said that MacArthur's excellent performance in governing Japan, breaking the Japanese monopoly, establishing personal freedom, encouraging cooperative purchasing, and reforming the land, all achieved great results. MacArthur is the only senior military officer who has not announced his support for peacetime conscription; if MacArthur is elected, no one can make the United States fight against the Soviet Union. La Follette directly responded to Eisenhower's argument, saying that it is inappropriate to oppose someone's presidency simply because they are a military officer.

### UN Committee to Listen to Opinions of Leaders

[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 26th] The Second Subcommittee of the United Nations Korean Commission has now begun work. It issued a communiqué today stating that it has listened to the political views of nine Korean figures and is scheduled to meet with Syngman Rhee this morning and Kim Koo this afternoon. It will also need to meet with other important figures in the future.

[Agence France-Presse Seoul, 26th] Syngman Rhee, a prominent right-wing leader in Korea, requested today that the United Nations investigative team establish a Korean government within a US military-administered area when it cannot obtain a unified action in the northern region, and then assist Korea in expanding this government throughout the territory. Rhee expressed his views at a meeting of the Second Subcommittee of the investigative team, saying that this government would represent two-thirds of the Korean people, and said that the provisional election method within three months would definitely complete the organization so that the investigative team and the people's representatives would have the opportunity to discuss.

### UK and Transjordan Begin Treaty Revision Negotiations; Future Status of Foreign Troops Extremely Delicate

[Reuters London, 26th] Negotiations on the possibility of revising the 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty, as well as on the future status of Transjordanian troops currently stationed in Palestine by Britain, are scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM on the 26th when the Prime Minister of Transjordan visits Foreign Secretary Bevin. Britain is eager to revise the 1946 Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty to align with Britain's recent Middle East policy, and the relinquishment of certain privileges seems inevitable. It is believed here that the future status of Transjordanian troops is a most delicate issue. Some of these troops have recently participated in Arab attacks on Jewish areas, and the Palestinian government has asked Britain to raise this matter during negotiations. However, if these troops are disbanded, it will create serious defense problems for Transjordan and will inevitably provoke opposition from the Transjordanian delegation. Although a compromise is ultimately expected, the manner in which it will be achieved is not generally predictable.

### Japanese Diet Adjournment Postponed; Katayama Expresses Willingness to Continue in Power; Allied Forces Assist Japanese Government in Collecting Taxes

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 26th] The questioning of Prime Minister Katayama's general policy speech in the Japanese Diet may be completed on the 27th. It was originally scheduled to adjourn on the same day, but because important proposals, such as the new budget, have been submitted and the government urgently needs to resolve and implement them, it has requested a postponement of the adjournment.

[Another dispatch] Prime Minister Katayama of Japan, in response to questions in the Diet on the 26th, stated: "No matter how bad the general criticism of the Katayama cabinet is, with the support of the majority in the Diet, the cabinet will not dissolve the Diet and will continue to shoulder the responsibility of governing the country."

[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The Allied Forces' occupation report for December of last year states that the easing of the severity of the Japanese coal shortage and the passage of the six major reform bills by the Japanese Diet have greatly increased the hope of the Japanese people for economic recovery and continued progress. The six bills passed by the Diet are: 1. Abolition of the Ministry of Home Affairs; 2. Temporary state control of some coal mines; 3. Dissolution of "excessive power" in the economy; 4. Expansion of local political autonomy; 5. Establishment of a Prosecutor General to replace the Ministry of Justice.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today: The Allied Forces will be used as a backing to require Japanese people to pay taxes, as the inability to collect taxes has forced the government to print paper money, further worsening the already deteriorating inflation. The announcement on the 26th stated: Approximately 50 military government personnel will be dispatched throughout Japan to supervise Japanese people's tax payments.

### MacArthur's 68th Birthday

Declares Continued Work in Japan

[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur announced on his 68th birthday today: "I will remain in Japan, and unless there are special circumstances, I will not return home until the mission is completed." This statement is the same as the one he made last year, and the amount of work he is involved in is also the same as last year.

### Most Effective Cholera Serum Found at American University in Beirut

[US News Service New York, 26th] According to the New York Times: The American University in Beirut, Lebanon, has recently discovered the most complete and effective cholera serum in scientific history. The acting president of the university, Crawford, stated: The poisonous cholera used to create the serum totaled 30 types, including the cholera properties that have recently occurred in Egypt and are currently occurring in Syria. After the outbreak of cholera in Egypt last October, the university hospital's laboratory began large-scale production of serum. Within two months, it was able to supply 750 liters of serum to the ministries of health in Syria and Lebanon.

### Pope Makes Peace Appeal to the World

[Reuters Vatican, 25th] Authoritative sources report: When the Pope met with London photographer Whitington (the man who took the first color photograph of the Pope last month), he granted Whitington's request and decided to write a "Peace Letter" to all the peoples of the world in his own handwriting and transmit it to various places via facsimile telegraph. The contents of the letter will be broadcast on Rome Radio on Monday morning. Since this is the first time the Catholic Pope has formally addressed the people of the world, it is receiving great attention. The letter, which is written in English, will call on people around the globe to strive to accomplish peace and charity among mankind. The letter will also be published on the cover of "Lives of Great Men."

### America's Extreme Cold

Train Delays, Industrial Shutdowns; 23 Deaths Due to Cold

[Reuters New York, 26th] The East Coast of the United States was disturbed by the first major snowstorm of the winter today. The number of deaths has reached 23, and most coastal and central states are shrouded in 6 to 12 inches of accumulated snow. Southern states, such as Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and even New Orleans, have also experienced heavy snow.

### Earth Cracks, Sea Water Soars; Violent Earthquake in Central Philippines; Iloilo City Heavily Damaged, Nearly 100 Casualties

[Central News Agency Manila, 26th, Combined Dispatch] The old Spanish-style city of Iloilo and its scenic vicinity suddenly experienced violent earthquakes beginning at 2:00 AM today, lasting for over an hour, destroying many buildings and shocking the residents in their sleep. This earthquake was the most violent in 50 years, but Manila only had slight tremors.

[San Yang News Agency Manila, 25th, Combined Dispatch] After 17 violent earthquakes occurred in the central Philippines today, Iloilo, its third largest city, suffered heavy damage, with at least 15 deaths and serious injuries each, and about 50 minor injuries. Due to incomplete equipment, the Philippine Meteorological Bureau was unable to determine the epicenter of the earthquake. It is said that the epicenter was obviously near Iloilo, and the city suffered the most damage.

[Associated Press Manila, 25th] Five islands in the central Philippines were struck by continuous earthquakes today. Panay Island suffered the most damage, estimated to be worth at least US$5.1 million. The other four islands are Negros, Cebu, Leyte, and Marinduque. The most casualties occurred in Iloilo, the capital of Panay Island, where one person was killed by falling bricks while praying in the Arellano Temple.

[Another dispatch] The Philippine Meteorological Bureau reported today: The earthquake in Iloilo City this afternoon affected five major islands within four hours. Many huge cracks formed in the ground, some hundreds of yards long, and seawater surged into the sky, reaching the height of coconut trees. Many historically significant churches, schools, and buildings in six cities collapsed. A Manila news reporter witnessed the situation and reported: "At 1:46 PM, as the reporter was holding a pen, Iloilo City was experiencing a two-minute earthquake. Residents were frantically running in the streets again. Men and women, struck by terror, rushed out of their homes with children in their arms, seeking safety in the fields. A woman leading her child cried out: "There's still more coming! Oh heavens, what's happening?!"

### Hull's Memoirs Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance Translated by This Newspaper's Editorial Department The White House Group Plays "Liberalism" Tricks

I often had the opportunity to see the President in the morning, when he was still in bed. Usually, he was already up, had breakfast, and then returned to bed to handle the first work of the day. I found his bed covered with newspapers, documents, letters, and telegrams. I would drag a chair nearby to sit down, and we would begin to discuss the issues at hand. This method was customary for me during my many years in the State Department.

Generally speaking, I was not a close friend of the President in social aspects. I was not invited to White House banquets (except for official formal banquets), or to take weekend trips on Mr. Roosevelt's yacht, or to go to Hyde Park. Roosevelt respected my decision that I was unwilling to distract my energy in social aspects, but wanted to preserve them to handle official business. In addition, I honestly did not like being invited to the groups in the White House, who often played "liberalism" tricks to the extreme.

Everyone knows that I am not an extreme liberal, nor a semi-radical, like some people close to the President. It was as awkward for me to be with them as it was for them.

What I found more meaningful was that I had many times when I dined alone with the President in a comfortable and quiet setting. In this situation, we could at least talk face to face for an hour without being verbose.

My relationship with the President's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was the most sincere. In my opinion, she was an outstanding woman who had dedicated everything to her son and her country. I first knew her because I heard that she often supported me and my views on official business. She became a warm and familiar friend, and in our conversations, she always showed a broad knowledge and accurate understanding of international issues and the current situation.

Mrs. Roosevelt was a bit more to the left than I was, and my contact with her was extremely limited, although it has allowed me to appreciate her abilities. She was a brave fighter for peace, and she exerted a broad influence in the United States and other countries for peace and other humanitarian work.

I believe the President was completely honest with me; although I did not attend his purely military meetings - unless the issues discussed also involved diplomacy - or domestic affairs meetings, I never asked him a most confidential question about the military or domestic situation, unless he immediately and unreservedly told me all the details, I would stop there. We had several ambassadors, especially Bullitt, who was stationed in Moscow and then in Paris, Kennedy, who was stationed in London, and Davies, who was stationed in Moscow and then in Brussels, because they were all old friends of the President, and often wrote directly to the President, discussing important policy issues, bypassing me. It has always been inappropriate for ambassadors and ministers to communicate directly with the President, and I have argued with Roosevelt on this point. But despite this, I cannot recall any significant instances that prove that the State Department's views and policies have been significantly hampered by this behavior.

The President liked to use a method that was often very embarrassing for the State Department, which was to send special envoys abroad in the capacity of his personal representatives to talk to foreign government leaders or perform certain tasks. Among these special envoys were Hopkins, Wallace, Harriman, Hurley, Sheenovan, and Davies, who were all sent out once or twice. In many cases, sending these special envoys often caused confusion among our ambassadors and ministers stationed in those countries. However, their missions rarely interfered with the government's work strictly within the scope of diplomacy.

The President and I often discussed the appointment of my key assistants in the State Department and the ambassadors and ministers stationed abroad. As time went on, the President often made many suggestions for this type of appointment. But in most cases, it was always the State Department that made suggestions to him, and after proper procedures, he expressed his approval, with only a few exceptions.

His own suggestions to me were often concise, written in pencil or pen on small White House notepads, without a date, often like this:

"Smith to Chongqing

"Jones to Paris

"Brown recalled

"?"

After the capital of Turkey was moved from Istanbul to Ankara, I received a note from him written in pencil:

"C.H. (Cordell Hull abbreviation - translator)

"Why can't we move our embassy from Istanbul to Ankara?

"FDR"

(Franklin Delano Roosevelt abbreviation - translator)

I wrote underneath in red pencil. "Deeply agree.

"C.H."

Before Roosevelt became President, I always called him "Franklin." After that, I called him "Mr. President," because one reason was that he was often with others when I saw him. But even when it was just the two of us together, I called him "Mr. President," although we rarely used titles. He always called me "Cordell," before and after he became President.

The President only went to the State Department once. Before he came to the State Department, he spent several hours on the floor above finding offices for his "assistants whose names no one knew."

I suggested to the President more than once that he invite former President Hoover to discuss certain issues, such as the food situation abroad. I myself never hesitated to consult with my predecessor, Mr. Stimson, and I received valuable help from him, especially in the legislation of trade agreements. But the relationship between the President and Hoover had become very bad, and as a result, the former never invited the latter to the White House.

I myself had several informal discussions with Hoover, although not officially at the State Department. Following Hoover's suggestion, our talks were held at the home of former Undersecretary of State Castle (Wlliiam Castle), and I reported the content of the talks to the President. Hoover expressed the most enthusiastic interest in public affairs. As for whether his extreme animosity toward Roosevelt made his party's flavor more intense, I cannot say. In any case, it was a mutual animosity.

Some people with extreme left-wing colors often provoked the President's relationship with the State Department; it was not Mr. Roosevelt himself who made things difficult for the State Department, but a small number of people with left-wing colors who often protested to him because I did not accept their orders. He, except for occasionally complaining about the State Department "leaking news," never said to me that he "hated" the State Department, as one or two people later said. He knew that most of his speeches, statements, and letters on foreign policy were drafted by me and the officials of the State Department on their suggestion or at their request. He was satisfied with us doing so.

On December 31, 1943, about eleven years after I entered the State Department, he sent me a note that is worth quoting: "Here, I am sending you a memorandum that I sent to Churchill. (This memorandum was attached to a memorandum that I previously sent to the President regarding the relationship between the Free French Committee and Italy.) Thank God, I don't have the same difficulties with the State Department that he has with his Foreign Office - F.D.R."

Generally speaking, the President's cabinet played a very small role in the formulation of foreign policy. In cabinet meetings, I found that there was not as much discussion of foreign relations as I imagined.

Regarding important secrets, I often kept silent in the cabinet, because there had been cases of leaking such news to favored journalists and broadcasters. According to the most reliable information I have obtained, this leak was limited to a very small number of cabinet members.

Some cabinet members often encroached on the authority of another or other cabinet members. This situation made me feel very uncomfortable several times later; for example, this happened when discussing the embargo on Japan, and when Wallace's Economic Warfare Bureau tried to allocate the main tasks related to economic warfare to the State Department and other agencies.

Since it has been my consistent policy to separate diplomatic work from domestic affairs, and the President has specialized in domestic affairs and purely military work, it is natural that my personal relationship with the President is not as close as that of some cabinet members, because cabinet members who handle domestic affairs need to hold meetings with him frequently to discuss the problems that arise at any time and are almost countless. In this situation, it is also natural to create a so-called internal kitchen cabinet composed of several people. These people often wanted to interfere with the work of other ministries in the name of the President or others, seemingly without obtaining the President's instructions. It is puzzling that two or three cabinet members and some White House staff members have been attacking the policies of the State Department in the name of the President, while at this time the President and I were working harmoniously together. This is one of the several unpleasant experiences that our cabinet members must endure.

In these cabinet meetings, the President was lighthearted and interesting. His amiable personality was fully felt. He liked anecdotes and liked to tell them. He was almost always very happy, and he spoke in a relaxed and interesting way.

One day, he walked into a cabinet meeting with a smile on his face, a little late. He said that he had just suffered a slight impoliteness from a relative. This relative said to him: "Sir, you talk so much that we never have a chance to speak." The President laughed while telling this anecdote, and then turned to me and said, "Cordell, do you agree with this statement?"

I replied, "Oh, Mr. President, just before I came to the meeting today, some reporters met me and said to me:

"Mr. Secretary, it is rumored that the food at the White House is very bad lately. We want to know your opinion."

"I never eat anything at the White House," I replied.

"What!" they shouted. "We know you often go to the White House for lunch or dinner."

"That's indeed true," I said. "But before I go to the White House, I always eat lunch or dinner first. In this way, when the President is eating, I can have a chance to say a few words."

The President laughed with everyone.

### Extreme Cold Breaks Five-Year Record Lowest Temperature is Minus 8.3 Degrees Celsius Water Vapor on Glass Windows Condenses into Ice Harsh Wind Strikes Face Like a Knife

[Reported by this newspaper] Under the direct impact of the Siberian cold current, the climate in this city was extremely cold yesterday, breaking this year's record and creating the lowest peak in the past five years. According to the record in 1943, the temperature was minus 10 degrees Celsius, and the coldest temperature recorded since 1944 was minus 7 degrees Celsius, while yesterday's lowest temperature dropped to minus 8.3 degrees Celsius. In the morning, water vapor on the glass windows condensed into ice, which did not melt for a long time. The harsh wind outdoors struck the face like a knife. Although the sun was shining, the power of the severe cold did not diminish at all. According to the weather station report, the Yellow Sea: cloudy and frozen, haze, northerly wind to uncertain wind, medium waves. Central China: dangerous to cloudy, frozen, local snow, light fog in the morning and evening, brisk northwest wind to northeast wind. Shanghai: overcast, haze, frost in the morning, brisk northwest wind to northeast wind, light fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: cloudy to overcast, rain in the south, strong north wind to northeast wind, huge waves, turbulent sea waves around Taiwan. The center of the cold current has stagnated in Central China, so the severe cold will continue for several days, and there is hope for a warming trend starting on the weekend. The Pushan Villa collected as many as 78 children's corpses yesterday, most of whom died from freezing.

### Electric Heaters for Heating Cause a Sharp Increase in Power Consumption The Power Company is Overwhelmed Half of the Yarn Factories are Forced to Shut Down

[Reported by this newspaper] In recent days, the climate in this city has been extremely cold, and citizens who have electric heating equipment have been using it for heating, resulting in a sharp increase in power consumption, which has greatly affected the power consumption of factories. It is reported that half of the yarn factories in this city were shut down yesterday due to insufficient power supply. According to statistics from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd of this month, the temperature in this city was 55 degrees Fahrenheit, and the company generated 148,000 kilowatts, without reducing the power consumption of yarn factories. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the temperature was 22 degrees Fahrenheit, and the power consumption was 150,000 kilowatts, an increase of 2,000 kilowatts compared to the 22nd. The reason for the sudden increase is probably due to the opening of electric heaters, so the power consumption of yarn factories had to be reduced by 11,000 kilowatts. It is found that the power consumption of yarn factories usually requires 180,000 kilowatts, so it can be seen that half of their power has been used by other parties.

In order to meet the needs of both households and factories, the power company must generate 169,000 kilowatts, but under the current circumstances, this is simply impossible. The power company feels deeply sorry for the citizens who have not complied with the authorities' restrictions on electricity use.

### The Central Government Considers Remedies for Party Members Who Fail to Register

Fang Zhi, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his public affairs in Nanjing. According to him, the Central Government attaches great importance to this general registration of party members. The registration deadline was originally scheduled to end uniformly at the end of this month, but considering that the city has a vast area and a large number of party members, it is feared that the processing may not be completed in time. In order to take into account the facts, the Central Government is considering remedies for party members who have not yet registered, so as to ensure that every party member can participate in the registration and determine their party membership. In addition, the Central Government attaches great importance to the mobilization and propaganda for suppressing the rebellion and building the nation launched by all sectors of the city, and hopes that it will continue to expand and continue to carry it out, so as to achieve great results.

### Half of the Shanghai South Wharf Project Completed Public Works Bureau Invited People from All Walks of Life to Visit Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The equipment of the Shanghai South Wharf in this city was completely destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. The Public Works Bureau organized the South City Wharf Restoration Committee to plan a full restoration and improve the equipment. The first phase of wharves 1 to 9 has been completed. It took 11 months and cost over 7 billion, and can berth eight 3,000-ton giant ships at the same time. The bureau invited city councilors and the press to visit at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The visiting parts included three parts: 1. Wharf restoration project, 2. Truck river crossing ferry project, 3. Pudong Avenue construction project.

Those who attended yesterday included Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Rentao, deputy director, and Zhu Jiapeng, secretary, as well as Tang Shichang, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Gao Xu'an, , Ma Shaoquan, Wang Shijie and Ye Dezeng of the Wharf Management Office, Zhang Huikang and Zhou Qixin of the Ferry Company, and Zhu Guoxi and Tang Mingshi of the Public Works Bureau. After gathering at the Municipal Ferry Terminal on the Bund of Beijing Road, they took special ferry No. 5 directly to Wharf No. 1 of Yangshupu to visit in order. According to Director Zhao's report on the wharf restoration project, before the war, the South City Wharf started from Dongmen Road in the north and went to Jia Du in the south. There were 21 floating wharves and 6 fixed wharves, all of which were destroyed during the war. After the restoration, the South City Wharf Restoration Committee decided on the principle that the location of each wharf should still be based on the pre-war one, and all floating wharves should be equipped. The original 18 floating wharves are planned to be completed in two phases. The first phase is to build wharves 1 to 9 first, and the second phase is to restore wharves 10 to 18. The first phase of the project is expected to allow 18 3,000-ton giant ships to berth at the same time, with an annual throughput of about 2 million tons, accounting for 15% of the total tonnage of ships in Shanghai Port every year. Construction started on November 20, 1946, and has now been fully completed. The second phase of the project needs to be continued urgently, but it suffers from insufficient financial resources and lack of materials, and the warehouses below Wharf No. 12 used by military agencies have not been fully returned and opened. There are many difficulties, and I hope that people from all walks of life will assist.

### Request for Supplementary Year-End Bonus: Customs Officers Stop Work, Agreement Reached

[Our Newspaper's Report] Approximately 2,000 lower- and middle-level employees of the Jianghai Customs started stopping work at 10:30 AM yesterday, forming a strike.

Chairman Shui Xiangyun personally received them. In addition to submitting a petition, the representatives of each industry detailed the workers' hardships and the precedents of past profit-sharing systems. Chairman Shui expressed deep sympathy for their requests and stated that he would resolutely fight for them with the relevant regular bureaus and consult with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to seek a reasonable solution. He hoped that the workers would work with peace of mind and await mediation before the problem is resolved.

### Labor Dispute at Zhenfeng and Other Woolen Mills: Accept Advice, Start Resuming Work

Regarding the sabotage by treacherous elements in the Zhenfeng and other woolen mills in this city, Social Affairs Bureau Director Kuai Xian specially made a statement on this matter yesterday: "Regarding the case of woolen mill workers in this city requesting year-end bonuses, due to the general conditions of the industry in this city in 1947 being worse than in previous years, after repeated mediation, an agreement was first established by the wool industry labor union and the trade association in the Third District, and then Chief Commissioner Lu of the Year-End Bonus Handling Committee personally mediated. The conditions were already very favorable, but a small number of treacherous elements in factories such as Zhenfeng, Yuanfeng, and Yin instigated trouble, making unreasonable demands that amounted to as much as five months, and instigating a starvation strike movement as a means of coercion, and occupying the factory day and night, surrounding factory directors and staff, and damaging raw materials and finished products. This kind of behavior is not only similar to hooliganism but is extremely illegal. In addition to requesting the local security authorities of this city to arrest and prosecute the treacherous elements who instigated the labor unrest, it is hoped that all good workers will no longer be exploited by others and will quickly return to normal in order to comply with government laws and regulations." (It is also learned) that most of the workers in the woolen mills have accepted the advice and have begun to resume work.

### Feihua Trade Association Requests Restriction of Bidding Method

### Strong Winds and Waves at Sea: More Than Ten Ships; Xie Xin Wheel Weighs Anchor and Advances

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Zhong Company and Min Tugboat towed a steel barge carrying more than 200 tons of goods and six cars to Wuhan on the 22nd of this month. They encountered wind on the Bai Maojiang River. The tugboat ran aground, and it was rumored that the steel barge also sank. The company consulted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and asked them to send a ship for rescue. The company has also dispatched Min No. 313 to tow the rescue. According to news from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, Min No. 313 did not go yesterday morning because Yu Zhong Company had already prepared a small wheel to go. There is also a saying that the barge has also run aground. According to a crew member of a ship that returned from the port yesterday, a steel barge also sank near Changyinsha River.

The Xie Xin, a regular ship of the Daji Company sailing to Renjiagang, weighed anchor and sailed to Renjiagang from Shanghai the night before. When it reached Wusongkou, it saw that the wind and waves were very strong and feared that the small ship could not support it, so it dropped anchor and watched. At about 11 AM yesterday morning, it saw that the wind and waves were slightly calmer, so it weighed anchor and advanced, and it is expected to arrive at Renjiagang by evening. The Dahua Wheel of the Huasheng Shipping Bureau encountered wind and ran aground on a chicken reef near Qingdao on the morning of the 23rd. It is heard that it has sunk, but the details are unknown.

### Postal Bureau Underpayment Case: Plaintiff's Lawsuit Dismissed; Not an Unjust Enrichment Without a Legal Reason

[Our Newspaper's Report] Lawyer Cheng Mengming previously sued Li Jinlu, the director of the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau, in the civil court of the district court, requesting the return of the underpayment for mail after the postal and telecommunications price increase. Judge Ling Yuanqing of the civil court ruled: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff."

The reasoning for the judgment is roughly as follows: "The postal and telecommunications price increase was passed by the 16th meeting of the State Council, and the Executive Yuan implemented it accordingly. Although the Legislative Yuan later suggested to the State Council to order the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan for review, the National Government handed it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review. According to the committee's report, the State Council is the highest state organ of the National Government according to law and has the power to formulate legislative principles. Based on previous cases, the State Council has revised legal provisions by resolution and ordered their implementation first, and there are precedents. The committee believes that the National Government Committee should be considered to have the power to make expedient arrangements in accordance with Article 16 of the Organic Law of the National Government, since it is the highest state organ of the National Government, and the precedents are as described above. Therefore, the State Council should be considered to have the power to make expedient arrangements, and the resolution of its 16th meeting regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase case should be considered legal and valid. It also ordered the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure, and informed the Executive and Legislative Yuan. The above facts are all published in newspapers and are obvious facts. Therefore, the defendant's order to the plaintiff to make up the postage of 1,500 yuan is not without legal reason, and does not constitute unjust enrichment. The plaintiff's request for return is not reasonable and should be dismissed in accordance with the provisions of Article 249, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law without oral argument." Cheng disagreed with the judgment after it was handed down and sent a letter to all members of the Legislative Yuan yesterday, reporting the process.

### Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui Pleads for Displaced Refugees: More Than Forty Oil Paintings to Be Sold in Charity Sale Starting Today; Shen Fuwen's Dunhuang Pattern Lacquerware Also on Display

[Our Newspaper's Report] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui is running around in Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai to raise money for the refugees in Datong City who have been forced to flee their homes. In Beiping, he met female painter Guo Yun. Ms. Guo, who is eager to help others, selected more than forty oil paintings from her late husband Professor Yang Zigu's posthumous works and donated them to Mayor Gong. Mr. Gong brought them to Shanghai and scheduled to exhibit and sell them in the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road starting today. The proceeds will be donated to Dalian refugees. According to Gong's words, Dalian citizens have been subjected to various oppressions by the Soviet army and the illegal municipal government. The refugees have accounted for two-fifths of the city's population. More than 48,000 refugees have registered with the Dalian Municipal Government's office in Shenyang. Most of the refugees are from Shandong and are mostly living in Shenyang, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao and other places, waiting to be fed and in urgent need of relief. At the same time, Shen Fuwen, a professor at the Sichuan Provincial College of Arts, is also exhibiting his Dunhuang pattern lacquerware. Mr. Shen has been engaged in lacquerware research for more than 20 years. The patterns of the Northern Wei, Sui, and Tang dynasties discovered in the Dunhuang stone chambers are applied to lacquerware. They are exquisite and antique and are truly rare works of art. Mr. Shen, considering that the patterns and colors of Fujian lacquerware are gradually lagging behind, buried himself in research and invented the natural lacquer toning method. Therefore, the color of Mr. Shen's lacquerware is bright, and the pattern can also be as desired, without being limited by the lacquer color. According to Professor Shen: Domestic lacquer has the characteristics of heat resistance and acid resistance, so lacquerware is not damaged by boiling water and strong acid. European and American people love it very much. If factories are built on a large scale in the future and exported to Europe and the United States, a large amount of foreign exchange will definitely be earned. Mr. Shen's works are exhibited in Shanghai for the first time. This exhibition has a total of more than 130 pieces, which are his products in the last five years, which are more advanced than his earlier products. The exhibition period is only six days and will end on February 1st.

### Democracy Tutorial, Lesson Three: Hangzhou Legislative Yuan Election – The Most Tense Three Days

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 25th Dispatch] In Hangzhou's Democracy Tutorial, the election of Legislative Yuan members is already in its third lesson. January 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, these three days, Hangzhou this metropolis, has already implemented a large classroom for democracy education. In the classroom, there should always be a bit of the environment. Thus, we see all kinds of campaign slogans pasted all over the streets and alleys, campaign leaflets and photos of candidates. Many slogans are printed, such as "Unanimously elect Mr. Chen Lifu, a pillar of the country, as a member of the Legislative Yuan." Huge banners request the election of Lu Jingshi, and Lu Jingshi's exquisitely printed leaflets are also distributed on both sides of the roads. At both ends of the Provincial Education Association building on Yingshi Street, there are two huge banners requesting the election of Dai Chuanxian as a Legislative Yuan member for the education sector. Wu Wangao, a candidate for the agricultural association's Legislative Yuan member, also posted many slogans and advertisements. Inside and outside the Municipal Business Association, various slogans are posted everywhere advocating the unanimous election of Chen Xunyou, Chen Bosheng, Cheng Cangbo, and Hu Jianzhong as Legislative Yuan members for the press. This classroom arrangement for democracy education can truly be described as a dazzling array.

Campaign Vehicles

Class has begun. On the morning of the 21st, many candidates' cars were racing on the roads, carrying voters, carload after carload, to the polling stations to cast their precious votes. Many of the candidates' helpers are doing their best to collect scattered votes in an attempt to increase the number of votes for their candidates.

At the Agricultural Association's polling station, many farmers did come to vote. They all came from the fields, preparing to elect people who would speak for them. The Agricultural Association's votes were almost all concentrated on Wu Wangji. Wu had put in a lot of effort before the election, and he had also published many articles in the Zheng Bao newspaper.

The votes of the Chamber of Commerce were almost all cast. An employee specifically took a notebook to various trade associations to sign, proving how many votes had been collected.

Freedom of Occupation is Too Free

The freedom of occupation is really free enough. More than thirty votes of accountants were all abstained. In three days, not a single person came to vote. It is said that the reason why accountants abstained from voting was to express "protest." As for the reason for the "protest," one said it was because the candidates did not come to greet them, and another said it was because of another kind of relationship. Of the 554 votes of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, only four were cast in three days, which is better than the accountants' total abstention, but the reason why they were not so enthusiastic is worth studying.

Films Comfort Voters

The Education Association still uses the old method of the National Assembly election, using film screenings to call on members to vote, and also using film screenings to comfort the voters. Because the Education Association's auditorium is rented out to people as a movie theater, it is conveniently located.

The candidates for the regional Legislative Yuan are also very innovative. Some surround the district chiefs of each district, some offer rewards to the heads of Baojia, some win over relatives and friends, and lobby in various neighborhoods. Some use students to persuade door-to-door, and various methods abound. It's truly "each has their own different skills"!

The workers of the union collectively went to the polling stations to vote. The postal workers' union was the most impressive. Carload after carload of green postal trucks, packed full of people in green uniforms, went to the union to vote.

Newspaper Reporters are Energetic

The most intense and enthusiastic was the Legislative Yuan election for newspaper reporters. Everyone attached great importance to this election for Legislative Yuan members of newspaper reporters, so the process was relatively more intense. It can be said to be the most exciting program in the third lesson of democracy. On the first morning, many people went to vote. The people managing the voting were very strict, saying that only the person themselves could vote. Later, they were afraid that this would not work, so they changed it to allowing voting with proof. So, people voted one after another. The result on the first day was that Chen Xunyou took the first place. By the second day, it became even more intense. More people were canvassing for votes everywhere. Many votes scattered in various corners were collected. In the polling station, you monitored me, and I monitored you. As soon as there was news, it was immediately transmitted to the "command post" of the campaign activities.

The third day was even more tense. The representatives of each candidate began negotiations. From negotiations, they proceeded to campaigning. Bustling, noisy, arguing endlessly.

The ballot box for newspaper reporters was set up inside a ballot box for free professional groups. Compared with the election of other free professional groups and the election of the newspaper reporter group, the degree of excitement was really worlds apart. They all watched the enthusiasm and tension of the newspaper reporters with their hands in their sleeves, and couldn't help but sigh: "Newspaper reporters are really energetic!"

The Last Moment

In the last moment of the election, Chen Xunyou and Hu Jianzhong's votes were still leading. Later, Hu Jianzhong's votes increased by more than ten votes, and Chen Xunyou's votes also increased by more than ten votes. Chen Bosheng also had many votes, and Cheng Cangbo also had votes. This finally brought the tense scene of the election to an end.

The bell for the end of the third lesson has already rung. Those who scored the most this time don't need to be proud, and those who scored the least don't need to be discouraged. When the next class starts, let's have another competition! (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Injured While Demanding Supplementary Ticket – Accusation Against Court Police

[Our Newspaper Jiangyin 25th Dispatch] The Fourth 30309 bus of the Zhongyun Company, operating on the Chengwu Road, departed from Cheng to Wujin at around 8:00 AM on the 24th. Because Huo Qigui, a court police officer from the local court, was delivering a summons to Shen Gang for the case of Shi Shaogong embezzling workers' wages, he was in plain clothes on the bus and did not purchase a ticket. When station master Yang Xuefeng checked tickets, he requested a supplementary ticket, stating that even government employees must purchase half-price tickets. Officer Huo refused, leading to a conflict. Station Master Yang's face was injured. Later, after the persuasion of the military police inspection office, Station Master Yang and the court police went to the police station together, and together with Director Zhang met with Chief Prosecutor Li Shudong of the court, detailing the facts. It was very satisfactory. When Station Master Yang was about to leave the court gate, he was suddenly stopped by court police chief Qin Xuezeng and others, who sounded the police siren and did not allow Station Master Yang to leave, saying that the court must open immediately, and was interrogated by prosecutor Zhang Sen. Officer Huo claimed: The official summons was torn up by the station master, denying the assault. However, during the examination, the station master's facial injuries were confirmed. Both sides held their own positions, and were ordered to be detained. At around 10:00 AM, the court police escorted the station master to the prison, wanting to add shackles. For the sake of his face, the station master jumped into the river along the Hongqiao River in an attempt to commit suicide, but was restrained by the court police. In the afternoon, the Wujin General Company received the news and sent Shen Yuenian, the director of external inspectors, to Cheng to investigate. Station Master Yang was bailed out by lawyer Pan Bingying for medical treatment. The company, considering that transportation personnel were assaulted, specially submitted a report to the Provincial Highway Bureau to set up an Jiang defense headquarters, and filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office according to law, and requested a transfer of jurisdiction for the investigation to ensure justice.

He actually used a cleaver to chop his biological father's head and shoulder, each with one cut, causing blood to flow profusely. He lost consciousness on the spot. Fortunately, he was saved by neighbors before he could recover. Wang Pinhe then reported to the criminal police team to arrest Jianyuan, who was transferred to the police station for investigation.

### Wuxing's Ten Traitors Awaiting Arrest – Assets Sealed First

### Wuxi Command Post Strictly Prohibits Military Personnel from Participating in Civil Disputes

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 24th Dispatch] The Wuxi Command Post, due to the labor-management dispute in the local barbershop industry, had soldiers in the countryside of the local militia participating in the matter. If the situation expands, it will be impossible to mediate. Therefore, it was decided at a joint meeting of various sectors that the regiment management area and the county government should be notified that soldiers in the countryside should comply with the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense and should not wear military uniforms, and strictly prohibit them from participating in local civil disputes. The military police team should pay attention to cracking down on them at any time, and severe punishment will be given if there is a violation.

### The Lock of Taiwan

— Penghu

One calm evening, a reporter took the Hengchun Wheel of the Taiwan Airlines Company and crossed the 78 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait from Kaohsiung. As the sun rose and the rays of the sun shone, we stepped on the "lock of Taiwan," Penghu, whose English name was forgotten at the Cairo Conference.

Fishermen and their descendants filled the pier, each with a withered, black, and emaciated face. The sea breeze blew, and the isolated island had no trees with tall vortex roofs, and their eyes were blown red, swollen, and shy.

Grain Shortage Eight Months, Every Grain of Rice is Precious

The Penghu Islands are a collective name for 63 small islands in the Taiwan Strait, including 20 inhabited islands and 43 uninhabited islands. The total area is only over 126 square kilometers, but it is inhabited by more than 70,000 people, which is very dense. However, there is a strong sea breeze containing salt, no rain, no rivers, and no tall trees. Although it is an average of only 17 meters, the highest is only 60 meters of low platform land, but you can't see a paddy field. Crops are only sorghum, peanuts, and sugarcane, which are more suitable on the fourth-century alluvial basalt geology. Most people eat sugarcane, and some even scavenge seaweed to fill their hunger. However, even in a good year, the yield of sugarcane and other crops is only enough for the consumption of the entire island for four months. There is a grain shortage for eight months. Assuming that a person consumes at least 15 catties of rice per month, it would require 9 million catties. There is no storage here, and there is a lack of transportation. Relying on Taiwan Island, distant water often cannot put out a nearby fire. Rice is like pearls here. Although coral is abundant here, coral is not as good as rice. Coral is produced in the deep sea. The technology and equipment of the past, the Japanese did not leave behind. Now, three small shops are selling inventory. After a few years, the coral island will not be able to see coral.

When the Northeast Monsoon Rises, Cut Off from the World

On the 500-ton Hengchun Wheel, a section chief of the Penghu County Government told reporters: You shouldn't have come on a big ship. At first, I didn't understand what he meant. Then he explained that it is rare to have a big ship to Penghu once or twice a year. Penghu people mostly travel by small steamboats of 30 to 40 tons. The wind is strong and the waves are high. This precarious feeling cannot be appreciated by those who have not experienced it. At present, there are only a few public-operated ships, such as "Taijiao 117," and private ships, such as Qiansui, Zhenxing, Gaoxiang, and Haifei, that maintain sea transportation. From October to March each year, these ships cannot fight against the seasonal winds. If they take risks, they will go wrong in nineteen cases. The ships capsize, and people are eaten by fish instead. As a result, traffic is cut off and isolated. Who can hear them calling? All that is heard are tsunamis, which also carry salt rain to attack these isolated and helpless people. The common people are very simple. Taking Magong Town, the most lively town with 26,000 people, as an example, it is rare to have a criminal case in a month. There was no disturbance in 2.28 here. Of course, newspapers cannot be seen for months, and radios cannot be afforded. But they mostly have a character that is indifferent to the world. They just want to find hope and find life in the waves!

The Penghu Transportation Company operates 33 kilometers of highway business. There are few passengers and goods, and there is a shortage of gasoline. If the parts are broken, there is no way to replenish them. Land transportation has also stopped. The person in charge repeatedly pleaded with the provincial government to release the approved subsidy of 150,000 yuan.

Fishermen Struggling on the Hunger Line

Penghu is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and cold and warm currents converge. The fishing industry is the most developed. In the past, more than half of Penghu's people used the sea as their fields and engaged in fishing. During the Japanese rule, the fishing industry was so developed that there were more than 2,000 fishing boats. Last year's statistics were like this, and the actual number would exceed three times. If further improvements are made, it can reach ten times. After the war, most of the ships were destroyed, and the fishing ports, oil storage, sugar, and shipbuilding yards were all selected for destruction. The most important ice-making plant has been out of operation. Without ice, there is no fishing industry. People in Taiwan Island prepared ice ships and seized them at low prices. There is no strength to revitalize the fishing industry, because the whole problem cannot be solved. Transportation, food, and fishing are mutually causal, which is the crux of Penghu's suffering today. Chairman Wei once announced to the people of Penghu: After the windy season passes, he will definitely allocate regular flights to Taiwan and Penghu. He also guaranteed to provide the people of Penghu with enough water—the golden fish filled the sea, and I hope that "fishermen are poor from generation to generation" is really a song, not a prophecy.

Frontier Officials Arrive Twice

Xu Shengping, the county magistrate who educates the people of Penghu with "when the house catches fire, the first thing to grab is the portrait of the Prime Minister," uses naval officer positions to comprehensively manage county affairs. He is young and capable, and the summer camp is well-organized, but there are many occasions where his energy is so full that he goes a bit too far, but it is no wonder that the frontier officials who have come to Penghu for two hundred years, Zheng Chenggong, are Wei Chairman!

There are 21 national schools, 3 county-run middle schools, 1 provincial middle school, and 1 provincial vocational school of aquatic products, with a total of more than 8,100 students. Teachers suffer, and students suffer as well. They expect the revitalization of the fishing industry to live a better life.

Penghu is the key to the southeast, and Magong is the machine in the lock. The color of the naval port is very strong. Weeds grow on the fortress, and several old cannons squat quietly. Under the rapid development of war tools at the present stage, these cannons have lost their effectiveness to some extent. The reporter climbed to the top of the platform and looked out at the white waves. Here, one can still point out the landing places where French, Dutch, and Japanese conquerors attacked Penghu in the past. Magong Town still has the monument to the French Cuban Lieutenant General and the Thousand-Person Tomb of the Japanese Mixed Brigade in the Sino-Japanese War, which tells us that the people of Penghu have not lived a good day in the past two centuries. When the reporter left this small island that looked like barren land, thousands of people shouted on the shore, and two small boats sent them out of the port, waving hats and scarves, reluctantly saying goodbye, almost making me shed tears!

### Laobaohua Silver Shop Closes Down – Shopkeeper Escapes with Wife and Children

[Our Newspaper Wujin 25th Dispatch] The Laoshiye Silver Shop on Beida Street in the county was opened by Wang Bojin and others from Suzhou. The business was still decent, but the capital was short. It was usually operated with high-interest loans. According to the year-end settlement, it is said that the deficit was more than ten taels of gold. At one time, there was no way to report it. On the 21st of this month, he borrowed 100 million yuan from a yarn and cloth shop, and the next morning he escaped with his wife and children. Only one apprentice was left in the shop, who also closed the door and left. There are many victims. The shop is now guarded by the police, pending liquidation.

### Wujin's Various Circles are Preparing to Build - Martyrs' Shrine

[Our Newspaper Wujin 25th Dispatch] In order to commemorate the anti-Japanese martyrs and encourage the coming generations, the county has successively decided to build a martyrs' shrine through the resolutions of the Senate and various public organizations. The surnames of all the loyal and righteous people will be listed and a spiritual hall will be set up to worship them for thousands of years. Recently, the county government specially convened a preparatory committee, which decided that the vicinity of the stadium on Daguan Road would be the site of the shrine. The construction cost is 200 million yuan in the county's budget. If the amount is insufficient, we will find ways to raise funds. On the one hand, the county construction department will first survey the orientation and draw up the design, and then submit it to the meeting for discussion and implementation.

### Steamed Bone Case Withdrawn

### Amidst the Flood of Overseas Remittances, the Minnan Overseas Compatriots Bear the Brunt

[Report from our Fuzhou correspondent, dated the 24th] Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, and Hai cheng Counties in Fujian Province are considered hometowns of overseas Chinese. This corner, from a political, economic, cultural, and even military perspective, seems like an insignificant place. However, it is probably the most extravagant, luxurious, and decadent area in the country.

This reporter often meets with people from the overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian. In their conversations, they are all filled with endless emotion regarding the current social situation in their hometowns.

After the victory, the once-severed overseas remittances flowed back into the hometowns of overseas Chinese, re-draping the entire area in a vibrant and beautiful brocade. Overseas remittances are undoubtedly a huge source of income for the motherland and the local areas, and they are also a sweet rain for the families of overseas Chinese. However, because overseas remittances have not been properly channeled, some negative effects have spread and fermented widely in the overseas Chinese hometowns, creating various social ills.

Overseas Capital Stimulates Prices

The high prices in the counties of southern Fujian cannot be said to be unrelated to the gifts of overseas capital. Returning overseas Chinese bring large quantities of gold and foreign currency to purchase property, shop, and even gamble and patronize prostitutes. Gold has become a complete currency, and prices are rising step by step with the large circulation of gold and foreign currency. The fish and meat markets in Jinjiang are more expensive than those in Xiamen (Xiamen is more expensive than Fuzhou, and Fuzhou is more expensive than Nanjing). The families of overseas Chinese use the black market rate of foreign exchange as their standard when entering and exiting the markets. Although the amount of legal tender is enormous, it is not much when converted into foreign currency. High prices are irrelevant to the families of overseas Chinese, but pity the local civil servants and farmers.

Young Girls Eager to Marry "Foreign Guests"

Because of the soaring prices, the phenomenon of wealth disparity is particularly evident. Returning overseas Chinese have money, so they have become the ideal marriage partner for young girls. The betrothal gifts for returning overseas Chinese to marry a wife are no less than ten or twenty million yuan, and the fashionable decorations prepared for them often cost hundreds of millions of yuan. Poor women in the area admire and yearn for these wealthy "foreign guests" even more fervently than medieval Spanish women admired the triumphant knights. Most women worship money, which is not surprising.

Overseas Chinese Wives Compete in Beauty

Women are the strongest link in the consumer lifestyle. Overseas Chinese wives rely on their strong economic power to enjoy life to the fullest and spend lavishly. They compete in fashion, with "American-style" outfits from head to toe, often creating extremely disharmonious appearances that make people laugh. They even decorate themselves with more than half a pound of gold jewelry to show off to others. Overseas Chinese wives have nothing to do, so they use offering sacrifices to the gods and performing operas as entertainment, spending tens of thousands of gold without the slightest stinginess. In the countryside of Jinjiang (Jinjiang is the largest hometown of overseas Chinese), Western clothing stores, beauty salons, photo studios, flower novelty shops, and silk shops are springing up like mushrooms after rain, creating an atmosphere akin to a Chinese "Hollywood."

Money Creates Evil

In the overseas Chinese hometowns, US dollars have become the destination sought by all kinds of people. US dollars encompass the entire value and meaning of life. Gambling, feuding, robbery, and prostitution are all products of the overflow of money. Wealthy and rich returning overseas Chinese often act as patrons of the human flesh market. In the "salty meat shops" in the countryside of southern Fujian, a night of romance costs ten US dollars. Under the demand of romantic overseas guests, private prostitutes are increasing day by day. Because there is not enough entertainment to amuse overseas guests, gambling has become a substitute. With the prevalence of wealth, villains easily infiltrate, so public security has also become a problem. The overseas Chinese are most worried about the atmosphere of robbery in their hometowns.

High Interest Exploitation of Poor Farmers

Large overseas capital, because it has not been guided to proper channels, has deepened the crisis in rural areas. When farmers are running out of food, they often use the emergency measure of borrowing high-interest loans from overseas Chinese to survive. The "floating goods" system prevails in the overseas Chinese hometowns. Two or three months before the harvest, one dan of unhusked rice is sold for only 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and one dan of peanuts is sold for 80,000 yuan. Farmers first receive the payment for the "floating goods" to buy fertilizer, but when the harvest comes, eight or nine out of ten times, it all belongs to the creditors. Overseas Chinese merchants buy and hoard at this time, manipulating the prices of local products, so the prices of products are high, and the farmers are in unspeakable distress.

How to Use Overseas Remittances

Overseas Chinese families carrying huge sums of overseas remittances do not want to invest in enterprises, but there are no suitable opportunities and conditions. It is said that in the overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian, local tyrants and gentry often clamor to organize enterprise companies, using fraudulent methods to swindle overseas Chinese capital, thereby losing the overseas Chinese's confidence in people in the country. If the government can set up a number of small factories in southern Fujian and grant various guarantees of rights, it can guide a portion of overseas remittances to the path of production. In today's domestic lack of industrial capital, overseas remittances are a very usable force. (Special correspondent Chen Zhengyu)

### The First Headquarters of Zhejiang Security Advances into Siming Mountain

[Report from our Yao correspondent, dated the 24th] The former Wang Bamei's subordinates, reorganized from the Pinghu Self-Defense Force, recently suddenly mutinied and became bandits, harassing merchant ships at sea. A few days ago, they landed in the Shiliuhu area on the border between Shangyu and Yuyao and hid along the coast during the day. In the evening, they contacted bandits in Nanshan. It is rumored that the bandits have a steel cannon and have fled into the Siming Mountain area. The First Brigade of the Zhejiang Security Force was ordered to enter Siming Mountain to suppress the bandits and has been sending teams to search Yinzhou West, Ci South Island, Danshan, and other places for days. The bandits' attempt to "collect ten catties of grain per mu" from the villages in Yuxi has been completely thwarted. It is also reported that more than 200 bandits led by Chen Buyi, carrying four light machine guns and complete rifles, are causing trouble in the Dalanshan area of southern Yao. The First and Second Battalions of the Zhejiang Security Force have been dispatched to search Mupingshan, Mahuang, Shiba Jiganxia, Guanting, Shanglianggang, Dongxiang, Lantian, Zhiling, and other areas and are advancing into Dalanshan.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Does Not Allow Students to Automatically Raise Donations, The Poor Student Assistance is Handled by the Unified Review Committee

[Report from the Central News Agency] Recently, it was heard that a small number of school students have launched a movement to raise funds for poor student assistance and that it has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. The reporter therefore visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to inquire about the details. Mr. Wu replied, "The bureau has never approved students' actions to automatically raise funds for student assistance. Regarding the matter of student assistance for poor students in various schools, a "Unified Review Committee" was originally established by all sectors of the city, presided over by Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, to take overall responsibility. In the last semester, a large amount of this assistance was received. Now that the semester has ended, Mayor Wu and Speaker will invite leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors to discuss raising funds for poor student assistance in the next semester. The fundraising target is set at 10 billion to 15 billion, which should not be a problem. Poor students in various schools who want to receive this assistance must apply to the principal of their school. After approval, they should submit it to the "Unified Review Committee" for collection. As for students in various schools automatically raising donations from outside, the bureau will never allow it, in order to avoid various malpractices. People from all walks of life should not pay attention to movements to raise student assistance."

### Ethnic Cultural Beauty, Turning Violence into Auspiciousness, Li Ximou Wrote the Preface to the Fine Arts Annual, Praising Shanghai as the Cradle of Emerging Art

[Report from our correspondent] The Municipal Art Tea Party has recently compiled the "Shanghai Municipal Fine Arts Yearbook." The preface was written by Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau. The original preface is as follows:

"Fine arts are the beautiful scenery of ethnic culture and the crystallization of the vitality of life. In terms of their function, they can reveal the trends of the people's living mood and the rise and fall of the entire culture. Looking at the beginning of the European Renaissance, it was the artists who pioneered it. The prosperity of Chinese artifacts in the Han and Tang Dynasties was also led by fine arts and religion. On a smaller scale, they can cultivate character and turn violence into auspiciousness. Can their impact on social customs be ignored?

Shanghai has convenient transportation, and modern humanities are gathered here. All cultural education, science, politics, and economics are at the forefront of the trend and hold a leading position. Even in terms of fine arts, its evolution of genres, development of theories, and influence extend to the entire world art scene, making it the cradle of emerging art in our country. Artists from all over the world who come to Shanghai with their art can receive fame and fixed prices. The situation is similar to Rome in Italy and Paris in France.

However, Shanghai is a vast city with a dense population. In order to facilitate the discussion of artistic theory, exchange of opinions, and connection of emotions among people in the art world, there are organizations of various fine arts groups. The most prominent ones are the Chinese Painting Society, the Shanghai Fine Arts Association, the Shanghai Painters Association, and the Fine Arts Tea Party. They have made many contributions to the exhibition of fine arts, the research of fine arts academics, assisting the government in promoting fine arts education, and assisting social relief undertakings.

Although Shanghai's position is so important, the contribution of people in the art world to the government and society is also great, and the development of the fine arts industry is also rapid, the relationship between the evolution of history and the relationship between social culture is very close. If there is no systematic record of the whole, it will not only disappear without a trace after a long time, but it will also be impossible for people at home and abroad to understand the current trends in the Shanghai art world. The gentlemen of the Municipal Art Tea Party have realized this, and therefore have taken the initiative to compile the Fine Arts Yearbook. The far-reaching significance is self-evident, and it can be predicted that it will contribute to fine arts education and national literature.

Furthermore, the value of fine arts in education and the importance of their relationship with social customs are as described above. The Education Bureau is aware of this and has planned to establish an art museum. However, due to the financial constraints of the municipal government, its formal establishment is still pending. The Art Museum Preparatory Office has held a centenary painting exhibition and will soon hold a Qing Dynasty painting exhibition. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic support of people in the art world in the city. I hope that people in the art world will continue to assist and urge them to complete the art museum as soon as possible. It is not only the fortune of our country's culture and education, but also the heartfelt prayer of all citizens of Shanghai. This is the preface."

### Export Control Commission Drafts This Year's Plan, Expanding Export Commodities Production and Sales, Resolves to Make Utmost Efforts in Any Difficult Situation, Purchases Commodities That Merchants Cannot Export

The Export Control Commission, under the leadership of Director Huo Shishu, attaches great importance to promoting the export of commodities. The relevant departments of the commission have begun drafting this year's plan. It is reported that the plan includes two parts: (1) Increasing production; (2) Promoting sales. The production department has specific measures for production, transportation, loans, and other aspects. In terms of production, the emphasis is on improving quality, increasing output, and standardizing export commodities. In terms of transportation, the focus is on how to increase transportation efficiency, secure export time, and reduce transportation costs. For inland rivers and hinterland areas, the Ministry of Transportation will be responsible for establishing joint ventures, designating vehicles and ships to be specifically responsible for this task. In terms of loans, low-interest funding will be provided to exporters to enable them to make full use of the funds and reduce export costs. The sales promotion department also has specific decisions on issues related to promotion technology and exchange rates. For example, how to improve promotion technology and how to contact our commercial counselors stationed in various countries are all necessary. The policy of maintaining existing exchange rates will remain the main focus. In addition, a purchasing method is also established to purchase commodities that merchants cannot export. After the plan is formulated, it will be sent to the National Economic Commission for review and then reported to the Executive Yuan for approval. The person in charge of the commission stated that, under any difficult circumstances, they are determined to make the utmost effort to export commodities to increase foreign exchange reserves and balance international payments.

### Discussing Rice Market Transaction Methods, Director Wu Convenes Talks with Grain Merchants, Rice Prices Should Still Maintain the Original Price Limits Set by the Social Bureau

[Our Newspaper's News] Wu Chang, Director of the Social Bureau, convened a meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday with Hu Wenan, Xu Songren, Yin Fuxiang, Hu Hangang, Cai Shengming, Gu Yisheng, and Cha Qishan, seven members of the Management Committee of the North-South Rice Market. They discussed issues related to rice market transactions and rice price controls. Ye Shifu, Executive Committee Member of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Grain Department of the Social Bureau, also attended. The following points were decided:

(A) Re-examine the methods for grain merchants entering the market for trading: The Management Committees of the North and South Rice Markets shall compile a list of the numbers and names of all issued market entry permits and submit them to the Social Bureau for review by January 29th. The review shall be handled by a dedicated small group of the Social Bureau. The two Management Committees may nominate one representative to attend as an advisor. Grain merchants approved by the small group to enter the market shall be issued new market entry permits by the Social Bureau for inspection. All old permits, whether expired or not, shall be canceled. The issue of business aftercare for merchants without market entry qualifications shall be discussed separately (based on the principle of exclusively selling relief rice and government-allocated rice).

(B) Rectify methods for purchasing rice from other ports: A small group shall be established by the Social Bureau for research, convened by Chief Ji. The Management Committees of the North and South Rice Markets shall jointly provide opinions for reference.

(C) To prevent rice price fluctuations before the Lunar New Year, the previous order issued by the Social Bureau stating that the selling price of rice per shi should not exceed 1.45 million yuan remains in effect and shall be strictly enforced by the Market Management Committee.

### Rice Market Prices Fluctuate Slightly, Oil Market Sees Strong Buying Interest

Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of over 13,100 shi of rice. With the cold weather turning clear, the market showed gains in the morning but retreated in the afternoon. In the end, glutinous and indica rice showed little gain or loss, and white yuan saw little fluctuation. Flour mills were selling off, with a total of over 10,000 bags of various brands of flour. Prices remained the same, but old flour from military ships was in high demand, stepping over 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran trading was sluggish and flat.

Soybean cake demand was weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybean turnover was sluggish, with customer beans falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while Duhuanggou remained firm. Tea beans were actively traded in the north, with the market showing strength, rising slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Broad beans were also selling well, with demand exceeding supply, causing prices to rise by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rainbow beans were firm, and red beans rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red sorghum was scarce and rising, reaching 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Bagged rice in Beiyang was moving without rising significantly, increasing slightly by 10,000 yuan. Sesame in Tianjin continued to be processed, and the market was brisk. Oil mills were also eager to buy, circling upwards and rising again by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Raw kernels were actively absorbed by Guangdong merchants, with local traders competing to buy, causing a sharp increase of over 200,000 yuan.

The oil market was actively digesting, with strong buying interest. Soybean oil rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, raw oil rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, and both vegetable oil and clear oil were up by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Sesame oil rose sharply by 100,000 yuan.

Tea Prices Soar

Although trading in the tea market among foreign firms remained sluggish, local traders and merchants from other provinces continued to purchase, with strong buying interest. They were taking goods as soon as they saw them. As a result, sellers felt that goods were scarce and held out for higher prices, triggering a sharp rise in prices. At the close of the market, each dan rose by tens of thousands to nearly one million yuan.

Green Sugar Rebounds

Yesterday, the sugar market was stable, with red and white sugar showing minor fluctuations. However, green sugar rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan due to excessive declines in recent days and gradual sales. Shantou Green was 1.43 million to 1.44 million yuan, compared to 1.39 million to 1.37 million yuan in the previous session. Diao Green had previously dropped to a minimum of 1.29 million yuan, but opened yesterday at 1.32 million to 1.345 million yuan. The association's price for grade 24 crude white was 1.68 million to 1.685 million yuan, grade 4.5 white was 1.675 million yuan, and the futures market was relatively soft.

### Brokers Increase Capital and Certificates, Licenses to be Revoked for Failure to Comply by Deadline

[Our Newspaper's News] The Shanghai Securities Exchange received a notice from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on January 23rd, stating that the assets or capital held by securities exchange brokers should be no less than 50 million yuan, according to Article 6 of the Securities Exchange Business Rules. Previously, due to market volatility and rising stock prices, the Securities Exchange was instructed to raise the minimum capital amount, taking into account the existing capital of the brokers and the market situation, in order to protect market security and client interests. Brokers whose capital was insufficient to meet the new limit were ordered to increase it. Now, to facilitate the uniform handling of matters by brokers, the capital of each broker should be at least 500 million national currency. Furthermore, the Securities Exchange Brokerage Guarantee Fund was originally 50 million yuan. In addition to the cash and US dollar bonds already paid, brokers should increase it by 150 million national currency, for a total of 200 million yuan. Regarding the increase in the guarantee fund, it should be announced upon receipt of the document and completed within one month. The increase in capital should be completed within three months from the date of receipt of the document. Failure to comply by the deadline will result in the revocation of the license. The Securities Exchange Standing Committee received the document yesterday and held an extraordinary meeting of the Standing Council at 4:00 PM, chaired by Chairman Du. In addition to reporting the notice from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it was immediately announced in the market after the meeting yesterday.

[Another Report] The Brokerage Guarantee Fund was originally 50 million yuan, including 20 million yuan in cash and 30 million yuan in US dollar bonds. The notice from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs did not specify the ratio of cash to bonds after the increase in the guarantee fund. It is said that further instructions are pending.

### National Bonds Flat and Weak, Foreign Stocks Decline

Government bonds were flat and mediocre yesterday, with a turnover of about 4 million. National Bond C opened at 72,000, retreated from 73,000 to 67,000, and finally remained near the opening price. Compared to last Saturday, Bonds A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, Bond C fell by 3,000 yuan, and Bonds D and E remained flat.

Foreign stocks rose initially and then declined yesterday. Securities firms and retail investors were selling. Ewo Silk fell from 645,000 and struggled around 580,000. Hong Kong Stocks also rose initially and then retreated to flat. The situation was volatile and trending downward.

At the morning opening, all stocks were stable except for the Telegraph Company, which did not show any improvement. Wing On opened at 770 yuan and 787 yuan, and there was still a rebound after the opening, retreating to 763 yuan and 784 yuan. At this time, the price shouted outside the market exceeded the delivered price by more than 10 yuan, and it rose to 790 yuan and 812 yuan. Later, as the telephone investigation outside the market intensified, it fell to 780 yuan and 7999 yuan. Guangdong merchants advanced by more than 10 yuan. The erroneous rumor that the off-market interest rate was 3.6 and 4.05 cents caused morale to plummet. Halfway through the session, the off-market interest rate was announced, although it was 3.3 cents and 3.75 cents, it was still considered too high, and buyers dispersed, gradually moving downstream. The off-market gradually leveled with the delivered price. Around noon, it rebounded slightly to a low price of 745 yuan and 770 yuan. The afternoon close rose to 758 yuan and 778 yuan. As a result, compared to the delivered stocks from last Saturday, Xinhua, Lihua, Lianzhong, and French each fell by 3 yuan, and there was little effect in maintaining the Western merchants' shares. Compared to last Saturday, paper shares fell by 10%, Ewo Silk, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Ewo Brewery, and Shipping all fell by 5%, Steel declined sharply, and the real estate market was flat.

### China Trust Allocates Artificial Silk, Allocation Price Lower Than Last Week

The Central Trust Bureau allocated artificial silk to the ribbon and silk weaving industries for the fourth time yesterday (the 26th), allocating a total of 250 boxes of artificial silk. Allocation was similar to 73.6 million yuan for A-grade Dongyang and 73 million yuan for A-grade Tianqiao, which was about 2.5 million yuan lower than the allocation price last week.

### Winter Goods, Woolens Stagnant

Recently, in addition to long-haired velvet, Mair Deng, and military ship overcoat woolens, various grades of plain, thick overcoat woolens that are in demand for the cold season show a phenomenon of being produced but not selling. Local merchants lack embellishments. The standard market price has therefore fallen from its peak. It is because the selling season has passed seven or eight tenths. Therefore, the thick woolens that should be sold in the current season are not as strong in sales as the thin spring and summer woolens that have not yet been sold. Yesterday, white canvas was quoted at 95,000 yuan per yard, Soviet rubberized cloth at 75,000 yuan, rainproof cloth at 110,000 yuan, and mercerized feathers were generally sold at 72,500 yuan.

### Fangjian's Cotton Yarn Price Increases, 20-Count Yarn Listed at 34.75 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper's News] China Fangjian Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 895 pieces, equivalent to 1352.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 328 purchase orders. The selling price of 20-count yarn has reached the negotiated price limit of January 16th of this year, listing at 34.75 million yuan per piece.

Yarn Prices Fluctuate

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw Fangjian Company's sales opening with a slight increase in the negotiated price, and the battle between buyers and sellers was fierce. Demand from northern merchants increased, and traders with loose money were strongly bidding up prices. The 42-count Phoenix fine yarn opened at the 60 million mark and quickly broke through it, shouting as high as 60.7 million. Later, with the hope of US loans, the stock market reported small losses across the board, and morale suddenly turned soft. Local sales were stagnant, and weaving mills' appetite was flat, causing the market to move downstream. There were also profit-taking sales. As a result, the 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 100,000 yuan compared to the weekend, to 59.8 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns fluctuated by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Cloth Imports and Exports Scarce

Yesterday's cotton market saw increased inventory due to Fangjian's large supply on Saturday. Factories rarely imported or exported due to partial cash settlements. Due to transportation and cash constraints, Tianjin merchants often cut prices for sales. Hankou merchants were slow to absorb due to telegram delays. Cloth merchants and retail investors were constantly selling off due to economic pressures. As a result, 12-pound fine cloths fell by 5,000 to 23,500 yuan compared to the weekend, while twill and straight fine twill were more attractive. Other cloths showed little fluctuation.

Spot Cotton Market Continues to Be Firm

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was active. Traders felt optimistic because cotton yarn prices were trending higher. Yarn mills opened their appetites, and traders were strongly hedging. Market prices soared, and base prices were firm. 750 bales were traded. The factory price for Tuolisi was 5.787 million yuan, Han fine was 5.307 million yuan, the warehouse price for Han fine was 5.208 million yuan, and Tuolisi was 5.87 million yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton inferior goods were 1.15 million yuan.

Yarn Control Committee Implements Detailed Rules, To Be Announced Once Approved

The detailed implementation rules for yarn spinning and weaving, and the regulations for resident factory supervisors, have been sorted out by the committee's three-person team and were taken to Beijing by Fei Mingyang, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the 25th. It is reported that once approved by the central government, the Shanghai Yarn Control Committee will be notified by telegram to announce it in advance.

Six District Cotton Spinning Association Appeals to the Economic Commission

[Our Newspaper's News] The Six District Cotton Spinning Association, in light of reports that the government is reviewing the detailed rules for the management of cotton yarn and cloth and that there has been no participation from the industry to express opinions, is unaware of the contents. This matter concerns the entire survival and future of the textile industry. Therefore, at the request of its members, the Standing Council appealed to the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Yarn Control Committee, so that it can have the opportunity to contribute opinions before the announcement to show seriousness.

For yarn spinning and weaving, taking the form of contractual entrustment, there are daily production reports and unified tax records available, so there is no need to send resident factory supervisors. It is also reported that Council Chairman Wang Qiyu is currently in South China for inspection. The association has urgently telegraphed Wang to return to Shanghai immediately to preside over the association's affairs.

### Cigarettes Slightly Down

Yesterday, the cigarette market was stable at the opening. Later, due to active purchases by local merchants and looser cash flow in various areas, trading by non-industry players was brisk. Ten and twenty packs of British cigarettes were particularly strong. However, non-industry commodities retreated in the afternoon. As a result, ten packs of British cigarettes rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the weekend, to 34.5 million yuan, while Old Knife fell by 50,000 yuan. In addition, American packaged cigarettes rose, while Wuhu merchant cigarettes mostly declined.

### Silver Becomes Tighter Again Yesterday, Chinese Stocks Rise and Then Fall

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw slightly tighter cash conditions, and off-market interest rates rose, causing many to waver, so prices rose and then fell, with little trading. Off-market prices fell by 10%, and Qinxing, Zhabei, Commerce, Zhongsi, Meiya, Tongyi, Jingfang, and Rongchang were all down by 5%. The gains and losses of the remaining stocks were minor. The delivered stocks Qinxing fell by 10%, Meiya fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly.

Later, the evening report contained news that industrial loans would not be released, and Shangba fell to 757 yuan and 760 yuan. Number 54 entered the market immediately after the release, and numbers 23, 172, 65, 105, and 218 entered the delivered market, and numbers 206, 193, 8, and 157 entered the immediate market, rising to 775 yuan and 785 yuan. The national banks sold more than 100 billion, and sellers rose up, gradually retreating to 742 yuan and 752 yuan. The closing price was 748 yuan and 755 yuan. As a result, compared to the delivered stocks at the morning close, Xinguang, Xinyi, and Rongfeng each fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly. The delivered stocks Xinguang and Huafeng fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly. Among the off-market unlisted stocks, public utility stocks fell slightly, while the remaining stocks were flat.

### On the Issue of Siamese Remittances (1) The Significance of Securing Siamese Remittances

By Liu Zuoren

Our country is a country with a huge import surplus. The trade deficit of more than 300 million yuan per year before the war was mainly offset by remittance income. Therefore, remittances are not only an important item in balancing our country's international balance of payments, a major source of replenishing our foreign exchange funds, but also greatly beneficial to our country's financial and financial relations.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our country was still in the position of a human surplus country, and due to the ineffectiveness of foreign policy and the shrinking of domestic production, the trade deficit became more and more severe. Not only have remittances not increased, but they have also competed to escape to Hong Kong, and the international balance of payments deficit has become larger and larger. Therefore, how to absorb remittances and reverse this trend is an important issue at present. The author has always paid great attention to the issue of remittances. Last autumn, taking the opportunity to preside over the opening of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, I contacted people from all parties and conducted on-the-spot inspections. I deeply felt the importance of securing Siamese remittances, so I wrote this article.

The significance of securing Siamese remittances can be described from the following three points:

First: From the perspective of the distribution of the Chinese population, the Siamese Chinese account for the first place in the world. According to the statistics of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in 1940, the total Chinese population in the world was 8,546,374, and its distribution is shown in the following table:

Place of Residence Population

Various places in North and South America 1,601,218

Vietnam 426,353

Malaya 2,300,353

Dutch East Indies 1,344,809

North Borneo 68,034

Burma 193,594

Philippines 20,500

Total 8,546,374

From the above statistics, the Siamese Chinese account for more than 34% of the total number of overseas Chinese in the world. The number of overseas Chinese compatriots is the largest. From the perspective of population proportion, we should know the importance of Siamese remittances. Especially because the Nanyang suffered the most damage during the war, and the Nanyang overseas Chinese cause and population suffered significant losses. After the war, the number of Nanyang remittances was not as good as before the war, which is expected. Siam suffered less damage during the war, and although overseas Chinese compatriots were slightly affected by the influence of Siamese anti-Chinese, it is the most convenient and promising area for securing remittances. Therefore, from the perspective of the number of overseas Chinese, we can already see the importance of Siamese remittances.

### Imbalance Between Production and Consumption

— Sun Heng

To understand the interdependent relationship between producers and consumers, one must first understand that consumers' income is paid by producers. Not only do those engaged in agriculture and industry receive their income directly from entrepreneurs, but government taxes also come from producers, either directly paid by them or extracted from the income consumers receive from producers to be paid to the government. The government then uses the tax revenue to pay military and government personnel, making them non-direct producers. Therefore, we can define it as follows: a nation's national income is equal to the total production value of that nation.

Producers use their funds to pay the people, and the people use their income to buy consumer goods or capital goods, returning it to the producers. Only in this way can producers engage in reproduction and pay the people again, serving as the national income for the second period. Only then can production and consumption be balanced. If the people do not use all their income for consumption or investment, and there is a surplus of products left in the hands of producers, then this surplus, in a broad sense, is still a social investment. However, because producers already have a surplus, investment in the next period will be reduced accordingly. Consequently, the national income of the next period will also decrease, further affecting consumption. Therefore, an ideal balance between production and consumption is still difficult to achieve (because although production decreases, consumption decreases even more). This is the economic pathology of advanced European and American countries. To remedy this, one can either seek overseas markets to increase exports or increase new domestic investments, such as undertaking public works, thereby increasing national income and increasing effective demand. Moreover, due to the multiplier effect of investment expansion, new investment in one industry often stimulates investment in other industries. Consequently, national income is often several times the amount of the original new investment. Whether the purpose of increasing investment and production is to increase exports or increase domestic consumption depends on the international balance of payments situation. If it belongs to the former, then public works should be postponed to fully invest in the production of export goods. The recent British economic plan clearly belongs to the former.

In countries where politics are not clear, the imbalance between production and consumption is far greater than what is mentioned above, and I will describe it separately below:

1.  In industrially backward or agriculture-based countries, the harm is indescribable if the production value of the rural areas is not returned to the rural areas. The famous American historian George Adams, in his "Civilization During the Middle Ages," argued that the economic factor was extremely important to the fall of Rome. The aristocracy and wealthy class in Roman cities lived in extravagance and indulgence, and their wealth was actually taken from the rural areas. Moreover, they provided extensive relief to urban vagrants while imposing heavy taxes on farmers and forcibly suppressing the prices of their products. In the past, when farmers exchanged their production for urban goods, the value would still return to the rural areas, but now, the fruits of their hard work were half-consumed once they reached the cities. The capital of the rural areas was diminishing day by day, and their population continued to flee. Those who remained were mostly destitute, their spirits were dejected, and their physical strength declined daily. Good fields became barren because they were unable to fertilize them. Therefore, when the Germanic barbarian armies arrived, they collapsed at the sight of them. The once fierce and warlike spirit of the Roman people vanished like smoke. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that Rome did not resist than to say that the barbarian tribes conquered Rome. Reading history to this point, one cannot help but feel infinite regret!

2.  In countries where politics are unstable, the wealthy class does not invest their legitimate or illegitimate income in domestic production, but instead smuggles their funds abroad. As such, domestic production decreases, and at the same time, the total income of the people decreases. It is no different from transferring a portion of the country's savings abroad, increasing foreign production, and increasing foreign national income. If the wealth obtained from tainted blood were invested in domestic production, the result would only be an unfair distribution of wealth. However, because it is invested domestically, the capital is still temporarily paid to the people. Although in the long run, due to the unequal distribution of wealth, the purchasing power of the people declines, and thus production has to shrink as well. However, the harm is still chronic and not as severe as the disaster caused by the flight of capital overseas.

The transfer of international capital is inherently fluid. In countries with developed industries and surplus capital, it is not a problem to seek more favorable markets abroad to prevent overproduction. For example, after World War I, the United States invested as much as 10 billion US dollars in Germany; similarly, countries like the United Kingdom and the United States invested a considerable amount in China. However, this cannot be said of countries like China, which lack production and have short capital. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, a large amount of capital has fled China. If it were not for foreign loans and relief supplies offsetting its effect, the national economy would have been unbearable long ago.

3.  In countries frequently plagued by war, most able-bodied men join the army, reducing the number of workers who can be hired, easily leading to a state of full employment. If, at this juncture, more currency is issued to engage in new investments, then although the effective demand calculated in paper money increases, because the prices of raw materials and wages increase simultaneously, the amount of production still cannot increase. Unless production technology is rapidly improved, the latter may be possible, but this cannot be achieved in the short term. Moreover, because domestic order is unstable, the fleeing capital does not return, and there is no certainty of foreign investment, it is not easy to import the necessary production equipment. Trying to increase production by issuing currency is like climbing a tree to catch fish.

The ideal balance of consumption and production is that consumers use all their income to purchase consumer goods or investment goods. Producers also use all their income to engage in reproduction. Even if this ideal can be achieved, it is still static economics. But the evolution of society is dynamic. If the population increases and production technology does not improve, or there are no new investments, resulting in an increase in production, then the people's standard of living will be lowered. Therefore, in a dynamic society, in addition to improving production technology, it is also necessary to increase investment. Not only must all savings be used for reproduction, but in countries with short capital, it is also necessary to import foreign capital and return fleeing capital. Therefore, after the war is settled in our country, if the economic steps are not chaotic, it will still take decades of effort to achieve success. Shouldn't those who plan for the country pay attention to this!

### On "Sincerity" (Part 2): The Function of "Sincerity"

— Bu Dang

Since the essence of "Sincerity" has been described in the previous article, its function can be discussed. The "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is bestowed upon humans to become their nature and bestowed upon things to become their principle. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, possessing perception, movement, thought, and action, which things may lack or possess only in a negligible degree. Therefore, the function of "Sincerity" is mostly manifested in human interactions and human treatment of things. Manifested in human interactions, it involves "establishing oneself" and "establishing others"; manifested in human treatment of things, it involves "perfecting oneself" and "perfecting things." "Establishing oneself" and "perfecting oneself" exhaust the Way of Being Human, which is called "exhausting one's nature"; "establishing others" and "perfecting things" enable people to become complete and things to find their proper place, which is called "exhausting the nature of others" and "exhausting the nature of things."

The "Sincerity" bestowed upon humans as their nature is either complete or partial. The complete one is "born knowing" and "acting with ease," which is called a "sincere person" (also called "utmost sincerity"); the partial one is "learning to know" and "benefiting by acting," "struggling to know" and "striving to act," which is called "one who strives for sincerity." The "sincere person" is a sage (also called a "supreme sage"), and the "one who strives for sincerity" is a virtuous person or an ordinary person. "The sincere person hits the mark without effort and attains it without thought, acting calmly in accordance with the Way"; "the one who strives for sincerity chooses the good and firmly holds onto it." "Hitting the mark without effort" refers to action; "attaining it without thought" refers to knowledge; "acting calmly in accordance with the Way" means that both knowledge and action are in accordance with the "Doctrine of the Mean," natural and effortless, without any compulsion. The heart and body, inner and outer, thoughts and actions of the "sincere person" are all in accordance with the supreme Way and principle. The supreme Way and principle, in terms of their truthfulness and absence of falsehood, are called "Sincerity"; in terms of their absence of excess or deficiency, are called "Doctrine of the Mean," but in essence, they are one and the same. The "one who strives for sincerity" constantly adds vigilance and exertion to their thoughts and actions, "choosing the good and firmly holding onto it." "Good" is the "Mean" without excess or deficiency, and is also the "Sincerity" of truthfulness and absence of falsehood, the supreme Way and principle. Having devoted their mind's knowledge to seeking clarity of the supreme Way and principle, they further use the ability of their body to embody and practice it, so as not to lose or fall behind. This is a matter of "utmost devotion to the particular," hence it is said: "Next is to devote oneself to the particular, and devotion to the particular can lead to sincerity." "Particular" means partial; "devote" means to reach, to exhaust. Partial means different things and different matters; complete means shared principles and common examples. Shared principles and common examples are the supreme Way and principle of heaven and earth, the so-called "Sincere person." "Devoting oneself to the particular" is like saying that one exhausts their knowledge of the particular, that is, examines different things and different matters, seeking to know the reason why they are so, and then unites and connects them to achieve a consistent principle. The task of "striving for sincerity" lies in this.

From "devoting oneself to the particular" to reaching "Sincerity" is what is called "enlightening oneself through sincerity." "Enlightening" means to understand the reason why different things and different matters are so; "Sincerity" means the principle obtained by uniting the reasons why they are so. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Enlightening through sincerity is called nature; sincerity through enlightenment is called education. Being sincere, one becomes enlightened; being enlightened, one becomes sincere." If "Sincerity" is a principle. Principles are common, but matters are different; principles are complete, but things are partial; principles are metaphysical, and things and matters are physical. Applying the common and complete metaphysical principle to the different and partial physical matters and things, then the obscure matters will be revealed, and the ignorant things will be clarified. Hence it is said "enlightening through sincerity." Drawing inferences based on principles, leading through analogy, such as A and B being the same as C, therefore A and B are the same, is inherently a matter of ability, the nature's inherent ability, hence it is said: "Enlightening through sincerity is called nature." "Enlightening through sincerity" is a matter of academic extroversion (also called deduction). So-called "sincerity through enlightenment" means observing different things and different matters, obtaining the particular facts of their nature, the physical nature, and uniting their commonalities, understanding their completeness, and reaching the metaphysical principle. This is the work of academic introversion (also called induction), the competence of education, and the key lies here. Hence it is said, "Sincerity through enlightenment is called education." Education values experience, experience means that through what the ears and eyes have experienced, one examines the reasons why they are so, and then uses their thoughts to unite and connect them to form common principles and examples. Once the principles and examples are formed, one turns around and controls them, to manage changes, going against the current, and the application is endless, and human affairs are beneficial. "Enlightenment becomes sincerity" means to observe different things and different matters and to understand common principles and examples, the so-called "learning below and reaching above." "Sincerity becomes enlightenment" means that having understood common principles and examples, those that have not been observed can also be enlightened without observation. "The way of utmost sincerity can foresee." This is what it means.

With the completeness of their nature, the innate endowment of "born knowing" and "acting with ease," the so-called sage of "Sincerity," their "establishing oneself," "establishing others," "perfecting oneself," and "perfecting things" are natural and effortless, without waiting for the effort of cultivation. As for the partiality of their nature, the quality of "learning," "benefiting," "struggling," and "striving," the so-called virtuous person and ordinary person who "strive for sincerity," they become so only after doing, reach it only after cultivating, and the so-called "devoting oneself to the particular" and "sincerity through enlightenment" is their work. However, "devotion to the particular can lead to sincerity." Accumulating the work of "devoting oneself to the particular" will eventually lead to "Sincerity"; fully understanding the reasons why different things and different matters are so will also lead to their unification and connection, and reaching the supreme Way and principle of heaven and earth, and thus reaching "Sincerity." Hence it is said: "And when their knowledge is one," "and when their success is one." Generally, people must experience things and matters inside and outside their hearts and bodies before they can know and be able to do them, tasting the bitterness and sweetness themselves, and bearing the benefits and harms themselves. Therefore, their use of their hearts is painful, and their efforts are diligent. This is what is meant by "struggling" and "striving." Taking a step further to draw on the experiences of others, using what they see and hear for knowledge, and relying on imitation for ability, is what is called learning to know. Learning and then knowing, knowing and then being able to do, without struggling or striving, is what is called "benefiting." The highest are those who do not need to experience or practice, nor rely on what they see and hear for imitation, but quietly think and silently observe, unite and connect, and touch the similar by analogy, applying it to real things and matters, as if knowing without learning and being able to do without practice. This is what is called "born knowing" and "acting with ease." For these three levels, their knowledge has difficulty and ease, but when they know it, they all share this principle of heaven and earth, which is inherently what their nature is able to know. Their ability has slowness and speed, but when they are able to do it, they all share this matter of things and people, which is inherently what their nature is capable of doing. Therefore, what they know and what they achieve are one and the same. Thus, the innate sage and the man-made sage achieve the same merit. Sages, virtuous people, and ordinary people take different paths but reach the same destination. This is why sages and virtuous people are attainable. (To be continued)

### This Year's International Academic Conference

— Li Ren

This year, world academic conferences are becoming active. War hinders the progress of such conferences, but when we still have time to think about post-war reconstruction issues and the maintenance of peace, we cannot but think about them. "One can conquer the world on horseback, but one cannot govern it on horseback." When armed forces cease, it is naturally the day when academics rise. Academics have deeply suffered from the pain of war, and how can they not think after the pain has subsided? Although academics may not necessarily have the power to prevent war, they have a responsibility to prevent it. Perhaps this is one reason why this year's world academic conferences are particularly lively.

There seem to be quite a few international academic conferences to be held this year. Let the author first report on two of them. One is the Tenth International Philosophical Conference, and the other is the Twelfth International Psychological Conference.

We know that the Ninth International Philosophical Conference was held in Paris in 1937. After the conference, the Dutch government was invited to hold the Tenth Conference in the Netherlands in September 1941. However, the ruthless war hindered this conference. In February 1940, the person in charge of this conference decided to postpone it indefinitely. Soon, the entire Netherlands was occupied by the Nazis, and Professor Leonard Polak, chairman of the conference, was also arrested and sent to the concentration camp where he died tragically. The war's destruction of academics is a clear example of this. Now, the person in charge of the conference has decided to reconvene it in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in August or September of this year (the date is not yet certain). At the same time, the International Cultural and Educational Organization (UNESCO) has also decided to support it, so there should be no problem with the holding of this conference. In view of the complexity of current philosophical trends, this conference accepts this complexity without the illusion of unity. However, they are also unwilling for this conference to be just a place for ideological struggle. Therefore, they decided to propose a theme for this conference. The theme is: "Ideas of Man, Humanity, and Mankind." They believe that these ideas are the common origin of various different thoughts and their common problem. To provide a philosophical explanation of these ideas, mutual consultation is necessary. Moreover, when discussing these ideas, it is also necessary to seek the help of other sciences, such as sociology, psychology, mind science, anthropology, and cultural history. In addition to the theme, specialized philosophical issues, such as epistemology, axiology, and metaphysics, are naturally also on the agenda. However, when possible, the discussion of these issues should also be related to the theme. Judging from the theme of this conference, we know that world philosophers have indeed undergone a transformation, that is, a transformation to what the American philosopher Dewey called "the problem of man." And this transformation is exactly the same as the traditional philosophical thought that has been consistently inherited in our country. Because our country's traditional philosophy, no matter what the problem, is always related to life and does not leave life. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that philosophers from our country can participate in this conference. The chairman of this conference is H. J. Pos of the Netherlands, the secretary is E. W. Beth, and the correspondence address is: Bern. Zweerskade 23I. Amsterdam-z.

The Twelfth International Psychological Conference was originally scheduled to be held in 1940 and was also postponed due to the impact of the war. The conference has now decided to hold it in Edinburgh, Scotland, from July 23 to 29 this year. Because psychology itself is related to the issue of human nature, this conference will naturally not ignore the issue of human nature. It is also very important for people from the psychological community in our country to participate. The chairman of the organizing committee of the conference is James Drever, the general secretary is Godfrey Thomson, and the correspondence address is: Moray House Ecinburgh 8.

### Urban Environment and Mental Illness

— Fang Zheng

The urban environment or modern civilization has been regarded by many as a breeding ground for neurosis. Many people feel that the bustling stimulation of cities is an important cause of mental illness. Neurosis is a very serious problem, and the causes are very complex. Recently, social research in this area has yielded some commendable results, and looking at this problem from the perspective of the urban environment yields some fresh meanings.

"Mental Disorders in Urban Areas" by R. E. L. Fari and H. W. Dunham, published in 1937, starts from this point of view. Based on the initial diagnostic statistics of public and private hospitals in Chicago and its vicinity, they studied the relationship between mental illness and the urban environment. The results were the same as those of Shaw and Mckay's previous investigation into criminals. Farris and Dunham also divided Chicago into six types of areas: a bustling area, the city center where brothels are located; a boarding area, the center of hotels, apartments, and vagrants (Hobo); slums; tenement districts; residential areas; and luxurious residential areas. They found that the rate of neurosis had a very obvious relationship with this type of zoning. For example, from the center to the northwest, the frequency of each area is: 362, 177, 95, 71, 65, 55. If the zoning is more detailed, the results are more obvious, with the highest reaching 499 and the lowest only 48. The above numbers are based on the total number of initial diagnoses from 1922 to 1934. However, because the population of each district varies greatly, the above numbers are just a ratio, that is, taking the population of people over fifteen years old in 1930 per 100,000 as a benchmark.

Such results may have multiple different explanations, and it is not necessary to assume that mental illness is related to the urban environment. First, poor people or single men have to go to the hospital after they get sick, while rich people can recuperate at home, so there are more sick poor people. Second, perhaps it is not the environment that produces mental illness, but the possibility of having these diseases flows to these areas. Because of illness, one becomes poor, and because of poverty, one has to move to the slums. Therefore, the cause and effect may actually be reversed. Third, perhaps it can be explained by race instead of environment. For example, black people are mostly concentrated in poor areas, or perhaps the black race is inherently more prone to neurosis. The cause and effect of phenomena cannot be thought of solely from the surface.

However, Farris and Dunham's detailed results cannot all be explained in this way, and their results have at least six similar studies—in other cities in the United States—that can be cited as corroboration. We will now briefly cite a few special examples from their research. For example, the geographical distribution of schizophrenia is different from the geographical distribution of manic-depressive illness. The distribution of schizophrenia is roughly similar to the general results mentioned above, but manic-depressive illness does not seem to have this kind of regional difference. Moreover, speaking solely from schizophrenia, because of the complexity of the disease, its distribution also varies depending on the type of disease. Paranoid schizophrenia is concentrated in apartment and hotel areas, catatonic schizophrenia is more common in poor areas concentrated by foreigners, and such differences make us believe that the environment cannot be completely unrelated to mental symptoms.

Why is schizophrenia a disease of the poor? We must first know the cause of schizophrenia. It is a split, that is, an extreme introversion symptom in which the individual loses contact with reality. If we investigate how a person becomes alienated from reality, a large part of this has to be blamed on the environment. People are born to be gregarious. However, poor children have to alienate themselves from society because of social discrimination and live in isolation. The more isolated from reality, the more misunderstandings, and they blame all their personal disappointments on social obstruction and constraints, and they imagine everyone persecuting them. In this way, they think they have a remarkable origin and superhuman instincts, and the paranoid delusions gradually deepen. The urban environment further increases this force. People come and go, and no one cares about anyone's well-being, which results in a person having to increase their introverted tendencies and flow into the disease of schizophrenia.

The fact that manic-depressive illness does not seem to have a regional distinction does not necessarily mean that manic-depressive illness is unrelated to the environment. For example, Krout believes that this is due to the sequential relationship of the roots of the disease. The source of schizophrenia is early frustration, while the source of manic-depressive illness is later frustration. Early frustration is mostly due to family finances, while later frustration may have multiple causes and not entirely depend on family finances. Therefore, manic-depressive illness is not as specific to poor people as schizophrenia. According to the research of the German psychologist Kretchmer, manic-depressive patients are mostly pyknic types, and the pyknic type seems to be more common among the rich. Therefore, manic-depressive illness may be said to be a disease of the rich. This view may not be entirely appropriate, but the relationship between mental illness and the environment does not seem to be without basis.

### Academics, Forestry, and Conversations (7)

— Zhang Qiyun

U.S.-Soviet Relations

Last September 20th was the eightieth birthday of Mr. Henry L. Stimson of the United States. The "Foreign Affairs" magazine, founded in the autumn of 1922 (also translated as "Quarterly Journal of Diplomacy"), also coincided with its 25th anniversary. Mr. Stimson was specially invited to write an article for the anniversary issue (October of this year), the first essay, entitled "The Challenge to Americans." Stimson served as Secretary of War during President Taft's administration, and President Hoover appointed him as Secretary of State. During President Roosevelt's era, he was appointed as Secretary of War. In 1931, when the September 18th Incident occurred, Stimson advocated using force to confront Japan's aggressive policies. He spoke out justly and has always been a friend of China. During World War II, Stimson aided China in mobilizing the nation to defeat Germany and Japan, establishing immortal achievements. In his essay in "Foreign Affairs," after discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, he specifically expressed his belief that the United States today should aim for the world's freedom and prosperity, contributing its boundless national strength. "Foreign Affairs" magazine is a well-established publication in the United States with a high academic standing. We should pay close attention to the words of this old statesman. Although this article speaks for the American people, it is also a valuable warning for the Chinese people.

Victory and peace are not synonymous. Currently, most parts of the world are merely in a state of armed truce, and some places have already openly opened fire. The path to lasting peace and stability is extremely distant. The world crisis came with victory, and the biggest crisis is the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union. Stimson recalled that President Roosevelt repeatedly wanted to build friendly relations with the Soviet Union, treating the Soviet Union with goodwill, and hoping that the Soviet Union could also treat the United States with goodwill. Unfortunately, before President Roosevelt passed away in the spring of 1945, the Soviet Union had already expressed an unfriendly attitude towards the United States. Stimson greatly admired the Soviet people's loyal and courageous fighting but said that the people currently in power in the Soviet Union believe that the American style of democracy and freedom has reached its end, which runs counter to the Soviet style. The United States hopes that the Soviet Union will become a good friend, and such friendship is beneficial to the Soviet Union. But at least for the time being, the Soviet Union considers the United States to be outdated and goes its own way. Communist parties around the world follow the Soviet Union's lead, and there is a tendency to intensify this trend. Stimson believes that if Americans do not recognize this fact, and think that if we are friendly to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will be friendly to us, it is either self-deception or utter foolishness. These words were of course directed at people like Wallace.

Stimson claimed that his attitude is not passive, let alone anti-Russian. It is only to make the Soviet Union truly know that freedom and prosperity are not mutually exclusive and that both can coexist in the Western democratic world. The American people should examine themselves and devote themselves to production. Diplomacy and domestic affairs are inseparable. It is indeed true that America's prosperity depends on the world's prosperity. It is equally reasonable to say that the world's economic future depends on America's economic future. The United States must strive to create a new standard of peacetime production. Laziness, hesitation, and irresponsibility are incurable problems. Unless production increases, there is no point in talking about increasing wages and profits. The United States should also use this spirit to quickly rescue Western Europe and other places from disappointment, hunger, and terror. The faster it is done, the less it costs, and the greater the success. Freedom requires tolerance. Under the principle of human dignity, there can be different forms of free society, and they do not all have to be exactly the same as the United States. If the United States can make freedom and prosperity a reality in this world, then communism will not become a threat. If it cannot, regardless of whether there is communism or not, our civilization will eventually fail. Soviet leaders pay attention to reality. We should respond to them with concrete facts so that they know that if they do not change their goals, they will lose their position. Only in this way will it be effective. Otherwise, merely engaging in blind anti-communism will cause our efforts to be in vain.

Stimson believes that the United States cannot continue to tolerate the Soviet Union's expansionist policies and arbitrarily advance into areas emptied by the war. The United States must make it clear that it is by no means an expansionist. America's responsibility is to help threatened people help themselves. This is by no means easy and requires a brave and mobile policy, and capable and sensitive implementation. The construction of peace cannot be undertaken by one country alone, but the preparation for war can be decided by one country. The United States must maintain a strong military force to make aggressors wary. We also know that Russians are not happy to fight and that a non-aggressive Soviet Union has nothing to fear from the United States. The United States is the first country to use atomic energy. American personnel have a sacred mission. Atomic energy should make mankind prosperous and not cause mankind to self-destruct. Within the borders of the United States, there is still the freedom to protect freedom. This point must not be taken lightly. If we are timid and evade responsibility, or even isolate ourselves from the world and stand idly by, war may be unavoidable.

The establishment of a world government and the control of atomic energy are impossible without Soviet participation. However, the United Nations is currently paralyzed due to the frequent use of the veto. Stimson believes that the United States should devote all its efforts to revitalize the authority of the United Nations. If the Soviet Union cannot be honest with each other, it is better to raise a clear banner of opposition. The first chapter of the United Nations clearly states that it should have the power to investigate and report on world issues and cannot be denied by the veto of any major power. Stimson firmly believes that the United States has the power to solve major world problems but cannot take a half-hearted attitude, nor can it give up halfway. The way to solve difficulties lies in reason and will, and the country's basic policies must be backed by the understanding of the people. The United States has unlimited responsibility for the world, and all public and private plans and policies should be set against the background of the whole world. The problems of Asia and Europe are the problems of the United States. Political and economic isolationism must be eliminated. Today, the duty of the United States is to use its unlimited national power to strive for the world's freedom and prosperity.

### ### Record of Today's Peach Blossom Spring

— Lei Hong

There is such a place where people do not have to worry about the coming of atomic bombs, and income tax is only one percent. The Prime Minister does not need to put on the airs of a politician, but spends most of his time leading a troop of Boy Scouts. This place does not know what divorce is, has no poor people, and nine-tenths of the people enjoy an old age of over sixty.

Is it Shangri-La? Or Utopia? It is not. It is a small country located between Austria and Switzerland, nestled in the mountains of the Alps: Liechtenstein.

The people of the country are always happy. When they cross the border and look at Europe, which is shrouded in famine, distress, and war, they congratulate themselves and doubt what the "enlightened" giants who are causing a stir are doing. They entrusted the Allied planes to bomb the Zeppelin factory on the shore of Lake Constance. That night, there were tragic beacon fires on the northern horizon. How can we remember it? On this evening, the capital of the country, Vaduz, was full of fireworks celebrating the birth of a son to Head of State Joseph II and his wife, Princess Georgina.

The people of the country can eat good and abundant but simple food, and it is easy to buy, without relying on the black market. Morality is high, and criminal incidents are rare. Therefore, prisons are empty and can only be rented to neighboring Switzerland for the detention of an occasional resister.

But do not think that the people of the country are unsociable hermits. They are probably the most compassionate people in the world. For every three people, one is an active member of the Red Cross, serving the ravaged neighboring countries and rescuing people who lack food and clothing and are afflicted with poverty and disease.

When Hitler went straight into Austria and then wanted to sweep the country, the country sent a troop of Boy Scouts to the border, and along the way, some farmers left their fields, casually picking up something as a weapon, and confronted the German army. The German army hesitated when it saw this strange team. The Nazis finally withdrew and respected the neutrality of the Kingdom of Liechtenstein.

The day Joseph ascended the throne was the day Hitler's army occupied Austria. The king likes to read modern literature, appreciates classical music, and often plays with his children. The government respects the constitution and practices democracy. A petition signed by four hundred people can influence Congress. The people of the country do not pay taxes to the royal family—the income tax is one cent per dollar.

Regarding the reason for the low tax rate, Prime Minister Frick said it well: "Of course, we have no military expenditures, because we do not need an army, navy, or air force. We do not have to run social enterprises, because everyone has enough land to support their family. And our stamps are sought after by stamp collectors around the world, and we are naturally happy to supply them. Setting up customs and tax bureaus is too expensive, so we lease this 'right' to Switzerland to collect taxes on our behalf. Even her foreign policy is handled by Switzerland, saving the cost of sending envoys."

Foreign factories take advantage of the fact that the country has no labor unions and have gone to open branches, thereby developing their operations—because the country only has "family unity." For example, a hotel manager had a small dispute with a butcher in Vaduz. As a result, the manager was unwilling to do business with him anymore. But when the hotel roof leaked, all the plasterers claimed that they had other work and refused to repair it. The plumbers and electricians also made excuses when needed. Later, the manager was replaced before the hotel business could be revitalized. It seemed that all the technicians were relatives and friends of the butcher.

The country has one movie theater, which is only open on Sundays. Because people have to work on weekdays, and they should rest in the evenings. Children under the age of eighteen are not allowed in the theater; the films shown are limited to those that do not represent the extravagant life of Hollywood. They point out that films with debauchery cannot make people feel happy and satisfied.

According to Frick, the reason why the Liechtenstein can live peacefully in the world is, "We have a rich way of seeking happiness, but we lack the dream of conquerors."

### ### Cold Wave in Beiping

— Liu Yansheng

According to the meteorological station, the cold in Beiping this year is the most severe in ten years, with the thermometer reading seventeen degrees below zero, which is unprecedented in previous years.

The cold in Beiping has been recorded in poems and books by the ancients many times. On this occasion of extreme cold, discussing the writings of predecessors about the cold in Beiping can also serve as an introduction to the local customs of Beiping and can also provide more assistance in conversation, matching Li Du's.

Shushi Jiayi Youcao entrusted Gong Youying with saying: "A gust of wind howls in the wilderness, shooting my jade skin with goosebumps. I go out in the morning wearing a fox fur coat, and sleep at night with heron-like curled feet; my shins shrink under the quilt, and half the bed is not too crowded." This poem describes the meaning of coldness, and it can be said that it has been depicted to the fullest. If one has not experienced it personally, one cannot be so profound.

Guizhai Ji's Ouyang Yuangong's Fisherman's Pride words say: "Sable sleeves, leopard robes, and silver rat felt, beauties come and go in felt carts." It also describes the state of life in the cold of Beiping. Although the taste of coldness in the mansions of the rich is slightly reduced, they use precious fur coats to keep out the cold, not only to show off their wealth but also because precious fur coats are not enough to resist the extreme cold.

The Fengyue Yutan Lu records: "The climate of the capital is bitterly cold, and fires are lit every year on the first day of October until the first day of February. However, on extremely cold days, even fire is not warm." The Yanjing Suishi Ji and Chunming Caifeng Zhi both have this record. In the winter cold of Beiping, people all regard the brazier as a gift of grace. There are many forms of braziers, many methods, and most of them are locally made in Beiping, exquisite and durable. The Yanjing Suishi Ji records: "The brazier is made of non-ash wood, which is whiter than jade stone, light, warm, strong, and durable." The Chunming Caifeng Zhi also records: "Most of the braziers use non-ash wood, because it is warm all around. The smaller ones in the brazier are short and fat, called 'little fat boys'. Poor families use flower pots to hold them, the smaller ones cherish them, saving money and making them last. In recent years, there are people who make them with , which are light and convenient." This is nothing less than a short history of the braziers of Beiping. Non-ash wood is a special product of Beiping, produced in the Western Hills, belonging to minerals, durable, and has a particularly strong heating power. In the past, there were many shops in Beiping that sold non-ash wood braziers. In the past ten years, people have mostly used foreign stoves, and those made of non-ash wood have fallen behind. These shops have also changed their business one after another, and non-ash wood braziers have become historical terms. If you look for them in the families of Beiping, there are still some that are still in use and not broken. Every winter, they are taken out and used, and they should be regarded as treasures. In addition to non-ash wood, there are also those who use copper stoves, which are magnificent. However, copper stoves are the nature of the stove cover, with a stove core in the middle. After the fire is lit, it is placed in a copper cover. The stove core is made of iron, and many are also made of non-ash wood. Since the popularity of new-style foreign stoves, this kind of antique-style brazier has been abandoned by people.

From the brazier, let's talk about coal. Beiping is a coal-producing area. Mentougou in the northwest suburb is the general meeting place of coal. In the past, it was specially for the use of Beiping. The Shuicao Qingxia Lu said: "The price of coal in the Western Hills is not very high, and it is quite profitable." It can be seen that coal is a special product of Beiping. The Sichaoshi Shi contains Wu Yangyuan's poem on coal balls, which is mostly ancient and obscure. The so-called: "The north is bitterly cold, and the Western Hills are rich in nurturing. Cheng Caihuo sends stones, competing with Sui zuanmu." It also said: "The mud pill is majestic in Qin Guan, and the charcoal group is unique to Song Chen. Utilizing super-Su, bestowing the name Jia Cuju." Coal balls are used in poetry, or this is the first choice.

The ancients often described the cold in the north as dropping fingers and cracking skin, and even reading Fang Xiang's poem recorded in the Jintai Youxue Cao, the so-called: "The cold of Yanshan is not found in the south, and in October, the mountains are already surrounded by foxes. In the daytime, the wind is like cutting the face, and the night air is like a micro-skin." Now that the cold wave still wants to stay, the cold is even worse. As I write this, my heart is still shivering.

### ### The Struggle of Foreign Envoys to Meet the Emperor in the Late Qing Dynasty

— Yifeng

Before the Opium War, the Manchu Qing dynasty closed itself off to the outside world, and there was no diplomacy to speak of. Later, Britain, France, the United States, and Russia established embassies in Beijing, which opened the door. However, the important ministers of the court at that time were either ignorant and arrogant or ignorant. Therefore, the slowness of Qing diplomacy, from "despising foreigners" to "fawning on foreigners" to "fearing foreigners," was full of jokes. When people read it today, they still have mixed feelings of laughter and tears.

For example, after the British and French War, embassies of European and American countries were successively established in Beijing. According to European and American practice, the envoys must meet the head of the host country and present their credentials, which is also an indispensable etiquette. However, the Qing court repeatedly refused to do so. Xianfeng was afraid of meeting them and would rather not return to Beijing. When Tongzhi succeeded to the throne, the foreign envoys requested an audience, but the Prime Minister's Office refused on the grounds that the Empress Dowager was in power and that men and women should not be in close contact. The only reason they refused the foreign envoys' audience was the dispute between the Chinese slave-style kneeling ceremony and the Western-style bow. At that time, those old and decaying ministers of the Prime Minister's Office and the frontier officials all believed that not kneeling was a major matter that insulted the national dignity and was unruly. The words of Ding Shizhen, the governor of Shandong, can be taken as a representative of the general court officials' discussion. He said: "Since they do not practice Chinese etiquette, their unruly spirit will be difficult to subdue... If they are allowed to enter the audience, I am afraid that in the future, even the smallest matters will trouble the Emperor... It seems better to refuse politely in advance to prevent it." Wu Dacheng even said: "Our country's system has never had a method of not kneeling. The etiquette of the court is the system left by our ancestors." Not only did he raise the big hat of "ancestors," but he also believed that if foreign envoys did not kneel, "all the people in the world" would be aroused by "resentment and dissatisfaction." I really don't know what he based this on, and his ignorance is also known.

What is especially ridiculous is that in 1872 (the eleventh year of Tongzhi), Emperor Tongzhi got married. The foreign ambassadors in Beijing thought that when China had such a grand ceremony, they would definitely be invited to participate, and they could also take this opportunity to satisfy their curiosity about seeing the Chinese emperor. Who knew that things were very different? Before this big day, they were not only not invited, but the side sent someone named to each embassy to inform them that on that auspicious day, all foreigners should not walk on the streets, simply treating the foreigners at that time as ominous floods and beasts. Naturally, this aroused the dissatisfaction of the foreign envoys. The following year, Tongzhi took power, and the foreign envoys firmly demanded an audience in advance. For a time, there was a lot of discussion in the court. Some strongly opposed it, thinking that if this precedent was set, foreign envoys could take the opportunity to blackmail the emperor at any time; some even requested to deploy troops to frighten them, as Bian Shiquan said: "The Emperor should make a sole decision and refuse to see them, and instruct the Chinese and foreign ministers to strictly deploy troops to uphold the dignity of the court and to prevent the arrogance of foreign barbarians." It was simply going to declare war on the outside world. In the end, it was Li Hongzhang and a few other ministers who were slightly more understanding who adopted the compromise method of "only allowing one audience, not allowing another, only allowing all envoys to see together once, not allowing one country to ask for a separate audience" to solve this struggle for audience. They also changed the Western three bows to five bows to show respect. The foreign envoys of various countries had no choice but to comply.

Afterwards, the Beijing newspaper exaggeratedly recorded such a ridiculous process, saying:

"The British envoy first recited about two or three words of the credential, and then trembled all over. The Emperor said, "Is your Emperor healthy?" The British envoy could not answer. The Emperor also said, "If you want to visit Us, what is your intention? Tell it to Us quickly." He still could not answer. The envoys all presented their credentials in order. Some dropped their credentials to the ground, and some could not answer when the Emperor asked. Then he and Prince Gong were ordered to leave. However, after the fear, their feet could not move, and when they reached the resting place, they were sweating profusely, so that they could not attend the banquet given by the Zongli Yamen. Afterwards, Prince Gong said to the envoys, "I once told you that visiting the Emperor is not something to be taken lightly as a children's play; you did not believe it, but what is the result now? Are the Chinese like you foreigners, who are as light as chicken feathers!""

Was this really the case? I'm afraid only the people at that time knew!

### ### Talking About Pickpockets

— Leli

Recently, I saw in the newspaper that a reader requested the elimination of pickpockets in a letter. It is said that pickpockets are extremely rampant in the money shop area between Henan Road and Shandong Road on Ningbi Road, and there are many victims. I also saw in the newspaper that a six-year-old girl stole a huge diamond. Although the police station has been investigating in Beijing and Shanghai, the principal has fled to Hong Kong, etc. It can be seen how active the pickpockets in this city are, and how superb their methods are! A few days ago, because I went to the post office to buy stamps, I was also "patronized" by these people. 500,000 yuan of legal tender in my pocket was snatched away, and I really shared the reader's feelings.

The reason I say "patronized again" is because I have been coveted by pickpockets many times before. This is the third time. The first time was as early as twelve years ago, on a tram on French Concession Road. It was a summer day. I was wearing a silk long gown, and the silk short gown on the fur surface was cut with a seam, and a wallet was lost. I was very clear when I lost it, but how could I catch the thief red-handed? I could only let it go. Fortunately, the money and things were all in my hand, and there was nothing in the wallet except photos and keys. Therefore, I paid great attention and thought that I had learned a lesson once I had suffered a loss.

Sure enough, I had experience the second time. In the winter of the year of victory, I returned to Shanghai and took trolleybus No. 17 on Fuzhou Road. I felt something different in the crowd, so I stroked my whole body with my hand, trying not to come into contact with people, and at the same time pressed down on my inner pocket. When I got off the bus, I saw that the pocket of the silk cotton short gown had been cut with a seam in the same style as before, but the few Customs Gold Units in the pocket were fortunately not leaked out.

When the newspaper reported some time ago that the police station was clearing out pickpockets on a large scale and ordered them to demonstrate their skills in public, I often told people about these two things, thinking that being pickpocketed was always due to my own carelessness. Who knew that I would lose if I talked too much? This time was terrible. At nine o'clock in the morning on the 14th, because it was convenient, I went to the Wusong Road Post Office to buy some stamps. I was standing in line in front of the counter, and it was a little crowded. Suddenly, I felt light in my pocket. I let go of my hand and touched it, and the buttons were undone. The money was gone. I thought I had experience, so I didn't make a sound at the time. I bought the stamps as usual and went to the police booth in front of the post office (now at the street corner). There are many such booths to report the loss, but the police officer was not very interested. Later, I heard that I was a government employee, so he reluctantly went into the post office with me and took a look, and said to me: "If you had announced it earlier, closed the door, and then I came, you could have caught him. Now, how can you catch him?" Naturally, I had to give up.

It is true that people who are pickpocketed are careless. Who told me to be distracted that day? If I could have concentrated my attention, the pickpockets would probably still be unable to use their skills; however, the chaos and complexity of this city life greatly increases their opportunities, which is a fact.

What is strange is that, as I see it, these pickpockets, at least the pickpockets near the bank and post office, are quite easy to catch. The reason why they are still active and getting worse seems to be some factors of "not being able to do it." If I have time, I will definitely learn the foolishness of a certain student who was also reported in the newspaper some time ago, tie a thread on a fountain pen, arrange the bait, and catch one or two pickpockets to try.

### ### Long Faces and Round Faces

— Wang Dingyi

When I was working at the National Kindergarten Normal School, I heard a lecture by Mr. Chen Heqin. He said: "There are three treasures in life: a mirror, a notebook, and a pen, and a cross." He meant to use a mirror to look at your own face to see if it is round or long? Generally, a round face is pleasant, and a long face is annoyed. That is to say: the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness in your heart are shown on your face for others to see.

The reporter feels that in today's society, there are really too many annoying things to count. No wonder there are disturbances in all classes of society. Everyone has anger in their hearts. As long as there is a disagreement, they will start to fight, so they fight each other and cause a storm.

In fact, this is unnecessary. If the liver fire is strong, it will burn immediately, but we have to look in the mirror often ourselves. If we are annoyed in our hearts and always have a long face, and then use it to deal with others, the other party was originally happy and wanted to talk and say something with you. When they meet your noble face, they have to put away their smile and become serious. Then, the originally harmonious and relaxed atmosphere becomes awkward. Even if the other party happens to be unhappy, and they want to vent, when they see your iron plate face, they are right in the middle of their heart. If there is a disagreement, the liver fire will rise, and both sides will compete, resulting in both sides being hurt!

Therefore, I think that a long face is more likely to attract trouble, while a round face is called a spring breeze, a harmonious atmosphere, and everyone likes to see it. Why must we hang a long face and make people hate and fear us?

If we have problems, annoyances, and difficulties, we might as well be gentle and sincere to discuss with others and think of a way to solve the difficulties and eliminate the annoyances. Why must we hang a long face and seriously argue?

### Leisurely Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (54)

Zhu Zhai initially declined, saying he had matters to attend to. Later, Yun Qing told him that her mother had returned from Tianjin and he must go, and she also asked him to come for dinner. Zhu Zhai had no choice but to agree. That evening, after arriving at the Gu residence, he invited Qi Wan out, bought a carpet, and Qi Wan accompanied him to the East Asia Building for dinner. Zhu Zhai said he had other engagements, and after sending Qi Wan home, he hurried to Yun Qing's house. Yun Qing's mother, upon seeing Zhu Zhai, showed extraordinary warmth, asking about everything. She strongly disapproved of Zhu Zhai living in the bank's dormitory, believing that living away from home without anyone to care for him was very inconvenient. She suggested he either return home or move into her house. Zhu Zhai was deeply moved by the old woman's enthusiasm. He felt that Mrs. Zhang's attitude toward him since returning from Tianjin was so fervent because she knew about his divorce from Hu Sheng and had high expectations for him. However, he doubted that this situation would have a good outcome and feared a major backlash in the future. Therefore, seeing Mrs. Zhang's warm hospitality, he felt increasingly uneasy. That evening, Mrs. Zhang specially prepared many dishes that Zhu Zhai usually liked, and Yun Qing eagerly urged him to drink. Zhu Zhai, moved by the enthusiasm of the mother and daughter, couldn't help but drink heavily, becoming completely drunk. He ended up lying on the sofa, snoring away. Mrs. Zhang, fearing he would catch a chill, instructed Yun Qing to help him to a room to rest. Yun Qing led him to the outer study, to a small cot. Seeing that his tie was tied tightly around his neck, she casually loosened it and took off his jacket, helping him lie down. As she hung his jacket on the coat rack, she saw a paper packet fall from his pocket. Yun Qing picked it up and saw that it was a stack of photographs developed by the Wang Xing Photography Studio. Overcome by curiosity, she opened the packet and pulled out the photographs. She found that they were pictures of Qi Wan. Two of them were casual shots, and one in particular was most jarring: a photo of Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai together. Qi Wan was sitting in a chair, and Zhu Zhai was sitting on the armrest to her left, with one hand on Qi Wan's shoulder, appearing very intimate. Yun Qing, upon seeing this photograph, felt a surge of intense emotion. She bit her firm lips and looked at Zhu Zhai, wanting nothing more than to wake him up and demand an explanation. Standing in the center of the room, she hesitated for a long time, finally concluding that he was drunk, and even if she asked him now, he might not be able to give a coherent answer. She had always suspected Zhu Zhai's actions, and today she could prove that he indeed had another lover in his heart, and that the object of his affection was none other than the most detestable Qi Wan. This matter needed to be addressed. However, confronting him with just this one photograph would not be sufficient; she needed concrete evidence, to catch him at a weak point, to question him thoroughly and make him submit. But after this incident, their relationship would inevitably be severed. Thinking of this, Yun Qing's anger turned to heartache, and tears streamed down her face. Unable to bear it any longer, she ran to her own room, collapsed on the bed, and began to sob uncontrollably.

### Stealing Leisure in Busyness

— Ji Mo

Life is busy and tense, everyone has their own career, everyone has their own future. Even the pleasures of the city, such as pre-ordering theater tickets, reserving seats in restaurants, and finding empty seats in crowded dance halls, require you to set aside some time and treat it as a serious matter. Otherwise, being turned away at the last minute will only double your disappointment.

However, the loveliness of life perhaps lies in a bit of leisure amidst all the busyness. In a speeding train, a glimpse of a vibrant young branch from the window can moisten our souls. Our work may seem to keep us impossibly busy every day, but we can always find moments of leisure to free ourselves from mental and physical constraints.

I once encountered a Harvard University graduate, with whom I had a passing acquaintance, on the street. He was working as a street-level employee in an American company, wearing a crisp suit. It was last autumn, and he was chewing chestnuts while carefully reading the newspapers posted on the street. You might say he lacked gentlemanly manners, but he was undoubtedly a philosopher who understood the joys of life.

On another occasion, while riding the number 10 bus, the passenger next to me was a Western woman in her thirties, carrying a handbag full of newspapers and various items. Her clothes were simple, but her attire was clean and tidy, giving the impression of a Jewish housewife. She seemed to be going to the downtown area to shop, or perhaps returning from shopping. After sitting for a minute or two, she pulled out a first-grade Chinese textbook from her bag and, with a relaxed and contented manner, began to write clumsily in a square grid notebook: "Come read, everyone come read..." as if she were studying an interesting lesson.

Sometimes, even in a serious office where the atmosphere is heavy, a touch of levity stolen from busyness is undeniable. Once, I visited a foreigner who was in charge of economic research. He had bright blue eyes, light yellow hair, and the snow-white cuffs of his shirt protruded from the sleeves of his light blue, narrow-striped suit.

After I finished discussing business with him, a boy brought in a kraft paper package and placed it on the foreigner's desk. He looked it over and said to me, "This is a Christmas gift sent from America on December 12th of last year, it's finally arrived." This had nothing to do with my business, but it was full of human warmth, suggesting that he was willing to chat with me for a few minutes amidst his busy schedule. Unfortunately, I was short on time and had to say goodbye.

### A Study of Han Yu's Letters to Great Master Dian

— Zheng Guoyi

There have been many eminent monks throughout history, but Great Master Dian is uniquely remembered and discussed, remaining immortal to this day. The people of Chaozhou especially revere him, referring to him as the Patriarch with utmost respect. The reason for this is the influence of Han Yu's three letters. If Great Master Dian had not encountered Han Yu, this famous case would not exist, and he would have long since decayed like grass and trees. However, the authenticity of Han Yu's three letters to Great Master Dian has been a subject of much debate, with no definitive conclusion. Ouyang Yongshu took the phrase "If one is not attached, then the mountains and forests are as noisy and bustling as the city" to mean that only Han Yu could have expressed such a sentiment. Su Dongpo, on the other hand, believed that the three letters were falsely written by someone, with vulgar language that even Han Yu's servants would not use. Ouyang and Su were both great literary masters of their time, yet their views differed so greatly. Zhu Xi, however, stated that "Only the last of the three letters has passages that are truly ungrammatical, perhaps because the original text was lost, and the monks' recollections were inaccurate, resulting in omissions and errors. Ouyang Gong only considered the general idea, so he only took what was acceptable and did not dwell on what was questionable. Su Gong noticed what was questionable but could not discern the errors and directly condemned it as vulgar." Thus, he judged the last letter to be false, while the first two were indeed written by Han Yu. Among Ouyang, Su, and Zhu, only Dongpo explicitly rejected them, while Yongshu and Zhu Xi both believed that they undoubtedly came from Han Yu. The only point of contention was the last letter. If the first two letters were indeed written by Han Yu, why dwell on the authenticity of the third letter? When Yuan Gong (Dunyi) wrote a poem on the wall of the Great Master Dian Hall, he also wrote: "Retreating Zhi considers himself like Confucius, vehemently denouncing Buddhism and Taoism. Not knowing what Great Master Dian is like? Several letters cherished, even leaving behind clothing." He ridiculed Han Yu to the extreme. In essence, Han Yu and Great Master Dian were friends, and Han Yu had already given him his heart. To quibble about the three letters is unnecessary. It was once said: "Han Yu criticized Buddhism, and Song Xu also criticized Buddhism, but monks feared Han Yu more than Song scholars, because Han Yu had not studied Buddhism deeply, his criticisms only scratched the surface, making them easily understood by the world. Song scholars, on the other hand, delved deeply into Buddhist scriptures, their criticisms reaching the essence, which not everyone could understand. Han Yu's criticisms were only directed at the Buddhist practices of the monks, so monks feared Han Yu more than Song scholars." This statement gets to the heart of the matter. Reading Han Yu's "Yuan Dao" (On the Origin of the Way) makes this clear. Han Yu, who had never studied Buddhism, suddenly encountered Great Master Dian on a desolate seashore, who eloquently discussed profound and subtle matters with him, Han Yu could not help but develop a sense of admiration and trust. Otherwise, how could there have been the acts of "building a hut" and "leaving behind clothing"? The acts of "building a hut" and "leaving behind clothing" are not something Han Yu himself denies. The existence of the three letters is of minor importance.

### One Step Further

— Wang Baili

Suiyuan Shihua states: "Immortals are a beautiful title, but an ancient poem says: 'A husband's life is short, unfortunately becoming an immortal.'" Willow catkins are a drifting object, but an ancient poem says: "I am more adrift than willow catkins, willow catkins are only busy for one spring." This is what is meant by taking it one step further. Lao Xue'an's Notes record that Yan Jingchu, a minister, invited a monk to reside in a temple. The monk complained that the temple was too poor and humble. Jingchu said, "Talent makes things easy." The monk said, "How can a skilled woman make soup noodles without flour?" Jingchu said, "With flour, even a clumsy woman can handle it." The monk was ashamed and withdrew. I believe Jingchu's words also take it one step further.

### The Value of Fish Scales

— Tong

The silver scales of the menhaden, a type of herring found in the Finte Bay, are a surprising byproduct of the fishing industry. Surprisingly, these trivial scales are worth ten times the price of the menhaden and herring themselves.

Fishermen, exposed to wind and sun, are able to profit handsomely as manufacturers drive up the price and aggressively purchase the fish scales. It turns out that fish scales can be used to make pearl essence, the sole raw material for artificial jewelry.
