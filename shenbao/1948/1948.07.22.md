The discussion of the general budget proposal began in the morning, including: (1) The budget under the jurisdiction of the National Assembly Secretariat was passed according to the review opinions. (2) The budget for the Office of the President was slightly increased after deducting from the review opinions.

(News of opposition to the Committee for Mobilization for Suppressing Rebellion and National Reconstruction paying committee members is published on page two.)

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Legislative Yuan resolved in the secret meeting on the 21st to extend the current session to this weekend. The remaining agenda items will be discussed and completed as much as possible before the 24th. In addition, the Legislative Yuan scheduled the fifth secret meeting for 9 a.m. on the 22nd to continue discussing the national general budget proposal. At 3 p.m., an extraordinary meeting will be held to publicly discuss and vote on the President's nomination of Lin Yunkai as Auditor-General of the Control Yuan, requesting approval. The 22nd plenary session will likely be held consecutively on the 23rd.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Wang Shixian, a legislator from the Democratic Socialist Party, recently expressed his views on the Legislative Yuan's handling of the budget proposal, believing that the review process has been very successful. He also advocated that the Legislative Yuan should "follow the example of the U.S. Congress—Congress has the power to investigate the administrative efficiency of executive departments"—and organize an institution similar to the U.S. Congressional Investigation Committee to investigate the government's budget in terms of: (1) Whether efforts have been made to limit issuance in terms of revenue to comply with the Legislative Yuan's policy of increasing tax revenue and freezing issuance during the budget review. (2) Whether the work of streamlining redundant agencies and tightening expenditures has been carried out and completed in terms of expenditure. (3) Whether the military budget, which accounts for half of the total budget, has been entirely used to improve the lives of soldiers and enhance combat power. (4) That the funds used by citing the Provisional Clauses of the Constitution should not be cited without limitation.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Interpellation on the Reason for Issuing Large Denomination Banknotes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The Legislative Yuan passed a temporary motion by more than 100 members in a secret meeting on the 21st, deciding to submit a written interpellation to the Executive Yuan, asking it to respond to the reasons for the sudden issuance of large denomination banknotes. The members generally believed that there was no need to issue large denomination banknotes recently, and questioned why the Central Bank took this action that affected people's minds and fueled market unrest.

### Handling of Compensation Materials and Other Matters; Executive Yuan Appoints a Small Group for Review; Measures to Encourage Overseas Chinese Investment Approved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] During the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 21st, the "Case of Sending Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Types, Quantities, and Handling of Compensation and Other Materials" was discussed. The case was proposed by the Budget Review Committee of the Executive Yuan, suggesting that the Executive Yuan send personnel to thoroughly investigate the types, quantities, and handling of compensation materials, enemy and puppet materials, surplus materials, and relief materials. The case was discussed for a long time. As a result, Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Sun Yueqi, He Yingqin, Lei Zhen, and others were selected to form a small review committee to conduct preliminary review, with Vice President Zhang Lisheng as the convener.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] In order to attract overseas Chinese capital and introduce it into legitimate production industries, the government has drafted measures to encourage overseas Chinese to invest in domestic production industries. The measures have been discussed and reviewed by the Executive Yuan multiple times and were approved at the routine Executive Yuan meeting on the 21st. According to the Export-Import Management Committee, in order to attract large amounts of overseas Chinese capital, it has drafted specific measures. The original measures included three items: (1) Measures for Applying for Import Permits for Industrial Raw Materials and Parts; (2) Measures for Applying for Import Permits for Foreign Capital Investment in Production Industries; (3) Supplementary Measures for Overseas Chinese Returning to Invest in Production Industries to Apply for Import Permits. After discussion, they have been merged into one, with special emphasis on overseas Chinese capital returning to invest in production industries. The scope of so-called production industries includes industrial mining, industry, transportation, agriculture, processing, and export industries. However, in order to prevent overseas Chinese capital from becoming hot money and causing trouble in the market, and to prevent the abuse of using overseas Chinese names to engage in business for profit, certain necessary restrictive clauses have been included in the measures. However, compared to the past, when we treated overseas Chinese capital imports according to ordinary import measures, it was a major loss for national production industries. After the implementation of these measures, it will be convenient for overseas Chinese and beneficial to the country. Therefore, some people attach great importance to this.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The allocation of Japanese reparation goods to private enterprises, which was previously decided to be calculated in U.S. dollars, had its calculation method approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 21st. When private factories allocate Japanese reparation goods, the conversion of U.S. dollars to legal tender is calculated as the sum of the official exchange rate of the U.S. dollar plus the price of the exchange settlement certificate. Industrial and commercial figures had requested that the conversion of U.S. dollars to legal tender be the official exchange rate of the U.S. dollar plus half the price of the exchange settlement certificate, but the political affairs meeting did not adopt it. It is also learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has issued a notice to all private factories to expedite the allocation procedures.

### Coin Redemption Measures; Hankou Gold Control Bureau Requests Revision by Ministry of Finance

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 21st] The Hankou Gold Control Bureau recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a revision of the coin redemption measures, advocating that the National Bank provide a guarantee, refer to the actual value, collect and store (freeze) coins from the people, prohibit them from circulating in the market, and return the original value after financial stability. The proposal emphasizes that the harm of coins is now far greater than that of gold. If the legal principle of one-to-one exchange is adhered to, it is tantamount to a great irony.

### Our Country Obtains U.S. Military Aid; Delayed Due to European Situation

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Authoritative sources say that due to the worsening situation in Europe, China will face an indefinite delay in obtaining U.S. military assistance. Although the U.S. Congress has passed a "unrestricted" $125 million military aid fund for China, China is still encountering the problem of where to purchase arms and equipment. According to informed sources, the State Department has formulated "priority" regulations regarding China's needs and the possible arms shipments of Western European countries in the Brussels Treaty. Therefore, if the European situation becomes more serious, the State Department may divert arms and equipment to Europe. President Truman has ordered the U.S. armed forces not to announce any surplus equipment in the future. This means that any equipment that the armed forces can sell to China must come from existing stocks. The U.S. military will inevitably need to replace equipment at that time and will have to ask China for the value of the replacement equipment.

### Newly Appointed President of the Supreme Court; Xie Yingzhou Arrives at the Court to Take Office; Measures for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment to Be Drafted by the Ministry of Justice

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Xie Yingzhou, the newly appointed President of the Supreme Court, arrived at the court on the morning of the 21st to take office. The handover ceremony was held at 10 a.m. Former President Xia Qin had left Nanjing for Beiping before and the handover was overseen by Judge Ye Zaijun. After the ceremony, reporters asked President Xie for his views on the work of the Supreme Court in the future. He replied: "I mentioned the four words 'openness and impartiality' during the meeting and will use this attitude to establish internal credibility, so that employees can work with peace of mind, thereby increasing the efficiency of judgment. The court currently has a large backlog of cases, and I will first devote myself to this. In the future, I will also pay attention to speedy judgments, so that justice is not lost. The Supreme Court is the final instance, so the judgments should be especially cautious. If a case is delayed for three or five years, even if the judgment is fair, it is not fair." The reporter also asked about the issue of compensation for wrongful imprisonment. He replied: "This system has long been implemented in many European and American countries, and our country has also been actively planning recently. The Ministry of Judicial Administration will draft the measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for review. The implementation of this system can reduce the occurrence of wrongful imprisonment, and at the same time, those who have suffered injustice can receive some compensation, so it is an excellent policy, but it will increase a national debt." It is also learned that Wu Xuehuang will be appointed as the Chief Clerk of the court. Wu is currently in Guangdong and has not yet arrived in Nanjing; the position of Chief Clerk is temporarily held by Jin Shiding.

(2) The defending troops in Dingxing and Xushui, parts of the 31st Provisional Division, due to historical relationships with the Tan Department, had previously received point-line defense training from the Japanese. Their current combat concepts could not be flexibly applied to adapt to the needs of today's bandit suppression battles. Therefore, the "clearing the fields" policy could not be completed in a timely manner, and it is estimated that they have suffered considerable losses. Details are being investigated and reported.

[Another Dispatch] According to the North China Suppression Headquarters: (1) The Guojun troops moving south along the Pingbao section recaptured Songlin Store, Gaobeidian, and the surrounding strongholds along the line on the 20th. Currently, a strong corps is continuing to advance towards the area north of Xushui and west of Xincheng to capture the main force of the bandits, conducting horizontal sweeps.

[Our Baoding 21st Dispatch] The military announced: A large corps of Guojun troops rushing to aid the Pingbao Line approached the outskirts of Dingxing at noon on the 21st and continued south, engaging in fierce fighting with the bandit troops blocking their advance.

The main forces of the 2nd, 6th, 3rd, and 4th columns of the bandits crossed Dingxing north along the southern section of the Pingbao Line. There will be a decisive battle in the mountainous areas of Zhuo (County), Lai (Shui), and Yi (County). On the banks of the Cao River north of Baoding, there is still a bandit brigade stationed to guard against Guojun troops from Baoding launching an attack. Baoding City is isolated and in distress. Last night, there was no gunfire all night, presenting a calm before the storm.

Tension Again on the Pingjin and Pinggu Routes

Editorial

### The Dawn of Korea's Independence and Unification —Celebrating Dr. Syngman Rhee's Election as the First President—

After the promulgation of the new Korean Constitution and Government Organization Law, the National Assembly voted on the 20th to elect the President and Vice President. Dr. Syngman Rhee, leader of the Democratic Party, received an absolute majority of 180 votes and was elected as the first president of the newly emerging Korea. Mr. Yi Si-yeong was also elected as Vice President with 133 votes. Hoping that Korea will soon establish an independent democratic government, whether for the future of the Korean people or for the long-term plan of peace in East Asia, we feel infinite joy upon hearing the news of the election of Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee as the first president.

Korea, also known as Joseon, is a large peninsula that juts out from the southeast of the Asian continent, located between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. It faces the Pacific Ocean (formerly known as the Sea of Japan) to the east, the coast of our country to the west, the Korea Strait to the south facing Kyushu, Japan, and is bordered by the Yalu River and the Tumen River to the north, bordering Northeast China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Korea's geographical location can be said to be a "bridge" between the Asian continent and the Japanese archipelago, and also a "bridge" between China and Japan, and China and the Soviet Union. Korea is indeed a major cornerstone of peace and security in East Asia, and its relationship with China is most close in terms of politics, economy, and culture. However, in the past, China failed to fulfill its responsibility to maintain this cornerstone, and instead, Korea's importance in East Asia attracted the covetousness of its neighbors. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 can be regarded as struggles between Japan and Russia for this cornerstone. Although Korean revolutionary patriots constantly struggled for independence and freedom, Japan's influence in Korea, after the above two wars, had already taken deep root, causing Korea to become a Japanese protectorate. By 1910, Korea was formally annexed into Japan's territory. From then on, the so-called Joseon and the so-called Korea became merely geographical names!

However, from 1910 until Japan's surrender in 1945, the Korean people never willingly accepted Japanese rule during these thirty-five years. Korean revolutionary patriots launched uprisings repeatedly to fight for independence and freedom, pressing forward wave upon wave, never ceasing, and staging countless tragic and moving stories. The most famous of these was the "March 1st Independence Movement" of March 1, 1919, also known as the "March 1st Revolution," which can be called the most heroic revolutionary movement of a weak nation in the world. The leader of the Korean people's arduous struggle was Dr. Syngman Rhee, who was elected as the first president of Korea the day before yesterday. With his call, the Korean people responded enthusiastically and unanimously supported Dr. Rhee as the first president of the Korean Provisional Government. However, due to the lack of secrecy and the harsh rule of the Japanese imperialists, this revolutionary movement eventually failed, forcing Dr. Rhee into exile overseas. However, Dr. Rhee has led the Korean people's revolution for thirty years as if it were one day, and continues to fight for Korea's freedom and independence. Dr. Rhee's revolutionary spirit is truly admirable. Not only do the Korean people regard Dr. Rhee as the revolutionary leader of the nation, but all countries in the world also regard Dr. Rhee as a symbol of Korea's independence, unification, democracy, and strength.

Dr. Syngman Rhee returned to Korea from the United States last April and has been working on the Korean renaissance movement on the ground. He stopped in Shanghai on the way, and the people of China and Korea expressed their warm welcome. Dr. Rhee's words, demeanor, and his fighting spirit are still deeply etched in our minds. Dr. Rhee's ambition is not only to fight for Korea's freedom and independence, but also to promote the relationship between China and Korea. He firmly believes that China and Korea are as close as brothers, with a relationship as close as lips and teeth. Only through the sincere cooperation between China and Korea can peace in the Far East be maintained and any kind of aggressive war be prevented. His foresight is the same as the views of the Chinese government and people. Our country has always sympathized with the Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence, and has not only worked hard to promote the diplomatic relations between China and Korea, but has also supported Korea's demands in practice in order to realize the wishes of the Korean people. For example, in 1943, when the heads of state of China, Britain, and the United States met at the Cairo Conference, our country firmly advocated that the Allies should not only force Japan to surrender unconditionally, but also assist Korea in realizing its independence and freedom. The issuance of the Cairo Declaration was like a bright light for Korean revolutionary leaders in exile overseas, illuminating the glorious future of Korea's independence and making them even more excited and hardworking. Especially the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing, under the encouragement of the Cairo Declaration, more actively celebrated its renaissance movement.

However, after Japan's surrender and the Allied victory, Korea not only failed to immediately realize its hope, but its country was misled by power politics. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Three Countries in December 1945 even decided that Korea should first be jointly administered by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for five years, and then be allowed to be independent. During this period, Korea would be divided into two regions, occupied and administered separately by the United States and the Soviet Union. This declaration clearly violated the principle of national self-determination. For Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it was tantamount to going back on their promises to Korea, which not only greatly disappointed the Korean people, but also deeply regretted us Chinese for the failure to implement the Cairo Declaration. Later, the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union deepened the division of Korea, resulting in the current situation of almost dividing the country. This is not only a tragedy for the Korean people, but also a misfortune for the Far East. The United Nations should not allow this situation to continue to develop, and had to find another way to clarify the situation in Korea. Therefore, it was decided to hold a general election in the US-occupied area of ​​southern Korea first, organize a National Assembly, formulate a democratic constitution, and elect a President and Vice President. Then, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, an independent and democratic Korean government would be established. Although this measure is currently limited to southern Korea, everything is being carried out under the supervision of the United Nations delegation, which can not only be regarded as legal, but also as an expression of Korean public opinion. All those who hope for Korea's independence and unification should naturally be pleased with the birth of the new Korean government, especially the election of Dr. Syngman Rhee as the first president.

In short, we hope that after the establishment of the Korean government, it can use southern Korea as the starting point for unification, and call on all Korean people to unite and not be used by power politics, so that Korea can gradually be unified and regain its glory. We would like to use these words to congratulate Dr. Syngman Rhee! To congratulate the Korean people!

### The Yangtze River Flood Situation Is Increasingly Worrying, Xue Dubi Submits an Emergency Motion to the Political Affairs Council, Decision to Have the Ministry of Water Resources and the Hubei Provincial Government Quickly Draft Measures

[Our Nanjing 21st Dispatch] In recent days, the water level of the Yangtze River has risen sharply, and various ports along the river have suffered from floods. On July 20, the water level in Hankou had reached 26.48 meters, which is 1.80 meters higher than the highest water level last year, and the trend is continuing to rise. Chongqing rose by 9.84 meters on July 18 and 19. On the 20th, the water head reached Wanxian, increasing the water level by 4.58 meters. It will reach Hankou in about three days. If there are no other factors, the water level in Hankou may increase to more than 27.00 meters on the 23rd and 24th. According to a telegram from the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the flood season is still long, and it is still impossible to predict how high the water level will rise in the future. Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Resources, submitted an emergency motion at the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 21st, calling for the speedy implementation of measures to reduce the flood disaster in Hubei to save the disaster. After discussion, it failed to pass. It was also decided that the Ministry of Water Resources, together with the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hankou Municipal Government, should draft other measures with reference to the said measures. These measures were drafted and implemented during the major flood in Hankou in 1938. There are no revisions in terms of addressing the root cause. The main points are as follows: (A) Yangtze River (1) All dikes and embankments in the area between the main dikes that obstruct the flow of water must be notified in advance that their height must not exceed the water level height that should exist at a Hankou water level of 48 feet. (2) For the third-class main dikes protecting local farmland below Hankou, and the Wancheng and Zhibing dikes on both sides of Taipingkou below Chenglingji, their height must not exceed the water level height that should exist at a Hankou water level of 49 feet. (3) When the Hankou water level rises above 49 feet, the Jinkou sluice gate will be opened immediately to divert water into the Luhuo and Xiliang lakes in the Jinshui watershed. (4) If it is still not enough to lower the rising water level, effective emergency measures should be considered for the following dikes: (1) Du City, Fuxing, He, and other embankments in Hanyang County below the Xindi on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the Weihu Dike to divert water to the lakes west of Yixi. (2) On both sides of the Hudu Estuary, the Daxing and Luocheng embankments on the west side of the eastern and western embankments of the Ouchikou entrance, and the eastern and western embankments of the Chen Gong embankments on both sides of the Tiaoxian Estuary, to divert water into Dongting Lake. (3) The Dulong Dike on the north bank below Hankou to divert water into Datang Lake. (4) Jinkou Long Dike. (5) The major diversion of Fankou to Liangzi, Hengshan, and other lakes. (B) Han River (1) During the Hankou flood season, if necessary, effective emergency measures should be taken for the following dikes: (1) Xiaojianghu Dike on the south bank above Shayang. (2) The Xiang Sheng Main Dike west of the Dongjing River above Yuekou below Shayang to guide water into Changhu or the Hei Nan Xiao Main Dike east of it to divert water into Paihu Lake. (3) Embankments and embankments with mountains on both sides below Hanchuan. (C) The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has drafted four concise implementation steps as follows: (1) When the Hankou water level reaches 48 feet, all related strongholds should be dug up and released. (2) When the Hankou water level reaches 47 feet, those responsible for excavation should have everything prepared. (3) Before the end of June, each county should register the names of the personnel responsible for excavation in each area and the names of the embankments that should be excavated and submit them. (4) After the Hankou water level reaches 48 feet, if it is found that the embankments that should be opened have not yet encountered water, the county government in charge should be responsible.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Guangdong Provincial Journalists Association expressed strong dissatisfaction with the request of the members of the Pacification Mobilization Committee and the National Assembly representatives to be paid, and now specifically sent a telegram to the whole country calling for unanimous criticism.

However, the committee members and representatives have not fulfilled their duties to the public and are only afraid of being behind others for personal gain. All the committee members should be models for the people, but now they are like this, which is chilling. Why should the 450 million farmers have such Pacification Committee members?

Meng will go to Beijing within days to visit Yu Hongjun and discuss in detail the solution to Henan's financial problems in the future. In addition, after this fall of Kaifeng, the essence has been completely lost. According to Meng's estimate, the funds required for relief and reconstruction work, calculated in terms of time currency, cannot be less than 10 trillion. Today, Henan is full of war, the local area is dilapidated, and there is no source of taxation. In the future, the provincial finances will rely entirely on central government subsidies.

### Taiwan Sugar Company Studies - To Improve Sugar Production Technology

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] This reporter has recently learned from the Resources Committee that since the successful trial of the intermediate juice carbonation method by the Taiwan Sugar Company, the technical personnel of each factory have recently made three achievements in the research on sugar production technology: (1) The hot air sugar production method of the Miaoli Sugar Factory. The research motivation is based on the fact that the existing vacuum pan sugar production equipment is too large and complex, and cannot be adopted by large sugar factories. However, the sugar production method in our country takes too long and the output is not much. The hot air sugar production method will make a significant contribution to the sugar production industry in inland areas with inconvenient transportation. (2) The Taiwan Sugar Industry Experimental Institute has successfully produced edible sugar from molasses again. The Nanxing Sugar Factory will cooperate with the Institute to use the new method to produce a large amount of sugar. (3) The Dalin Sugar Factory has invented a scientific fertilizer manufacturing method based on past experience and theoretical research on increasing sugarcane production and cultivating fertilizer. The raw materials are composed of sugarcane leaves, sugarcane tails, sugar mud, and human excrement.

### To Avoid the Berlin Crisis Leading to War - Washington Decides on Three Principles - Willing to Seek Solutions Through Diplomacy - U.S. Military Commander in Germany, Clay, Summoned Back Home to Report

[This newspaper] Washington, 21st broadcast: At a press conference, Marshall replied to reporters' questions about the possibility of a "war crisis" in Berlin, saying that to avoid the tragedy of war, the United States would take all measures to reach an acceptable agreement with the Soviet army in Berlin. However, the Secretary of State continued, the United States "will not be suppressed or coerced in any way" when reaching an agreement.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] State Department officials confirmed that the U.S. government has decided on three policies to deal with the Berlin crisis in order to find a peaceful solution. The contents are as follows: (1) Absolutely not to be kicked out of Berlin. If the Soviet Union attempts to use force, the United States will resist with force together with other Western powers. (2) Use all diplomatic methods, including direct exchange of views between the highest levels of the United States and the Soviet Union, to seek a peaceful solution to the Berlin crisis. (3) Be cautious in words and deeds to avoid further aggravating the crisis and blocking the path to compromise. It is generally believed that the United States will not use force to break through the Berlin blockade. Although senior officials here hope that the crisis can be resolved peacefully, they also said that if shooting occurs, the responsibility should be borne by the Soviet side.

[Reuters, London, 21st] Clay, the U.S. military governor in Germany, left Germany yesterday to return to the United States to discuss the situation in Berlin with the State Department. Before leaving, he met with British Governor Robertson, French Governor Koenig, and the prime ministers of the eleven states in West Germany to discuss the political reforms in West Germany. According to relevant sources, when Clay and Koenig talked privately about the Berlin issue, the latter stated that the French government did not support forcing the Soviet Union to lift the Berlin blockade by military means. Clay asked what kind of method France supported. Koenig replied that France hoped to restore the four-power talks on Germany and believed that the talks might resolve the current dispute. It is expected that Clay's return to the United States will report the French attitude to the State Department.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] According to well-informed sources, General Clay's return to Washington is to discuss drafting an Allied note in response to the Soviet Union on the current situation in Berlin. The content of the reply is said to be (1) rejecting the Soviet note and reaffirming the non-recognition of the legitimacy of the Berlin blockade; (2) proposing a broad four-power consultation on the Berlin issue, the final form of the proposal has not yet been decided. The so-called "broad" means that if the issues previously considered to be related to the entire Germany, such as the four-power basis, are discussed, then the Berlin administration issues such as currency reform can also be discussed. It is now hoped that this proposal can be a compromise solution and accepted by the Soviet Union; (3) the reply does not mention any possibility of direct negotiations by the four foreign ministers; (4) as a last resort, the article will suggest that the case be submitted to the United Nations for mediation.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton declared today that President Truman should explain the extent to which the United States and the Soviet Union are approaching combat at a special session of Congress next week. When asked how to deal with the Berlin issue, Eaton replied that we have the right to remain in Berlin and are acting accordingly. Eaton also said that the President convened a special session of Congress only to discuss domestic issues as the reason, but what the United States is currently facing is the Berlin issue. The Berlin issue is the most important not only for the United States but for the whole world. This is a conflict between Christ and the devil, between freedom and slavery. I have been in close contact with Secretary of State Marshall before the Berlin issue became serious last week.

### Western European Five Countries Reach Agreement - On Steps to Take Against the Soviet Union in the Future - Bevin Returns to England to Prepare to Draft a New Note

[Reuters, London, 21st] After returning to London from The Hague to attend the consultation committee meeting of the Western European Union, Foreign Secretary Bevin launched diplomatic agencies today to ensure an early end to the Berlin crisis. Shortly after arriving in London, Bevin met with U.S. Ambassador Douglas for a secret talk of about an hour. Bevin almost informed Tao in detail about the process of the Hague conference, and Tao reported the latest instructions from Washington. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman at a press conference at noon, Bevin has told the U.S. Ambassador that the new note to the Soviet Union should not be delayed for too long. An external spokesman also confirmed that the five countries of the Western European Union had reached an agreement in The Hague on the steps to be taken in negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Bevin agreed with the U.S. argument that the wording of the new note to the Soviet Union should be as severe as possible, but should not be in the nature of an ultimatum. Bevin is scheduled to meet again this afternoon with French Ambassador Massigli, British Foreign Office German Director Strang, and the permanent committee on the Berlin crisis formed by the U.S. and French ambassadors to the UK. It is said that a new note to the Soviet Union will be drafted at a meeting to be held today and tomorrow. Observers believe that France will continue to firmly refuse to participate in any diplomatic action that can be regarded by the Soviet Union as an ultimatum. At the meeting in The Hague, Foreign Minister Bidault strongly advocated convening a four-power conference to discuss the entire German issue. The current task of the London Three-Nation Standing Committee is to find a way to compromise the views of France and the United States and maintain the position that the four-power meeting cannot be held before the Berlin blockade is lifted. Although the new note to the Soviet Union will maintain this position, it is expected to attach some basis for compromise so that the deadlock can be broken.

### End of The Hague Conference - Concise Communiqué Issued

France Suggests Expanding Independence Without Vote

[United Press, The Hague, 20th] The Standing Committee of the Western European Union concluded its two-day meeting here today and issued a communiqué stating that "the Foreign Ministers of the five countries, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, reviewed the international situation, particularly the German problem, and were in complete agreement. They resolved to cooperate with countries sharing the same ideals to safeguard their political independence, territorial integrity, and various cultural systems. The work of the Standing Committee since its establishment has been rigorously reviewed, and it will continue to strengthen cooperation in economic, cultural, military, and colonial affairs in accordance with the Brussels Treaty, to promote the highest degree of unity among the five countries."

[Associated Press, The Hague, 20th] French Foreign Minister Bidault today proposed expanding the Western European Union of five nations to include all of Europe, potentially including the Soviet Union. This proposal is an informal invitation to the Soviet Union to abandon the Cold War and jointly participate in a European federation with Western Europe. The British and Belgian Foreign Ministers immediately expressed agreement in principle but pointed out that France's proposal was impractical, and suggested that such a "dream" be realized by non-governmental organizations.

### The French Political Crisis Is Expected To Be Resolved Quickly - Marie Is Tasked To Form A New Cabinet - Preparing to Establish a Center-Right Coalition Government

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 21st Broadcasting: Former Radical Socialist Minister of Justice Marie has agreed to attempt to form a new cabinet and declared that he will soon begin negotiations with various parties.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] President Auriol today informed Socialist elder statesman Blum that he had chosen former Radical Party Minister of Justice Marie as the next Prime Minister, pending Marie's acceptance. Auriol summoned Marie to the Presidential Palace at 10:00 this morning. If Marie agrees to form a cabinet, a formal announcement is expected this afternoon. Blum has indicated to Auriol that appointing a member of the Radical Party as Prime Minister could alleviate public fears about the rise of the Gaullist movement. It is believed that the National Assembly will grant Marie a vote of confidence, thus avoiding a general election that could give the Gaullist movement an opportunity to gain power. According to the Socialist, Radical, and Popular Republican parties, they are willing to participate in a coalition cabinet led by Marie. Furthermore, they believe that forming a center-right cabinet is preferable to holding another National Assembly election that could give De Gaulle the opportunity to govern. Foreign Minister Bidault, who has just returned from The Hague, has also expressed support for Marie as the new Prime Minister.

### Lie Arrives in England En Route to France to Inspect UN General Assembly Site

[Reuters, Southampton, 21st] UN Secretary-General Lie, aboard the "Queen Elizabeth," arrived here today from New York and will proceed to Paris to inspect the Palais de Chaillot, the site of the next UN General Assembly in September. After disembarking, Lie transferred to a ship bound for Cherbourg in Normandy. He declined to answer questions regarding the Berlin situation but acknowledged that the situation there was indeed serious. He also stated that, although the Charter allows the Soviet Union to make a statement to the UN regarding its actions in Berlin, the Western powers have no intention of taking such action. The Palais de Chaillot has been under renovation for seven months, and most of the work was completed last week.

### US and Canada Send Representatives to Western European Union Military Committee - Establishment of the North Atlantic Defense System

[Reuters, London, 20th] Canadian and American military experts have arrived in London to participate in the talks of the Permanent Military Committee of the Western European Union. They came to London at the invitation of the Permanent Committee of the Western European Union. It is said that the number of people is not large. Diplomatic circles here believe that the participation of the United States and Canada in the Western European Union Military Committee indicates that the North Atlantic defense system has been established, and Western European powers have therefore been assured of military assistance from across the Atlantic. The Western European Union conference in The Hague and the close military ties between Western Europe and North America have served as the basis for the next action taken by Britain, the United States, and France against the Soviet Union.

### Opening of the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress - Tito Receives Enthusiastic Support from the People - Many Soviet Representatives Stationed in Yugoslavia Return to Moscow with Their Families

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 21st] At the Communist Party Congress, convened here today, all party members unanimously elected Tito as the chairman of the congress. The 2,344 delegates from the Yugoslav Federal Republic who attended the congress cheered unanimously after Tito was elected chairman, calling him "Our Hero." Others who were recently condemned by the Cominform, such as Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, Minister of Interior Ranković, and Minister Without Portfolio Djilas, were also elected as members of the Party's Executive Committee.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 21st] According to the official Athens News Agency today, many Soviet representatives stationed in Belgrade, carrying their families, flew south to return home.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 21st] The Sixth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party opened here on the 21st. When Marshal Tito formally announced the opening of the meeting, the entire venue responded with enthusiastic cheers. Tito stated that the Yugoslav Communist Party was stronger than before, that the party was united, and that the people were firmly behind the party. He felt more confident than ever before. Regarding the recent actions taken by the Cominform against the Yugoslav Communist Party, Tito acknowledged that the current congress was being held under special circumstances and said, "We are very proud of our independence and freedom of thought. We must cherish this independence and freedom and promote it." National flags were displayed throughout Belgrade to celebrate the opening of the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress. Huge portraits of Tito were displayed at major intersections, along with inspiring slogans. According to the Yugoslav official news agency Tanjug, the current Yugoslav Communist Party Congress will demonstrate the nation's support for the Yugoslav leader. The Yugoslav Communist Party Congress is well aware of the Cominform's inappropriate attitude towards the Yugoslav Communist Party and will formulate policies to strengthen the country's strength and cope with future challenges. Observers believe that the most important significance of this Yugoslav Communist Party Congress is to show whether the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslav Communist Party have shaken the internal lines of the Yugoslav Communist Party. One of the agenda items of the Congress is to provide a formal response to the Cominform by Kidrič.

### US P-80 Shooting Star Fighter Squadron - Transferred to German Base to Increase Defense - Sixteen Aircraft Arrive in England, Seventy-Five on the Way

[Reuters, Stornoway, Hebrides, 20th] Sixteen US P-80 Shooting Star jet fighters, after crossing the Atlantic from the United States, landed in the UK for the first time. After staying in England for two or three days, they will fly to Wiesbaden in the American-occupied zone of Germany. Another 75 of the same type of fighters are scheduled to arrive in Glasgow on August 4th aboard the aircraft carrier "Sicily" and will then be transferred to Germany. Among them, 50 are fully equipped and ready to take off, while the remaining 25 have not yet been assembled. These aircraft belong to the 36th Fighter Squadron of the US Air Force, originally stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, and are now being transferred to a base in Germany. After all the aircraft are fully assembled in Glasgow, they will fly directly to Germany in formation. Their pilots and maintenance personnel, 378 in total, are scheduled to arrive in Glasgow on August 6th aboard a US transport ship. A few days ago, 60 US B-29 Superfortress aircraft arrived in England in preparation for training flights in Germany. It is expected that Shooting Star fighters will also participate in these exercises.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] The French government has submitted inquiries to Washington and London, requesting a detailed explanation of the purpose of the long-term stationing of American Flying Fortresses in England. It is believed here that the "showing off of military might" by American aircraft will only increase the difficulty of reaching a compromise with the Soviet Union.

### US's Main Goal in Attending the Danube River Conference - Seeking to Restore East-West Trade

[US Information Service, Washington, 20th] The State Department announced today that the US delegation to the Danube River Conference, scheduled to be held in Belgrade on the 30th of this month, will be headed by US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Cannon, with the Director of the State Department's Transportation and Communications Division, Swedes, as his deputy.

### Japanese Cabinet Teetering - Katayama Reiterates His Call for Dissolving Parliament - Yoshida Demands the Cabinet Resign Immediately

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Social Democratic Party Chairman Katayama, on the 21st, spoke about the reasons for requesting the dissolution of the Diet, saying: "Rather than the current cabinet resigning en masse, it would be better to consider dissolving the Diet. I have repeatedly mentioned this, because under the current atmosphere of preparing for dissolution, it is meaningless to deliberate important bills even in a temporary Diet. It is better to dissolve it decisively at this time. As for the timing of the dissolution, there seems to be a difference of opinion between Yoshida and myself. After returning to Tokyo, I will discuss it with him and decide on it. I think late August to early September would be appropriate. The Social Democratic Party rejects the extreme left and does not lean towards the extreme right, and will display its true face as a socialist party."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Democratic Liberal Party President Yoshida issued a statement on the 21st demanding the immediate resignation of the current cabinet. The gist of the statement was: "The Yoshida Cabinet has no clear policy, and allied parties are also wavering. Furthermore, whenever any problem arises, the Ashida Cabinet always seeks to get through it by adopting an attitude of guidance from related parties (implicitly referring to MacArthur Headquarters). However, such measures violate the principles of democratic politics. The current cabinet should put aside personal feelings and strive to revive the country and should resign en masse immediately."

### Bernadotte Begins To Exercise His Power - To Stop New Conflicts in the Holy Land - Hostilities Must Cease or Sanctions Will Be Implemented

After the Syrian forces returned fire, the Jewish artillery fire subsided somewhat. According to reports from Damascus, there were demonstrations by the public in both places against the truce in the Holy Land.

### North Korea to Establish a Separate Government - Kim Koo and Others Express Opposition - South Korea Invites North Korean Representatives to Participate in the National Assembly

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 21st] Kim Kyu-sik, who went to Pyongyang in April to participate in the joint conference of North and South Korean political parties, also issued a statement on the 19th, opposing North Korea's unilateral promulgation of a constitution and organization of a government.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] (Delayed) Pyongyang Radio previously broadcast that North Korea was scheduled to establish a "People's Government" on August 25th. The Korean Independence Party has already issued a statement firmly opposing it, but party leader Kim Koo had not made any statement. But on the 18th, Kim finally broke his silence and expressed his opposition.

Kim Koo believes that the establishment of a separate government in North Korea is contrary to the spirit of the joint conference of North and South Korean political parties held in Pyongyang in April of this year, so he does not agree to it. This opinion, which was expressed on the eve of the South Korean presidential election, has attracted great attention from all parties.

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] French representative Poncet, head of the UN agency's delegation to Korea, declared today that the government of southern Korea had been established after Li Seung-man was elected president and Li Shi-young was elected vice president. However, the question of recognition is therefore that the United States has always demanded freedom of navigation on equal terms for all countries on the Danube River, non-discriminatory laws and regulations, no obstacles to navigation in the main waterways, and no collection of tolls or other fees other than the cost of developing and maintaining the waterways. In addition, the fleets in Germany and Austria are currently unable to operate due to the division of the Danube River into two. The actions of these ships depend entirely on the free and unrestricted traffic of the entire waterway. If these ships can be reused, the traffic on the waterway can be greatly increased. These ships can transport urgently needed industrial medicine and salt to Eastern Europe, and at the same time transport the most important industries of Eastern Europe back to Western Europe.

### Soviet Union Builds Naval Base in the Gulf of Finland - Porkkala Peninsula Becomes a Restricted Area

[Reuters, Stockholm, 21st] According to reports from the Finnish Porkkala Peninsula, which juts out into the Gulf of Finland and is close to Sweden, the Soviet Union is building a large-scale naval base on the peninsula, which was leased to the Soviet Union under the Finnish peace treaty. With this place and the Tallinn naval base on the other side of the Gulf of Finland, the Soviet Union can control the entrance to the Gulf of Finland and closely protect Kronshtadt, the main Soviet naval base outside Leningrad. According to fishermen near the Porkkala Peninsula, for three years, there have been large explosions every day. The Soviet Union has implemented strict control on the peninsula. The train from Helsinki to Turku must lower its iron windows and lock all doors after entering the Porkkala area. Since last winter, the authorities have banned ships from sailing on the Porkkala coast, and small boats disappear if they stray into the area. Soviet fast motorboats patrol the area constantly. The boats are black and have machine guns mounted on them. Coastal residents often call them "pirates."

### The US State of New Jersey Announces - Resumption of Wartime Civil Defense Organization - This Move Sufficiently Reflects the Severity of the International Situation

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] New Jersey Governor Driscoll announced today that he would resume the state's wartime civil defense organization, which is a reaction to the extremely deteriorating situation in the United States. Driscoll declared that due to the seriousness of the international situation, all civil defense organizations in New Jersey (including air defense teams) will be re-established. He also said that the governors had discussed the issue of civil defense organizations at a meeting in Portsmouth in June of this year, and at that time, American leaders had already foreseen that there would be a crisis in diplomacy this summer.

### US Orders Arrest of Communist Party - Seven Leaders Have Been Indicted - Another Twelve Have Also Been Charged

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Seven leaders of the American Communist Party, including National Committee Chairman Foster and Secretary-General Dennis, have been arrested here after being indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of engaging in subversive activities and released on $5,000 bail. Another five are being pursued by the FBI. In addition, twelve other communists have been sued under the 1940 Alien Registration Act for advocating the violent overthrow of the US government.

The maximum penalty under this law is a fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for ten years. It has never been invoked since its enactment. If it is invoked this time and a sentence is handed down, then hundreds of American Communist leaders will be treated similarly under current law. The Communist Party National Committee issued a statement after Foster and others were arrested, calling it "the American version of Hitler's Reichstag fire plot." It also accused President Truman of wanting to use the suppression of the Communist Party as his election strategy and to put Wallace's third party in a difficult situation. The latter is scheduled to convene a national convention in Philadelphia on the 23rd.

### More Than One Hundred Foreign Spies - Sneak into the US for Activities

Announced by a US State Department Official

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Amidst the Berlin crisis, a State Department official announced today that hundreds of foreign spies are taking advantage of the United Nations to sneak into the United States, and Washington and other places are in a state of "spy panic." Harold, Director of the State Department's Visa Office, reported to the Senate Immigration Committee today that a large number of dangerous people who were being watched by immigration authorities have now transformed themselves into official representatives of foreign governments in the United Nations' news, broadcasting, film, or intelligence departments. It is said that these people are sent by Iron Curtain countries to work for the United Nations and are openly coming to the United States with the sole purpose of doing their best to promote propaganda and harm the interests of the United States, so they pose a considerable threat to American security. Harold said that according to US law, people from communist countries are allowed to enter the United States only if they serve the United Nations and are limited to the location of the United Nations, but some people now transfer to other cities after entering the United States. Harold said that foreign government representatives to the United Nations cannot be barred from entering the country unless it can be proven that their entry would endanger public safety. The Senate Immigration Committee recently heard opinions from all parties on the issue of allowing foreigners to enter the United States. State Department officials who attended and expressed their opinions last week said that the problem of American visas has existed for a long time, and there are still some people who entered the United States under the League of Nations who have not left. Harold also said that the State Department has divided this issue into two parts for discussion: one is whether the United States can refuse to issue visas to United Nations Secretariat personnel and other people who come to the United States to engage in subversive activities or propaganda work; the other is whether the United States should refuse to issue visas. It is said that, so far, the State Department advocates suspending the issuance of visas to dangerous elements coming to the United States.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 20th] The Lake Success side is indignant at the US State Department official's claim that foreigners are using the United Nations as a tool to enter the United States for destructive work. United Nations Secretariat personnel immediately stated that if the United States is dissatisfied with the personnel of the United Nations working in the United States, it can be submitted to the United Nations through the US delegation. However, to date, US personnel stationed at the United Nations are also very surprised by this news from Washington and have written to the State Department's United Nations Bureau to inquire about the details of the matter.

### Saving the Public Utilities Crisis - Major Users of Water, Electricity, Etc. - Monthly Billing in Two Installments - National Bank Agrees to Lend Hundreds of Billions for Repayment in Two Months

[Report from This Newspaper] The heads of the city's major public utilities companies visited municipal authorities yesterday to seek salvation, as their losses had become too great due to the surge in the cost of living index, exchange rates, and raw material prices this month, and they were on the verge of collapse. It is learned that the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to temporarily remedy the situation by allowing the four public utilities, water, electricity, gas, and telephone, to bill major users (such as large companies and factories) twice a month, once each in the first and second halves of the month, in order to turn over funds. Meter readings will be taken on the 11th for the first half of the month and on the 26th for the second half of the month. In addition, the municipal government has contacted the National Bank for loans on behalf of the companies, and President Yu has agreed to lend hundreds of billions to the Inland Water Company, China General Edison Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, British Water Works, British Gas Company, and Wusong Gas Company, which will be repaid in two months. As for the China General Edison Company, because it owes 600 billion, it will need to wait until the accounts are audited before applying for a loan. As for the problems of transportation public utilities such as public buses and trams, the crux of the matter lies in gasoline and fuel oil, which the Public Utilities Bureau is studying to solve.

According to Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee visited the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday afternoon and intended to adjust the price of allocated coal again this month. Director Zhao requested that the original price be temporarily maintained this month to avoid increasing the cost of public utilities. Director Zhao said that the price of coal may not change this month, but the source of coal is indeed worrying. Since November 14th, only 12,000 tons of coal have been shipped from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. A telegram has been sent to the coal mines to expedite the supply.

### UNESCO Seeks Chinese Staff

Over 500 Applications Received

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper has reported several times on UNESCO's intention to recruit talent from China. According to Mr. Zhu Baoxian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the United Nations, the UNESCO headquarters is in Paris, so the original staff consisted mostly of British and French individuals due to geographical considerations. To ensure a more even distribution of staff by region, the organization will not renew contracts once they expire. At the same time, UNESCO is recruiting fifteen types of specialized talent, including administrative affairs personnel, in all member countries. Because China has had very few staff members in UNESCO in the past, there are more opportunities for allocated positions this time, roughly around twenty. However, applicants must be specialized talent in any of the fifteen fields. Applicants may request a detailed resume form from the Shanghai office and submit it, along with a letter of recommendation, by July 24 of this year. It is reported that the office has already received over five hundred letters of recommendation, but only about one hundred are qualified.

### Using Tap Water to Impersonate a Military Officer and Defraud People of Money

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Jianhong, a native of Hubei, is currently unemployed, so he had a whimsical idea. Wearing a major's uniform and accompanied by his girlfriend Wu Meiju, he wandered on various roads with fake medicine bottles filled with tap water. When he saw someone neatly dressed, he would bump shoulders with them and then throw the medicine bottle to the ground, smashing it. He would then falsely claim that the water was prepared by a certain large pharmacy, costing millions of yuan, and that the full price must be paid in compensation. Unexpectedly, at around ten o'clock the night before last, Chen and Wu were loitering at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Haining Road, performing their usual trick, when they were seen through by passersby. They were then turned over to the police, who took Chen and others to the Hongkou Police Station. Under questioning, Chen confessed that he was forced by livelihood to use this method to defraud people of money. He had done it several times in Nanjing. After coming to Shanghai, he had also done it five or six times. The police station charged him with impersonating a military officer and defrauding people of money, and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling.

### College Student Sues Her Biological Father; Ming Shiting Submits a Written Defense

Judge Huang Wenlan of the District Court, believing that the case involved direct blood relatives and wishing to avoid further damage to the father-daughter relationship, advised the two parties to settle the matter out of court. However, as of yesterday, the two sides remained deadlocked. The District Court has scheduled another hearing for tomorrow. Ming Shiting also submitted a written defense yesterday, stating that his daughter was being misled by others, had made excessive demands in the past, and had insulted the family.

### VIP Air Freights Drugs; People's Socialist Party-Nominated Legislator Wang Zhibin Interrogated at District Court

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the 18th of this month, the China National Aviation Corporation's "Overlord" plane arrived in Shanghai from Beiping at 3:40 p.m. After landing at Longhua Airport, customs inspectors and military police stationed at the airport approached to check the identities of the passengers and their luggage. One of the passengers, claiming to be legislator Wang Zhibin, carried two suitcases. One of the suitcases was filled with summer clothes, but a hidden compartment was discovered at the bottom of the suitcase. After managing to open the hidden compartment, a package sealed with sealing wax was found inside. At the time, Wang used his identity as a legislator to ask the inspectors not to inspect it, but his request was not allowed. When the paper package was opened, it was shockingly found to be high-quality opium, weighing ten and a half kilograms, equivalent to about 330 taels, with a value equivalent to more than 330 taels of gold. The inspectors, believing that he was highly suspicious, detained him. Wang remained calm and claimed that the two suitcases were entrusted to him by Mrs. Liu, a friend in Beiping, to be delivered to her husband, Liu Yunge, in Shanghai. He said that if they did not believe him, they could wait a while, and Liu Yunge would definitely come to pick him up. Before long, a person named Liu Yunge arrived at the airport, and the customs officials transferred Wang and Liu to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation along with the seized evidence.

Because Wang Zhibin claimed to be a legislator, the police bureau's investigation of the case was extremely careful. According to Liu Yunge's confession, he denied drug trafficking. He claimed that he was temporarily staying at the residence of Wang Zhibin's relatives at No. 1, Lane 38, Jiangxi South Road. Because he had entrusted Wang with seeking employment, Wang's brother-in-law was a manager at Jardine Matheson & Co. in Shanghai. Wang's sister instructed him to go to the airport on the afternoon of the 18th to pick up Wang, so he took Wang's sister's son (i.e., Wang's nephew) to greet him. This suitcase was not his, and if they did not believe him, they could call Beiping to investigate. After police detectives examined the clothes in the suitcase, they confirmed that they belonged to Wang Zhibin. They then turned to interrogate Wang, and Wang's confession changed again. He claimed that the two suitcases were entrusted to him by Xu Songer, a friend in Beiping, because he knew that he was going to Beijing for a meeting and asked him to bring them to Liu Yunge in Shanghai. During the investigation, a person named Wang Hanzhang, claiming to be Wang Zhibin's brother, came to visit. He was detained by the case handlers. Wang Hanzhang claimed that he had just arrived in Shanghai in early June and had come to inquire about the reason for his brother's arrest, but he did not know any other details.

To be cautious, the police bureau sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing for instructions the day before yesterday. On the same day, they received a reply stating that Wang Zhibin was indeed a legislator nominated by the People's Socialist Party, but had not yet registered. The police bureau, based on the reply, immediately transferred the suspect in the air transport drug trafficking case, Wang Zhibin and Liu Yunge, to the criminal court of the District Court for trial. Wang Hanzhang was granted bail because he was considered less suspicious.

### Rice Stored in Litai Warehouse Found Not to Be Illegal

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper reported on the Guo Guixuan rice hoarding case on July 10. It is now learned that the batch of rice was purchased by Tianjin Dingyi Company from Hankou to be sold in Tianjin. The original purchase was 5,000 bags and had a permit from the Ministry of Food. 4,100 bags had already been shipped to Tianjin. The last batch of 900 bags was forced to be unloaded in Shanghai's Litai Warehouse because the ship ran aground downstream of Nanjing, causing the permit to expire. 700 bags have already been sold, and the remaining 200 bags could not be sold because of their poor quality. The Economic Section of the police bureau sent personnel to investigate the warehouse on the 6th of this month, believing that there was hoarding, but it was actually a misunderstanding.

### Two Rice Shops Embezzle Ration Rice; Zhu Rende and Wu Peifu Collude for Profit; District Prosecutor's Office Completes Investigation and Files Public Prosecution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office has recently completed its investigation and filed a public prosecution in the case of Zhu Rende of Tongfeng Rice Shop, Xi Diansheng of Yuansheng Rice Shop (who is at large), and Wu Peifu and others, who were suspected of embezzlement of ration rice entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Association to be distributed to households. The indictment states that the Tongfeng Rice Shop opened by the defendant Zhu Rende and the Yuansheng Rice Shop opened by Xi Diansheng, who is at large, were both rice shops entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Food Rationing Association to distribute ration rice to households. The defendant Wu Peifu was the purchasing agent for Yuansheng Rice Shop. Before June, Zhu concealed 33 bags of ration rice that were unsold in the shop and did not report them to the Municipal Rationing Association. On June 28, he reported to the Municipal Rationing Association that he had 76 shi of American aid rice unsold. On June 29, he loaded 21 shi of the rice onto a cart and transferred it to Yuansheng Rice Shop. Citizens Jin Shiyuan and Lu Bingliang and others saw this, and because the shop often distributed inferior rice to residents and sold the American aid rice at a high price, they reported it to the North Sichuan Road Police Branch. The police branch sent police to investigate and seized 21 shi of American aid rice. The original rice bags (with English letters) had been changed to Yuansheng rice bags by Tongfeng Rice Shop, and they were busy transporting them out. Zhu and Wu were taken to the police station, and the police found 33 bags of ration rice that had not been reported in Tongfeng Rice Shop in addition to the 76 shi of unsold rice that had already been reported. The case was transferred to the procuratorate for investigation. The defendant Xi Diansheng could not be summoned. Zhu confessed at the police station that he had not reported the 33 bags of extra ration rice, and the police officers seized and sealed the rice as evidence. Regarding the 21 shi of American aid rice sold to Yuansheng Rice Shop, he claimed at the police station that the shop had exchanged 510 household purchase certificates from the current period for 51 shi of rice. At the District Prosecutor's Office, he changed his claim to exchanging 210 ration certificates. Wu also made the same statement. However, the rationing of household rice in June was stipulated to end on June 25, and Tongfeng Rice Shop still had rice unsold. Yuansheng Rice Shop, on the other hand, the number of rice received was consistent with the rice sold with the ration certificates. This was admitted by the defendants at the police station. Zhu's Tongfeng Rice Shop also returned the household purchase certificates to the Civil Affairs Association on June 28, and reported the 76 shi of unsold rice to the Municipal Rationing Association, with receipts and confirmation seals from the Civil Affairs Association as proof. The defendant received 510 expired ration certificates from Yuansheng, which could not be reported. Wu, who worked at Yuansheng Rice Shop, could not obtain 510 expired ration certificates after the end of the June household rice rationing. Their embezzlement is obvious. The defendants colluded with each other to change the American aid rice from Tongfeng to Yuansheng rice bags and transferred them privately. Based on the allegations of the plaintiffs, the defendants usually distributed inferior rice to residents and sold the American aid rice at a high price, which is not without basis. It is also obvious that they were seeking profits from their official duties. Zhu Rende and Wu Peifu have violated Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 1, Paragraph 1, Article 3, Item 6, and Article 5 of the revised regulations on punishing corruption. In addition, it was found that rice shops must report the remaining rice to the Civil Affairs Association in addition to returning the ration certificates. Zhu Rende's shop had 33 bags of extra rice in addition to the reported amount. The concealment of the unreported rice clearly indicated that it was accumulated by mixing in inferior rice and reducing the amount during rationing. Zhu Rende also has the crime of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the same regulations. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed.

### Trial Opens in Major General's Wife Murder Case; He Cannot Help But Burst into Tears Seeing Photos of the Tragic Death

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Xiwu, a former major general who worked at the Ninth Training Office of the Suzhou Traffic Police Training Class, went from Guangdong to Chongqing in 1943, and settled his wife, Lin Xinying, and son, Xiangchun, in Guangdong. Chen then married Zhou Liwen in Sichuan and took her to Nanjing, Suzhou, and other places. In April of this year, Chen resigned from his job and was unemployed. Lin took her son to Chen's cousin's house in Jiaxing to find her husband. Chen conspired with Tan Yumin, who was at large, to murder his first wife. Tan agreed to commit the crime because he had asked Chen to introduce him to a job. He purchased a fruit knife, and on May 16, Chen took Lin from Jiaxing to Shanghai. They got off at Longhua Station, where Tan was waiting. He led Lin to the riverbank west of the Zhongjia Tomb in Caohejing, where Tan stabbed Lin more than 20 times, killing her. The murderer fled. Later, the police station found clues in the deceased's bag and arrested Chen in Nanjing on the 6th of last month and sent him to the District Court. Yesterday, Judge Huang Guangyu opened the trial. The court showed Chen photos of Lin's tragic death after being stabbed. Chen burst into tears after seeing the photos and confessed, "Because Lin was still alive, it greatly hindered my future development..." The court adjourned the hearing because Zhou Liwen still needed to be summoned. Chen was returned to custody.

### Stateless Foreigner Arrested for Buying and Selling Gold and Currency; Involves Foreign Trading Companies and a Military Officer from a Certain Country

[Report from Our Newspaper] The police bureau's Economic Division received a report that a stateless foreigner named H. Obrenz, residing at No. 20, Lane 1220, Beijing West Road in the city, usually engaged in the business of wool and diamonds, but in reality, he secretly bought and sold black market gold, currency, and other illegal transactions.

However, the case also involved well-known foreign trading companies and a senior military officer from a certain country. Because further investigation was needed, the police bureau has applied to the Special Criminal Court for an extension of detention.

### Labor Union Agrees to Assist in Reporting Warehouse Hoarding; First Batch of 34 Locations Investigated; Most White Paper and Gauze Found

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Bureau of Social Affairs and various military and police agencies began inspecting warehouses throughout the city, the first batch of 34 warehouses has been inspected. It is learned that the materials stored in the most warehouses are white paper and gauze, and the amount stored is sufficient to meet the needs of the entire city for three months.

Yesterday, Director Wu ordered the First Division to instruct Zhang Chude, Chief of the Price Management Section, to convene a discussion meeting with various units under the General Labor Union and gave three instructions: (1) all "underground warehouses" storing daily necessities; (2) all company, factory, and business self-provided warehouses storing raw materials, finished products, or goods for sale that are not related to the business, or goods deposited by people outside the industry; (3) the warehouses of all shipping companies or warehouse businesses where daily necessities have been stored for a long time without being cleared. All of the above are subject to reporting. Chief Zhang convened approximately 20 representatives from the General Labor Union and its affiliated dock, transportation, and loading and unloading unions at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. Chief Zhang explained in detail the three instructions given by Director Wu. The labor union stated that it was willing to do its utmost to assist the government in inspecting warehouses and to pay attention to the entry and exit of materials in various warehouses at all times.

### Opposing the Revival of Japan's Textile Industry: Appealing to Our Government for Serious Negotiations; Cotton Textile Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai Bitterly Explain the Stakes

The Cotton Textile Industry Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai, in order to oppose the revival of the Japanese textile industry, recently sent a telegram to the President of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Industry and Commerce, appealing for serious negotiations. The original telegram is as follows:

"It is believed that the United States' support for Japan, threatening the security of the Far East, has already aroused serious opposition from relevant countries. The textile industry is an important weapon of Japan's economic aggression and a fundamental industry for its war preparations. Under the intentional support of MacArthur after the war, it is recovering at an alarming rate. Even advanced textile industrial countries such as Britain and Australia are alarmed by the resurgence of this powerful competitor and have expressed their protests. How much more so in our country, should we not remain silent. The second session of the member representative assembly of this region was held in Shanghai last month. After reviewing the current crisis in the textile industry and how to save it, it was unanimously agreed that the industry should focus its anti-American and pro-Japanese movement on opposing the revival of the Japanese textile industry. A unanimous resolution was passed to request the government to seriously negotiate. This matter concerns the survival of national industry, and there are things that must be explained in detail to your department:

Bearing in Mind the Bitter Lessons of the Pre-War Era

(1) The United States' fostering of the Japanese textile industry is part of its overall pro-Japanese policy. From its own perspective, the Japanese textile industry poses no threat to the United States. Instead, the United States can export its large amount of capital that has nowhere to be invested, and its surplus cotton and other raw materials can find wider sales channels. American and Japanese capital can merge to control the world market, which the United States considers worthwhile, without considering the impact on China. Sino-American relations have always been strong, but in this matter, interests are completely opposed, which is deeply regrettable. However, we must not forget the dangers to our nation and country for the sake of diplomatic relations. The reason why the people in this industry firmly oppose the revival of the Japanese textile industry is because they remember the bitter lessons of pre-war aggression. The wounds have not healed, and the memory is still fresh. Furthermore, in these difficult times, we cannot bear to see our precarious industry suffer another external blow. The Chinese cotton textile industry is the nation's most promising national industry, but its foundation is still very fragile, urgently requiring national support and guaranteeing its survival and development. It must not be devastated by Japan again. This is the most urgent and sincere request of all industry members, and they expect the government to make a proper and comprehensive choice between Sino-American relations and national interests.

Concealed Intentions Should Be Exposed

(2) The people in this industry sympathize with the Japanese people's need for self-sufficiency, and therefore do not oppose the Japanese textile industry maintaining a production level sufficient for its domestic consumption. However, the Japanese textile industry today has rapidly recovered from more than 1.1 million spindles at the time of surrender to 3.5 million spindles, which far exceeds its domestic consumption and will restore its level as an economic aggressor under Japanese imperialism. Given that Japan has a population of 70 million, it only needs to maintain 1.5 million spindles to produce 700 million yards of yarn and cloth annually, which averages to ten yards per person per year, a very comfortable amount. However, its purpose of revival is not for self-sufficiency, but to force exports and develop aggressive power. Therefore, even though the current number of spindles is double this amount, it still loudly proclaims that it is insufficient and has the absurd ambition to restore the pre-war level of 10 million spindles. Given Japan's industrial potential and speed of development, it is not difficult to restore this level. The threat to the national industries of various Far Eastern countries, especially China, is worrying. Therefore, China should thoroughly expose Japan's hidden intention to cover up its revival of the textile industry with the slogan of self-sufficiency to prevent it from reigniting and must not turn a blind eye, appearing to tacitly approve of it.

Regarding Southeast Asia as its Sole Preserve

(3) The key to future competition between the Chinese and Japanese cotton textile industries lies in capturing the Southeast Asian market. Currently, Japan regards Southeast Asia as its sole preserve for cotton textile exports. Its conspiracy is clearly to control the Southeast Asian market and then control the entire Asian and even global cotton textile market. The Southeast Asian market is the lifeline of China's cotton textile industry. The good opportunity in the first one or two years after the war has already been missed. If we continue to delay, even the domestic market will be unable to defend against the attack of Japanese textiles, and the consequences will be unimaginable. It is reported that Japan's export plan for this year is 1 billion square yards of cotton cloth, which has reached half of its total pre-war cotton cloth exports. It should be known that the huge volume of exports demonstrates the huge power of the Japanese textile industry and reflects the blatant nature of its aggression. To anticipate problems and prevent them, we must strengthen the competition for the Southeast Asian market. All management policies that hinder exports and restrict output should be considered for cancellation by the government, and a comprehensive plan should be formulated to effectively encourage exports and promote output, so that the entire strength of state-owned and private enterprises can be gathered to reverse the current passive disadvantage. We must ensure that the Southeast Asian market does not fall entirely into the hands of the Japanese and that we gain a foothold abroad to lay the foundation for textile exports.

Eradicating the Roots of Renewed Aggression

(4) China had more than 5.5 million spindles before the war. After deducting the 1 million spindles destroyed in the war and 300,000 spindles in the Northeast, only 4.2 million spindles remain, and the actual number in operation is even less than that. The Chinese people will never forget that the accumulation of Japanese cotton textile capital was mostly condensed from the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and today, the revival of the Japanese textile kingdom will inevitably sacrifice the blood and sweat of the Chinese people again. Therefore, the people in this industry firmly advocate restricting the Japanese textile industry to prevent it from using its surplus production capacity to carry out its aggressive actions. The number of Japanese spindles cannot exceed the limit necessary for its people's clothing needs, and it cannot be higher than the living standards of the people in Asian countries that were invaded. According to this principle, Japan should maintain a maximum of 3 million spindles, which is already benevolent. All cotton and wool textile machinery and machine tools for manufacturing cotton and wool textile machinery exceeding this limit should be dismantled and transferred to China as compensation. China fought the longest and sacrificed the most during the war, and has the right to demand the largest percentage of the total compensation. We must argue reasonably and strive to achieve the goal, so that we can obtain the needs for substantive industrial construction and eradicate the roots of renewed Japanese aggression. In summary, the people in this industry are fighting for the survival of the cotton textile industry, which is also fighting for the survival of the entire national industry. The crisis is urgent, and it is difficult to stand idly by. Therefore, we especially appeal to your Yuan (Department) to quickly negotiate with the United States and the Allied authorities, demanding that the number of Japanese spindles be reasonably restricted, and insisting on the claim that the surplus equipment should be compensated to China, so as to save the current crisis of the textile industry and lay the cornerstone for industrial construction. Urgent plea, please examine and approve. Respectfully submitted by the Cotton Textile Industry Associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai." Ma.

### Rejection of Marriage Proposal Leads to Acid Attack; Lu Hanming Indicted

[Report from this newspaper] Lu Hanming, a 28-year-old from Haimen, residing at No. 12 Jixiang Road, harbored resentment after his marriage proposal to Ms. Ding Yichun, a woman from Pudong, was rejected. On the morning of June 24, at approximately 8:00 AM, he lay in wait near the entrance of Helin Alley on North Sichuan Road. Upon seeing Ms. Ding pass by, he splashed her with nitric acid, injuring her right upper arm and other areas. Lu then fled in the chaos. After being injured, Ms. Ding sought treatment at the Municipal Fourth Hospital and obtained a medical certificate. She also sought to track down Lu's whereabouts, and on the morning of the following day, Lu was taken to the police station from No. 9 Jixiang Road and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor He Huimin, based on the victim's vivid and detailed testimony, and finding the defendant's attempts to evade responsibility unconvincing, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The trial is scheduled to begin on the 26th of this month in the District Court.

### Special Donations Only Reach Two Trillion; Many Associations Still Hesitant; Authorities May Adopt Mandatory Fundraising Measures

[Report from this newspaper] The special donations for relief in this city have so far reached only around two trillion. The city government previously sent letters to various trade associations, urging them to immediately report their lists of pledged donations, and those who have already reported their lists of pledged donations were urged to pay their donations. It is learned that the securities, hardware, warehousing, sugar, department store, woolen textile, shipping, import and export, oil, steel smelting, underwear knitting, watch, and enamelware trade associations in this city have not yet pledged donations. The Special Relief Donation Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at the end of this month to review the donation situation of various industries. It is rumored that the insufficient amount may be raised through mandatory measures.

Agricultural Mechanization in Northeastern Anhui: Tractor Plowing, Water Pump Drainage. By Qian Mengchao, correspondent of this newspaper.

[Report from Bengbu, July 19th, from this newspaper] The newly established Anhui Provincial Agricultural Promotion and Guidance Committee held a grain production increase conference at the Provincial Second District Agricultural Farm on Shengli Road in this city on the 16th and 17th, in order to strengthen agricultural promotion and guidance work in eastern Anhui. Holding a grain production increase conference during a period of poor wheat harvest, skyrocketing grain prices, and insufficient supply in northeastern Anhui is very meaningful. Although the conference only lasted for two days, under the leadership of Xu Boshen, director of the Provincial Agricultural Promotion and Guidance Committee, and with the participation and discussion of responsible persons from various agricultural institutions and experts and technicians related to water conservancy machinery, in addition to making decisions on grain increase areas, grain loan coordination, increased allocation of chemical fertilizers, disease and pest control medicines and machinery, and distribution of improved seeds, they also had intense discussions on the use of machinery to strengthen agricultural reclamation and increase grain production. It was decided that the Anhui Branch of the Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Enterprise Committee would promote machinery agricultural reclamation to the greatest extent possible within its limits, in line with current environmental needs, in order to achieve the goal of increasing grain production. Now, a brief report on the situation of agricultural reclamation machinery work in northeastern Anhui will be given.

Agricultural Reclamation Experts Preside Over Work

Agricultural reclamation mechanization and scientification is a unanimous request in the call for increased grain production. Using machinery to plow fields has been trialed in northeastern Anhui for nearly a year, and has been well received by rural areas due to its outstanding work efficiency. For the sake of developing Anhui's agriculture, it is necessary to actively promote it.

Currently, the entity trialing mechanical plowing in eastern Anhui is the Re-Cultivation Team of the Anhui Branch of the Machinery Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Enterprise Committee. Because the former Anhui Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Branch had set up a tractor station in Gaojia Lake, Wuhe, the tractors owned by the Agricultural Reclamation Branch Re-Cultivation Team were completely transferred from the former Relief and Rehabilitation Branch tractor station. After the end of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Branch, most of the business was transferred to the Anhui Provincial Business Management Office of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau to continue handling. Currently, the staff of the Agricultural Reclamation Branch Re-Cultivation Team are in close contact with the Anhui Provincial Business Management Office of the Rehabilitation Bureau.

The person in charge of mechanical agricultural reclamation work in Anhui Province is Jiang Diqiu, director of the Anhui Branch of the Agricultural Reclamation Office. Mr. Jiang is a Master of Agriculture from Cornell University in the United States and a specialist member of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. In addition to promoting agricultural guidance work, he is very serious about improving water conservancy and promoting machine reclamation techniques.

Reclamation and Water Pumping are Used in Coordination

Currently, the tractor stations set up in northeastern Anhui are located in Gaojia Lake in Wuhe and Konggang in Huaiyuan, and there is also a station in Yicheng, southern Anhui. Mechanical plowing in Gaojia Lake, Wuhe, has been established by the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Branch for more than a year. Last summer, Ye Yuanlong, the former director of the Anhui Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Branch, invited reporters to visit the mechanized reclamation of Gaojia Lake for the first time. On the 21st of last month, he was invited again by Director Jiang Diqiu to visit tractor plowing and harrowing in Konggang, Huaiyuan, with Commander Xia Wei. Because China's science is backward, there are very few places where machines are used to plow fields. After two inspections, a vivid impression still remains in my mind.

The results of using tractors to plow fields in Wuhe, Huaiyuan, and Yicheng are remarkable and are envied by farmers in those areas. It is reported that Fuyang, Yingshang, and Shouxian in northern Anhui are also preparing to set up tractor stations. Social figures who care about rural revitalization and hope to increase grain production are all looking forward to the rapid development of mechanized reclamation work, and therefore have high expectations for the Anhui Agricultural Reclamation Branch.

Currently, in coordination with tractor agricultural reclamation work, it is worth introducing the water pump work team affiliated to the Anhui Agricultural Reclamation Branch. The work team is gradually carrying out water pumping work in northern Anhui, where the rainfall is erratic and the situation of irrigation and flood drainage needs to be improved urgently. Water pumps and tractors have different structures. There are currently 150 water pumps in total. Water pump stations have been established in Cao Sizi in Huaiyuan and Shang Zhao Zhuang in Mingguang. Jiang Chuan Shi, the captain of the First Water Pump Work Team stationed in Zhao Zhuang, attended the grain production increase conference in Bengbu a few days ago and spoke with reporters at a banquet about the water pump work situation and plans to invite us to visit water pumping in Shang Zhao Zhuang.

Konggang Machine Station Assists in Cultivation with Marked Effect

The Huaiyuan Tractor Station of the Agricultural Reclamation Branch is located in Konggang, and was formally established on March 1st of this year. Konggang is located in the southwest of Huaiyuan, bordering the Jingshan Lake, 25 kilometers from Zhazha. The lake is shadowed and the fields are vast. During the Yellow River flood, it was the most severely affected area. After the flood receded, many fields were dried up, but they were covered with fine sand, which hindered the growth of crops, so deep plowing and harrowing were urgently needed. The Konggang Station has ten new large-sized tractors, five water pumps, two trucks, two trailers, three bicycles, one seeder, and one harvester. According to Jiang Diqiu, at the beginning of the tractor re-cultivation project, local farmers applied for registration. The number of mu registered was 11,900 mu of valley land and 830 mu of high land, of which 102 households were poor farmers who were unable to re-cultivate. The area cultivated on their behalf was 525 municipal mu before the wheat harvest and 5,200 municipal mu of valley land and 422 municipal mu of high land. In the autumn of this year, it is planned to use water pumps to irrigate 2,000 municipal mu of rice fields. He also said: Tobacco and onions are the local farmers' by-products, and it is also planned to use love-themed trucks and trailers to organize a transportation and sales cooperative during the idle time of cultivation to solve the farmers' transportation and sales problems.

Regarding the working efficiency of tractor plowing, according to Zhou Xinyi, the station manager of Konggang Station, its significant efficiency is to change the soil quality. Due to the Yellow River flood over the years, the fields bordering the Jingshan Lake are mostly silted up with sand, with poor soil quality and very little harvest. The large plow of the tractor station has a diameter of 28 inches and can plow 14 inches deep, which is far from comparable to the plowing that farmers can do with plows. Therefore, the valley land ploughed is covered with flying sand, and the sown crops are flourishing, and a good harvest can be predicted this autumn. Therefore, local farmers are very satisfied with the machine's sand-turning plowing, and they also respect the driving technicians. Also, because the staff of the station do not accept any hospitality, they are even more popular with the local people. Even farmers ten miles away have come to complain about their difficulties in not being able to obtain cultivation assistance and hope to get help with their plowing. After visiting the Konggang machine cultivation, the reporter deeply hopes that the Mechanized Agricultural Reclamation Office will compile a strong mechanized unit to launch the sacred work of re-cultivation to assist in increasing grain production.

### Yixing's Soybean Flowers Bear Fruit When Locusts Suddenly Arrive to Eat; They Cannot Be Driven Away, Causing Concern Among the People

[Report from Yixing, July 19th] At around 8:00 AM on the 19th, millions of locusts suddenly flew in from the northwest, like a dark cloud, obscuring the sky. They gathered in the soybean fields to eat, making a clicking sound, and could not be driven away. Residents tried using water pumps to irrigate them, but they still flapped their wings and flew to the southeast, making a whirring sound. In less than a quarter of an hour, the soybean flowers that had already fruited in dozens of mu of soybean fields were all eaten up.

### Chuansha County Assembly Involved in Rental Dispute

Presenting New Evidence to Appeal

[Chuansha, July 20th] The houses rented by the Chuansha County Assembly originally belonged to the Sun Qing Cloth Industry Association. When the Cloth Industry Association no longer needed them in the early years of the Republic, they were donated to the Zhiyuan Shantang, an organization that provided care for the elderly, orphans, medical treatment, and medicine. In the second year of the Republic, a neighbor surnamed Zhao sued the Zhiyuan Shantang for encroaching on land, and the lawsuit began. The case concluded after three trials in March of the 14th year of the Republic. Because no one was in charge of the Zhiyuan Shantang, Zhao took advantage of his position to win the lawsuit. Zhao has repeatedly tried to execute the judgment, but the house has been informally suspended from execution because it has been rented by local agencies. Fortunately, it was not destroyed during the occupation period. When victory came and the county assembly was established, the house was formally rented by the assembly. Recently, Dai Mian, a judge in Chuansha, forcefully executed the judgment, intending to demolish the house. After the War of Resistance, many public houses in Chuansha were lost. Now, when everything is waiting to be done, county magistrates and judges over the decades have been transferred and moved frequently, and have been able to take into account the people's sentiments and understand the facts. However, Judge Dai enforced the law as firm as a mountain, causing confusion to hundreds of thousands of people in Chuansha. County Magistrate Su Kui Bing telegraphed the Suzhou High Court. Song Yuan, the former speaker of the county assembly, and Zhu Youfu, the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, along with Lu Rongan and Qin Xingyan, members of the National Assembly who traveled to Shanghai, went to Suzhou to meet with Liang, the president of the Higher Court, and presented the actual situation, temporarily suspending the execution. It is also heard that new evidence has been discovered, and a lawsuit for objection has been filed.

### Zhejiang Construction Department Measures the Baizhang Pond

[Report from Hangzhou, July 21st, from this newspaper] Yuyao and Shangyu counties have often been in dispute over the excavation of water sources in the Baizhang Pond. For more than a hundred years, a reasonable solution has not been reached. The Zhejiang Construction Department has sent a surveying team to measure the pond in order to open it up. If this project can be successful, it can irrigate 200,000 mu of fertile land in the two counties.

### A Glimpse of County Governance in Xinjiang

— Cheng Ze

[Dihua, 17th, Airmail] In Xinjiang during times of war and chaos, construction is of course out of the question. Because today's Xinjiang, no matter from which aspect you look at it, lacks two important factors: firstly, capital, and secondly, talent. Talent is even more important and more lacking than capital. The reasons for this are, of course, the difficulty of transportation, the underdevelopment of the people's intelligence, and the lack of widespread education.

The lack of talent in Xinjiang is widespread, not only in terms of engineers, scientists, educators, or other specialized technical personnel, but even cadres for county governance are pitifully few. The salaries of public servants are so low, and the living conditions of county-level civil servants are even lower. Generally, people with some assets all engage in business and trade, seeking great profits, and simply do not value the meager income of working in public service. Those who work in county governance are only impoverished scholars who have studied the classics but have no capital and no other options. But how many such people are there in the end?

A county magistrate in Xinjiang must be an all-round talent. He must be able to deal with all kinds of matters between various ethnic groups, deal with the garrison troops, deal with provincial government officials and ordinary guests, and also handle errands for military and police agencies, mediate for the common people, review official documents, and even administer justice. Even if a woman seeks justice from the county magistrate because her husband has a new love. With a lack of cadres and slow administrative efficiency, the county magistrate has no choice but to handle things personally. I have personally seen a county magistrate who was also the secretary director, in charge of receiving and dispatching documents, overseeing the seals, acting as the accountant, the principal of the primary school, and also the captain of the county's self-defense force, because it was a remote place, very difficult, and no one wanted to go there.

The lack of talent hinders the implementation of all government orders and construction projects. During the Sheng Shicai era, Soviet engineers and young people who had studied in the Soviet Union were fully utilized. After leaving Xinjiang, a group of engineers came from the interior, but in the chaotic Xinjiang, with the change of the political situation, new talents did not take root, and the old ones scattered. Therefore, Xinjiang needs construction, needs culture, education, transportation, health, water conservancy, light industry... construction in all aspects, and even more needs specialized talents to promote these various construction policies. But the stagnant construction situation makes anyone in Xinjiang feel infinitely depressed. Therefore, when a new construction project appears, no matter which aspect it is in, it brings a string of joys.

Mu Die River is a small county with 12,000 people, of which 8,000 are Han Chinese, more than 3,000 are Kazakh, and more than 400 are Uyghur. Most of the Kazakhs live in the southern Tianshan Mountains. The land is small and sparsely populated, and there are not many products. The main agricultural product is wheat, followed by naked oats and beans. Because of the lack of manpower, every autumn harvest relies on farmers from neighboring counties to cut wheat. Sometimes, if neighboring counties do not come to help, the wheat will overripen in the fields, and no one will harvest it. From this small county governance situation, we can imagine the situation in other counties. It is very obvious that the agricultural development of Xinjiang still depends on the improvement of manpower, water conservancy, and cultivation techniques.

Where to start building a new Xinjiang? This reporter believes that it should start from the grassroots county governance, and start from improving the rural areas. Otherwise, everything is just empty talk and does not help reality. Today, counties across the country are almost all facing the same problem, namely, the county government has heavy responsibilities but little power, the county magistrate has many concurrent positions but few can fulfill their duties, the county government has many affairs but little funding, and there are many undertakings to be undertaken but few specialized talents. This is not only the case for county governance in remote Xinjiang, but it is the entire problem of our internal affairs.

### Miss Hong Kong and Miss Macau

[This newspaper, Hong Kong, 18th, Airmail] In recent months, Hong Kong has been trapped in a very "depressing" situation. She is on a blurred borderline, watching the fire from across the bank. But the wildfire swept over from the mainland wilderness and spread all over the mountains, making her anxious, hesitant, and even indignant. On the 15th that early morning, gunfire suddenly broke out outside the border fields and lasted for seven hours. A stronghold within the Chinese border was captured by "2,000" communist bandits in a "big fish eats small fish" attack! The communist bandits took advantage of their remaining strength, distributed leaflets, and threatened to attack Yuen Long Hui within British territory. This kind of "posturing" by the communist bandits further increased the depression in Hong Kong.

Miss Hong Kong Competition Sends Kisses Through Tears

In the depressing low pressure, people desperately seek stimulation. Coincidentally, the election farce that had been promoted for two months was staged during this period (the 18th). Thus, on the one hand, thousands of troops were mobilized to prepare for bandit suppression, and on the other hand, thousands of idle people appeared to "nominate" a "Miss Hong Kong" for the year 1948. I don't know if it was a deliberate joke, but a middle-aged woman weighing more than 150 pounds was also mixed among the young women to show off her beauty. The contestants held "press conferences" one after another, and some even "sent kisses through tears." As a result, a "red dance girl" from a second-rate dance hall named "Sima Yin" defeated the other eleven candidates and was elected. According to a authoritative source in a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper: The number of citizens who called the newspaper to inquire about who was elected that night was ten thousand times more concerned than when the vice president was elected!

Graduate from Patriotic Girls' High School [Excellent Student]

This "Miss Hong Kong" was in North China before the age of ten, in Shanghai after the age of ten, and in Minming during the Anti-Japanese War. She was born in Beiping, is 24 years old this year, is five feet four and a half inches tall, weighs one hundred and ten pounds, and is an "excellent student" from Shanghai Patriotic Girls' High School. Her original surname is Chen, and her name is Ming. She is very fond of music—she should be a genuine "Shanghai Miss."

Miss Macau Unluckily Sinks Straight into the Sea

On the 16th, the "Caterpillar-style" amphibious twin-engine aircraft named "Miss Macau" sank into the sea off the coast of Macau! This Miss Macau! That Miss Hong Kong! How different are their fates, like heaven and earth? "Miss Macau" took off from Macau to Hong Kong at about 6:00 PM that afternoon. About ten minutes after takeoff, it suddenly exploded and sank straight into the bottom of the sea. A total of 27 people were buried in the green waters with her, including a family of four American tourists, all of whom were killed.

Gold Passengers Lose Both People and Money in the Plane Crash

It is rumored that a financial magnate from Hong Kong and Macau, Mr. Chen, lost 3,000 taels of gold on the plane, and both people and money were lost.

### Tight Credit Policy Has Short-Lived Effect; Commodity Prices Fluctuate Again Yesterday; National Bank Acknowledges Natural Phenomenon During Suppression of Rebellion

[This newspaper] Commodity prices were relatively stable yesterday morning, but fluctuations started again in the afternoon. Almost all Chinese stocks hit the daily limit. Yong Yarn was suspended after a deep dive, and transactions outside the market were made at an additional 600 yuan. Cotton yarn rose by half a percent, and the cotton cloth market also rebounded. The rice and grain market was closed in the afternoon, but the retail prices had already fluctuated. Silk prices rose by 10%, and general daily necessities also rose by about half a percent. There are three reasons for the price fluctuations: (1) Credit gradually eased in the afternoon, and it was rumored that outside speculators would come to Shanghai, and the amount would increase again. (2) Rumors spread that after the Central Bank issued large banknotes, it asked foreign banks not to make large loans within three days. Now that the deadline is approaching, there may be a big difference today. (3) The arrival of US aid materials in Taikoo had an indirect impact on market psychology.

It is also learned that after the issuance of the Customs Gold Unit notes, the Central Bank, in order to prevent major market fluctuations, not only stopped all loans but also sold a large amount of materials to tighten credit. Therefore, in the two days after the issuance of the banknotes, commodity prices rebounded. It is said that the person in charge of the Central Bank is quite satisfied with this and believes that the stimulus of the large banknotes has passed. If prices rise in the future, it will be a natural phenomenon during the suppression of the rebellion and has nothing to do with the issuance of the banknotes. The general view of the business community is also that the tightening of credit is a short-term matter and difficult to sustain. Judging from the commodity price situation yesterday afternoon, this observation is quite close to the truth.

### Credit Gradually Eases in the Afternoon; Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply

Chinese stocks showed a slight turnaround after yesterday's unusually tight credit situation, and the rebound was extremely fierce, with 19 stocks hitting the limit. Yong Yarn's premium reached 600 yuan, and Meiya and others also added water.

The morning opening was weak due to tight credit. Yong Yarn retreated to 10,180 yuan. No. 152, No. 55, No. 121, No. 71, and No. 95 advanced to a high price of 10,670 yuan. No. 12, No. 43, No. 197, No. 85, No. 28, No. 145, No. 213, No. 129, No. 155, No. 27, and No. 171 were sold off and retreated to a low price of 9,980 yuan. No. 145, No. 97, No. 95, No. 16, and No. 89 were replenished, rising back to 10,270 yuan. Dark interest rates soared to nine corners, but there was no source, and there was no strength to advance, appearing extremely weak. However, those covering short positions were still eager, and the noon closing still stood at 10,300 yuan. Except for Merlin Yongye Liandi hitting the limit, Xinyi Business was still flat, and Hengda, Wuhe, Jinglun, Zhabei, and Zhongfa were down by half a percent, the remaining stocks showed little change.

Afternoon market news revealed a turnaround in credit. Yong Yarn's opening price already announced a limit up. After that, it gradually increased. Xinguang, Huawei, and Meiya also reached the limit one after another. Although Yong Yarn once retreated below the limit due to the supply of No. 120, No. 187, and No. 47, and small stocks also rebounded, No. 119, No. 145, No. 72, and others still advanced, and Yong Yarn's premium increased to 550 yuan and 600 yuan, and Meiya added 5 yuan. As a result, except for Yonggong, Zhongni, Datong, Shangni, Xinyi, Hengda, Zhabei, Zhongxing, and Huaxin, the rest all reached the limit. Unlisted stocks outside the market were still the most popular, rising by 10%, public utility stocks were still stable, and the rest were flat.

Government Bonds

Initially stable, then weak. Unified C opened at 1.05 million, retreated from 1.06 million to 980,000 and then stabilized slightly. Dashengxing and Room 552 sold, while Room 550, Room 360, and Room 500 advanced. The transaction volume was 2-3 million. Compared with the previous closing, A and B were down by 20,000 yuan, C and D were down by a little over 10,000 yuan, and Unified E was still flat.

### Agricultural Bank to Purchase Flour as Agent; Second Batch to Be Signed Today

90% of the Payment Prepaid, Paid in Nine Installments

The flour purchased by the Agricultural Bank as an agent on behalf of the Ministry of Food, the first batch of 500,000 packages, has already been delivered and 300,000 packages have been shipped out. The remaining 200,000 packages will also be shipped out this week. The second batch of 550,000 packages was delayed until now because the payment method was not resolved. It is understood that the Agricultural Bank will begin signing contracts with the flour industry in the Fourth District today (the 22nd). All the various conditions will still be handled according to the original contract of the first batch. The only difference this time is to cooperate with the tightening of credit. 90% of the payment will be prepaid at the time of signing the contract, and it will be paid in nine installments, with one-ninth paid every day, and the goods must be delivered within ten days. After the goods are delivered, a settlement will be made according to the market price of the day.

### Silk Prices All See High Increases

The artificial silk market was initially weak yesterday but then rose sharply. No. 120 Golden Three Horses bright silk opened in the morning at 1.9 billion yuan, once dropped to 1.86 billion yuan, and then rose to 1.93 billion yuan due to an imbalance between supply and demand, hovering for a long time. The noon closing rose again to 2 billion yuan spot price, and the forward date was shouted at 2.15 billion yuan. The afternoon opening was 2.25 billion yuan, the maximum rose to 2.44 billion yuan, and the closing price fell to 2.37 billion yuan buying price and 2.4 billion yuan selling price, a huge increase of 500 million yuan compared with the previous day.

Factory Spun

The market followed the artificial silk step by step, also reporting an increase. The morning was very weak, and high zero-lot immediate payment was traded at 1.95 billion yuan. In the afternoon, the opening was 2.3 billion yuan, and the D-grade was quoted at 2.35 billion yuan, all of which were 300 million yuan higher than the previous day. Dry spun high zero-lot was traded at 1.75 billion yuan.

Silk Fabrics

The market was high, and the true silk quilt opened in the morning at 1.1 billion yuan, rose to 1.17 billion yuan and then retreated to 1.13 billion yuan. Then, due to the good stock market, it was searched and purchased by various parties, and the spot price rose to 1.24 billion yuan at the close, a premium of 90 million yuan for the deferred date. It rose again in the afternoon, opening at 1.47 billion yuan. The checkered crepe was not opened yesterday, and Huajin crepe was traded at 1.8 million yuan.

### Large Disparity Between Domestic and Foreign Prices; Raw Silk Not Easy to Export

According to the person in charge of China Silk Corporation, since the announcement of the new method of foreign exchange settlement certificates, the export situation of raw silk has not improved. Commodity prices have doubled in half a month, and black market exchange rates have also increased by more than two times, while the market price of foreign exchange settlement certificates has remained around 3 million. As a result, the difference between the domestic and foreign market prices based on the settlement certificate has become larger and larger. The domestic market price of raw silk C grade 81 degrees is 2.4 billion yuan per dan (unit of weight), and the foreign market price in New York is 4 yuan per pound. Calculated at the current market price of settlement certificates plus the equalization price, each dan is only worth 1.545 billion yuan, a difference of more than 800 million yuan. In the past, there were plans to export raw silk, silk fabrics, and silk shirts, and weaving had already begun, but under such unreasonable exchange rates, this plan cannot proceed.

### Rice Prices Turn Strong From Weak; Grains, Oils, and Flour All Rise

The rice market was stable yesterday, and the image of turning strong was slightly revealed near the close. The early opening saw endless exits due to the continued tight credit, falling another 1 million yuan. The middle market was even weaker, and the close turned strong due to the rising of miscellaneous grains. The market price in the North Market for white japonica, thin rice, and indica was 37 million each, and the premium japonica was 39.5 million. The market price in the South Market for white japonica was 36.5 million. Market quotations in each market increased by 500,000. 3,539 shi (unit of volume) arrived in the two markets.

Flour

People's minds have turned from panic to stability. Retail investors took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and the opening saw a high rise. Subsequently, manufacturers increased the flour price to 11.6 million (including donation), the quantity remained unchanged, and as a result, people's minds were even more firm and prices rose again. The old flour rose from 11.2 million to 11.8 million, and the warship closed at 11.3 million, each rising by 1.3 million. Red Bee Construction was all up 1.45 million. Large bags of bran were 8.6 million, an increase of 550,000.

Grains were uniformly strong due to the large declines on the previous day. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and owners uniformly tightened. The closing price of zha beans was 17 million, and the price of car beans was 18.5 million. The zha beans returned to 16 million in the afternoon, and the car beans to 18 million, with a uniform increase of 500,000. Black beans were still flat, corn trended strong, tea beans and raw wheat were all up 1 million, Xuzhou red grain was 15 million, sesame seeds added 1-2 million, and raw peanuts were taken up by Guangdong merchants, up 4-5 million.

Cooking Oils

Although it was announced to have fallen the previous day, people's minds were not really at ease, so retail investors took advantage of the low prices to take delivery, and owners also sold tightly. The factory quotations were not low, with the highest price of soybean oil reaching 80 million, and the closing price slightly returned to 78 million, an increase of 5 million. Raw rapeseed oil also rose by 5-6 million, Jilin raw oil added 2 million, small car sesame oil added 1 million, and the price of bean cake opened high at the factory, and later retail investors sold off, and the ultimate price saw a return to low, rising only 1-2 million.

### Tea Market Transactions Quiet

In yesterday's tea market, buyers appeared with a sell-off attitude in the morning, but in the end, due to the increasingly tight credit situation, and the buyers were afraid of high prices and hesitated, the process was still weak. The results at the close continued to guard the original line, and transactions were as sparse as the morning stars. It is learned that the tea samples sent abroad by local exporters some time ago have now been received, and it is said that they are very satisfied with the quality of the tea, but the prices offered are disappointing, only about US$0.22 per pound. At this price, the cost of the Chinese tea raw is about 30% away, and it is difficult to smoothly sell it for a while. However, the tea merchants are planning to call overseas again to request a moderate increase in prices, and it is still difficult to predict whether it is possible or not.

### Cotton Yarn Market Steady; More Cloth Sold, Prices Down

In yesterday's cotton yarn market, the enthusiasm of local buyers improved due to the easing of credit in the market. However, the opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was slightly higher due to unsettled minds, and it dropped back once due to poor sales. Near the close, the quoted price of yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company was higher, and it finally saw a return to 1.7 billion, a premium of 150 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 21-count Shuangma yarn also stabilized first and then rose, with the main holders taking advantage and rising by 200 million yuan. The remaining various counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 50-60 million to 145 million yuan, respectively.

In yesterday's cotton cloth market, sales of cloth were still high due to the fact that credit was not yet too loose and payments had not arrived, and local buying was also flat. The initial opening of Longtou fine cloth was up about 1.3 million, and then the Yarn Control Committee re-allocated Shuangyu and Zuqiu fine cloth, and cloth merchants and table merchants took the opportunity to suppress prices, and the price immediately dropped to 42.5 million yuan. After 10:30, the industry saw low maintenance, and floating shorts also came to cover, and the close rebounded to 43.5 million yuan, a drop of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five Fortune fine cloth saw the biggest plunge of 3 million yuan due to the Textile Construction's tender sale of 40.5 million yuan, and other cloths also saw a lower price.

Also reported: The cloth market finally heard that yarn prices rebounded, and Longtou fine cloth was also strong to 44 million yuan in transactions. It is also learned that there were very few applicants for the fine cloth sold by the Textile Construction on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee. Also reported: China Trust Bureau's 1,100 tons of cotton were loaded on the Zhixin Wheel and transported to Tianjin.

Also reported: Yesterday, Zhongfang sold 648 pieces of yarn, a total of 1,091 pieces of 20-count yarn, and collected 8.485 billion in national currency. It also sold 1,388 pieces on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, collecting 53,277,000,000 yuan.

Also reported: The Yarn Control Committee telegraphed the Sixth District Association yesterday, saying: "It is found that the insured unit price for fire insurance during the storage period of the emergency applications and the foreign cotton spun yarn in the first and second quarters of each factory will be adjusted again from now on. With 400 pounds of 20-count yarn as the standard, the insured amount for each piece is 1.33 billion yuan, regardless of large bales or grass bales."

### Ministry of Education Circular to All Provinces and Cities: Earnestly Promote Vocational Education, Designate Special Funds and Absolutely Prevent Disguised Misappropriation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] The Ministry of Education issued two directives regarding vocational education to the Education Bureaus of all provinces and cities on the 21st:

(1) Vocational education is a major measure for cultivating technical talents for national defense and economic construction, and promoting people's livelihoods. We have repeatedly urged its implementation. The National Assembly resolved to "earnestly promote vocational education to alleviate youth unemployment and develop social production" and to "expand vocational schools to increase production and fulfill the mission of nation-building." These resolutions should be earnestly implemented. Please pay close attention to implementing them.

(2) Our ministry promulgated the "Standards for the Allocation of Middle School Establishment Funds in Provinces and Cities" in 1933, stipulating that vocational schools' funding should not be less than 35% of the total. Since then, vocational education has gradually expanded in various provinces and cities. However, the War of Resistance soon began, and less attention was paid to implementation. Recently, the National Assembly resolved to expand vocational education, increase funding, and allocate a substantial amount specifically for the expansion of vocational education, which must absolutely not be misappropriated in disguised forms. This should be earnestly implemented. In the future, middle school education funding should still be handled according to the ratio standards of the previous law. The actual situation in your province or city this year must be reported for verification before the end of the year, and this ratio standard must be effectively achieved starting in the second half of the year. Please proceed accordingly.

### Chen Xueping Discusses Student Unrest: Vocational Students Account for Only Five Percent, Hopes Pure Young People Can Thoroughly Understand

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] Youth Minister Chen Xueping, when discussing student unrest with reporters on the afternoon of the 21st, said: "Since the Shen Chong incident, there have been more than 500 student movements across the country in the past two years, initiated for various reasons. The loss of youth and studies is truly incalculable. While some may have legitimate reasons, the vast majority are incited by vocational students. Their purposes are all political. Vocational students in various schools account for no more than 5%. However, most pure students are often manipulated by them. Now most pure students have gradually awakened, and I believe it will be difficult for vocational students to use their tricks in the future." Chen also said that student unrest often has political implications. If the National Army can win more battles in various theaters to suppress bandits and if prices can be controlled, student unrest will naturally decrease. Otherwise, "organization against organization" and "action against action" are also stopgap measures. But these are by no means good strategies. Chen finally hoped that most pure young people could thoroughly understand the conspiracies of vocational students.

### Shanghai College of Law and Politics

Brief History

Shanghai College of Law and Politics was originally named "Shanghai University of Law and Politics," which opened in 1924. When the National Government promulgated the University Organization Law in July 1929, stipulating that only institutions with three or more colleges could be called universities, the institution changed its name to the current name on November 15 of that year. The founder of the institution was Xu Qian, who served as the first president. Subsequently, Zhang Zhiben, Huang Huiping, Zheng Yuxiu, Zhang Zhongdao, Wei Daoming, Zhang Shizhao, and others served as presidents of the college one after another. From 1937 to the present, the president has been Dr. Wang Chonghui, and the acting president is Dr. Li Xinyang, both authorities in the field of law. Compared with the "Shanghai College of Law" located on Jiangwan Road, the name of this institution has only one additional character, "Politics," which makes it difficult for people from all walks of life to distinguish them. In fact, this institution and the Shanghai College of Law, which is abbreviated as "Shang Fa," are two different schools.

Campus and Facilities

The school is located at 450 Zhongzheng South Second Road (i.e., Dapu Bridge, Jin Shenfu Road), covering an area of more than seven acres. There are two self-built four-story buildings. Trolleybuses on routes 17 and public buses on routes 21 and 23 can all reach the school. The library facilities are quite substantial, especially the books on law. There are also two basketball courts and one volleyball court for sports. The school originally had a large auditorium, which was demolished by the enemy and puppets during the war, and is now planning to rebuild it. There are currently no dormitories, and out-of-town students who do not have a place to live in this city should not apply. This information should be reported in particular.

Departments and Content

The college currently has three departments: Law, Politics, and Economics. The Law Department adopts a hybrid system, does not divide into groups, and focuses on cultivating legal talents. Graduates of previous sessions mostly work in the legal field and as lawyers, in addition to those who go abroad for further studies. The Political Science Department aims to cultivate local administrative talents and local self-government talents. The Economics Department aims to train talents in taxation, finance, and trade, which are currently needed. Currently, the Law Department has the most students, with more than 260 people. The Political Science and Economics Departments each have about 140 to 150 people.

Key Faculty and Staff

The director of academic affairs is Zhang [missing name]. The director of student affairs is Luo Shiji. The secretary and director of general affairs is Guo Xiaoxian. The chairman of the Law Department is Li Mo. The chairman of the Political Science Department is Lu Shidao. The chairman of the Economics Department is Zhang Yushan. Part-time professors include Li Xinyang, Luo Shiji, Li Mo, Lu Shidao, Cha Liangjian, Huang Liang, Wei Wenhan, Li Liang, Xu Fuji, Zhou Nan, and He Xianzhang in the Law Department; Xu Diping, Mao Yiheng, Cheng Dexu, Wu Benzhong, Zhu Junti, and Miao Qingbang in the Political Science Department; and Chen Qinghua, Zhang Yushan, Guo Xiaoxian, Xia Yande, and Chu Baoyi in the Economics Department. Teachers of common required courses include Zhao Erqian, Sun Xiaocun, Shi Zhecun, and Yang Yizhi.

Enrollment

In addition to recruiting 60 new first-year students in each of the three departments (Law, Politics, and Economics), the college also recruits transfer students for the second and third grades of each department. The registration date is from August 5th to 7th, and the examination date is August 10th and 11th. Both will be held at the college at 450 Zhongzheng South Second Road. The examination subjects are listed below: (A) First-year freshmen examination subjects: (1) Chinese, (2) English, (3) Mathematics (Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigonometry), (4) Civics, (5) Chinese and Foreign History, (6) Chinese and Foreign Geography, (7) Physics and Chemistry, (8) Oral Examination. (B) Transfer students will be given additional examinations in specialized subjects.

### Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts

History and Current Status

The school was first named "Academy of Fine Arts" and was founded by Liu Haisu in the first year of the Republic. In 1920, it was renamed "Shanghai Art School." In 1930, by order of the Ministry of Education, it was renamed "Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts." During the War of Resistance, it planned to relocate inland, but it failed due to financial exhaustion and traffic obstruction. On the other hand, the acting principal Xie Haiyan and others led the students to move inland, establishing art specialization courses in Southeast United University and Yingshi University. After the victory, the school returned to Shanghai, and President Liu Haisu resumed his duties, establishing a Restoration Committee to vigorously promote the school. The current address is 560 Shunchang Road (Caishi Road). The school has four academic systems: (1) Five-year specialized program, with five groups: Chinese Painting, Western Painting, Music, Sculpture, and Pattern Design. (2) Three-year specialized program, with three groups: Chinese Painting, Western Painting, and Drawing. (3) Three-year Art Education program, with three groups: Painting, Music, and Handicraft. (4) Two-year Handicraft Specialization program, entrusted by the Ministry of Education.

Enrollment

Next semester, the school will enroll 20 new first-term students in each department and group, 5 transfer students in each department and group for the first term of the first year and the first term of the second year, and 20 special elective students. The qualification for applying for the five-year specialized program is junior high school graduation, and the qualification for applying for the three-year specialized program and the art education program is senior high school graduation. The first registration date is approximately in early August, and the examination is in mid-August. The second examination is approximately in early September. Examination subjects: The five-year specialized program will examine Civics, Chinese, History and Geography, English, and General Knowledge of Art. In addition, the Chinese Painting group will examine Chinese Painting, the Western Painting group will examine Sketching (pencil drawing or charcoal drawing), and the Pattern Design group will examine Pattern Painting. The three-year specialized program is the same as the five-year program, except that General Knowledge of Art is changed to a test of Art Principles. The three-year art education program is the same as above, except that the Music group will also examine Music Theory, Vocal Music, and Instrumental Music, and the Handicraft group will also examine Pencil Drawing and General Knowledge of Handicraft.

The remaining eight matches' records, after being collected and organized by the organizers, are now being disclosed. In the Group A match between Jingwu Huang and Nanhua at the Jingwu General Association's gymnasium, the former displayed skilled techniques and had the advantage of home turf. Veteran Li Longbiao secured three victories. Nanhua's main player, Lu Wenliang, was absent, and female player Cai Xiuyu stepped in. Despite her excellent performance, she ultimately succumbed to the physical disadvantage of being a woman after a grueling battle, ending in defeat. Zheng Jiakun and Zhong Zhihui's performances seemed less polished, resulting in Jingwu Huang defeating Nanhua with a score of 7-2. The Lin team, a "dark horse" in Group C1, faced the Dianying Hei team, whose strength was greatly reduced due to captain Zhu Zicai's absence. Despite Jian Yuan's valiant efforts to hold the team together, they narrowly lost 4-5, a regrettable outcome. Elsewhere, Luying Lü defeated Xinxing Bing with a dominant score of 9-0, and in Group C2, Lianshi Yi convincingly defeated Renren with a score of 8-1.

### After the Arrival of Large Denomination Notes

— Jing Wen

Large denomination notes have arrived, and the face value is even higher than most people expected. This can also be said to be taking the opportunity to "emerge." Anyway, everyone is already indifferent to numbers in the hundreds of thousands or millions. Even if million-yuan gold certificates come out together, the impact would probably be just the same.

The arrival of large denomination notes was preceded by "rumors," followed by "absolute denial," and finally "hesitant acceptance." The shy and afraid-to-meet-in-laws mentality fully demonstrates the awkward posture of an ugly daughter-in-law. However, it goes without saying how much credibility the so-called authorities still have in the eyes of the people.

Judging from the price situation, the issuance of large denomination notes was inevitable, without the need for so many roundabout pretenses. In fact, if they had been issued before prices had risen sharply, the market upswing would probably have been just the same. Now, waiting until prices have already risen before issuing them will inevitably encourage a new wave of price increases. The authorities keep saying that part of the price increase is due to human factors, but they have ignored this human factor when it comes to issuing large denomination notes.

After the issuance of large denomination notes, there will naturally be "as usual" some talk about "purely for the convenience of the people, to meet the needs of reality... If speculators take this opportunity to spread rumors and attempt to disrupt the financial market, they will be severely investigated according to the law," and the speculative market will "as usual" also have a few "small faces" appear, the nature of which is like a famous actor taking the stage, and there will always be a group of supporters and friends to join in the fun. However, what the facts are, it is advisable to review the "historical records" after the issuance of large denomination notes in the past.

The way of governing lies in honesty and trustworthiness. And the most undesirable thing is to engage in not-very-clever mystification. Before the war ends and the national budget is balanced, inflation is difficult to avoid, and rising prices are inevitable. The general public has long been psychologically prepared for this, so the issuance of large denomination notes can fully adapt to the "needs of reality." Issue them when necessary, without tightening credit beforehand, creating an atmosphere, and still half-heartedly giving speculators opportunities, causing honest people to suffer more, and the result is nothing more than the government undermining its own credibility.

I believe that the big problem in today's politics is not that there is no way to solve everything, but that they want to cover up their inability to solve it when there is no way. For example, every time prices rise, the authorities in various places, as usual, always have some talk about selling off goods and suppressing speculation, as if this price increase is the last price increase. I believe that although the authorities may have their difficulties and sincerity, they always inevitably feel a sense of powerlessness. Given the production conditions of today, the so-called selling off of materials must have a limit. What's more, those who actually control the materials are not only unwilling to sell them casually, but sometimes they are even leading the price increases! Even if they are willing to sell them, wasn't the policy of selling gold during President Song Ziwen's era simply met with rolling waves of banknotes?

Having no solution is not a dead end, as long as those in charge can be open and honest, tell the people the facts, discuss them with the people, and gain the people's trust, I believe there will be a solution. At least if you shrug your shoulders and show that you really have no solution, you can still gain the sympathy of others, which is much better than concealing the truth.

Concealing the fact that there is no solution will be the real no solution. Because concealing the fact that there is no solution means lacking the courage to reform in response to reality, and this will forever lead to no solution. Recent people have been talking about political reform, and political reform is naturally urgently needed, but the first thing that needs to be reformed is the old problem of concealing illness, which is to first reform the political problem of concealing failure. The past approach to the price problem was a failure. If we copy an old article again this time, it will inevitably be doomed to failure. Empty threats are useless, and even if we really "borrow a head" to use, it would at most only inject a shot of adrenaline. What's more, the real speculative "giants" cannot be "borrowed" casually before the old problem of concealing illness is reformed. Since the big fish can live freely, why bother sacrificing a few small fish!

How to handle the aftermath of the large denomination notes is the core of the problem. Selling goods and suppressing speculation have all been done in the past; naturally, they will have to be done in the future, but these methods all have a certain limit. Only by living within our means, balancing the budget, and publicly announcing the number of notes issued can we truly gain the trust of the people. It doesn't matter if a family goes bankrupt, but they should tell their family members the extent of the bankruptcy and jointly plan for the aftermath. That's the right way to do it.

### Three Notes on Zhao Guni

— Qian Dacheng

I have repeatedly described the posthumous affairs of Zhao Guni and published them in the Shen Bao. Regarding the origin of Guni's being appreciated by Duke Weng of Changshu, I am grateful to reader Mr. Yang for his corrections. However, what I heard from my hometown differs from what Mr. Yang said. Guni initially worked as an accountant for Yu Jinmen, the nephew of Duke Weng. When Duke Weng was dismissed from his position and lived at home, he had close relations with Jinmen, and Guni was able to be appreciated by Duke Weng. In the first month of the Jia Chen year of the Guangxu era, Guni drew a portrait of his deceased father, and Duke Weng wrote three poems, saying: "Zhao Zi is not a painter, he lies down to write his father's truth, even coughing in his dreams, the paper piles are all divine. Selling medicine is also an elegant affair, and the admonition is still earnest. Strive for poetry and learning, and do not mix with the vulgar." Guni was born in the Jia Xu year of the Tongzhi era and was thirty-one years old this year.

I also heard that Guni raised the son of a friend and, when he grew up, recommended him to Master Miqi Ni Shen, a local gentleman, to serve as an accountant. The friend's son suddenly fell ill with typhoid fever. Master Miqi Zhai, Mr. Shen Chengbo, hired a doctor and prescribed medicine. Guni also hired a doctor. One advocated for purgative medicine, and the other advocated for cooling medicine. The two doctors argued endlessly, and Guni and Mr. Chengbo also argued incessantly. In the end, both warm and cool medicines were administered, and the friend's son died. Guni did not set foot in the Shen family for many years. Such was his courage to take responsibility.

Guni served in the Shen Shiyou family for a long time, but later did not visit Shiyou's house for a long time. Shiyou was angry and said to him one day when they met: "I have a lower couplet, try to match it." The couplet said: "Poverty ends, poor friends do not come to the door." At that time, Shiyou had been married to his daughter for some time, and his son-in-law was a rich man who often visited his father-in-law's house, and Shiyou would smoke opium with him. Guni knew about this and responded with "More gold, a quick son-in-law climbs the couch" to mock him, and Shiyou could do nothing about it. Such was his humor and cynicism.

### Anecdotes of the Hermit of Linwu Mountain

— Chen Zuogao

Suffering from the heat at home, I accidentally checked old books and found the posthumous works of the Hermit of Linwu Mountain. After looking at them, I imagined the man and collected anecdotes to supplement what was not achieved in the biography. The mountain man's surname was Bu, his name was Xiangfen, his character was Zhangwu, and he was from Qixian County, Henan Province. He was a tribute student in the Ding You year of the late Qing Dynasty and was the twelfth-ranked Juren in the Gui Mao year in Beijing. There were five brothers, three Jinshi and two Juren, and the family was known as a family of many scholars. The mountain man's writing strives to follow the style of Liu Zongyuan. His poems in the ancient style follow the Han and Wei dynasties, and his poems in the modern style follow the Tang Dynasty. He was especially good at collecting Du Lian, like Zhu Zhang Guwei's Huanju Lu, but unfortunately, it is not seen today.

When Yuan Shikai was training troops in Xiaozhan, the mountain man and Duan Qirui Wang Shizhen were all Yuan's staff, participating in confidential matters, and their positions were considered equal. Since the Renzi year, he has still assisted Xiangcheng, serving as secretary of the Presidential Palace and Daoyin of Shandong Province. When the imperial system was proposed, he went south with Yuan Zi Hanyun (Kewen) and settled in the Jishui Society in Shanghai, calling himself the Hermit of Linwu Mountain.

The mountain man initially relied on writing for a living and later practiced medicine to help the world. At that time, Shan Nong from Tiantai Mountain had the friendship of Jinlan and wrote an inscription for him: "Ten Generations of Confucian Doctors, Hermit of Linwu Mountain." People suspected that his trace was close to Jianghu, and few people sought his diagnosis. Although he had the skills of Bian Que, his name was buried and obscure. I remember when I was young, I suffered from an acute illness, and after a pulse diagnosis, the illness suddenly improved. According to him, between the Guangxu and Xuan Dynasty periods, seventeen members of his family died of illness in three years, so he was determined to study Qihuang and gained a deep understanding of it. There is also a secret recipe for treating hoarseness, with more than ten ingredients, which is extremely effective. Tan Xinpei obtained it from the palace, knowing that Hanyun had a serious illness, so he specially sent this recipe, which the mountain man copied from Yuan's place. He can also treat breast cancer. I once recorded these two secret recipes and gave them to my elder brother Julai, but they have been lost for a long time. The recipe for treating cancer, which includes a pair of scorpions, is still memorable. He once said: "Pain belongs to external symptoms and should be treated with internal medicine. Eye problems are internal diseases and should be treated with external medicine. This is why I am effective."

The mountain man was proficient in music and enjoyed listening to operas, and he liked to make close friends with famous actors. For a time, people like Tan Xinpei, Yang Xiaolou, and Yu Shuyan had frequent exchanges with him, and he wrote many articles praising them. There were also no fewer than a hundred female actors who were like adopted daughters to him, such as Wang Keqin, Yanqin, Xin Yanqiu, and Wang Yurong. Although the mountain man had many adopted daughters, he was extremely dignified and self-restrained. Therefore, he lived in the Jishui Society, which was transformed from Jiyunxuan because female historians were not allowed to stay there, which can show the strictness of his life. Moreover, his room was extremely small and crowded, and there were often many snot and saliva on his desk, which also shows his unconventional and unconventional nature.

In his small room, wine and cigarettes were piled up like hills. He drank a bottle of brandy and two cans of cigarettes every day, truly embodying Liu Ling's love. If he had lived in today's era of soaring prices, the cost of one day would have been no less than twenty or thirty million. He was immersed in the world of wine and medicine, and some say that this is why he could not reach the age of centenarians. The day he died was the same day as the writer Ye Yusen, and their funerals were both held in the Chinese Funeral Home, which is even more of a strange event.

When the United Nations handled post-war relief for countries affected by the war, one country expressed its willingness to give up assistance because other countries were more severely affected. This country was Abyssinia.

Although the British government is very poor, British people whose property was lost due to bombing during the war are still compensated by the government. The total cost is £44.5 million (approximately $180 million), and the number of people compensated is 250,000.

A survey of 437 of the largest stores in 20 major cities in the United States found that 80% of them worked only five days a week, meaning employees had two days off each week.

### Musings

— You Ting

If the world suddenly achieves complete and comprehensive peace, the first thing to spread across the globe will be harmonious and lovely music, followed by the sound of firecrackers.

This music includes the sound of church bells, the singing of the people, and the "impromptu" pieces that people play on the piano as they please, never heard in the world before. This music is not "technical" but what the world calls a gift from heaven.

A few painters from different schools cannot collaborate on a complete painting, but hundreds of musicians of different nationalities can form a symphony orchestra. Therefore, the symbol of music is harmony and cooperation; by extension, it means one world.

I wonder if the Nobel Peace Prize could be used to solicit a "One World Symphony." Its content should emphasize harmony, coordination, and cooperation, while also melting and refining the folk music styles of various countries into one. It might as well imitate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, adding a vocal part with Esperanto lyrics, emphasizing universal love and non-aggression.

I would also like to suggest to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): organize an unprecedentedly large world symphony orchestra, including players of all different races and countries. The orchestra should be named "One World." And let it cry out for peace in a world filled with bloodshed, with holy and benevolent sounds!

Washington Dispatch: General Pershing, the American commander in World War I, passed away at 3:50 AM on July 15th at the Army Hospital. Such a distinguished and brave general, possessing great wisdom and courage, had almost been forgotten by the world. Now, with the news of his passing, recalling his personal achievements brings to mind the previous World War, as if it were happening now. He lived to the ripe old age of 87 (or 88 according to Chinese reckoning), and had been ill for nearly ten years. In 1918, he led a large army to expedition in Europe, overthrowing the tyrannical Germans and ending the Great War. At the age of 50, his command was decisive and full of vigor.

The transliteration of Pershing as 潘興 is not entirely accurate, but the traditional Chinese method of transliterating it as a surname "潘" is quite interesting. According to Smith's "America's Participation in the War," Pershing's biography reveals that in his youth, he fought in numerous battles, such as the Indian Wars, the Spanish-American War, and the Philippine Campaign, all of which earned him great merit and made him known as the most outstanding military commander in the world. The United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, and the first batch of one million American troops, led by Pershing, arrived in Europe in February 1918. Working with the local French forces, they destroyed the German forces attacking the Salient, greatly enhancing the prestige of the United States. Germany's attempt to invade Reims to attack Paris was also thwarted. French General Mangin praised the great success of the allied forces. In September of that year, Germany was forced to retreat to the Hindenburg Line, unable to recover. American troops continued to arrive, reaching as many as two million by October. Among the Allied powers, only France exceeded the United States in troop numbers. (Britain contributed 1.7 million, and France more than 2.5 million, but France, as a continental country, was fighting on its own doorstep, so this was not considered excessive.) General Pershing commanded the troops, making flawless plans, winning every battle and capturing every target. His talent as a general was no less than that of General Eisenhower in World War II. He can be compared to General Pan Mei of the early Song dynasty in Chinese history. Pan Mei conquered the Northern Han in Jin, subdued the Southern Tang in Wu, and pacified the Southern Han in Yue, accustomed to winning victories in expeditions far away, also no ordinary man. (The Pan Renmei in dramas and novels deviates greatly from historical facts and is not credible.)

In the previous Great War, the United States only joined in the fourth year, after Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and others had fought bitterly with Germany and Austria for three years. The United States participated for only a few months and achieved complete success. Some praised it as a miraculous achievement, while others ridiculed it as "putting on a show to subdue demons" (referring to the theatrical trope where heavenly soldiers and generals fight demons in many scenes, and then a Bodhisattva appears, gives a few commands, and immediately subdues them). However, the final statistics show that the American side lost over 70,000 soldiers, over 190,000 were wounded, and the total number of missing persons was 300,000, which is not insignificant. Although the combat period was relatively short, American strength was still largely responsible for the courage in battle and the collapse of the enemy. Pershing was the fifth person to receive the "Five-Star" decoration, and is indeed the senior predecessor of current Generals Eisenhower and Marshall.

Among the great generals who enjoyed long lives, there was Hindenburg of Germany, who became president after the war, but endured the shame of a defeated nation until his death. Foch and Joffre of France have passed away long ago. Petain, although he lived to be ninety, became the leader of the pro-German government in the Second World War, disgracing his country and himself, which is both sad and pitiable. How could he compare to General Pershing, who retired after his success, living a leisurely life, from the extreme of brilliance to ordinariness, completing his life from beginning to end? His military achievements were not only outstanding, but his integrity also surpassed his peers. Is he not an extraordinary person?
