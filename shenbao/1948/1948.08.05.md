### Assisting in the Revival of Rural China: Exchange of Notes Between China and the U.S. in Beijing This Morning; Five-Member Committee to be Officially Established

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The exchange of notes between China and the United States regarding the Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction in China, as stipulated in the U.S. aid program for China, will be signed and exchanged by Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stuart at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 5th. According to the provisions of this exchange of notes, the committee, composed of two American experts appointed by President Truman and three Chinese experts appointed by President Chiang, will be formally established. Under the guidance and management of Mr. Raymond Brooks, ten percent of the income from the sale of U.S. aid materials will be used to formulate and implement a plan for rural reconstruction in China, including necessary research and training activities. However, this work will only be supported by this U.S. aid program until the funds are exhausted.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Executive Yuan approved on the 4th the exchange of notes regarding the Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction stipulated in the U.S. loan. It is reported that the chairman of the Joint Committee will be a Chinese national, and Yan Yangchu has been internally appointed. An American, Mr. Ravenholt, will also be a member. However, the appointment of the members is made by the President, so after the exchange of notes is signed, the committee can be established after the President issues the appointment order. Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Yan to ask for his opinions on rural reconstruction. Mr. Yan humbly stated that the selection of committee members has not yet been finalized, and he does not intend to make any statements. However, regarding the name of rural reconstruction, he said: "Rural reconstruction should be changed to 'village construction' because the scope of villages is larger than that of rural areas, and our rural areas have never been prosperous in the past, so how can there be reconstruction?" Furthermore, the English translation should also be "village construction." Regarding the use of this loan, Mr. Yan believes that it should be used appropriately and its effectiveness should be fully utilized. He hopes that it can be used for the people and that key areas should be selected for implementation first. The reporter then asked whether it would be used exclusively for land reform, agricultural production, water conservancy, etc. Mr. Yan replied in the negative. Village education is also important and is one of the objects of use.

### Implementation of the Aid-China Plan to be Negotiated in Beijing Soon; Stillman to Return to China This Weekend

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Stillman, head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's technical survey team in China, will return to Nanjing this weekend to begin negotiations with the Chinese government on the plans that the Economic Cooperation Administration will fund under the Aid-China plan. After arriving here yesterday, Stillman discussed China's construction plans with Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman and other officials of the agency. He will bring with him clear instructions when he returns to China as a guide for future negotiations. These negotiations will be conducted by Raymond Brooks, director of the China Branch of the agency. Stillman told reporters that they are quite clear about the situation in China, and the purpose of his return to Washington is to assist in making decisions on the many plans proposed by Chinese officials and non-officials. As for the claim that he brought back a list of plans to be implemented as soon as possible for the Economic Cooperation Administration to approve, it is inaccurate. Stillman also declined to disclose the contents of his report to the officials here. This report, like other reports by American officials on China, is full of secrecy. He emphasized that if there is any report on China's construction plan, then the report will be a joint report issued by the China U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration after detailed and full discussion and negotiation. Stillman replied to reporters' questions that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway did request 20 million U.S. dollars for repairs, and the request is under consideration. As for whether any plans north of the Yangtze River are also under consideration, he could not say: "I indicated that the Economic Cooperation Administration must first decide on a policy for this type of plan and then discuss it with China." The reporter also asked about the construction plans in North China, and he replied: "These plans are now under careful consideration." He admitted that the war in the area is clearly related to the delay in the implementation of these plans. As for the general possibility of the Economic Cooperation Administration implementing China's construction plans, he explained that the possibility of implementation varies from region to region, which clearly refers to the political and military situation in various regions. He mostly avoided answering questions such as when a certain plan will be implemented and how much it will cost. When discussing official and non-official plans, he said: "We have asked both parties to explain their needs and will not favor any one party." Regarding the report that the Economic Cooperation Administration has already approved privately-run occupations, he did not comment. He said that the policy for purchasing industrial raw materials and equipment required for construction plans is still to be drafted. As for whether the state will purchase them without going through private trade channels, he also refused to explain. He only said: "This remains to be agreed upon with China." He further discussed the issue of China's cooperation, saying: "We have indeed obtained China's cooperation and expect the Chinese government to fully cooperate." Stillman concluded by saying that the cost of the plans proposed by Chinese people is two or three times greater than the 60 million U.S. dollars allocated in the 275 million U.S. dollar Economic Aid to China plan, so these plans must be reduced to be commensurate with the funds that can be used.

The main force of the bandits has been gathering in Jinyuan, Qingyuan, Xugou, Taigu, Yucheng, and other places in recent days.

### End of Party Affairs Forum: Important Suggestions for Reform Work, to be Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Formulation of a Plan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Kuomintang Party Affairs Forum, held for two consecutive days, concluded on the afternoon of the 4th. The theme of this forum was to discuss the reform of party affairs. The attending Central Committee members and Legislative and Supervisory Committee party members made frank and straightforward criticisms of the successes and failures of past party affairs and put forward several important suggestions for the reform of party affairs in the future. They almost unanimously believed that the improvement of the party was a matter of urgency. At the end of the meeting on the 4th, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng summarized the opinions of the committee members and stated that these opinions would be organized by the Central Secretariat and submitted to the Central Standing Committee for the formulation of a plan, which would then be submitted to the Director-General for approval. The original text of Secretary-General Wu's report is as follows: This forum has yielded many valuable opinions. Many of these opinions are consistent among the comrades, such as: (1) strengthening the shared beliefs and mutual trust of comrades, and enhancing the revolutionary spirit and work enthusiasm of party members; (2) establishing a new work style for the party, earnestly implementing new guidelines, and using new appeals to strengthen the people's belief in the party; (3) the party should truly represent the interests of the people, thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and ultimately accomplish the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation; (4) selecting new cadres, reorganizing party departments at all levels, refreshing personnel organization, and cultivating new forces for the party; (5) effectively managing party members in government, urging them to implement the ideology and policies, and exert the party's leadership; (6) recruiting a large number of farmers, workers, youth, and intellectuals into the party to serve as the main force of the revolution; (7) conducting property registration for party members, eliminating corrupt elements, and preserving the party's revolutionary nature and purity; (8) the party's reform must be integrated with practical military, political, and economic reforms; the party's reform must make it a driving force for political reform, but political reform is the concrete manifestation of the party's reform. The above points are generally consistent opinions, but there are also some other important issues where comrades have different views, and consensus needs to be reached through further detailed discussion by the General Directorate:

(1) Regarding the issue of factions within the party, some advocate that factions must be completely eliminated to rebuild a party with unified will and concentrated power, while others advocate that under the principle of one leader and one ideology, groups with different political views may be recognized to carry out reasonable activities, divide labor and cooperate, and enable them to compete and promote progress. (2) Regarding the issue of the party's social base, some advocate that the party should represent a certain social class, especially farmers, workers, and revolutionary young intellectuals, while others believe that the party represents the entire people and cannot strictly define representing the interests of a certain class. (3) Regarding the issue of party member registration, some comrades advocate that party members should be re-registered to strictly eliminate corrupt elements, while others believe that after the merger of the party and the corps, a general registration of party members and corps members has already been carried out, and although it has now ended, it can be continued without the need for a new round of registration. In addition, there are various other valuable opinions, which the Secretariat has recorded one by one and submitted to the Director-General for review, and plans to distribute them to all comrades for reference and study. Those who have not yet expressed their opinions or have not had the opportunity to speak are requested to send them to the Secretariat in writing as soon as possible. If comrades who have already spoken have unfinished thoughts or are concerned that the Secretariat's records are not good and may have lost the original meaning, please also submit them in writing as a supplement, and they will be compiled and reported to the Director-General.

This forum was held after the first session of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan adjourned. The Central Government deeply felt the importance and urgency of how to communicate the opinions of responsible comrades of the party's power organs and the party comrades of the state policy-making organs after the implementation of the Constitution. Therefore, a forum was specially held to humbly listen to feedback and solicit the opinions of Central Committee members and Legislative and Supervisory Yuan committee members in Beijing as an important basis for the party's reform plan. This forum is of great significance. The Director-General has repeatedly given instructions, expressing the determination to reform the party. The Central Standing Committee has also conducted research and discussion. However, due to the short time, it was not possible to conduct a detailed discussion. Moreover, many Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and comrades have already left Beijing. If there is an opportunity in the future, it is hoped that another forum can be convened to solicit the opinions of all comrades on the materials compiled from this forum. This party reform movement has been prompted by the times and the environment. Both domestic and foreign parties expect the reform of this party very much. Only the reform of the Chinese Kuomintang can bring new strength and save the crisis of the country and the nation. The domestic and international situation no longer allows this party to hesitate and waver. Therefore, this reform movement can only succeed and cannot fail. This party affairs forum is constructive and proactive. The large number of participants and the enthusiastic and frank speeches of the comrades show that the comrades care about the future of the party. This gives the party reform movement unlimited strength. It is believed that the party reform movement will have a bright future and will definitely produce results.

### New Economic and Financial Policy Plan to Be Discussed by the Executive Yuan the Day After Tomorrow; Financial Portion to Be Announced and Implemented First

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The new economic and financial policy plan of Weng Wenhao was still not submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 4th. According to sources close to Weng, it is still being finalized. The Executive Yuan will hold a special meeting on the 7th, and it may be submitted for discussion at that time. It is also learned that the financial portion of the plan will be announced and implemented first. After the effectiveness has been observed, the other portions will be implemented one by one. Regarding the portion of the plan that regulates the inspection of banks, it is rumored that the number of the existing 6,000 banks will be reduced to 2,000. The intention is not as simple as imagined; if they do not comply with the regulations, they will be subject to closure, but there will be no one-time closure or other abrupt measures. After the Executive Yuan meeting on the 4th, it was once rumored that Weng's cabinet's new economic and financial policy plan would be announced at 4 pm, but it was quickly proven to be a false rumor. Since the publication of the editorial "Reforming the Economic Hub" in the Central Daily News on the 2nd, the serious proposition to regulate banks has attracted close attention from public and private banks in the capital. They are constantly inquiring about the contents of the plan and when it will be implemented. The number of telephone inquiries received by various newspapers is almost overwhelming. The banks have obviously entered a war of nerves due to the government's impending measures.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Finance, as of recently, a total of 5,912 public and private banks and money shops have been established nationwide, including 2,090 head offices and 3,822 branches. The detailed figures are as follows: (1) 7 national banks, with 868 branches; (2) 30 provincial bank head offices, with 1,121 branches; (3) 566 county and city bank head offices, with 232 branches; (4) 207 commercial bank head offices, with 1,113 branches; (5) 139 money shop head offices, with 108 branches; (6) 16 trust company head offices, with 17 branches; (7) 225 insurance company head offices, with 363 branches.

Editorial

### Do Not Forget the Close Relationship Between China and Siam

The anti-Chinese movement in Siam has not only not stopped, but seems to have intensified recently. As many as 270 Chinese schools have been closed, causing more than 20,000 Chinese children and young people to lose their schooling and thousands of Chinese teachers to lose their jobs. The Chinese government has repeatedly negotiated with the Siamese government, but has not achieved concrete results. Unexpectedly, while this outstanding issue has not yet been resolved, the Siamese Ministry of Interior has accused the Chinese Kuomintang of engaging in political activities in Siam as an infringement on Siam's national sovereignty. Even Siamese soldiers advocate strictly prohibiting overseas Chinese from entering the country, and the Siamese parliament will also resolve to reduce the quota from 10,000 to 5,000. All of this can be seen as the Siamese authorities' disregard for the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. In addition to hoping that our government will negotiate and argue on the basis of reason, we also hope that the Siamese government will remember its roots, not forget the contributions of overseas Chinese to the founding of Siam, and arbitrarily destroy and oppress them.

Frankly speaking, without China, how could Siam have its present state? The relationship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples dates back to thousands of years before the establishment of Siam. Western historians such as R.S. Wood have said: "The Siamese and Chinese people are of the same ethnic group. In prehistoric times, the two ethnic groups must have had the same origin." The ancestors of the Siamese people were called the Dai people in China, who were the Bai Pu in the Spring and Autumn period, and the descendants of the Yi barbarians. Since the Han and Tang Dynasties, they have been attached to China. Since the twelfth year of Yongping of Emperor Ming of Han, through Emperor Wen of Wei, Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Wenzong, Emperor Yizong, and Emperor Lizong of Song, for more than a thousand years, the Dai people have continued their lineage under the wings of the broad-minded spirit of benevolence of the Han people. The southern expedition of Emperor Shizu of Yuan then prompted the Dai people to expand into the Indochinese Peninsula, thereby establishing the Sukhothai Dynasty and creating today's Siam.

Further reading of the history of the three Siamese dynasties reveals that the hero most worshiped by the Siamese people was Ramkhamhaeng of the Sukhothai Dynasty, that is, Rama Mahathiraj, and this great king frequently paid tribute to China and invited Chinese workers to Siam. Since then, our overseas compatriots have gone there in a steady stream, developing Siam's industry and mining. They originally sowed rice on the soil and left it to fate. Our overseas Chinese taught them how to cultivate, and they had three harvests a year, becoming a rice-producing country. Today, their first export is rice. Speaking of art and culture, how could they not rely on the power of overseas Chinese to spread it? Ramkhamhaeng made his third visit to China in the fourth year of Dade during the reign of Emperor Chengzong, bringing many Chinese artistic workers with him, introducing the Chinese method of pottery making, and creating "Song Jia Yuan" porcelain, which is still treasured today.

The builder of the Bangkok Dynasty, Zheng Zhao, was 100% Chinese. He served in the Siamese court as a young man, and accumulated merit to become the governor. In the thirty-second year of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the Ayutthaya Dynasty of Siam was destroyed by Mang Ji Jue, the son of Ong Ji Ya, the king of Burma. Zheng Zhao rose up in response to the times, calling for the restoration of the country, leading warships up the Chao Phraya River, breaking the great city, killing the Burmese general Su Geli, and triumphantly returning to the old capital. The Siamese people rejoiced throughout the country, and honored this overseas Chinese hero as the King of Siam. He then successively quelled the various tribes, unified the country, conquered Cambodia, and expanded the territory, and was loved by the Siamese people.

Today, at least tens of millions of those who call themselves Siamese have Chinese ancestry. As King Rama VII of Siam said: "The blood of the Siamese people has been mixed with that of the Chinese people, and cannot be separated. Most of the senior officials of Siam, whether in the past or now, are of Chinese descent. Even I myself contain Chinese blood." Indeed, today there are countless officials in the Siamese court and magnates in the opposition who have Chinese ancestry. Even Luan Bilibo, the Siamese elder who was in power after the victory and has now fled, is actually Chinese. When he came to China the year before last, he himself repeatedly said that he was from Chaozhou, Guangdong.

The Chinese have written a glorious history for Siam. Of course, we do not seek gratitude, but unexpectedly, Siam has forgotten its roots. Rama V cut off relations with us after paying tribute in the fourteenth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. In the second year of Xuantong, Rama VI treated overseas Chinese harshly, causing a general strike in Bangkok. Since then, anti-Chinese sentiment has been unleashed and cannot be restrained. From treating overseas Chinese with courtesy, it has turned into mistreating overseas Chinese, and even discriminating against overseas Chinese as "Jews of the East."

Since Siam established the "Immigration Bureau" in the 17th year of the Republic of China, anti-Chinese sentiment has become more and more intense. In the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the "Bangkok Revolution" broke out, overthrowing the Rama VII royal regime. The following year, another "Second Revolution" broke out, purging the old-fashioned elements who were pro-British and pro-German, and turning to be pro-Japanese. In order to carry out its conspiracy to "appease Siam" in its southward policy, Japan took the opportunity to provoke the feelings between China and Siam, and made a major propaganda to Siam: "Overseas Chinese in Siam account for more than one-third of the Siamese population, and the entire economic machine of Siam is in the hands of the Chinese. Many people also have land rights. If these three problems are not resolved, Siam will have no opportunity for development for one day... " The Siamese authorities believed this and disregarded the traditional friendship between China and Siam, and repeatedly promulgated harsh regulations. In the field of overseas Chinese education, there were "Primary Education Regulations" and "Private School Regulations," which strictly limited Chinese from sending their children to official schools to learn Siamese, forced overseas Chinese schools to change to teaching Siamese, and added teaching Siamese geography and history. The principals had to be proficient in Siamese, otherwise they would be fined and imprisoned.

In the 26th year of the Republic of China, a coup d'état took place in Siam. Luan Pibun, the leader of the young military officers, the current ruler who has made a comeback, in order to please the people, did not hesitate to advocate "nationalism," staging a tragedy of anti-Chinese and Chinese-restricting, to win over the people. When our war of resistance against Japan broke out, the struggle between our overseas descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Japanese invaders and traitors became increasingly fierce. Japan then instigated Luan Pibun to change the country's name to "Thailand," showing its great ambition towards China, so that Siam distorted nationalism and came with the arrogant fascist politics. The patriotic and innovative argument was transformed into an anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese trend. Overseas Chinese became their "imaginary enemy," and the chairman of the chamber of commerce, Yi Guangyan, was finally assassinated by thugs in this anti-Chinese trend. Following the rehearsal of the "September 22" police massacre of overseas Chinese, we were oppressed and demonstrated against, and acted arbitrarily to the end. From small-scale conflicts, it turned into large-scale killings. The dead were wronged and their grievances were not redressed, and the living were displaced. The fate of the three million overseas Chinese in Siam faced the threat of death. Afterwards, "Thailand" was changed back to Siam, and it seemed that it relaxed a little on overseas Chinese, but the harsh regulations on overseas Chinese education remained unchanged. Overseas Chinese schools were barely opened in large cities, and they were still unable to open their doors in small villages and counties. After the coup, Luan Pibun, the famous executioner of anti-Chinese, took the stage again, so that the overall closure of overseas Chinese schools and the repatriation of overseas Chinese students to their home countries have become the current situation.

We have completely forgotten the close history, close geographical location, exchanged blood, and mutually beneficial economy between China and Siam, and we cannot but express infinite regret. In fact, even if the Siamese are forgetful, for the sake of peace in East Asia and for their own safety, they should not ignore the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. And in the Chinese government, so far there has not been any serious diplomatic action, watching our overseas compatriots being devastated and suppressed, which is also something that surprises us!

### President Cables Chairman of Hunan and Members of Provincial Assembly to Pay the Real Tax and Borrowing Quota as Scheduled; Cheng Qian Replies, Requesting to Send Senior Officials with Funds to Investigate the Disaster

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 4th] The President recently cabled Cheng Qian, Chairman of Hunan Province, and the Provincial Assembly that the real tax and borrowing for the 37th year of the Republic of China in Hunan should still be paid according to the quota. After receiving the cable, Cheng was very worried because the current floods have spread to 37 counties, and only one-tenth or two-tenths of the grain production in the lake area remains. The flood situation continues to rise, and the disaster area will continue to expand. In addition to replying that he would do his best to handle it, he also requested that senior officials be sent to Hunan with huge sums of money to investigate the disaster. According to the person in charge of the Farmers' Association, the floods in Hunan are serious, and all parties are calling for tax reduction and exemption. However, since Song Wen called for rent reduction and exemption, in areas where early rice has been harvested, landlords have used extremely strict measures to urge the collection of early rice rent. The disaster victims in Yiyang, Xiangyin, Yuanjiang, and other places are overwhelmed. The Provincial Farmers' Association is planning to formulate rent reduction principles to the Provincial Authorities to save tenant farmers from the floods.

[Another Cable] Cheng Qian, who is in charge of Hunan for the first time, announced the replacement of the commissioners of the 5th and 9th districts. Hu Bayue is the commissioner of the 5th district, and Chen Shi is the commissioner of the 9th district.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Regarding the request of Hubei Province to exempt this year's real tax and borrowing, the President recently replied to the Provincial Government, ordering it to pay the full amount according to the original quota.

### Qingdao's Five U.S. Military Housing Units; U.S. Only Has Leasehold Rights

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 4th] Regarding the sale of five U.S. military housing units in Qingdao, namely No. 9, Shanhai Pass Road, No. 1, Taipingjiao 1st Road, No. 1, Guangxi Road, and Nos. 6 and 7, Lanshan Road, the Executive Yuan had ordered the Municipal Government to issue ownership certificates. According to the Central Trust Bureau's letter stating the transfer situation, the Municipal Government issued temporary management certificates. The Executive Yuan recently decided to postpone the transfer of Nos. 6 and 7, Lanshan Road, as they are related to national defense.

### Measures Formulated to Handle Land in North China; North China Land Handling Committee Established

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters News: The North China Land Handling Committee was formally established on the 1st, with Zhou Beifeng as the chairman. The draft of the simplified rules for handling land problems formulated a few days ago has been officially named "Implementation Measures for Land Handling in the North China Pacification Zone." The regulations stipulate that land handling in this area will be carried out by farmers' associations composed of self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers, supervised by governments at all levels under the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Therefore, the North China Land Handling Committee will become the executing agency for handling land problems in North China. The difference between this land plan and the overall land reform plan of the Central China Pacification Zone is the method of collecting land price donations to support self-cultivating farmers. Half of the land price donations collected will be used to support self-cultivating farmers and organize cooperative farms. The remaining one-third will be used as the tax on the land being collected during the period of land price compensation. This will prevent tenant farmers who have been allocated land from being unable to repay the land price.

### Siamese Police Suddenly Arrest Overseas Chinese; Fifty-One People Accused of Illegally Seeking Funds; Another Thirteen People Accused of Organizing Secret Societies

[United Press, Bangkok, 4th] Siamese police recently unexpectedly rounded up 64 overseas Chinese. Although both Chinese Communist and Nationalist personnel are among them, observers here believe that this move is to prevent the Communists from imitating the Malaysian story and launching a rebellion. Siamese police claimed that they also obtained a large number of documents during the search, including a copy of the party's doctrine of "Soviet Democracy" and a report on the Communist Party's work in Siam. Fifty-one of the arrested overseas Chinese have been formally charged with illegally seeking funds, and the government plans to deport them. The remaining thirteen are accused of organizing secret societies. Siamese newspapers took this opportunity to promote that China wanted to conspire to "swallow Siam." The Chinese News Office then issued the following statement based on this: "The Chinese government's representative in Siam was greatly surprised by this report. This matter is enough to promote the Siamese hatred of China and is harmful to the friendship between the two countries, and the duty of the Chinese government's representative is to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. Zhong Bingqiang (transliteration), the Chinese Consul General in Bangkok, personally visited Major Luan Yotrakakosol, the police chief, to find out the truth about the so-called conspiracy to swallow Siam. The director tried his best to tell the Consul General that he had not found a conspiracy to swallow any country, and said that if there was such a thing, not only the newspaper's report, but the police station would have nipped it in the bud."

### Students at Beiping Vocational Schools Oppose Classes; Fighting Erupts at Changbai Teachers College; All Students Issue an Urgent Statement

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] Students from Changbai Teachers College in Northeast China studying in Beiping engaged in mutual assault in the dormitory courtyard on the 4th. Security authorities rushed to the college to mediate upon hearing the news. The students at the scene stated the cause of the fight to the security authorities and reported 18 vocational students who they claimed were disrupting order, forcing classmates to write letters, and opposing classes. Police and military police then searched the premises and found 15 people, including Guan Weishu, and various kinds of reactionary evidence. Along with two students, Li Renshan, who were involved in the conflict at the scene, they were taken to the Beiping Garrison Headquarters and are currently being interrogated.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] Since Changbai Teachers College in Northeast China moved to Beiping, the school authorities have been actively planning to resume classes. The acting president of the college summoned all students in Beiping on the 4th to give instructions and report on the resumption of classes. After Acting President Fang finished speaking, a group of vocational students opposed classes and threatened students who supported classes. This provoked opposition from most students who wanted to study peacefully, leading to arguments and then mutual assaults.

[Another Dispatch] All students of the National Changbai Normal College issued an urgent statement on the evening of the 4th, reporting the actions of 18 vocational students, including Fu Wenzong, explaining the course of events: They stated that the authorities' handling of the aftermath of the July 5th incident was making some headway, and the school's preparations for resuming classes were also about to be implemented. However, the vocational students, in order to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt the school and disturb public order, created topics out of thin air, posted illegal wall posters, opposed the Dean of Students Office, and insulted responsible teachers. When the Dean of Students tried to advise them, they refused to listen and instead held grudges, causing the entire Dean of Students staff to resign in anger. The resumption of classes that the majority of well-behaved students had been looking forward to for a long time was thus reduced to nothing. The vocational students even intensified their actions, guarding the school gate, prohibiting entry and exit, holding one meeting after another, and filling the air with reactionary slogans, causing good students to be insulted and feel ashamed. The students, witnessing this with heartache and unable to bear it any longer, in the interest of stability, studying, and upholding righteousness by putting public interests before family, reported the 18 vocational students, including Fu Wenzong and Ma Fangming, to the security authorities.

### Driven by Poverty and Illness, a Civil Servant in Beiping Dies Tragically by Jumping into a Well

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] A case of a civil servant in Beiping, driven by poverty and illness, committing suicide by jumping into a well has recently occurred. Hu Lianghe, a clerk in the Accounting Office of the Beiping Municipal Government and a native of Xiangshan, Zhejiang, had been working in the Municipal Government for two years.

His colleagues sent him to the hospital for treatment, but all hospitals refused him, citing a lack of available beds. Hu then requested a doctor to treat him in his dormitory in Yueya Lane. Because the Municipal Government still owed him his July salary, he was both ill and worried. The doctor told his friend that his condition was serious, leading him to contemplate death. At 3:30 AM on the 4th, Hu took advantage of people's inattention and jumped into the well in Yueya Lane, committing suicide. After being discovered, he had already been dead for some time. The body has been sent to the funeral parlor, and the Municipal Government's Welfare Committee has allocated 100 million yuan for funeral expenses.

### Sunspot Activity Reaches Its Peak This Year

Floods in Various Places Are Related to This

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 4th] The Taipei Astronomical Society recently announced that a group of small sunspots appeared on the 2nd at a location 37 degrees north latitude from the sun.

The number of sunspots will gradually decrease in the future, possibly reaching a minimum around 1953. Sunspot activity increases the amount of solar radiation, which makes rising air currents more active and dramatically increases rainfall. Therefore, the floods in various places this year seem to be related to this peak in sunspot activity.

### After Careful Study of Reports on Talks with the Soviets, the Three Nations Decide on Next Steps; New Instructions from the U.S. and French Governments Arrive in London; British Military Commander in Germany, Robertson, Summoned Home for Consultations

[Report] London, 4th Dispatch: The United States, Britain, and France are holding meetings here, exchanging opinions on the recent meeting between the three nations' special envoys and Stalin. Although secrecy is being maintained regarding the resumption of negotiations between the three nations and the Soviet Union to discuss the Berlin issue, officials have hinted at an optimistic atmosphere within the government. After holding talks here to protest to the Soviets and planning direct negotiations with Stalin, the three nations' representatives have resumed talks at the British Foreign Office. The U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, have both received new instructions from their respective governments and held lengthy discussions with the British Undersecretary of State, Strang, on the afternoon of the 4th, with the aim of exchanging the three nations' governments' views on the results of the meeting with Stalin.

[Report] London, 4th Dispatch: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have carefully studied the reports of the meetings between the three nations' special envoys and Stalin and are currently preparing to discuss taking the next steps. The main secrets at this stage are no more than the following two points: First, what demands will the Western nations make of Stalin, and what suggestions will they offer for convening a four-power conference? Second, what is the price that Stalin is demanding for lifting the Berlin blockade?

[Report] New York, 4th Dispatch: Regarding the situation after the meeting between the three nations' special envoys and Stalin, the White House and the State Department are maintaining the same silence. White House Press Secretary Ross said that he could not reveal anything at this time regarding the talks between the three nations' special envoys and Stalin.

### Poland Opposes West Germany Plan, Lodges Protest with Britain Again, Believes German Problem Should Be Resolved Through Four-Power Consultation

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd United Press] Poland has recently lodged a protest with Britain, protesting again the recent three-power conference held to discuss the German problem. The note was delivered to Foreign Secretary Bevin on July 30 by the Polish Ambassador to Britain.

[United Press, London, 3rd Dispatch] The publication of the Polish note a few hours after the holding of an important meeting in the Kremlin regarding the Berlin problem is particularly significant. The note stated, "The Polish government believes that coordinated action by the four powers is a just guarantee for a fair resolution of the German problem and security. We firmly believe that the conditions for such a resolution do exist, but the agreements concluded and binding by the four powers regarding Germany must be observed, and subsequent decisions should be made by the institutions mandated to discuss such decisions." The majority of the Polish note continues to criticize the policies of Western nations in the usual manner, accusing them of things like the Marshall Plan "will make participating countries political and economic vassals, and at the same time, there is a tendency to establish pre-war European economic organizations and use them to establish German ruling elements."

### Soviet Draft of the Danube River Convention is a Reappearance of the Iron Curtain Policy; UN Request to Send Observers to Meeting Denied

[British Information Service, London, 4th Dispatch] Vishinsky's draft of the Danube River Convention presented to the Belgrade Conference contains the "Iron Curtain" policy consistently used by the Soviet Union towards its vassal states, with the aim of allowing the Soviet Union to monopolize the river. The British opinion is in favor of maintaining the 1921 treaty, and the progress of the conference seems to have been stalled by Vishinsky's interference.

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 3rd Dispatch] The United Nations' request for permission to send special observers to the Belgrade Conference has been rejected by the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Nations will be unable to obtain arguments regarding the economic aspects of the Danube River situation at the conference, which are of great value, as the Danube River shipping issue has been included on the agenda of the Economic and Social Council.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 3rd Dispatch] The Danube River Conference held its fourth meeting today, chaired by Romanian Foreign Minister Ms. Pauker. Soviet representative Vishinsky and British representative had an intense debate over whether the 1921 Danube River Convention should be abolished. Baker reiterated that the Convention should continue to be in effect, pointing out that the Soviet Union's failure to participate in the conference at that time was because the Soviet Union had not yet participated in all international activities, and that no one had prevented it from participating in the 1912 Danube River Convention after the Soviet Union began participating in international activities. Vishinsky then delivered a long speech refuting the British representative's arguments and pointing out that the Western countries had already violated the 1921 Convention after the establishment of the 1938 Danube River Convention, so the latter was clearly invalid. Vishinsky also pointed out, "In your European Convention, Nazi Germany actually participated, but the Soviet Union had no seat." He claimed that the Soviet Union had requested to participate in the Danube River Conference in 1934, but it was not allowed for a long time, while Germany was finally allowed to attend. Vishinsky concluded the Soviet Union's position by saying, "Countries far from the Danube River certainly have no right to participate in the committee planning Danube River navigation." At this point, the conference was adjourned and scheduled to continue discussions tomorrow. Tomorrow's meeting will be chaired by the British representative.

### Malayan Communist Party's Attempt to Establish a Republic Thwarted by British Crackdown

[United Press, Singapore, 3rd Dispatch] Malayan Governor General MacDonald said in a national broadcast on the 3rd that the Communist Party had chosen August 3 to establish a Communist Republic of Malaya, but it was thwarted by mass arrests and British military action.

### U.S. Department of Justice Unable to Prosecute Communist Spy Case Due to Lack of Confirmation; Former Communist Chambers Accuses Multiple Spies Again

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Senior Justice Department officials said on the 3rd that former Communists Miss Bentley and Chambers had reported to the FBI before testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee about the Communist spy case, but after spending $500,000 on investigation for three years, sufficient evidence has still not been obtained to support prosecution. The Justice Department authorities are currently facing two problems: First, the documents that government officials allegedly gave Bentley to be forwarded to Moscow have not been obtained; second, anyone who is accused, if they are guilty, refuses to reveal the inside story and admit their guilt.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd Dispatch] Four individuals who once served as "New Deal" officials were identified on the 3rd by former Communist Chambers as important figures in a pre-war Communist underground organization, which was dedicated to carrying out espionage work for the Soviet Union and engaging in subversion of the U.S. government. These four individuals were once heads of the "Young Turks" of the New Deal. Their names are Pressman, Witt, and the Hiss brothers, Alger and Donald. They were accused by Chambers at the House Un-American Activities Committee. According to Chambers, he risked his life to leave the Communist Party in 1937. Chambers has been summoned to the committee to confirm the truthfulness of Miss Bentley's statement last week regarding Communist conspiracies and espionage work. The four individuals identified by Chambers today are the first ones that members of the Congressional committees investigating the Communist spy case have heard of. However, Chambers also identified multiple other "underground elements" that Miss Bentley identified last week, such as former Treasury Secretary White. Chambers, who once said that he did not know Miss Bentley, recently told the committee that Pen Lou, a former Treasury official and Air Force officer accused of being a Soviet spy, was one of the seven Communist "basic leaders" who worked in the government before the war. The other six are Pressman, the Hiss brothers, Kramer, Abbott, and Collins. Chambers also said that Witt was the leader of the underground organization in the Washington area. Witt once served as the Executive Secretary of the National Labor Relations Board. Abbott was once a powerful figure in the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and is now an organizer for Wallace's Progressive Party. The Hiss brothers held important positions in the State Department under the "New Deal" and have resigned from their positions in the past two years. Alger Hiss has now completed his duties as a senior economic and political advisor at the State Department and accompanied the late President Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference. Donald Hiss is now engaged in private legal affairs here. Pressman once served as a legal advisor to the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and later as the Chief Legal Advisor to the Works Progress Administration, resigning in 1937. Chambers supported Miss Bentley's accusation that former Treasury Secretary White cooperated with the underground organization during his tenure as a senior Treasury official. Chambers said that White, Pressman, and Alger Hiss were all members of the "backbone" organization of the Communist Party because they were all positioned within the government.

### The Mystery of Sleep: Scientific Research Results Sweep Away Past Misconceptions

[United States Information Service, Chicago, 3rd Dispatch] Sleep is one of the great mysteries of human life. Recent scientific research work in the United States has gradually shed light on it. Dr. Kleitman, director of the Sleep Laboratory, can be considered the most knowledgeable person about sleep. He has discovered some basic facts about sleep that can sweep away the misconceptions that are popular around the world today. At the same time, other researchers are also engaged in the study of sleep, viewing it as humanity's most convenient teacher and as a means of treating mental illnesses. After tens of thousands of trials over 25 years, Dr. Kleitman has proven that the common belief that moving the body during sleep is harmful to a night's rest is wrong. On average, everyone moves their body 20 to 45 times during sleep in order to give all parts of the body the opportunity to fully relax. He has also discovered that the 24-hour cycle of sleep and wakefulness can also be changed. He spent several weeks in a dark cave in the mountains, conducting various experiments, and found that if not affected by the cycle of day and night, humans can also have a cycle of 24 or 28 hours. This proves that the determination of this cycle is not based on the body's physiological need to sleep at a specific time. Based on scientific research, he has discovered that the arrival and awakening of sleep often go through six convenient steps, sometimes not very convenient. First, the pulse and heartbeat, and other physiological functions gradually slow down. Then, after a certain amount of time, the five senses gradually disappear, first the sense of hearing, then the sense of taste, then the sense of smell, then the sense of hearing (half of it is lost), and finally the sense of touch. When waking up, the process is the opposite.

### Looking to the Future of Berlin (Part 1)

— Translated by Zhang Ranshi

The storm in Berlin is not a harbinger of war. The strategy adopted by the Soviet Union in Berlin is currently one of "slowly tightening the noose," not a "lightning war."

American troops will remain stationed in Berlin, and the United Kingdom and France will take the same steps. However, the Soviet Union can take over Berlin at any time it pleases.

The "showdown" in the Berlin situation will likely occur in the winter of 1948. If there is no war, they will not withdraw from Berlin. But even without war, the Soviet Union will become the "master" in Berlin.

Berlin, like an isolated island, is located in the center of the Soviet occupation zone. It is a hundred miles away from West Germany, but all land and water transportation between it and West Germany is controlled by the Soviet Union. Apart from prolonged airlifts to transport supplies needed by Berliners from West Germany to Berlin, there is simply no other way. The game of cards and gestures between the two sides is expected to continue in Berlin. In the near future, the Berlin crisis will subside from a boil.

It seems impossible for the Berlin crisis to lead to war. Indeed, once a war starts, the Western powers will lose their power in Berlin. As for the Soviet Union, there is no benefit to it in a war occurring in a city under its control.

The result of the Berlin crisis may be an agreement between the two sides, with the Western powers allowing the Soviet Union to supply the German people of Berlin, while Western troops can still be stationed in Berlin. In this situation, the Western powers can avoid "retaliatory measures by the Soviet Union against Germans who are pro-Western," that is, the Western powers can protect German individuals who are pro-British, American, and French from suffering retaliatory measures from the Soviet Union.

At the same time, the turbulence of the Berlin crisis will temporarily subside without being resolved. The Soviet Union may ease the blockade of West Berlin, but this opportunity will only arise after its supplies begin to dwindle. The period when the Soviet Union eases the blockade of West Berlin will be around winter, because that is when Berlin needs coal.

If the Soviet blockade continues or resumes, then the United States, in retaliation, may cut off the supply of Bavarian water and energy to deal with the Soviet occupation zone. Air evacuation of the British, American, and French expatriates in Berlin is very likely. If the crisis becomes more intense, several hardline German leaders will fly out of Berlin, and some German people who prefer to reside in West Germany may also migrate out of the country.

The following events are likely to arise from the Berlin crisis:

Since the series of agreements from September 12, 1945, in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and France accepted the Soviet Union's right to regulate and control land and water transportation between Berlin and the West, the Soviet Union's squeezing of the Western powers in Berlin was expected.

As a result, the Soviet Union was not only able to cut off Berlin's railway, highway, and canal routes to the Western occupation zones, but also the three restricted air routes, which are also severely threatened by the patrols of Soviet fighter planes. The question now for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is how to maintain the real authority to administer the four sectors of Berlin.

The reason for the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is simply to control the city of Berlin, which is about the size of Chicago in the United States. Because Berlin has been the capital of Germany in both World Wars. With such a long history, the Soviet Union very much wants to make Berlin the capital of a communist government in order to control Germany. But the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are hindering this plan.

### Fire at a Warehouse on Zhongzheng East Road; A Large Quantity of Stored Pigments Destroyed; Fire Brought Under Control at 1 a.m. This Morning; Substantial Losses for Gonghelai

[Report from this newspaper] A fire suddenly broke out at 11:30 p.m. last night on the second floor of the French-owned Longdong Warehouse, located at No. B, Lane 11, on the Bund of Zhongzheng East Road (i.e., Avenue Édouard VII). Investigations revealed that the premises were mostly leased by the well-known pigment merchant Gonghelai, located at No. 29, Lane 2, Jiangxi South Road, in this city, for use as storage. It is reported that yesterday afternoon, the company had over a hundred barrels of various types of pigments, weighing 15 jin and 25 jin each, delivered to the warehouse, which may have been caused by a careless worker dropping a spark of fire. After the fire started, the building was quite sturdy, and the doors and windows were tightly closed, and the caretaker had left at 5 p.m., so it was not easy for the outside world to notice at the time. By the time the flames burst out of the windows, it was already beyond control. After receiving the report, the Fire Department immediately dispatched pump trucks from the Central, Xinkaihe, and Hongkou districts, which arrived one after another within a few minutes and started spraying water to put out the fire. However, because the doors and windows could not be opened, and the entire second and third floors had already become a sea of fire, rescue efforts were extremely difficult. After some effort, the doors and windows were pried open, and the water was concentrated to put out the fire. By 1 a.m. this morning, the fire was finally brought under control, but most of the pigments stored by Gonghelai on the second floor had been burned, and the rest were stained with water. For Gonghelai alone, the loss has exceeded several hundred billion. The French company Longdong Foreign Firm was originally the Chinese distributor of Three Stars Axe Brandy, but because imports have been restricted early on, the amount of stored goods is very small, and the loss is not large. According to an employee of Gonghelai Pigment Store, the pigments stored were all covered by fire insurance, and only a very small portion belonged to Gonghelai itself; the rest was goods already sold to customers. Also, during the big fire last night, the work of the Associated Press of America was suspended for an hour because it was adjacent to the Longdong Warehouse. The firefighters had not left by 3 a.m. this morning.

### Former Commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai; Kinoshita Arrested Again; Sufficient Evidence of Abusing Allied Personnel

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Major General Kinoshita Eiichi, the former commander of the military police in Shanghai, is said to have committed various atrocities against Allied prisoners of war. He has now been arrested at the request of the British government. Kinoshita was arrested once during the early days of the occupation of Japan, but was released due to insufficient evidence. His re-arrest is the result of discussions between the British Secretary of State for War, Shinwell, and the British judge in Singapore. The location of Kinoshita's trial has not yet been decided.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 4th] At the request of the United Kingdom, the occupation authorities arrested Major General Kinoshita on the 4th, who served as the commander of the Japanese Garrison in Shanghai in 1942, because Kinoshita committed brutal crimes in the famous Hashihama Mansion in Shanghai. Sergeant Major Yoshida Sakae, who was subordinate to Major General Kinoshita in Shanghai, was also arrested. According to a British spokesman, he believes that there is now sufficient evidence to accuse the two of responsibility for mistreating more than 20 Allied personnel. These people were subjected to torture and starvation in the Hashihama Mansion prison.

### Informant Colludes with Economic Police; Embezzles Thirty Taels of Gold Jewelry; Police Squad Leader Testifies in Court; Two Fugitive Police Officers Are Highly Suspected; Emphatically States That the Detained Squad Leader Is Honest and Reliable

[Report from this newspaper] Judge Wu Xiangzu of the District Court opened a trial yesterday afternoon for a case of dereliction of duty. A cotton cloth broker named Wu Bofan was acquainted with police officer Zhang Lin. Having heard that he could receive a 30% reward for reporting black market gold and currency organizations, he entrusted his friends Zhou Yunshan and Zhou Kuang to help him inquire about gold and currency trading organizations, hoping to obtain the reward. His brother-in-law Shao Xingnan also participated in the reporting group. Wu then unintentionally heard Tong Xiangxiuquan and Zhou Jingwei talking about the Baokang Silver Store at No. 702, Xinzha Road, engaging in gold and currency trading. He then gathered the Zhou brothers, Xiang Xiuquan, Zhou Jingwei, etc., and opened the Jielu Hotel to discuss the reporting method, deciding that Zhou Yunshan would use the pseudonym Wu Zhen and report to the Economic Police Brigade.

On the morning of February 23 of this year, Squad Leader Wang Shuci of the Economic Police Squad 6 was assigned to lead police officers Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, along with the informants, to the Baokang Silver Store for a search. As a result, they found more than 40 small gold bars and 270 million yuan in legal tender in the store, and a jewelry box containing about 100 taels of gold jewelry upstairs, all of which were sealed by Wang Shuci. At that time, the store employee Shen Guigen protested, saying: "The Social Affairs Bureau has an order that buying and selling gold jewelry is not illegal," and requested the return of the gold jewelry. After Wang considered it, he returned all 100 taels of gold jewelry, but retained the gold bars and legal tender account books. However, the informants Wu Bofan and others thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and persuaded Zhang Lin to take 30 taels of gold jewelry from the 100 taels, and only return 70 taels to Baokang Silver Store. The next day, Zhang Lin met with Wu and others at the YMCA in the Western Concession and divided up the 30 taels of gold jewelry for their own use. Later, Zhang Lin and Gao Rucheng, two economic police officers, fearing that the incident would be discovered, asked for leave from the team and never returned. When Director Yu Shuping received the report, he detained Wang Li Zhang, while the two police officers Zhang and Gao disappeared. According to Wang's confession, Wu Bofan and other six people were arrested one after another, and a portion of the original stolen goods was recovered and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. As a result, a public prosecution was filed. Except for Wang, who was detained, the others were released on bail of 500 million each to await trial.

The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon and interrogated each defendant one by one. Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade, also appeared in court to testify, stating the details of the case. He expressed his trust in the honesty and reliability of Squad Leader Wang Shuci, and believed that the suspicion against the two police officers Zhang and Gao was serious because they took leave and did not return. Warrants have now been issued for their arrest. The court ordered a postponement for further trial, Wang Shuci was remanded in custody, and the suspects were released on their original bail.

### Jiangyin Father and Son Collusion with Bandits Case; Kong Rusheng Escorted to Shanghai for Confrontation

[Report from our Jiangyin correspondent, 4th] Kong Rusheng, 19 years old, from Beimanshui Village, Zhutang, Jiangyin, and his father, Kong Yisheng (also known as A Xiang), used to be the leader of the peasant movement group under the command of the notorious bandit Yu Zaitang, who has been killed. He often engaged in secret activities in Shanghai. On the 14th day of the third lunar month of this year, Kong's father ordered his son Rusheng to take a secret letter, a map, and a "Guoxun" magazine back to Cheng, to be delivered to the bandit army. Rusheng returned to his hometown and stayed at the home of his uncle Wu Anfu. He was arrested by the village self-defense team, and letters and other items were found, which involved the bandit's work in great detail. After being interrogated by the county military court, it was learned that his father had been introduced by Yu to work for the bandit army for more than three years and currently lived at No. 13, Jia 9, Bao 3, Xishazhai, Shanghai. According to the confession, the county government sent a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau to go to the address to arrest Kong Yisheng, who was sent to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation. Kong categorically denied the charges. The Shanghai Waiting for Trial Criminal Court sent a letter to the county, urging the quick escort of his son Rusheng to Shanghai for confrontation. The county government approved the letter and dispatched police to escort Kong Rusheng and the relevant case files to Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd, to be interrogated by the Special Criminal Court.

### Rong Hongyuan Wins Lawsuit for Return of Deposit for Indian Cotton

[Report from this newspaper] Rong Hongyuan of Shenxin Textile Company ordered 3,000 bales of Indian cotton from Gandhi Bial (B.R. Gandhi), an agent of Peichang Foreign Firm, on September 30, 1946, and signed three contracts. Rong paid a deposit of 10% of the total value of the goods, totaling 113,500 rupees. However, since the government announced the amended Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade in November of the same year, cotton imports were restricted, and the order could not be fulfilled, and the contract signed by both parties was terminated due to the inability to deliver the goods. Rong wrote a letter on April 31 of this year to demand the return of the deposit, but Gandhi claimed that the ordered goods had been sold at a low price and wanted to seek compensation for huge losses from Rong. Rong then filed a lawsuit with the District Court, requesting a judgment to return the principal and interest of the deposit, and providing security to request a preliminary execution. This case was recently decided by the Civil Court of the District Court, with the main text of the judgment stating: "The defendant shall return to the plaintiff 113,500 rupees, and pay the plaintiff interest calculated at an annual rate of 5% from December 31, 1946, until the date of termination of the execution, all of which shall be paid in legal tender converted at the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank on the date of payment. The preliminary execution of this case is approved after the plaintiff provides security of 6 billion legal tender. However, if the defendant provides security of 12 billion legal tender in advance, the preliminary execution shall be waived."

### Wharf Workers of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on Hunger Strike; Negotiations Ineffective and at a Standstill

Xu Jinzhou, an employee of the First Wharf of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was dismissed from his position by the Wharf Department, which triggered a hunger strike protest by members and non-members of the wharf union. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, representatives of the warehouse workers' branch of the company negotiated with the Wharf Department again, but made no progress. The workers' side is determined to continue the hunger strike to the end, and the situation has reached a standstill. The warehouse workers' branch of the company has reported the matter to the Shanghai Warehouse and Cargo Handling Workers' Union for handling.

In addition, a letter from the Wharf Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stated: "Xu Jinzhou was in charge of forwarding the night work meal allowance for wharf employees from July 1st to 5th, but he failed to distribute the allowance to six employees: Feng Renhua, Hou Fuchang, Deng Zixiong, Su Hanhun, Wu Zhaoyuan, and Bei Zhixin for one to two days. Only after being questioned by the employees did he issue the allowance. This appears to be an intentional act to cause the comrades to lose their deserved benefits, which is not comparable to ordinary negligence, and Hou Fuchang provided a letter to prove it. He was given a dismissal to warn others."

### Finding a Diamond Ring in the Trash; A Fleeting Moment of Joy

Recently, Zhou Huzhi, a poor scavenger, submitted a letter to Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, claiming that he had found a diamond ring that was illegally confiscated by the police. He appealed for instructions for its return. Zhou Huzhi originally scavenged for trash in the Xiaohuangpu garbage dump in the Si Sheng District of Pudong. On the afternoon of July 26th, he found a diamond ring with four diamonds. At the time, he did not know if it was real or fake. The next day, he and his wife, Chen Zhou Shi, went to the home of their Shanghai friend Sun Defang for a meal. Afterward, they took the diamond ring to the Xiguan Jewelry Company at 294 Jing'an Temple Road to sell it. The shop assistant offered 100 million yuan, so he concluded that it was not a fake and refused to sell it. Later, another shop assistant offered 200 million yuan, but Zhou still refused to sell it. The shop assistant then became aggressive, asking where the ring came from. Zhou told him that he had found it in the garbage dump. However, when Zhou Huzhi left the shop, the shop assistant followed him and reported him to the police officer on duty, who brought him to the Xin Cheng branch bureau. Jiao Guorui of the Judicial Section of the branch bureau interrogated him and kept the diamond ring. Zhou is now very dissatisfied with this and has hired lawyer Yang Junlin to submit a request to Mayor Wu for the return of the diamond ring.

Not Reconciled to the Police Confiscation; Submits Letter to the Mayor and Speaker Requesting Order for Return

### Factors for Price Increases in Public Utilities Beyond Control of City Authorities; Zhao Huijue Briefs Reporters on the Process of Adjusting Prices

[Report from this newspaper] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, held a press conference at the Municipal Government at 5:00 PM yesterday, reporting on the process of adjusting the prices of public utilities for August. He stated that the authorities had made their best efforts to alleviate the rising trend of public utility prices. On August 2nd, when the Public Utilities Bureau convened a price adjustment meeting, they argued with the heads of the various trade associations for over six hours, ultimately reducing the requested multiples by the companies by two to three times. The price increases of public utilities are beyond the control of the municipal authorities. The continuous increase in foreign exchange rates and fuel prices has the greatest impact on the cost of public utilities. Although Mayor Wu decided at the last emergency meeting that the coal and fuel used by public utilities would be settled in foreign exchange once at the beginning of the month, with the funds borrowed from the Central Bank, execution has been difficult. The total amount of goods and education required is approximately 10 trillion yuan, but the Central Bank has reduced the advance amount to 5.5 trillion yuan due to the excessive amount of the advance.

Oil Companies Agree to a One-Time Purchase Reluctantly

Director Zhao continued, "In order to stabilize oil prices for public utilities, Mayor Wu convened the heads of the various oil companies this morning (i.e., yesterday) to explain the importance of the relationship between public utilities and citizens' lives, and asked for their assistance. After repeated negotiations, the companies reluctantly agreed to allow a one-time purchase for public utilities this month, but solemnly declared that it would not be an example for the future. However, the current US dollar exchange rate (with linked exchange certificate) has risen to 6 million yuan, and the amount of oil that the companies can purchase with the loaned funds has been reduced due to the reduction in the amount approved, originally only enough to purchase 20 days' worth of oil, but now the US dollar exchange rate has risen, so it is feared that it will not even reach this amount. It is still unknown how many days' worth of coal can be purchased with the borrowed coal funds. The reason why these price adjustments are calculated from the beginning of the month is to enable public utilities to receive payments early, reduce losses, and prevent the rate of increase from being too high. According to reports from various companies, due to insufficient oil and coal loans and the frequent rise in the US dollar exchange rate, there will still be a significant loss this month. For example, the Shanghai Electric Power Company expects to lose up to 2 trillion yuan in August."

Public Telephone Charges as High as One Million at a Time

Finally, Director Zhao stated that the Public Utilities Bureau is doing its best to consider the burden on citizens, but in the current economic turmoil, when it is difficult for all industries to survive, the only thing the Public Utilities Bureau can do to balance the revenue and expenditure of public utilities is to use the method of graded billing, so that the burden on ordinary people with small users will not be too heavy. The three items of electricity, gas, and telephone have already been piloted, and in the future, it will be extended to others depending on the effectiveness, and the number of low-level charges will be appropriately relaxed.

Later, reporters informed him that although the authorities had approved a charge of 100,000 yuan per public telephone call, some shops and restaurants were actually increasing the price to 500,000 yuan or even 1 million yuan per call for profit. Director Zhao, upon hearing this, believed that there was no reason for this and decided to find a way to ban it.

City Councilors Request Suspension of New Prices

[Report from this newspaper] City councilors Fei Shusheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and fifty-four others believe that the new prices for various public utilities in the city for August have increased threefold compared to the previous month, which has a profound impact on people's livelihoods. They have jointly telegraphed City Council Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, urging them to convene an extraordinary general meeting as soon as possible. Before the extraordinary general meeting is convened, they request a special letter to the municipal government to suspend the implementation of the various prices announced on the 2nd of this month.

Strike at Central Machinery Branch Factory Spreads; Workers at Factory No. 1 Also Strike Yesterday; Bureau of Social Affairs Sends Personnel to Mediate

The workers at the First Branch Factory of the China Textile Construction Machinery Company (formerly the Donghua Machinery Factory) in this city have historically been paid on the 5th and 18th of each month. Labor requested that the payment be advanced by one day, as Central Machinery Factory No. 1 (formerly the Toyota Factory) in the same system as the factory paid wages earlier. The factory stated that wage settlement procedures were quite complicated and could not be followed, as payment only happened three days after the announcement of the cost of living index. The workers went on strike the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the factory continued to strike, and the workers at Factory No. 1 (Toyota Factory), which is in the same system as the factory, also expressed support for the workers at the factory and simultaneously stopped working, and the situation gradually expanded. The Bureau of Social Affairs has sent personnel to mediate.

### Wave of Closures in Changzhou; Moral Decay in the Business Community; Secret Opportunistic Fraud

[Report from this newspaper from Wujin on the 3rd] Recently, there has been a wave of closures in the business community, with lawyer liquidation advertisements filling the newspapers. Starting with Yang Dasheng Rice Mill, others have followed suit, including Lihua Department Store, Lixin Iron Factory, Yukang Oil Shop, Yitai Grain Store, Lianyi Cotton Cloth Store, and Hengda Stone Shop. There are rumors that many other stores are preparing to close down. While some of these closures are due to genuine losses, there are also those who, after failing in speculation, intend to move all the goods out of the store and then declare liquidation. It is rumored in the market that closing down a store is more profitable than opening one, because in closing down a store, a lawyer can be hired to negotiate discounts on debts, and liquidation takes a considerable amount of time. The interest earned in ten days or half a month can offset the principal and profits, resulting in a net profit. As a result, stores are closing down one after another. Morality in the business community has almost completely decayed. The county government has ordered the police bureau to pay close attention and strictly enforce regulations. If caught, they will be prosecuted for disrupting finance.

### Market Sentiment Uncertain - Chinese Stocks See Mixed Fortunes

Yesterday, market sentiment was extremely uneasy about the economic measures that the Executive Yuan would implement, and the process was therefore hazy and uncertain.  Finally, as credit conditions gradually eased, bargain hunters were taking advantage of the low prices, and after falling, it was easier to rebound slightly.

Credit conditions eased, and it was rumored that the new economic plan would not be unfavorable to the securities market. Numbers 65, 197, 176, 183, 71, 69, 13, 95, 154, 169, 216, and 190 were actively covered, and around noon, the price had rebounded to a high of 12,150 yuan.

Compared to the previous close, Lian Di rose to the limit, Yonggong Matches fell by half a percent, Sino-French rose by half a percent, and National Goods, China United, Mayling, Tung Yih, Innerwear, and Wah Fung were all flat.

### National Banks Temporarily Suspend Interbank Term Deposits

[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Bank previously offered interbank term deposits to absorb idle funds, with interest rates as high as 20% per month, and deposits reached over 3 trillion at the highest. Currently, due to the fact that the market is constantly and unceasingly plagued by hidden worries, compared to the interest rates set by the Central Bank, there is a vast disparity, resulting in a sharp decline in deposits, from an amount of over 3 trillion to just over 100 billion, including the funds of provincial and municipal banks. It is now learned that the Central Bank has decided to temporarily suspend these deposits, and will resume them when the situation permits in the future.

### Market Sentiment Discouraged, Sales Quiet - Rice Prices Trend Weak - White Superior Rice Already Fell Below 40 Million

The rice market is trending lower. The price of tin is falling, and market sentiment is discouraged.

### Cotton Yarn Strengthens, Cloth Withers

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was sold at the opening in the morning as cloth market prices were weaker, with asking prices continuing to be 60 to 70 million lower. Subsequently, with easy credit conditions, local and northern buyers took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and as there were many buyers in the market, the market trend slowly rose. The current asking price has gradually increased to 2 billion, an improvement of 80 million from the previous day. The futures price was 2.04 billion, an increase of 70 million. The market for 40 and 32 count yarns was also initially weak and then strong. Other counts of fine yarns improved by an average of 30 to 40 million to 70 to 80 million compared to the previous day, but only 48 pieces were traded.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was sluggish due to obstacles in actual sales, with few customers active and large dealers generally taking a wait-and-see approach. Local dyeing factories and retail shops had not yet opened their appetite, and the market was still dominated by small sellers. Those who had tight finances were unable to bear the burden of high interest and were selling off their stocks, and the market trend gradually weakened.

Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell another 700,000 at the opening. Trading was still sparse after the opening, and the market continued to decline by 1 million, falling to a low of 52 million. Subsequently, with fellow traders making small covering purchases, the price rose to 53.5 million at the close, falling another 200,000 compared to the previous day.

It was heard that the price had rebounded to 55.5 million due to news of easing credit conditions and frequent interest-rate-buying. Sellers asked for 600,000, but trading volume was small due to heavy rain. The prices of other cloths also declined by 500,000 to 1.2 million due to slow sales.

### Valuable Gains at the World Games: Two World Records Broken; Women's 80-meter Hurdles Record is 11.2 Seconds; 800-meter Relay Team is 8 Minutes and 46 Seconds

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: Dutchwoman Mrs. Koen has become a double champion of the 1948 World Games. After winning the 100-meter race, Mrs. Koen won the 80-meter hurdles championship today, surpassing British Cadiena and breaking the world record with a valuable result of 11.2 seconds. The world record was 11.3 seconds, jointly held by Mrs. Koen and Italian Testoni. Second place Cadiena also achieved a result of 11.2 seconds, also breaking the world record. It was difficult to distinguish the order of arrival at the finish line, and the photo was finally used to determine it. Australian Strickland was third. Koen gave up participating in the long jump in order to devote all her energy to the hurdles.

### The Most Tense Program of the World Games: Basketball Game, Changes in the Situation; Belgium Defeats Chile; Analysis of the Situation of Each Team in the Second Group

[Report from Our Newspaper] Belgium, which was frustrated in the first group of the basketball game, recently overwhelmed Chile, which was hailed as the favorite to win the championship, with an amazing performance of 38 to 36. This has caused a major change in the situation of the second group. The emergence of the top two names still depends on the two major battles between China and the Philippines this morning and Chile and Korea tonight.

If China can defeat the Philippines, then the remaining battle against Iraq will definitely be under control, and it can dominate the second group with a great record of four wins and one loss. If it is unfortunately defeated, then the remaining glimmer of hope will depend on whether Belgium can show another miracle and defeat the Philippines, or whether Chile will repeat the same mistake and be defeated by Korea. (If the Philippines loses to Belgium and Chile loses to Korea, then in the second group, except for Iraq, which has been defeated in every battle, the other five teams will have three wins and two losses, earning eight points. The ranking must be resolved by the scoring average method.)

In the second hypothesis, if the Philippines wins both the match against China and the match against Belgium, and Chile loses to Korea, then the Philippines will be in first place, and the second place will be determined by the scoring average method of China, Chile, and Korea.

The scoring average method is a fair calculation method that takes into account the scores and losses of each team. It multiplies the sum of a team's scores by one hundred and then divides it by the sum of the losses to find the percentage of the scoring average. The larger the percentage, the more net points the team has. According to the current situation, Chile has the most points (348) and the fewest losses (124), occupying an absolute advantage. Therefore, if our country cannot defeat the Philippines, then the hope of entering the finals is very slim. The current situation of each team before the Sino-Philippine battle in the second group, the past records, and the total scores and losses are listed below:

Situation of Each Team's Wins and Losses

Team Name Games Won Lost Points Opponents Not Played

Chile 4 3 1 7 Korea

Korea 4 2 2 6 Chile

Belgium 4 2 2 6 Philippines

China 3 2 1 5 Philippines, Iraq

Philippines 3 2 1 5 China, Belgium

Iraq 4 0 4 4 China

### Belgium's Protest Rejected: No Error in Score of Basketball Game Against China

[United Press, Halingay, August 3rd] The International Amateur Basketball Association rejected Belgium's protest today. In the basketball game between Belgium and China on the 2nd, the two sides scored 32 points each at the end of the statutory time. In the extended time, Belgium lost to China by 34 to 36. Afterwards, Belgium protested, saying that Belgian guard Cole had made a free throw in the second half, but the referee had not recorded the score. Otherwise, the victory should belong to this team. Jones, Secretary-General of the International Amateur Basketball Association, declared that the referee had not made a mistake in not counting the goal. When Cole threw the ball into the basket, the referee stopped the game by blowing the whistle because another player of the Belgian team stepped on the free throw line. Cole also missed the re-penalty, so the score was not counted. The original judgment was correct.

### Song Junfu Appointed as World Games Referee

[Central Belly London, 4th] The Belgian World Games basketball team protested to the World Games Basketball Technical Committee yesterday afternoon, arguing that in the Sino-Belgian basketball game, the referee mistakenly called a foul on the Belgian team and allowed the Chinese team to score a goal.

### Ministry of Education Promotes Air Schools

Using Guangxi Education Department as an Example; Hopes to Popularize it in All Provinces and Cities

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] News Bureau news, in order to actively promote supplementary education, the Ministry of Education has promoted air schools in the electro-optical education plan, which uses broadcasting to teach. The courses listed by various provinces and cities are mostly Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Civics, as well as hygiene, law, and general knowledge of agriculture and industry, etc., which are formulated separately by the education departments of each province and city according to the circumstances of their respective provinces and cities. The textbooks are either compiled by experts hired by the education department or adopted from those published by major bookstores. The classes are taught using radio stations, and the time is mostly three times in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Students ask questions using correspondence. It is reported that the effectiveness of various provinces and cities that have already been held is still great. For example, the Guangxi Education Department's radio station teaches English at 7:30 every night, and its textbook is the Kaiming Reader. More than 580 students have registered to listen, and the first book will be taught in three months, which is no less than the progress of a formal junior high school, and the number of students is more than ten times greater. This method has been promoted by the department in the past and hopes to gradually popularize it in all provinces and cities. Because the broadcasting industry in Taiwan Province is more developed, the promotion is even more widespread, and it has been listed as a major item in the province's education budget for this year.

### Private School Fee Standards Not Yet Determined; Li Ximou Discusses Political Stance; Principals' Association to Hold Serious Discussions

[Our Newspaper] With only one month before the start of the next semester, parents of students in private primary and secondary schools in this city are quite concerned about the tuition fees for the next semester. Due to rising prices, the anticipated high fees have caused anxiety among parents about how to raise the funds. Education Bureau Director Li Ximou stated yesterday: The fee standards for various primary and secondary schools have not yet been determined. If any school sets high fees without the Education Bureau's approval, it will be reported to the mayor for disciplinary action. The Education Bureau's position is to consider both the students' studies and the school's maintenance. Therefore, schools with excellent facilities and good management may be considered for a moderate fee increase, provided it does not hinder students' studies. Director Li believes that half of the parents in this city can afford their children's tuition fees for the next semester, while the other half can apply for free treatment from the schools. Although the free quota for each private school is set at 20%, the Education Bureau may subsidize the expenses if the quota is exceeded. The Education Bureau is also in the process of raising scholarships for needy students to help those who cannot afford to attend school. As for the children of civil servants, unless their original agency already provides educational subsidies or runs a children's school, their parents can send a letter to the Education Bureau to apply for free treatment. In addition, strict measures will be taken against the few private schools in this city that charge miscellaneous fees exceeding tuition fees.

[Another Dispatch] According to Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Principals' Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, the association will convene a general meeting around the 20th of this month to seriously discuss the tuition standards for the next semester. This standard must take into account the burden on students' parents, improve teachers' salaries, and maintain the school's survival.

### The Gospel of Cancer

— Such is

I once had a friend who suddenly felt some pain in his throat when swallowing food. At first, he naturally thought it was just ordinary tonsillitis and didn't pay much attention. Later, the pain became extremely severe. He was originally a mathematics teacher, but at that time, he couldn't even teach anymore because it hurt to speak. Everyone urged him to go to the hospital for an examination. The doctor took an X-ray and simultaneously announced his death sentence!

The doctor said, "This is cancer, growing on the thyroid gland."

After that day, my friend quietly returned to his hometown. He was originally a natural scientist and understood that cancer is even more terrifying than lung disease. We wrote letters to inquire about him, but he never replied.

Two or three months later, we received his obituary.

However, scientists are silently working hard. There is already a glimmer of hope for conquering this terrible cancer.

In July 1946, a 73-year-old patient walked into the Memorial Hospital, a specialized cancer research and treatment center in New York. His name was Henry Hall. He was originally a reporter covering international news, had also written books and lectured, but at that time, he had cancer on his thyroid gland, and the cancer had spread to his buttocks. His right leg had become paralyzed. The day he sought treatment, he accidentally fell and dislocated his leg bone. The situation was quite serious, and the chance of recovery was extremely slim.

However, Mr. Hall is still alive today, with a rosy complexion and vibrant spirit. On the surface, he doesn't look like a sick person. Moreover, his right leg has gradually gained strength and can barely support him.

However, doctors solemnly stated that his cancer has not been cured, but the development of the cancer has been stopped.

Hall is an "experimental patient." He volunteered to provide the hospital with experiments for various new therapies. The doctor told him that radioactive substances might help his condition, but the doctor didn't know much about it and asked if he was willing to try it. He readily agreed.

The thyroid gland has a strong ability to absorb iodine, but in 85% of cases, cancerous thyroid glands often stop absorbing iodine. Hall was one of the lucky few whose cancerous thyroid gland still wanted to "eat" iodine. The thyroid gland is very "stupid" and cannot distinguish whether the iodine it absorbs is radioactive. This radioactive iodine is not to be trifled with. As soon as it touches the thyroid gland, it destroys it indiscriminately, regardless of whether it has cancer or not. Fortunately, the thyroid gland is originally a useless thing in the human body; it wouldn't work if it were the liver or kidneys.

The first time Hall drank the solution containing radioactive iodine was on Saturday, September 14, 1946. He called it "Hiroshima Cocktail," which looked exactly like a glass of ordinary water.

From then on, Hall had to have blood tests, urine tests, lung tests, and heart tests every day—a total of about thirty tests. Saturday passed, and Sunday passed. He didn't feel anything unusual.

However, on Monday evening, his throat suddenly became swollen and felt painful when swallowing. On Tuesday, his head and neck were in severe pain, he could only eat liquids, and he had difficulty breathing all night. However, 48 hours later, the swelling in his throat had subsided, and the pain in his head and neck had stopped.

According to measurements, Hall's head and neck absorbed 35% of the first "cocktail." After continuous use, his thyroid gland was completely destroyed, and the tumor in his kidney began to absorb a large amount. However, the liver and kidneys can also absorb a little iodine normally, so they may be adversely affected—but this bad reaction has not yet been discovered.

Hall himself is also very interested in this treatment and gladly said that he has been reborn. He has now begun to take large amounts of radioactive iodine. Compared to the rabbits and sheep that have been tested with atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll, his radioactivity has surpassed them.

### Taboo

— You Mojun

A name is just a symbol for easy identification. Therefore, even if someone is called "A Cat," it is impossible to prohibit others from calling "A Cat." This principle is very clear. However, in the past, our country not only required "respectful avoidance" of the so-called imperial name, but also the names of empresses, princes, princesses, etc., were all subject to "respectful avoidance." As a result, a perfectly good name that people were used to had to be replaced with another name. This was truly tyrannical beyond reason. Moreover, some names were changed and are still used today. Here are some examples:

Fuyang straw paper, everyone knows it. Fuyang was originally named Fuchun, but because Empress Zheng of Liang Jianwendi's name was "A Chun," "Yang" was used to replace "Chun." The pheasant was originally called pheasant, but because Emperor Gaozu of Han's Empress Lu's name was "pheasant," the Book of Fengshan in the Records of the Grand Historian said "wild chicken sings at night." At that time, the Analects of Confucius was fortunately not in the category of searching for lost books, otherwise, wouldn't the "female pheasant on the mountain beam" recorded in the Xiangdang chapter also have to be changed to "female wild chicken on the mountain beam"? The number twenty is now called "nian." Twenty is a commonly used number name, why was it changed to "nian"? Because the daughter of the Lord of Wu's name was "Er Shi" (Twenty). The chamber pot was originally called Huzi (tiger cub), but because Emperor Taizu of Tang's name was "Hu" (tiger), he had to change Huzi to "Mazi," and then it was changed to chamber pot in the Song Dynasty, which is even more ridiculous. Also, when we common people made a request to the government office, if we got the words "provisionally approved" in the comment, we would be very happy, because this "provisionally" can "provisionally" go down. On the other hand, if we get "the request is not approved" or "it is difficult to approve," there is no one who is not greatly disappointed or wants to take another route. But this "zhun" should be "zhun" (準). Water is level, so it should be from the water side, and the Book of Ping Zhun in the Records of the Grand Historian can prove it. Now the word is changed to "zhun" (准), and one point is written less on the side to distinguish it from the word "Huai" (淮). This began in the Southern Qi Dynasty, because Emperor Shun of Song's name was "Zhun," so all the histories are written as "zhun," and now it is customary to use it without knowing its mistake.

In traditional taboos, there is also the so-called avoidance of "suspicious names," that is, words with similar sounds must also be avoided, so even the ancients must change their surnames! For example, Emperor Xuan of Han's name was Xun (詢), and Xun (荀) and Xun (詢) have similar sounds, so Xun Qing of the Warring States period had to be forcibly changed to the surname "Sun" (孫). Emperor Ming of Han's name was Zhuang (莊), so Zhuangzi had to be changed to the surname "Yan" (嚴), so Lao Zhuang became "Lao Yan," which is really nonsense. Guangwu's old friend Yan Ziling was also originally surnamed "Zhuang" (莊). My original surname was Shen (沈), but during the Five Dynasties, there was a separatist king in Fujian named Wang Shenzhi (審知). "Shen" (審) and "Shen" (沈) have similar sounds, so the water side of Shen was removed, and it became a "You" (尢) character without a dot, and it was used as a surname, until now.

There are also scholar-officials who avoid their own family names. For example, Sima Qian's father's name was Tan (談). During the reign of Emperor Wen, there was a eunuch named Zhao Tan (趙談). The honest historian Sima Qian changed Zhao Tan's name to "Tong" (同) without changing his air, see Records of the Grand Historian. There are countless examples of this kind.

### Remembering He Huohua

— Da Zhuan

Yesterday I saw a report in this newspaper: "Another brave general has been added to our country's World Games team on the 29th. He Huohua has arrived in London from his hometown of Rotterdam to participate in individual and team cycling competitions." I am overjoyed. Readers, perhaps you are not very familiar with Mr. He, so I will briefly describe him.

Mr. He is currently about 33 years old, originally from Guangdong. His Western name is Hoeard Wing. He has lived in Rotterdam, Netherlands for generations, so Rotterdam can be regarded as his second hometown. He runs a business in the city and is a well-known figure among the local overseas Chinese. He has loved sports since childhood, especially cycling, and has a deep passion for it. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, he had already won the championship in local cycling competitions and later won the Dutch National Cycling Championship.

Before the 11th World Games were held in Berlin, Germany in 1936, the Dutch National Cycling Association was willing to train Mr. He and invite him to represent their country at the World Games. However, Mr. He, based on his patriotic enthusiasm, was unwilling to make a wedding dress for others, so he had already repeatedly expressed his sincerity to the Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands, asking Ambassador Jin Wensi to send a letter to China in August 1935 to discuss the matter. Later, with the approval of our country's government, he was allowed to be designated as the representative for the World Games cycling championship, agreeing to go directly to Berlin to attend the meeting.

On the afternoon of August 6 of the same year at 6:00 PM, Mr. He participated in the preliminary round of the 1,000-meter sprint race in the identity of his motherland. Overseas Chinese are certainly very happy to be able to serve their motherland. Unfortunately, in the fifth week of the race, he encountered the previous World Games cycling champion, and Mr. He was eliminated by a difference of only one centimeter. But he is strong and technically proficient, and he has made the greatest effort in this competition.

When World War II broke out, the Netherlands was the first to bear the brunt and was of course greatly devastated by the Nazis. After surviving the catastrophe, Mr. He actually arrived in the British capital again as a Chinese athlete. Looking west with his head held high, cheers erupted. Men from all countries are rushing to compete and are unwilling to give way. I wish Mr. He will be more vigorous than in the past, show his skills and win glory for the country!

### Two Chapters of Repeated Drinking

— Shi Shufan

Wine is like a soft, charming person, easiest to get close to,
Most confusing when lukewarm, pleasantly appropriate to the mouth,
Relying on it as life, accumulating for a long time without noticing,
Joy and anger lose their true nature, the great mistake becomes overturned,
Sudden damage to essence and energy, unpredictable disease;
Doctors warn with one voice, and fear arises!
Why reborn soul, lighting a lamp to steal a drink again?
Sweet fragrance flows through the limbs, even more appropriate than before.
Alas, distancing oneself from petty people, maggots attached to bones are difficult to scrape off,
If I had ten days, wine would also be a palace beauty,
Graceful boneless flower, how many feet left in the setting sun!

Fierce, the red of the chaste woman, the seductive rouge,
Why transform into a deity, always fearing the collapse of heaven and earth,
Drinking alone stroking the lamp waves, cherishing the past in thought!
Pure sweetness suddenly becomes sweet, jealous crows are originally good advisors,
Horse feet hanging a long bottle, shadows monitoring in and out,
In the past, brilliant and wise posture, desolate for whom is it reduced?
Holding hands looking at Penglai, the seawater is clear and verifiable,
Night cool, the moon is lonely and bright, turning to hurt the temporary merits.
Wandering and indulging again, the soul lingering in the poplar flower shop,
Comet hanging over Venus, a wave of the heart is afraid,
Don't sing the song of the great wind, looking in the mirror with a sigh of sorrow!

### The Price of Honesty

— Jin Fan

A lady forgot her purse in a taxi. Just as she was about to rush to get it, the driver was already chasing after her to return it. The lady was very grateful and wanted to thank him, but the driver firmly refused the reward.

"However, I want to ask a very rude question," the driver said, "How much money was there in your purse in total?"

The lady told him. He then took out a notebook from his bag, and the notebook already had a long list of numbers. He also wrote down the number that the lady told him. Then he slowly said, "I want to calculate how many copper coins it costs to be an honest person."

### Random Notes on Mice Spying on the Pavilion

— Yu Shou

Cantonese are the number one when it comes to eating lavishly, so when comparing the prices of banquets in various places, no one can surpass Cantonese cuisine. Even the solemn Beijing-Chao style is behind it.

Fifteen years ago, I saw the menu of the Manchu Han Imperial Feast made by "Fangshan" in Peiping (written on red silk, and many booksellers in Liulichang mounted it for sale as page leaves). At that time, it was known as the most aristocratic diet. Its special products, such as Buddha's Hand Swallow Dish, Clear Stewed Fish Lips, Braised Shark Fin with Osmanthus, etc., are now sold separately in Chunming Pavilion and other places, and each dish still costs tens of millions of gold. The entire feast has 83 dishes (including fruit porridge and snacks, etc.), which is still magnificent. However, if compared with the contemporary Grand Han Imperial Feast of the Moshan Pavilion in Guangzhou, it is very shabby. The Moshan Pavilion's menu combines snacks, vegetables, and fruits, but there are only more than 50 dishes, and at that time, it required 400 yuan. The "Fangshan" feast price did not exceed 100 yuan, so judging from the high and low prices to compare the degree of luxury, the Beijing-Chao faction is not an enemy of the Cantonese faction. The Moshan Pavilion's menu lists the names of clear stewed bear paws, braised white heron silk, braised golden coin leopard, etc., which is also more magnificent than what Fangshan has reached. This is the different type of selection of materials, which is not enough to prove that it is inferior.

Today, the most aristocratic diet to be verified in Peiping is not Fengzeyuan, nor Chunmingguan, nor the so-called "Park Board of Directors," but it still belongs to the private kitchen of the Cantonese, such as the Tan family cuisine and Guan family cuisine, which are popular at the time, all of which are in the style of Moshan Pavilion.

In the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the National Government first moved to Nanjing, Tan Zuan used a Cantonese cuisine of 120 yuan a table to go to Niushoushan to sacrifice to Qing Daoren, and invited friends to eat the leftovers together. At that time, he was very surprised by his extravagance, and the newspaper also sent a special telegram for it. I don't know that Moshan Pavilion already had a special supply of 400 yuan a table.

### Mei Lanfang and Fei Mu Cooperate; The Sorrows of Parting on the Silver Screen

— Ni Qiuping

Not long ago, Mr. Feng Zikai and I visited Dr. Mei Lanfang. That day, Mr. Feng tried his best to persuade Dr. Mei to shoot a color movie. Now this matter has been realized, and it officially started shooting on the evening of July 29. This not only satisfies Mr. Feng's hopes, but also what people who care about Ling Wang (Mei Lanfang) are looking forward to.

On the evening of May 28, the first test shoot was made, shooting a scene of Bawang Bie Ji (Farewell My Concubine) dancing with a sword. On the evening of June 21, a scene of Jing Meng (Startled Dream) from The Sorrows of Parting was shot again. The two experiments have added a lot of experience. When screening the test shots, everyone thought they were satisfactory. Not only was the recording clear, but the light and colors were no less beautiful than imported movies. That is the achievement of Mr. Yan Heming's years of hard work.

Regarding the script, it was decided after Dr. Mei personally discussed it with Mr. Fei Mu several times, because The Sorrows of Parting depicts the sorrow of national subjugation. The story is tortuous and moving, and it is a well-known Mei opera masterpiece on the stage. Now it will be adapted by Mr. Fei and directed by himself.

This movie uses new techniques while retaining the essence of the old play. It is not just moving the opera on the stage to the silver screen. It combines the strengths of movies and old plays. It can be called a new creation.

Now the official shooting has started—rehearsals have already been done many times at Mei's residence. The important scene of Chai Fang Quan Tao (Persuading to Flee in the Woodshed) was successfully completed on the first night. In this scene, there are Liu Shui Ban, Yao Ban, and very important dialogues. The mood is very tense. The picture is rich in pattern beauty. The woodshed is piled with messy firewood, and a pair of candlesticks are lit in front of the window, and the moon is outside the window. The candlesticks were blown out, leaving the embers of the unextinguished smoke, which set off the moonlight, symbolizing the fate of Han Yuniang (the main character in the play). Several shots from different distances and angles were quickly taken under the guidance of Mr. Fei. Although the weather was hot, everyone did not feel tired, and everyone was happily working. Especially me, I feel very excited. In this opportunity, I can follow Ling Wang and Mr. Fei Mu, whom I have always admired, as well as my husband Wang Shaoqing, to work together. This is really something I am proud of. [Editor's note: The author of this article, Mr. Ni Qiuping, is Dr. Mei's Erhu player.]

After finishing the work, in the breeze, a group of people took a car and returned to Mei's residence in the morning light. Everyone took a temporary rest in laughter, and only then did they feel tired.
