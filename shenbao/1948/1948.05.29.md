[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] At the fifth meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 28th, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Chen Lifu bid farewell to all the legislators, preparing to go to the United States to participate in the tenth anniversary meeting of the World Moral Re-Armament Movement held in Hollywood on June 2nd and 3rd. In his letter of request for leave to President Sun (Ke), Chen stated that he had discussed the issue of world peace with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, Mr. Sun told him that world peace could be obtained from the ancient Chinese way, but at that time Mr. (Chen Lifu) still believed that economic and military power could achieve the purpose of peace. After a long period of research and factual lessons, Mr. (Chen Lifu) finally accepted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's opinion. The purpose of the Moral Re-Armament Movement is to establish a peaceful world order by renewing individuals, strengthening families, and promoting harmonious labor-management cooperation, eliminating totalitarian politics, which coincides with the consistent path of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world peace in our country. This anniversary meeting has invited people from all walks of life around the world to participate. Mr. Chen did not originally intend to leave the country at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, but he was invited by celebrities from both houses of the United States Congress and there were special people who came to the east to invite him, so it was not convenient to refuse. He asked President Sun and colleagues to share the burden of affairs within the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Chen concluded: On this trip, he will also investigate the operation of American party politics and report his experiences to the people of the country after returning home, so that they can learn from it. After the speech, the audience applauded warmly to express their farewell. President Sun also hoped that Mr. Chen could return in triumph before the end of the first session of the meeting and share the legislative tasks.

According to reliable sources, the list of the new Executive Yuan will be announced within one or two days, but the position of Vice President has not yet been resolved. Weng went to Shanghai on the 27th to invite Gu Mengyu to serve as Vice President, but Gu declined. After Weng returned to Nanjing, Lei Zhen, Yu Hongjun, Dao Xian Guang, and others visited him one after another to discuss matters. Regarding the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, after Lei Zhen visited Weng, he went to Shanghai in the afternoon to discuss matters and may have made a decision. It is also learned that the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan was originally intended for Wu Zhaohong. Considering that Wu has served as Director of the National Resources Commission (NRC) for many years, he will still be heavily relied upon and may assist Sun Yueqi in serving as Vice Chairman of the NRC. Therefore, the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan will be selected separately. Furthermore, Jia Jia Gan, former Director of Finance of Taiwan, left Shanghai for Nanjing by night train on the 28th after receiving a telegram from Weng Wenhao.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] There is no problem with He Yingqin's appointment as the Minister of National Defense of the new Executive Yuan.

Zhang Jia'ao, the outgoing Governor of the Central Bank, visited President Weng at about 6:00 PM the night before last.

### The Situation Around Chengde Is Becoming More Tense; The National Army Controls the Mountains and Waits for an Opportunity to Strike

[Our Chengde Dispatch, 28th] The situation in western Rehe is becoming more tense. A major battle is brewing around Chengde. 50,000 bandits continue to approach the periphery.

### The Youth Party May Participate in the Executive Yuan; The Democratic Socialist Party Notifies Weng Wenhao of Its Decision Not to Join the Cabinet; Examination Committee Members and Grand Justices Will Be Recruited from Both Parties

[Our Report] Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the Executive Yuan, the two parties made more concrete decisions on the 28th. There is basically no problem with the Youth Party's participation. Zuo Shunsheng is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing today. According to reliable sources: Lei Zhen telephoned the Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhang Junmai, yesterday morning, informing him that the Youth Party had agreed to the compromise plan of 41 legislators, which is half plus one more than the number guaranteed by the Kuomintang. The original plan was to announce the list within three months, but now it has been decided to announce the entire list within two months. After the Youth Party joins the new cabinet, it will still retain the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Economic Affairs. As for the attitude of the Democratic Socialist Party, it still insists on the original proposal, that is, it will not talk about joining the new cabinet until the issue of the number of legislators is satisfactorily resolved. It is heard that Zhang Junmai told Lei Zhen: "President Weng believes that forming a cabinet is an urgent matter and needs to be completed within three or four days. The issue of legislators can be discussed at length. Therefore, he hopes to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet first. Please tell President Weng that our party does not intend to participate in the Executive Yuan for now, so as not to cause him any concerns during the process of forming the cabinet." Xu Fulin and Yang Junming took the train to Nanjing last night to formally convey the decision of the party's consultation in Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Due to the demands of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party that the problem of adding their members to the Legislative Yuan be resolved simultaneously, there were no results on the 28th. Lei Zhen suggested negotiating for 30 to 40 legislative members from each party, which the Youth Party has indicated it may consider. The Youth Party believes that if the number of Youth Party legislators can reach about 20, similar to that of the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party expresses its willingness to attend the Legislative Yuan, the Youth Party can also attend and participate in the Executive Yuan at the same time.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After the implementation of the Constitution, the various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions of the government, except for the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, will be established one after another after the new Executive Yuan is established. It is learned that members of the Examination Committee of the Examination Yuan and Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan will be recruited from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. The selection of personnel for the Presidential Advisors, National Policy Advisors Commission, and Strategic Advisors Commission will be discussed after the Executive Yuan is established.

### Constitutional Supervision Committee Passes Self-Drafted Rules of Procedure

Disputes Arose During the Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Based on the rules of organization of the Constitutional Supervision Committee decided by the Preparatory Committee on the 26th, a meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 28th to review the rules of organization, chaired by Jiao Yitang. However, the rules of organization being reviewed were drafted by the committee itself, not the ones announced by the Presidential Palace on the 26th. Therefore, a fierce debate broke out among the more than 30 representatives present, lasting for nearly two hours. Some representatives said: The Presidential Palace has announced the rules of organization, and the members are determined by the representatives themselves and then appointed by the government. Therefore, there is no need to review the rules of organization drafted by this committee. Other representatives insisted that this committee is an organization of the National Assembly, and the government's appointment and provision of treatment is another matter. The rules of organization should still be reviewed. After a long dispute, the review began. Some representatives withdrew on their own, and the remaining representatives passed the articles one by one. The second article still stipulates that the members of this committee are determined by the representatives themselves and sent to the government for appointment, because only by being appointed by the government can they receive treatment. However, the committee was originally scheduled to be established on June 1st, but it may have to be postponed. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, sent a letter to the committee, elaborating on this matter.

### Vietnam on the Road to Division

The long-standing Vietnam issue has now entered a new stage of division. According to the Central News Agency, the new Central Provisional Government of Vietnam was declared established in Saigon on the 20th of this month, with pro-French General Nguyen Van Xuan as Prime Minister, and announced that Annam's abdicated King Bao Dai was "His Majesty." According to Nguyen Van Xuan: The cabinet will be formed in June, and the list of cabinet members can be announced after being approved by Bao Dai. According to Saigon news: The new government has a total of 22 members, with Nguyen Van Xuan concurrently serving as Minister of National Defense, nine from Cochinchina, seven from Tonkin, and six from Annam. The new government initially planned to be located in the palace in Hue, the capital of Annam, but it has now been changed to Hanoi, and its ruling area includes the three regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina. Judging from the above reports, the new government of Vietnam was established with the support of France and was not produced through a general election; therefore, it cannot be regarded as being produced in response to public opinion. Moreover, after the abdicated King Bao Dai of Annam is restored to his position, he will be a monarch above the power of the government, and whether he is supported by the people is even more questionable. In the future, the relationship between Vietnam and France will be that of an autonomous territory; the relationship between the new government of Vietnam and the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh will be that of a confrontation between the North and South Dynasties. This point alone is enough to illustrate that Vietnam is on the road to division in terms of territory and politics. In the history of the Far East, this is another tragedy after the division of Korea!

Vietnam is a fertile land in Southeast Asia. Geographical, political, and historical factors have created a tragedy of shifting fortunes for five centuries. In 1471, the Annamese destroyed Champa, at the end of the 15th century they reached Quy Nhon, in 1611 they reached Dang Trong, in 1663 they reached Phan Rang, in 1697 they reached Binh Thuan, and in 1698 they reached Saigon. Finally, in the first half of the 19th century, they were ruled by France, and in the early 20th century, they were invaded by Japan and Siam. For more than 400 years, Vietnam has not been the unified country that the Vietnamese hoped for. Professor Zhu Kezhen compared Vietnam to a dumbbell, which actually contains geographical and historical significance. After World War II, the surging revolutionary movement in Vietnam, from the outside to the inside, and with internal and external cooperation, unearthed Ho Chi Minh. According to the "Vietnam Independence League" led by Ho Chi Minh, abbreviated as Viet Minh, their insistence on Vietnam's independence and unification of the three regions is fundamentally inconsistent with France's policies, resulting in multiple French-Vietnamese negotiations failing to reach an agreement. The French-Vietnamese preliminary agreement of March 6, 1946, and the French-Vietnamese temporary agreement of September 15 of the same year, were torn up after they were established, leading to war. It is undeniable that the French-Vietnamese war has been going on for a year and a half, and France's plan to conquer the Viet Minh by force has failed. The French army has nothing to do with Ho Chi Minh's guerrillas in the remote mountains and wilderness. Furthermore, due to France's own fragility, poor domestic economy, and the development of political disputes, France is deeply burdened by the military burden in Vietnam and cannot continue to extend the situation in Vietnam, and is seeking another way to "peacefully" resolve the situation.

France's countermeasure for "peacefully" resolving the Vietnam issue is to first support the right-wing forces in southern Vietnam in order to counter Ho Chi Minh and split the united front of the Viet Minh. Then, it will try to win over the abdicated King Bao Dai of Annam and support his restoration to rule the three regions. Bao Dai is the 13th, and also the last, emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty of Annam (1802-1945), and is only 37 years old this year. In August 1945, due to the trends of the domestic and international situation, he could not continue his throne and finally announced his abdication, which was praised by the people of Vietnam at the time. Bao Dai lived in Hong Kong, and France continued to maintain contact with him. Last year, he held preliminary negotiations with France. On the one hand, he naturally wanted to ascend the throne, and on the other hand, he also wanted to peacefully resolve the situation in Vietnam with France, but the result was not satisfactory. Although he and French Commissioner Bollaert signed an informal agreement on a French warship in Hạ Long Bay, there were only principles in it. Later, Bao Dai flew to London and then to Geneva to conduct concrete negotiations with Bollaert, but the negotiations between the two sides suddenly fell into a stalemate again. It is said that Bollaert presented Bao Dai with the following conditions: (1) France supports Bao Dai's restoration and the establishment of a Vietnamese constitutional monarchy government, with Vietnam as an autonomous state under the French Union; (2) Vietnam's diplomatic envoys must be approved by France; (3) The Vietnamese army must be trained by French officers and commanded by France; (4) Bao Dai should protect France's cultural and economic interests in Vietnam. Under these multiple restrictions, Bao Dai's position is completely that of a puppet, and Vietnam's position is completely that of a colony. Although Bao Dai is a noble figure, his thinking is not conservative, and his character and life are very different from that of Pu Yi. Therefore, he rejected France's conditions and quietly left Geneva and returned to Hong Kong.

After Bao Dai returned to Hong Kong, the local government of Vietnam decided to support Bao Dai. The Nguyen-character Vietnamese Unification League is the backbone of the anti-Ho Chi Minh faction. They gathered in Hong Kong to hold meetings, and France and Bao Dai made concessions to each other. The declaration of the establishment of the new government in Saigon on the 20th of this month can be said to be clear evidence that the negotiations between France and Bao Dai are quite mature. The new government of Vietnam is calling for Bao Dai's restoration, but whether Bao Dai will immediately return to Vietnam is not without question. Bao Dai wants to exist by taking advantage of the contradiction between France's opposition to Ho and Ho Chi Minh's opposition to France, and wants to exist by taking advantage of the Vietnamese people's fear of France and communism, but whether he can eliminate Ho Chi Minh's power and balance the complex ethnic disputes in the three regions is also questionable. At present, Ho Chi Minh is still silent about Bao Dai's restoration. If Bao Dai cannot politically win over Ho Chi Minh and "peacefully" resolve the situation in Vietnam after he returns to Vietnam, then the French-Vietnamese war will inevitably turn into a civil war in Vietnam, and the future of Vietnam's independence may become increasingly bleak. In this way, Vietnam's path to division will be the same as the tragedy of Korea, plunging into an irreparable catastrophe, and will make Vietnam a "dumbbell" forever in terms of geography and history.

### Principles Determined for Tax Exemption and Taxation of Future International Imports; Ministry of Finance's Proposal Approved by the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Ministry of Finance believes that the measures for tax exemption and taxation of various international imports fall into the following four categories: (1) Those that should be exempt from taxes according to Sino-foreign agreements, such as post-war relief materials and US relief materials; (2) Those that are ordered to be exempt from taxation, such as Japanese reparations materials and returned materials; (3) Those that are separately exempt from taxation according to regulations, such as enemy and puppet industry materials; (4) Those that are exempt from taxation according to existing cases depending on the nature of the organization and materials used, such as US military surplus materials, which are currently handled by the material supply and handling departments, and should be taxed in principle, but if the organization using the materials has a precedent for tax exemption or bookkeeping, it will still be exempted or booked according to the existing case. The above four categories should be handled separately according to the agreement or special project until the transportation and import of the materials are completed, and it is not convenient to change them midway. However, in the future, new international materials will continue to be received, and the taxation (including commodity tax) can be determined by our government without the restrictions of agreements. It seems appropriate to set a principle to have a standard. The following three points are specifically suggested to the Executive Yuan: (1) Relief materials should be exempt from taxation in principle, but each item should still be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval based on the nature and use of the materials and the target; (2) Other international materials should be taxed in principle, but if the nature and use of the materials and the organization using them meet the regulations for tax exemption or bookkeeping, such as military materials, educational supplies, and road-specific materials, they may still be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval on a case-by-case basis; (3) In the future, if newly tax-exempted imported materials are processed and sold domestically, the selling price should include taxes, and the proceeds and taxes should be listed separately and reported. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance's proposal has been approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation and has been notified to relevant agencies. The first meeting was held in Beijing yesterday.

### US Aid Rice and Wheat Shipped to China in Steady Stream; Second Phase of Rationing Decided to Continue; Will Benefit Qingdao and Other Four Major Cities

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Food recently told reporters that the comprehensive rationing of food in cities has been carried out since March, and the situation in various places has been generally good. The general public can purchase a fixed amount of food every month, and people's hearts are quite stable.

### Tragic Bus Fire in Taiwan; 63 Passengers Killed or Injured; Fire Caused by Private Carrying of Gasoline

[Central News Agency Taipei Electric Dispatch on the 28th] A tragic fire occurred on the Taiwan railway this afternoon, with 63 passengers killed or injured. The 29th passenger train from Keelung to Chiayi caught fire suddenly at 2:58 pm today after leaving Wanhua Station near Taipei for a few minutes and reaching the Xindian River Railway Bridge. At that time, the train was running on the bridge, and some passengers were burned, either dead or injured.

### Sino-US Commercial Navigation Treaty; Copyright Part; Prepared for Separate Negotiations; Recommendation by US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee

[US News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee recently recommended the approval of the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, but reserved the copyright part. The committee said that in this reservation, the United States is prepared to conduct immediate negotiations with China to further improve the copyright issue, paying special attention to the US desire to protect translation rights. The Senate believes that protecting the author of literary and artistic works to retain the exclusive right to translate or authorize the translation of his works is a fair treatment that the author should enjoy. This point is very important, and it is equally important to ensure faithful translation and its faithful presentation to people who must accept it in a language other than the original. Under the current circumstances, this protection is necessary to promote the effective dissemination of literary and artistic works and to encourage responsible industries to produce such works within a country. The report stated that earlier treaties did not stipulate such protection for translated works, and current Chinese laws and regulations do not prohibit the translation of works in order to protect domestic publishing companies and associations. The report also called attention to the fact that the new treaty does not force either party to implement most-favored-nation treatment for copyright matters.

### Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Military Grain; Mixed with Mud, Sand, and Barnyard Grass; The Field Grain Storage and Transportation Agency Has Not Fulfilled Its Responsibilities; The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Food Have Decided to Investigate Strictly

[Central News Agency Nanjing Electric Dispatch on the 28th] According to news: In the past, military rations were of poor quality. Through the joint efforts of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Food, measures to improve the quality of military grain were clearly stipulated and implemented seriously. Since then, there has been considerable improvement. However, the military grain from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi transported to the Jiangmian River in Xiaguan and transferred to the front line recently reached 80,000 to 90,000 bags, and it has been found that the quality does not meet the regulations. Except for a part that is still edible, the rest are mostly mixed with mud, sand, and barnyard grass, and mold has been found. The Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Food have sent personnel to inspect and sort them out. It is heard that the Ministry of Food is strictly investigating the dereliction of duty of the field grain and storage and transportation agencies in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi.

### The Climax of the Victory in Eastern Gansu

— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou

[Our Newspaper Xi'an Air Dispatch on the 26th] On April 6, the Communist bandits sneaked from south of Yijun to Malan and other places. On the evening of the 17th, they crossed the Jinghe River from Gao Wangzhen and quickly captured Bin County, Changwu, and Yongshou, sweeping across western Guanzhong. At that time, the National Army happened to be concentrated near Tongchuan. Between the Xun River and the Wei River, the terrain is undulating and there are many large valleys, making it difficult for large corps to cross. The Communist bandits saw this point, which was beneficial to them, and immediately took advantage of it.

Three Areas

This battle can be divided into three areas to describe: (1) Bin-Chang-Qian-Yong Area (2) Western Guanzhong (3) Eastern Gansu and Northern Shaanxi.

The victory in the Bin-Chang area was the first result of the cooperation between Ma Jiyuan's troops and the Guojun in Qian County on the southern line. When the Guojun on the southern line pursued with thunderous momentum, Ma Jiyuan's troops set out from Xifeng on April 23 and encountered the bandits on the outskirts of Changwu. The bandit army stationed on the Xi-Lan line was the Sixth Column. After Changwu was captured on the 25th, the bandit army living near Tingkouzhen in southern Bin County panicked because the broadsword cavalry of the entire 82nd Division was famous for killing people. He immediately withdrew the main force of the bandit army to ten miles south of Tingkou. The terrain in Naqiu was very complicated, and the Communist bandits destroyed all the roads in the north in an attempt to prevent the 82nd Division from going south. At that time, this approach was told to the troops by an old man, and the 82nd Division changed its route and detoured from both wings. The cavalry's actions were swift. The Communist bandits were surrounded on the east, south, and west sides. The north road was destroyed, and the air force had just finished its shooting. After being hit by this battle, they were all wiped out. According to a post-war investigation, Cheng Yuechang, the commander of the New Fourth Brigade of the bandit army, was killed in battle. Even the cook of Luo Yuanfa, the commander of their column, was captured. According to his confession, Luo had no way to go when the army collapsed. He ordered an adjutant to shoot him with a handgun, and then the adjutant committed suicide. The Guojun on the southern line recovered Jianjunzhen on the evening of the 25th, and Yongshou joined forces with Ma's division on the morning of the 28th. The war in this area came to an end.

Turning the Tide

The Guojun advancing westward along the Longhai Road attacked the Fourth Column and the Second Column of the bandits from the 25th. The bandit army on the Dao line retreated without a fight. The Guojun smoothly recovered Wugong, Fufeng, and captured Qishan, Fengxiang, and Caijiapo until reaching Baoji on the 27th. The main force of the bandit army fled north into the Xu Mountain and gathered the main force of three columns north of Fengxiang, claiming that they would defeat the Guojun here with superior forces in a superior area and then commit crimes in the east, joining forces with Chen Zaibu outside Xi'an.

At dawn on April 29, the fierce battle began. This was the first time that the bandit army fought a "happy battle" with the Guojun in the Northwest! After nine hours of fierce fighting, the Guojun destroyed the bandit army's position with strong firepower in coordination with the air force. This battle shattered the Communist bandits' dream of establishing the Pangshan Military Region and turned the tide of the entire Northwest war, laying the groundwork for the victory in eastern Gansu. According to the war results announced by the Generalissimo's Office, 1,400 bandits were captured, 500 rifles and more than 30 light and heavy machine guns were seized. The materials looted by the bandits in the Caijiapo area (mainly cloth and daily necessities) were 2,800 carts. More than 800 bandits were killed. The Guojun continued to pursue and suppress in the northeast direction at a pace of 120 li per day. During the same period, the Guojun on the northern line completely wiped out the Sixth Cavalry Division led by Hu Jingduo in Cuimu and Changning.

Peng Dehuai and Zhao Shoushan gave speeches in Malan before fleeing. The purpose of the bandit army was to "expand the liberated areas" and "establish the eastern Gansu base area." If it was absolutely necessary, they would retreat to Liupan Mountain, but when they were defeated in the Battle of Lingshan and then defeated in the Battle of Yongshou, their morale dropped greatly. Outside Jingchuan City, they fell into an empty city trap again. When Peng Dehuai ran south of Jingchuan, he did not know how many Guojun were stationed in the city. He did not dare to commit crimes easily and detoured westward for dozens of miles across the Xizha Road and fled north. In fact, Jingchuan was an empty city at that time, with only a few hundred security teams. Peng was suspicious and suffered on his own. He took a step late, and the Guojun's pursuit and blocking troops all caught up.

Telephone Interlude

The Victory in Eastern Gansu was when the Guojun drove the Communist bandits into a pocket, and Ma Jiyuan rushed up and tied the mouth. When Ma Jiyuan's troops used two regiments to surround the two brigades of the bandit army led by Zhao Shoushan in Tunzizhen, Peng Dehuai quickly led the main force of the Second Column from Yudu Temple and surrounded the troops in the second layer, thus being attacked from both the front and the rear, fighting hard in hand-to-hand combat for three days and nights. At that time, the Guojun's reinforcements going north were engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Yudu Lizhen and other places. On the evening of the 6th, there were several interludes: One was that Ma Jiyuan called Li Zhen, the commander of the 65th Division of the Guojun. The former spoke with a Gansu accent, and the latter was in Cantonese. Later, this one shouted "Fight! Fight, fight!" and Hao Ge only replied "Fight! Fight, fight!" "In Yudu," "Sigh, in Yudu!" As a result, they fought. That day was windy. We set out from two places and met in the middle, and there was a small misunderstanding and we started shooting. Both sides were surprised. The bandit army had never been so fierce. Later, they realized that they had made a mistake. One was that the bandit army in Tunzizhen called Master Ma in the name of a certain regiment of the Guojun, asking how many more reinforcements could be transferred to help them and which road they could attack from. As a result, they were seen through, and both sides cursed loudly on the telephone.

Before the occasional division captured Tunzizhen on the evening of May 6, the moon was dark and the wind was high. The Communist bandits escaped from the south ditch of Tunzizhen. When Master Ma entered the city the next day, many bandits had escaped, but all the heavy weapons were left behind. In this battle, the Communist bandits suffered heavy casualties, which was really very heavy. This was the climax of the victory in eastern Gansu.

After the Communist bandits broke through the encirclement, they fled eastward in a panic. The Guojun pursued at a pace of 120 li per day. When the Communist bandits crossed the Ma Canal, they had already collapsed into a disorganized army. From the cut-off documents, it only said to gather in Yan'an. As of the 16th of this month, this big turn was considered complete. According to the war results released by the Xi'an Generalissimo's Office, the Communist bandits suffered 27,000 to 28,000 casualties, 6,525 were captured by us, 4,000 to 5,000 were dispersed, 5,672 rifles, 125 cannons of various types, 443 machine guns, and 4 radio stations were seized. The command posts of the First, Fourth, and Sixth Columns of the bandit army and seven brigade headquarters were dispersed.

Not Proud of the Victory

Shangguan Yeyou, Director of the Political Work Department of the Northwest Generalissimo's Office, summarized the reasons for the great victory in this battle when he received reporters in Jingchuan: The Guanzhong Corps and the Eastern Gansu Corps were closely integrated, the security team and the Guojun cooperated appropriately, the military and civilians and the local government cooperated, the communication was fast and accurate, the supply mechanism was sound, and the power of the air force was used appropriately. As for the future military situation in the Northwest, Commander Ma Shaoxiang (Jiyuan) said it well: The Communist army's supply is a little faster than ours. Although we hit him this time, he will reorganize and replenish himself in half a year, and maybe he will be even fiercer than now. They will definitely carry out a more tragic retaliatory war. This time, we all cooperated to defeat the bandit army. What should we do next time? Now, we can only not be proud of the victory and wait for the storm to come!

### Before the Republican National Convention; MacArthur Has No Intention of Returning Home to Report for Duty; Officially Replies to the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; The Call for MacArthur to Be Nominated as a Presidential Candidate Is Very High

[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcasting on the 28th: Washington News, MacArthur has long been nominated by the Republicans as a presidential candidate. Since the Senate Committee voted yesterday to ask him to return home to present his views, the call to elect MacArthur as president has become even higher than before.

[Associated Press Washington Electric Dispatch on the 28th] MacArthur telegraphed the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Bridges, today, saying that he was unwilling to return home before the Republican National Convention to nominate a presidential candidate next month. It is said, "If I return home at this time, no matter how sincere the purpose, it will be misunderstood and accused by most people of having a political effect. On the contrary, after the political issue is resolved next month, if you still want me to explain my views on matters of public concern, you can do whatever you want." Bridges declared after receiving the telegram, I understand MacArthur's intention and will submit the reply to the Senate Appropriations Committee as soon as possible.

[Reuters Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] The Senate Appropriations Committee recently passed a motion with a vote of seventeen to one, requesting General MacArthur to return to the United States to present his views on the Far East situation to Congress. Earlier, when the Pacific War broke out, General Wainwright, the commander of the US Army stationed in the Philippines, had asked Congress to summon MacArthur to return home to provide opinions on the military needs of the United States in the Far East. General Wainwright led a number of veterans to support MacArthur in running for the Republican presidential nomination. According to Senator Wiley, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who expressed the views of the majority of the committee members, the committee's decision to ask MacArthur to return home had no political motivation. Wiley believes that the US occupation of Japan is a bright spot in US post-war policy and believes that MacArthur will be able to provide Congress with valuable information. According to political figures here, the Senate Appropriations Committee's recall of MacArthur is a clever attempt to restore MacArthur's chances of running, because he was defeated in the primary election in Wisconsin two months ago. MacArthur went abroad before the Pacific War and has not returned to his home country so far. If he returns home now, it will naturally cause a commotion among the general public.

[US News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] Secretary of the Army Royal telegraphed MacArthur today, saying that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed a motion instructing its chairman, Senator Bridges, to request MacArthur to return to the United States to attend the committee and express his views on the Far East issue. Royal said in the telegram that Bridges proposed June 2 or 3 as the convenient date for "Your Excellency to attend" and said, "Someone has suggested to me that you bring your family with you.

[Chicago News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] President Truman told reporters that he had asked MacArthur to come to Washington to meet, but it depended on whether MacArthur could leave Japan. He hoped that MacArthur could respond to the Senate Committee's invitation to attend and report on the Far East situation. The President also said that he fully agreed with MacArthur's policy and was willing to support him in all aspects.

[Associated Press Tokyo Electric Dispatch on the 28th] The US urging MacArthur to return home today symbolizes the completion of the entire US attempt on the Far East policy. This decision by the Senate Appropriations Committee is very provocative and is almost a tactic against MacArthur. The committee's request for MacArthur to personally state his views on the "Eastern situation" undoubtedly includes three major issues, two of which are directly related to MacArthur. (1) MacArthur's often detailed views on Japan, as an entry point for US support for the Asian economy. (2) The scope and type of continued aid to China; (3) The future US policy towards Korea, especially whether it should continue to occupy South Korea after the recent elections. The mutual response of the United States to the policies of the three countries is becoming increasingly necessary. At the same time, politically, MacArthur's return home this time is the last chance to win the Republican presidential nomination. It has not been hinted whether MacArthur has given up hope for the nomination as a result of the Republican primary election. The US occupation of Japan has entered a relatively peaceful period. Currently, the focus is on expanding economic construction funded by the US, which is the culmination of MacArthur's consistent occupation policy. Therefore, the Senate's invitation is at least timely.

### French Government Advises Washington Authorities; Stop the "Cold War" with the Soviet Union; Smith Returns to His Post, Pan Youxin Summoned Back Home

[Reuters Paris Electric Dispatch on the 28th] According to reliable information, the French government has once again protested to the United States regarding the recent US diplomatic means towards the Soviet Union, urging the United States not to carry out the Cold War too hastily. Some French diplomats hope that Britain can participate in this action of the Chicago Kingdom. They believe that Britain, like France, has no interest in the tense relationship between the US and the Soviet Union.

[United Press Berlin Electric Dispatch on the 27th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and his wife flew to this place from Paris this afternoon and are scheduled to go to Moscow on the 28th. Smith had spent his holiday in the Chicago Kingdom.

[French News Agency Washington Electric Dispatch on the 27th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin said that he had met with US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett today to discuss the issue of resolving the $1.1 billion that the Soviet Union owes under the Lend-Lease Act. The ambassador then said that he would return home soon to receive new instructions from the government on this matter. He also emphasized that the Soviet government will do its best to resolve this matter. According to diplomatic circles, the main reason for the ambassador's recall to Moscow is to consult on Soviet-US relations, because the resolution of the Lend-Lease Act issue can be done through diplomatic channels, without the need for this trip.

### Marshall Lists Soviet Violations in Memorandum to Congress

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Marshall recently submitted a memorandum to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee detailing the Soviet Union's obstruction of a reasonable peace. The memorandum lists over thirty instances in recent years where the Soviet Union has broken agreements with the United States and other nations. State Department officials say that the document's publication requires the approval of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or Senator Vandenberg.

[Quoque News Agency, Washington, 27th] President Truman stated at a press conference today that he has not received any letters from Stalin himself since leaving Potsdam in the summer of 1945.

### Martin Condemns Secret Diplomacy

[United Press, Puanvitenst, Rhode Island, 27th] House Speaker Martin today criticized the government for the recent exchange of letters between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which has caused hopes for peace to fluctuate. He stated, "This is another example of the New Deal government's peculiar practices. The clumsy handling of secret diplomacy is reminiscent of the signing and failure of the Potsdam Agreement."

### Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume Soon

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] It is widely rumored here today that Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations are expected to resume in the near future.

### Before the Outbreak of War: British Diplomatic Secrets; Soviet Union Publishes Nazi Archives

[United Press, London, 28th] The Soviet Union today accused Britain of allowing Germany freedom of action in Eastern and Southeastern Europe and of returning former African and Pacific territories to Germany in the three months before the outbreak of World War II. Radio Moscow broadcast that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs had compiled captured Soviet documents into the second volume of "New Documents Before World War II." This includes correspondence and reports from the German Ambassador to Britain, Dirkson, to the German Foreign Office between 1938 and 1939. On August 3, 1939, a month before Germany invaded Poland, Schidt was still discussing the conclusion of a non-aggression and non-interference treaty between Britain and Germany with the British Under-Secretary of State, Wilson. Poach reported to the German Foreign Office that the basis of the Wilson talks remained valid. The conclusion of an Anglo-German agreement could invalidate Britain's guarantees to Poland, Turkey, and other countries. The Dirkson talks also involved raw materials, colonial territories, financial assistance to Germany, and other issues. Later, Poach returned to Germany, and his mission in the Anglo-German negotiations came to an end. Radio Moscow also claimed that the British Cabinet decided in February 1939 to return former German territories to Germany. After Britain protested in March due to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, a series of secret negotiations were held in June and July.

### British Representative Suggests Four-Week Truce in Holy Land to Security Council; Israeli Representative Immediately Objects

[Our report] New York, 28th broadcast: Success Lake report, at today's Security Council meeting, China opposed the Soviet Union's proposal for the United Nations to intervene decisively in Palestine, while the United States supported the Soviet proposal. Under the current circumstances, those generally supporting the British proposal for a four-week truce also include Syria and Argentina, while those supporting the Soviet proposal include France, Ukraine, and Colombia, which may also support it. However, it appears that neither proposal can obtain the necessary seven votes to pass.

[Quoque News Agency, Success Lake, 27th] Britain today proposed that all countries ban arms shipments to the Middle East and asked the United Nations Security Council to once again seek a truce in Palestine.

Britain proposed that if the United Nations intends to issue an effective and universal ban on arms shipments to both the Arab and Jewish sides, Britain will cease supplying arms to Iraq, Transjordan, Egypt, and other Arab countries. British representative Cadogan formally proposed a four-week truce in the Holy Land, during which United Nations mediator Bernadotte will attempt to reach a permanent solution acceptable to both the Arab and Jewish sides. The U.S. and the Soviet Union have repeatedly stated that it is now time for the United Nations to intervene more forcefully in Palestine. U.S. officials declined to comment on the British proposal. The Security Council adjourned without discussing the proposal and is scheduled to reconvene on the 28th. The Israeli representative strongly opposed this, and Israel issued a formal statement stating: "The British government's objective is to tie Israel's hands, so that the Arabs are free to defeat Israel."

[U.S. Information Service, Success Lake, 27th] Soviet representative Gromyko requested the Security Council to make a decision that the situation in Palestine constitutes a threat to peace, according to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet proposal would order both sides to cease fire thirty-six hours after the proposal is passed.

[United Press, Success Lake, 27th] The proposal by British representative Cadogan at the Security Council appears to have been decided after four meetings in London between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, aimed at partially accommodating the Arab side's truce conditions. Cadogan stated that if this reconciliation attempt fails again, Britain will implement coercive measures jointly with other countries.

### Britain and the United States Plan to Use Cyprus as a Naval and Air Base; U.S. Army Air Forces Denies U.S. Troops Opened Cyprus

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] A spokesman for the U.S. Army Air Forces solemnly denied that the nineteen U.S. transport planes that landed on the island of Cyprus yesterday carried American troops. There were only one or two soldiers serving as guards. Regarding the rumor that Britain and the United States are jointly planning to use Cyprus as a naval and air base, the State Department and the U.S. Air Force authorities declined to comment. According to a report by Sulzberger, the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe for the New York Times, Britain and the United States are secretly drafting a joint plan to enhance Cyprus as a major naval and air base. Cyprus now has facilities capable of accommodating 30,000 troops, and today it has truly begun to suit its terrain as an arrow pointing towards Asia. However, Sulzberger also stated that due to the differences between Britain and the United States over Palestine, this joint plan has also been shaken.

### U.S. Considering Lifting Arms Embargo to the Middle East; President Truman Speaks to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Truman declared today that the matter of lifting the arms embargo to the State of Israel is still under consideration by the government. However, the U.S. will not make any decision on lifting the embargo until the Security Council takes action on the Palestine issue. He said that the embargo on arms to the Middle East was in response to a request from the Security Council, and the United States is waiting for action from the international organization before taking further action. The State of Israel has not applied for a loan. If it does apply, it must go through formal procedures.

### Twenty-One British Officers Withdraw from the Holy Land; But Continue to Work for Transjordan

[Reuters, Johannesburg, 28th] The United Party led by South African Prime Minister Smuts has lost its majority in the South African Parliament, replaced by the Nationalist Party led by Malan. Smuts himself, in the Standerton constituency where he has held sway for 24 years, also lost to the Nationalist Party's Placy by a margin of 224 votes. Smuts has submitted his resignation to South African Governor-General Van Zyl. Van Zyl has summoned Nationalist Party leader Malan to Pretoria and authorized him to form a new cabinet. The final results of the general election show that the Nationalist Party won 70 seats, the United Party won 65 seats, the Afrikaner Party won 9 seats, and the Labour Party won 6 seats. Observers believe that Smuts' failure was due to farmers' dissatisfaction with the government's control policies, who cast their votes against the ruling party. "The Natal Times" stated that Smuts' recognition of the State of Israel was the reason for his defeat.

[Reuters, Pretoria, 28th] The headquarters of the South African Nationalist Party issued a statement stating that the party does not intend to make substantial changes to the foreign policy recently pursued by General Smuts after taking office. Nationalist Party leader Malan solemnly declared that the party will continue to pledge allegiance to the British King and the British Commonwealth.

It also stated that according to the Moscow Agreement, General MacArthur has the right to issue all orders for the occupation and control of Japan and to use military force to prevent smuggling and illegal entry. To accomplish this task, it should include monitoring ships at sea with low-flying aircraft.

### Main Battle Underway in Jerusalem; Jews of Old City Surrender Yesterday

[Our report] London, 28th broadcast: Jewish forces in the Old City of Jerusalem surrendered on Friday.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 28th] The Jewish Haganah army announced on the 28th that the main battle in Jerusalem is underway in the Latrun area, with both sides concentrating large forces and fighting fiercely.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 27th] The Jewish government's new ceasefire order came into effect at 6:00 p.m. standard time on the 27th.

[United Press, Cairo, 27th] In the Old City of Jerusalem, the infantry of the Arab Legion finally entered the Hepha Jewish Synagogue, which had been defended for eleven days, and hoisted the Arab flag. Jews fled in disarray to a rubble-strewn 200-square-foot area. According to the "Voice of Jerusalem," a Haganah radio station in the besieged city, thousands of troops from both sides engaged in fierce fighting in Latrun, a former British detention camp for Jews, and in the Bel Air Huashi gorge, 15 miles west of Jerusalem. Arab political sources in Cairo stated that Egyptian forces have assumed responsibility for the main battle in Jerusalem, assisted by the Arab Legion and irregular forces, and attacked Jerusalem from the south on Thursday morning.

Arab forces have been driven out of the Malliyah Temple on the Bethlehem Road, and Ramallah has also been retaken by Jewish forces.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Report on Aid to China (4)

Construction Projects

The State Department's proposed plan is to provide China with 60 million U.S. dollars before June 30, 1949, for the purpose of undertaking several major construction projects. China is currently unable to fund these projects. As for which projects should be selected for implementation, which construction should take priority, or which should be funded first and which later, these issues should be decided by the personnel implementing the plan. However, the following projects have been repeatedly studied, and the committee believes they are urgently needed by China today. These include the Shanghai power supply project, the restoration of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and the reopening of coal mines in western Jiangxi and Xiangtan.

Implementing personnel may find that the vast majority of the 363.3 million yuan can be used to carry out various restoration projects that can be continued independently by the Chinese without the need for foreign assistance. In this way, the United States can more accurately observe how American money is being used, while also encouraging private enterprise. For example, with reasonable financial support, taking immediate steps to improve agriculture, with a view to improving agricultural products, rural conditions, and land reform, is something that Chinese and American agricultural experts have long hoped for. China's agricultural economic situation is very different from that of Western Europe, so it must be handled in this way. In addition, we must strive to increase the free transportation of food from rural to urban areas.

Currency Stabilization Issues

Some have discussed providing flexible silver to replace a considerable amount of goods, so if it could be supplemented with some measures, China might restore the coin standard as a step towards stabilizing the currency. One report stated that this approach does not require a large loan, as the total currency in circulation in China in 1947 was estimated to be worth approximately 250 million to 350 million U.S. dollars. Another figure that has been proposed is 600 million ounces of silver, loaned by the United States, to lay the foundation for regulating the appropriate currency.

However, Secretary of State Marshall said that, according to the opinion of our country's monetary experts, providing a currency stabilization fund would require a huge amount, and under the current circumstances of having to deal with war and the fragmentation of the people, most of it would be depleted. It is understood that another report on this topic is currently being prepared for submission to the committee.

China's Repayment of Loans

The committee understands that the Chinese government has never defaulted on any loans it has obtained from the U.S. government. Regarding the 500 million U.S. dollar credit loan to China in 1942, as well as China's other wartime debts, the repayment method will be finalized through negotiations to clear the U.S.-China war debts. At the request of Secretary of State Marshall, the Export-Import Bank had previously scheduled to approve 500 million U.S. dollars as a loan to China, but it was not implemented due to the expiration of the scheduled period on June 30, 1947. After the expiration of this schedule, China submitted several applications for credit loans of a considerable amount, but the bank did not grant them, because it was unable to obtain guarantees of repayment.

The committee is deeply impressed by the Chinese government's creditworthiness in repaying U.S. loans. However, one point should be pointed out: given the National Government's economic situation, most of the assistance proposed under the draft bill must be provided in the form of grants.

Can U.S. Aid Benefit Civilians?

On February 19, 1948, Ambassador Stuart stated that the aid plan for China "aims to benefit civilians." The committee reiterates that those responsible for implementing this plan must pay attention to ensuring that this is indeed achieved in rural areas and in a smaller number of urban centers. The purpose of the application of U.S. dollars in China is the responsibility that the plan implementers and the Chinese government should first pay attention to.

U.S. Commercial Interests in China

U.S. commerce in China is at a standstill. American commercial interests have complained of various discriminatory measures, which prevent them from enjoying equal commercial opportunities. If the Chinese government can remove the obstacles to outbound activities and guarantee that it will not adopt discriminatory treatment towards American commercial interests, it will greatly help encourage China's traditional free enterprise and attract foreign trade and investment. The committee believes that the Chinese government will find that taking positive action along these lines is beneficial in many ways.

Agreements with China

The committee intends to grant the Secretary of State broad authority to negotiate agreements with China, in consultation with the administrator of economic cooperation, stipulating that China must, to the extent possible, assure U.S. taxpayers that the money it pays will be used effectively to achieve the goals of this bill and the Chinese people. The committee, while believing that some details may need to be revised or added to accommodate the proposed plan, recognizes the agreement signed in Nanjing on October 27, 1947, pursuant to Public Law 84 of the 80th Congress. The contents of the agreement are reprinted in Appendix B.

### Public Trial of the Social Affairs Bureau Smashing Case; Dancers Weep Incessantly in Special Court; Sixty-Nine Men and Women Interrogated; Tang Zongjie Accused of Being the Culprit; Court Hearing to Continue This Afternoon and Begin Debate

[Our report] The case of dance industry workers and dancers smashing the Social Affairs Bureau was publicly tried for the first time yesterday in the Special Criminal Court of Tilanqiao. At around 9:00 a.m., Judge Wang Zhennan, Judges Sun Tiling and Xu Naikun, and Court Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats. Thirty-seven defendants, including Tang Zongjie, who were in custody, were brought in, and thirty-two defendants, including Yu Zhiqin, who were released on bail, were summoned for interrogation. Reporters from various newspapers and the defendants' family members were allowed to enter and listen, after first signing their names and receiving audience passes. Armed police were heavily guarded. Because the courtroom was small and crowded, there was no space to sit. The defendants in custody were pale and emaciated, with disheveled hair, and staggered as they walked. Dancers Hong Xiaoping, Wang Min, and others covered their faces and sobbed upon entering the court, and did not stop crying until they left the court. The defendants released on bail, on the other hand, were energetic and lively, a world of difference compared to those in custody. More than ten defense lawyers, including Chen Tingrui and Zhou Yizhi, arrived in the morning, but only one lawyer appeared in court in the afternoon. The morning session lasted until 12:00 p.m., and the afternoon session lasted from 2:00 p.m. to around 4:00 p.m. The court ordered the hearing to continue at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon and to begin the debate.

At 9:15 a.m., Judge Wang first called the roll, and all sixty-nine defendants were present. After completing the roll call at 10:35 a.m., Judge Wang announced: "This court received a transfer order from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department on March 17 this year, stating that the case of Zhu Zui, Yu Zhiqin, and others smashing the Social Affairs Bureau violated Article 7 of the Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering National Security during the Period of Suppressing Rebellion, and is being sent to this court for trial. Because it was sent by transfer order, it will be treated as a prosecution argument, and the trial will begin today."

### Collective Petition Unanswered; Public Outrage Leads to Incident

The first to be interrogated was Tang Zongjie, the unemployed chairman of the city labor union. Tang was wearing a gray cloth long gown, with a face full of worry. The court interrogated Tang: "Did you lead the dance industry workers in smashing the Social Affairs Bureau? Did you accept orders from the Communist Party? Today I am giving you a chance. If you were instigated by the Communist Party, you can confess frankly, otherwise it will be unfavorable to you when the investigation comes out." Tang replied: "This time the dance industry suffered a crisis because the Social Affairs Bureau advanced the lottery date. At that time, the workers and dancers were all meeting at New Xianlin, about two thousand people. When they heard this news, they all had job anxiety after the dance industry, and in order to eat, they collectively petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the Social Affairs Bureau, no one came out to meet them, which led to public outrage and an unfortunate incident. Therefore, this time smashing the Social Affairs Bureau was entirely due to a momentary emotional impulse, and there was absolutely no Communist infiltration involved. I am a member of the Three Principles of the People Youth League and will definitely not be utilized by the Communist Party."

### Petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau Was a Joint Effort

This petition to the Social Affairs Bureau was orchestrated by the Joint Office of the Ballroom Industry, encompassing five groups: investors (Sun Hongyuan, etc.), employees (Tang Zongjie, etc.), dancers (Jin Meihong, etc.), managers (Wu Fugen, etc.), and musicians (He Hai, etc.). The petition was not solely the responsibility of the labor union. The rumors that dancers would be fined 3 million yuan for not petitioning and employees would be suspended for not participating are untrue, as the labor union has no such power. Hu Yunyuan, the standing director of the labor union, stated, "Obeying orders is important, but so is earning a living." Wang Min, dressed in a black cheongsam, sobbed during her testimony, saying, "There was a party flag at the scene, but I did not enter the Social Affairs Bureau office. The person in the beating photograph is not me. My hair is short, while this person's hair is long. I wore a long leather cheongsam during the petition, while this person wore a short jacket, and it's a back view, so it's insufficient evidence." Dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tan Pei'e, Feng Aina, Sun Huiling, Li Jun, Luo Ying, Yang Lili, and others also wept uncontrollably during their testimonies. Jin Zukun admitted to shouting slogans, but stated that his slogan was "Support the Constitution."

### A Female Student's Rash Actions Provoke the Judge's Wrath

Among the 69 defendants, the only non-ballroom worker was Jin Ying, a student from Yunzhong Girls' High School, wearing a blue cotton cheongsam, aged 17. She testified, "A former classmate, Chen Juping, who is now a dancer, invited me to see a movie at the Majestic Theatre. Because we couldn't buy tickets, Chen asked me to go to the New Celestial Forest to take a look. At that time, the ballroom workers were about to leave for the petition, and they pulled me onto a truck. After arriving at the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen told me to shout 'Show courage!' I followed along and was arrested by the police." Judge Wang was enraged and reprimanded her, "If this case involved only ballroom workers, people wouldn't suspect political motives. Now, because you alone are mixed in, people suspect that students are inciting the dance craze and that there is a political background. You are only 17 and have already harmed so many people. How many people will you harm when you are 37!" Jin Ying burst into tears, and the audience was in an uproar.

### Everyone Agrees: No One Took Action

The court convened in the afternoon to question the defendants who had been released on bail, asking the usual questions: "Did you participate in the petition? Did you take action to vandalize the Social Affairs Bureau?" The defendants all answered, "I went, but I didn't take action. I stood in the back. I didn't see anyone taking action." However, at the very end, Zhang Rongshou and Ma Hongkui, big shots from the Far East, presented a certificate proving that they were informants for the Central Statistics Bureau. They testified that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau not to petition, but to do work. They stated with conviction, "There is absolutely no communist activity within."

Finally, Judge Wang showed Tang Zongjie a meeting record, in which a resolution "Collectively petition the Social Affairs Bureau" was proposed by Tang. Judge Wang said sternly, "This vandalism incident at the Social Affairs Bureau started with the person who proposed the petition. Because of the petition, the communists were able to take the opportunity to act. Therefore, you are the main culprit and cannot escape responsibility." Upon hearing this, Tang was thunderstruck and tearfully said, "Zhu proposed this in the meeting. This record is a forgery, an attempt to frame me. Please investigate carefully, Your Honor." At this point, the court announced that arguments would begin tomorrow afternoon (referring to the 29th), those in custody would remain in custody, and those released on bail would remain on their original bail.

### Tang Zongjie Tried Hard to Stop the Disturbance; Reporters at the Scene Willing to Testify

When the court adjourned, reporters from various newspapers requested Judge Wang to allow them to speak with the defendant Tang Zongjie for ten minutes. Judge Wang permitted it. According to Tang's conversation with reporters: "At the Social Affairs Bureau, I strongly urged the employees not to act rashly. I spoke until my voice was hoarse. Reporters at the scene must have seen this. Unexpectedly, the investors later pushed all the responsibility onto the labor union, and the police investigation resulted in no investor defendants, which is very unfair. Furthermore, the forged records have caused me to suffer an unwarranted injustice. I deeply hope that the media will uphold justice." At that time, many reporters who were at the scene when the Social Affairs Bureau incident occurred witnessed Tang preventing the crowd from rioting and indicated that they were willing to testify if necessary.

### Mayor Encourages the Magazine Industry to Work Hard; Analyzes Reasons for Poor Sales, Hopes for Improvement

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu, at the invitation of the city's magazine industry, delivered a speech at the Fudan Alumni Association on Beijing Road last night at 7 p.m. Mayor Wu began by expressing humility, saying that he had always been afraid of speaking to the cultural community, fearing that he would be ridiculed. He then said that the sales of Chinese magazines are currently dismal, not even as good as the sales of American magazines in China. He mentioned that to study the success of foreign magazines, there are inherent external environmental factors, such as the high level of knowledge of the masses and the development of air transport.

Three Internal Factors

In addition, I believe that there are three internal factors: (1) Accuracy: I remember that there is an American magazine called "Fortune" that specifically stated that everything published in the magazine is factual and that readers who can catch errors will be rewarded with five dollars, etc., and the result was very successful. (2) Catering to Social Psychology: Western magazines have clear target audiences and content aimed at a specific class, so each magazine has its fixed readers. (3) A Spirit of Seeking Progress in Stability: When Western magazines are launched, they often have a firm grasp and a long-term vision. In the first few issues, they do not seek merit, but seek no fault. When readers gain confidence, they gradually develop. This kind of spirit seems to be lacking in the Chinese magazine industry. The current universal phenomenon in the magazine industry is that the first issue is the best, and each issue afterwards is not as good as the previous one, and being overdue is even more commonplace. This phenomenon is enough to affect magazine sales. If it can be improved, I deeply believe that the future of the Chinese magazine industry will be unlimited. As the saying goes: only if you endure hardship can you achieve success. I congratulate my colleagues in the magazine industry for working hard for the advancement of culture.

Mayor Wu finally reported that his parents came to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, and he was eager to go home to reunite with them, hoping that the attendees could understand his early departure with the heart of a son.

### Liang Saizhen and Her Husband Arrested for Trafficking

[Reported from Beiping on the 28th by this newspaper] Liang Saizhen and her husband, actor Guan Dekui, were arrested on the 27th for abducting and concealing a young woman, Zhang Yuqin, for prostitution after Zhang's husband found her and reported them.

### Chairman of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Association Indicted for Fraud

[Reported by this newspaper] Mao Shengdong, Chairman of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fishermen's Association, was previously secretly reported to the court by Zhong Ruiqi and three others for: (1) Mao used the name of the Shengsi Islands Fisheries Cooperative to obtain a re-export certificate from the Ministry of Food, but in fact, the cooperative was not registered with the competent authority and was not established. (2) The re-export certificate stipulates that grain cannot be purchased in Shanghai for re-export. Most of the grain purchased by the association was purchased and transported locally in Shanghai, which is illegal. (3) The association illegally collected donations for rice exports, 12,000 yuan per family, under the guise of sponsorship and entertainment expenses. The above accusations were investigated and confirmed by Peng Yongcheng, leader of the public grain supervision team of the Ministry of Food. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution on the charge of fraud.

### Father and Son Investigated for Buying Gold

Based on a tip-off, the Economic Division of the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office yesterday discovered that Ye Hongchun, the person in charge of No. 694 Zhengzheng East Road, and his son, Ye Zhenming, used 1.7 billion yuan in legal tender to purchase three large gold bars from black market gold dealers. Both the people and the goods were seized on the spot. However, Ye Zhenming was not at the scene at the time and will be summoned for questioning.

### Bandits in Chuansha Surrounded and Suppressed by Garrison Troops

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the case of the Huanggang Township Self-Defense Force in Chuansha being robbed of firearms by bandits, Chief Bao of the Garrison Headquarters Staff Office stated yesterday: The number of bandits is not as large as rumored, only 20 to 30 people. The number of firearms snatched was also only a little over 10, which were privately hidden weapons collected from the people. They should have been sent to the county government for verification earlier, but the township head failed to send them out on time, which allowed the bandits to take advantage of the situation. The township head is currently being detained and interrogated by the Chuansha County Government. The bandits are being surrounded and suppressed by garrison troops and will not be difficult to eliminate.

### Xiayi Society Holds Rehearsal

### Soldiers' Association Passes New Soldier Settlement Fee Standards; Workers Assessed by the Social Affairs Bureau; Public Servants and Teachers Pay at the Lowest Level; Publicly Funded Students and Soldiers Exempt

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Soldiers' Service Association held its ninth standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, reporting the following points: (1) The first batch of soldier settlement fees started to be issued on the 20th of this month. As of the 27th, a total of 481 soldiers have been paid, each receiving 10 shi of medium-cooked rice, which is converted and paid according to the household rice allocation price in May, 3.5 million yuan per shi, for a total expenditure of 16.835 billion yuan. (2) Regarding the solution to the problem of issuing soldier settlement fees before they are collected, the Civil Affairs Bureau previously signed off on the Mayor's approval to first allocate 100 billion yuan from the garrison brigade's expenses to cover the costs, which will be reimbursed when the settlement fees are collected. After successive negotiations, a contract to overdraft 100 billion yuan from the City Bank was signed on the 17th of this month, and it has already started to be used. (3) The City Bank previously sent a letter to the Soldiers' Service Association regarding the case of interest and acceptance fees of 1.719 billion yuan for the previous loan of 105 billion yuan from seven banks and bureaus, and the association has sent a letter to the City Bank, which agreed to waive the fees as a preferential treatment. (4) The previous letter to the municipal government to transfer the negotiations with the City Bank to borrow 15 billion yuan to cover the costs of collecting soldier settlement fees was previously approved by the municipal government, stating that the City Bank was unable to raise the funds. Now, 100 billion yuan from the garrison brigade's expenses has been allocated to cover the costs. (5) The Physical Examination Committee has been dispatched by 15 major hospitals in the city since the 17th of this month to conduct physical examinations at the new recruit conscription center on a rotating basis, and the Supervision Committee has also sent personnel to be stationed at the center to carry out supervision tasks. (6) The task of supervising the collection of soldier settlement fees in various districts has been dispatched since the 17th of this month by two cadres from each of the association and the Civil Affairs Bureau to carry out supervision. Later, discussions began, and the following key cases were decided: (1) After the new soldiers are sent from the new recruit conscription center to the regimental management district new soldier brigade, regardless of how long it takes to transfer them (referring to the transfer of new soldier training institutions), the second batch of soldier settlement fees will still be converted and paid according to the June allocation price of rice. (2) The new soldiers' comfort items such as toothbrushes, towels, toothpaste, soap, shoes, socks, and rice bowls are the responsibility of the Soldiers' Service Association to prepare.

### Dragon Boat Festival Comforts for Conscript Families: 2 Million Yuan Per Household

(3) Dragon Boat Festival comforts for conscript families and the issuance of preferential payments will be set at 2 million yuan per household. (4) The voluntary donations from wealthy people this year will continue to be solicited, and the list will be drawn up by the Soldiers' Service Association. (5) A special subsidy of 100 million yuan will be given to the Shanghai Garrison Command to establish a "Military Administration Quarterly". (6) The new soldier settlement fee levels will be assessed by the Social Affairs Bureau at a meeting for workers. Public servants and teachers will pay according to the lowest level. (The lowest level of new soldier settlement fee payable by active duty men of conscription age is 5 dou of finely cooked rice, and the lowest level of settlement fee payable by households without conscripted men is 200,000 yuan.) Publicly funded students, active duty soldiers, and soldiers serving in the military will be exempt from payment. (7) The budget for the Soldiers' Service Association this year will be reviewed by the Secretariat. The new soldier settlement fees payable by active duty men of conscription age are paid late until the date of remittance, and the district guarantee cannot refuse to accept them, and the bank has stopped collecting them. It is decided that this month will be temporarily collected and transferred by the Soldiers' Service Association, and the collection in June should be stopped one day before the remittance deadline.

[Another report] As of the 27th, 300 billion yuan in new soldier settlement fees has been received.

### Workers' Settlement Fees: Determined to be Paid at the Lowest Amount

[Reported by Dagong News Agency] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. invited representatives from the labor community and various specialized committee members to discuss the measures for graded collection of new soldier settlement fees for industrial and vocational workers this year.

(2) The new soldier settlement fee for industrial and vocational workers without conscripted men shall be uniformly 200,000 yuan per household. (3) Industrial workers shall be jointly certified by the factory and the labor union. The list of members reported by each vocational union to the Social Affairs Bureau shall be used as the basis for vocational workers. (Note: The above-mentioned new soldier settlement fee of 5 dou of medium-cooked rice and 200,000 yuan are both the lowest amounts stipulated by the Soldiers' Service Association.) The above resolutions have been submitted to the Soldiers' Service Association after the meeting and will be officially announced by the association after approval.

### Small Lenses of the Big Trial; The Judge's Cry of "Chief Culprit" Startled the Entire Room; Tang Zongjie Cried, "I Have Eight Family Members!"

The names of the sixty-nine defendants were called, and they were all asked "What's your name, how old are you, where are you from, what do you do, where do you live?" It took a full hour and thirty-five minutes.

A reporter once counted that there were a total of 167 people in the special criminal court, including judges, male and female lawyers, newspaper reporters, security police, bailiffs, audience members, and defendants. There was no room to stand.

Hong Xiaoping started the crying trend. Tears streamed down her face as soon as she entered the door. After the court hearing, she saw her sister sitting in the audience. After the two looked at each other for a moment, they cried even more uncontrollably.

Yang Lili from "Far East" burst into tears at the window as soon as she left the defendant's column. Wang Min from "Dahu" also grieved for her life and wiped away her tears frequently. A man in a long gown in the audience had red eyes at this time, but did not shed tears. It is said that he is Wang Min's long-suffering husband.

The judge said to Tang Zongjie, "If you didn't petition, you wouldn't be taken advantage of by the communists, and you wouldn't vandalize the Social Affairs Bureau, so the person who proposed the petition is the chief culprit." After saying this, he showed Tang the association's record book and pointed at Tang, saying, "You are the chief culprit!" The whole room was startled.

The words "Proposed by Tang Zongjie" written in the record book were obviously added later. Tang's tears flowed non-stop, and he shouted urgently, "Please investigate, Your Honor. I have eight family members, and my old mother is about to die of illness. I really can't bear this charge."

Tang Zongjie said that he is a member of the Kuomintang and has a party card. He is also a member of the Youth Corps and holds the position of squadron leader, requesting an investigation.

Zhu Fei, the boss of "Saint Taile," testified that he originally intended to go on a hunger strike if the petition was unsuccessful, but who knew that a conflict would break out temporarily. There was no political purpose. After the court session in the afternoon, Zhu Fei raised his right hand for five minutes, requesting to speak, but his wish was not fulfilled.

Li Meiping, a singer from "Dahu," previously stated that she was 26 years old, but today she said she was 25 years old. After being questioned by the judge, she said, "It's just 25 or 26, there's no real reason."

Shi Meifang from "Huadu" was praised by the judge for being "very honest" because she said that she wanted to hit people when she went to the Social Affairs Bureau, but couldn't squeeze in.

All the defendants said in unison that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, but did not take action. After the judge asked, he jokingly answered the testimony on their behalf: "You went, but you didn't hit anyone, right?" The defendants nodded, causing laughter in the court. The judge also said, "You all say that you didn't hit anyone, either because you arrived late or you were in the back. Then who hit them? The back was full of people, where did the people in the front go?" This also caused a burst of laughter.

When the court session ended, the audience and the defendants released on bail exited the courtroom. The defendants in custody, who were in a miserable state, were touched by the scene, and cries suddenly arose. Some waved to the group of reporters and appealed for help, while others cried out piteously for the old man to help them, which was heartbreaking.

### The Mayor Yearns for His Parents; He Welcomed Them from Hankou the Other Day; "No Time to Accompany Them," But Had a Meal Together Two Days Later

Since Wu took office as the Mayor of Shanghai, he has never been to Shanghai in more than two years, and Mayor Wu has never returned to his hometown to visit his relatives due to his busy official duties. It is now known that the Mayor welcomed his parents to Shanghai on the 27th because he longed for them. Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday: "After the old people arrived in Shanghai the night before last, I, as a son, still had no time to accompany them. Both the night before last and yesterday afternoon, I was unable to serve them for dinner because I had prior engagements, so I decided to have a family reunion for dinner last night and share the joy of family." It is reported that the old people are both 73 years old and in good spirits. After coming to Shanghai this time, they plan to stay in Shanghai for a long time to show their filial piety as a daughter-in-law.

### Preparing to Establish a Magazine Association

### Hundreds of Tons of Bituminous Coal in Pudong Suspected of Hoarding and Profiteering

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government recently received a report that the Hankou Zhengkang Trading Company has stockpiled 450 tons of bituminous coal in Shanghai for a long time without selling it, which is suspected of hoarding and profiteering. A special order has been issued to the police bureau to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the order, the police bureau sent detectives to investigate and learned that the company's coal was stored in the Zhongxing Coal Yard in Baiyunjing, Pudong. They then went to the yard to retrieve the account books and found that the bituminous coal was transported by "Yongxing" and "Wuchang" on October 11th of last year, totaling 1,449 tons. After selling some, there were still 459 tons remaining. The person in charge of the company in Shanghai, Ju Jiyuan, lives at No. 232 Nanjing West Road. He was summoned yesterday. According to him, the stored coal was sold to the Municipal Government Employees Welfare Committee in October last year, but only a part of it has been taken, and about 200 tons are still stored. As for the remaining part, it has not been sold out due to the poor quality of the coal, and it is not intentionally hoarding and profiteering.

### Xu Yiqin's Open-Mindedness: Willing to Donate Corpse for Dissection Teaching Materials in the Future

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Xu Yiqin of this city (see picture) recently wrote to the National Shanghai Medical College, stating that he is willing to provide his body for teaching and experimental purposes after his death. He also pre-drafted a will on the back of a football match ticket in his wallet, stating, "No matter when or where I die, please notify Shanghai Medical College to collect my body for dissection." His spirit of breaking superstitions is worthy of being a pioneer in the social atmosphere. The reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Xu last night. According to him, he is currently an inspector at the Garden Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. He is 35 years old, a native of Shanghai, and there is no special reason or strange idea for this move. It is because he recently read in the newspaper that Shanghai Medical College lacks dissection teaching materials. He believes that the human body is fundamentally composed of cells, so it does not matter how the body is disposed of after death. Moreover, science is now developed, and the old concepts of the past should be broken. Therefore, he immediately wrote to the medical college.

Mr. Xu graduated from the Department of Agronomy of Jinling University this year. During the War of Resistance, he participated in the army and studied various agricultural products to improve their manufacturing, such as manufacturing oatmeal and setting up many factories in Guiyang, refining dried fruits, and using coffee bottles to modify the bottle caps into pressure regulating plugs to make Sichuan pickles. When he graduated, he wrote a thesis entitled "Military Dehydrated Vegetables." He also said that although he received a university education and studied science, he is ashamed of having no achievements. Now he is willing to provide his body for teaching after his death, which is considered to be some contribution to the society and the country. He also said that this matter is not worthy of attention and humbly asked not to publish his name to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world.

When the reporter visited yesterday, Mr. Xu was out. His wife, who currently works at the Customs, suddenly became extremely anxious and her hands and voice trembled when she heard about this. She did not know that Mr. Xu had sent such a letter to the medical college beforehand, and she had not seen Xu return since noon yesterday, so she suspected an accident and hurriedly took her four-year-old son out to borrow a phone to inquire everywhere. After about an hour, she returned home disappointed without finding any trace, but at this time Xu had returned home. After explaining, Mr. Xu also expressed his apologies for not telling his wife beforehand.

### Storm over the "National Exhibition" at St. John's University: Students to Host Press Conference Today; Whether Alumni Reunion will be Held Becomes a Question

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "National Exhibition" initiated by the Student Union of St. John's University, with opposition to the "U.S. Support for Japan Issue" as its focus, continued to be exhibited on campus yesterday, but it has been moved from the recreation room to the lawn. The exhibits are mostly woodcut cartoons, photos, etc. Many Chinese and foreign reporters went to visit yesterday. The most eye-catching among them was the photo of Zhu De, the so-called "Chinese Anti-Japanese Hero."

The beginning of this exhibition was actually launched at the May 20th Memorial Meeting, and was later decided at the "Symposium on the U.S. Support for Japan Issue." At that time, Tu Yuqing, President of St. John's University, Lin Muguang, Professor of the Department of Economics, and Pan Shizi, Acting Dean of Student Affairs, personally attended and participated, and obtained the permission of the President. However, recently, due to the President's measures to stop the exhibition from continuing, the students raised questions and published a long announcement of about a thousand words, expressing dissatisfaction with the school. At the same time, they also demanded that the school disclose the details of the visit of personnel from the U.S. Embassy and Consulate to the President and asked President Tu to express his position.

In addition, another reason for this incident was the passionate speech of Chen Renbing, the school's professor of the Three People's Principles, which had a great impact. At the lecture, Chen called for opposition to the revival of fascism at home and abroad, and to follow the example of American leftist leader Henry Wallace. At the same time, he incited the students to unite under the banner of the Student Union, which was banned by the government authorities!

After the inside story of this incident was revealed by Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days, the students' emotions have been very tense. A press conference is scheduled to be held on campus this afternoon to report on the process of this matter. Whether the annual alumni reunion, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon, can be held as usual without being affected is still a question.

In addition, the "May 30th Memorial Meeting" (initiated by four student associations in the school) originally scheduled to be held yesterday was postponed to the day after tomorrow due to insufficient preparation.

### Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts Students Clash

[Report from Our Newspaper] A group of students from the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts went to Jiaotong University on the 22nd of this month to participate in the so-called "May 20th Anniversary Evening Party." With the theme of "Opposing U.S. Support for Japan," they attempted to expand the propaganda to overthrow the government. After being denounced by most of the students in the school, a mutual fight broke out yesterday. The Songshan Police Branch sent personnel to suppress the incident, and the situation did not escalate. According to reports, the National Salvation and Nation-Building Association, formed by student Xie of the school, posted a notice the day before yesterday, pointing out that the few students who participated in the Jiaotong University evening party were being used by traitors, and claiming that the school's student union and student federation were illegal organizations that should be dissolved. This caused dissatisfaction among the student union cadres. Yesterday afternoon, when Xie and five other students returned to school for dinner, they gathered many people, stepped forward to question and insult them, which led to a mutual fight. Later, after the persuasion of Song, the Dean of Academic Affairs of the school, and the dispatch of personnel from the Songshan Police Branch to the school to suppress the incident, the dispute subsided.

### Rice Prices Rise Again: White Round-Grain Rice Reaches the 7 Million Mark Again

The rice market continued to soar, mainly due to the price increase in Wuxi. The price in the Nangang production area also rose. Coupled with the daily decrease in arrivals, the owners were unwilling to sell at low prices. Due to the price limit in the market, transactions were still suspended. Supply rice continued to be released, and the amount in the two markets was still 6,000 shi, and the price remained unchanged. The off-market price of white round-grain rice reached 7 million, but the market was slightly weak afterwards. Thin rice and indica rice were 6.9 million each, an increase of 300,000 to 400,000 compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, a total of 2,483 shi of passenger and cargo rice were registered.

Flour rose, but slightly weakened towards the close. In the early market, due to the continued rise in rice prices, those holding goods tried their best to raise prices. The early opening was the firmest. Lao Che and Bingchuan flour opened at 2.22 million each, and then some sold at high prices. Retail investors did not dare to buy more. Bingchuan fell back to 2.15 million, and Lao Che to 2.16 million, still up 60,000 to 70,000. Hongfeng and Jiancheng closed at 2.1 million each, up 50,000.

At the opening, the owners still wanted to take advantage of the rise in rice prices to continue to quote higher prices, but due to the lack of confidence in high prices, the price increase was weak. Broad beans closed at 3.4 million, slightly lower than the previous day by 50,000. Northern corn was not popular, and the market was stable. Selected green mung beans were stable. Shaoxing new green rice debuted yesterday at a price of 2.95 million. Red sorghum fell by 50,000 to 100,000, sesame weakened by 100,000, and raw peanuts fell sharply by 1 million due to the heavy selling the previous day.

Edible oil showed a slight decline. Raw oil rose sharply the previous day, and fell sharply yesterday. Although there were not many sales, the willingness to buy was also weak, resulting in quiet transactions. Qingdao Jiton raw oil opened at 17.4 million, a decrease of 600,000. Although soybean oil fell slightly, it was only called flat. The sales of soybean oil were more active in this street. Dayou soybean oil initially opened at 15 million, and then opened at 15.1 million. The lowest Changde soybean oil was 14.6 million. Vegetable oil factories offered more new rapeseed, so the sales were not stingy, and the price fell by 300,000 to 400,000. Small car sesame oil fell by 300,000. Initially, there was a willingness to buy soybean cake, and 30,000 to 40,000 were traded. In the end, because there were not many buyers, it returned to the original price of the previous day.

### Manufacturers Request Input of Raw Materials Must Have Solid Sales Assurance

The China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company was recently subjected to compensation after transporting cotton textiles to Hong Kong for export, and had presented a request for relief from the Export Control Committee. It is reported that the spokesperson of the Export Promotion Department of the Export Control Committee said that the important purposes of the Export Promotion Department's measures for the rotation of raw materials for export products are three: (1) To promote the export of domestic products, (2) To increase the state treasury's foreign exchange income, (3) To assist manufacturers in obtaining raw materials and reducing costs. Since the handling of this matter, many manufacturers and exporters have been eager to apply for the import of raw materials. So far, they are generally satisfied. After applying this method, manufacturers can import a part of the raw materials to reduce their export costs, which is very beneficial to promoting the export of manufactured products. However, the department recently learned that some exporters applied rashly in the hope of obtaining imported raw materials. The export goods have no buyers who have concluded a deal, and there is no concrete plan for actual sales that is guaranteed. In fact, they are only transferring goods from Shanghai to Hong Kong, waiting for an opportunity to seek actual sales. Therefore, once unfavorable changes occur in the Hong Kong market, they will inevitably be compensated. Moreover, it does not fully comply with the government's original purpose of promoting exports. For example, although the Export Promotion Department approved the China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company to import raw materials with 40% of the foreign exchange earned from the export of its cotton textiles, the company suffered losses because the market price of cotton textiles fell sharply when the company transported the cotton textiles to Hong Kong, which happened to be at a time when there were rapid changes in the Hong Kong market. The Export Promotion Department expressed deep regret for this, but the reason why the company was compensated was because the company did not understand commercial practices and took on too much risk. The spokesperson of the Export Promotion Department said that he hopes that when manufacturers and exporters apply for the input of raw materials using the above-mentioned method, the exported manufactured products must have been concluded and there is a solid assurance of sales, so as to avoid unexpected compensation.

It is also reported that the first batch of 50,000 bales of American aid cotton is expected to arrive within the next week, and the supply of raw cotton is expected to improve.

At 9:00 AM, a simple and solemn ceremony was held. It was originally planned that the chairman and others would give speeches, but this was waived. Only the staff and athletes circled the field once before the competition began. It paused at 12:00 PM at noon and continued from 1:00 PM in the afternoon until it concluded at around 6:00 PM. As a result, the championship of the senior division for boys was won by Provincial Shanghai High School, with a total of 32 points. Hsin Hsin was second, and Chung Cheng was third. The championship of the junior division for boys was won by Guangdong High School, with a total of 47 points. Hsin Hsin was second, and Yue Qing was third. The championships for both the senior and junior divisions for girls were won by Private Minli Girls' High School, a rare double victory. In various events, 9 records were broken in the senior division for boys, 6 in the junior division for boys, 2 in the senior division for girls, and 4 in the junior division for girls, for a total of 21 records. In the junior division for girls, Guangdong's Ma Shenmei not only won the championships in the 100-meter, 200-meter, and long jump events, but her 4.25-meter long jump was particularly outstanding.

### Qingbai Railway Contention; Mayoral Cup Final Rights; This Afternoon at 4:00 PM at Yiyuan Stadium; Xin Feng vs. China Textile Group C Final

The third Mayoral Cup Football Tournament has entered its final stage. Donghua has already defeated Tede, thus securing the right to compete in the final. Qingbaiqing and Railway will face off in a rematch at Yiyuan this afternoon at 4:00 PM. The winner will compete with Donghua for the throne. Qingbaiqing fully demonstrated its power in the game against Qunli last week, and on Monday, a surprise attack against the British Navy resulted in a 3-2 come-from-behind victory, proving its strong momentum and smooth ball possession. Railway has many outstanding newcomers, who are not only young and strong but also well-coordinated, and their individual skills are also excellent. In terms of skill, they are comparable to Qingbai. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. However, Liao Xiong and Cao Liming are both suffering from minor illnesses, and whether they will be able to play at the time may become a problem. If so, Railway will inevitably be slightly affected. Tickets today are still sold at 100,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan.

Before the game, starting at 2:00 PM, there will be a Group C final between Xinfeng and Zhongfang 17. The strength of the two teams is evenly matched, and it is uncertain who will win. The schedule for today is listed below:

In the past two months, over 730 people have arrived in Peiping (Beiping) on foot or by air. Those in charge have found that some of them are wealthy, well-dressed, and living comfortably, while others are poor and living in small dwellings, eating cornbread.

Literary History

### On "Yun Ying"

— Tang Lan

Scholars have always believed that there were two types of "Yun Ying" (Rhyme Treasury) during the Tianbao era: one was the "Tianbao Yun Ying" and the other was the "Chen Tingjian Yun Ying." This error originated with Dai Zhen. The postscript to Han Shi's phonetic examination paper on the yuan rhyme states:

The notes from the Jixian Academy at the end of the Tianbao era state that the emperor, considering that ancient rhyme usage was not very distinct and Lu Fayan's "Qie Yun" failed to rectify this, ordered a revision and compilation of the "Yun Ying," maintaining its five-volume structure. The old rhyme had 439 categories, while 151 new categories were added, resulting in 580 rhyme categories with 19,177 characters, analyzed with great detail. However, the "Southern New Records" states that Chen Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying" during the Tianbao era. Thus, could the 439 categories mentioned in the notes refer to Tingjian's work? And could the maintained five-volume structure be based on Lu Fayan's format?

Wang Guowei's "Guan Tang Collected Works," Volume 8, contains the "Examination of Tianbao Yun Ying, Chen Tingjian Yun Ying, Zhang Zhi's Examination of Sound, and Wu Xuanzhi's Rhyme Classification":

The "Jade Sea" Volume 45 quotes Wei Shu's Jixian Academy notes, stating, "At the end of the Tianbao era,...resulting in 580 categories, analyzed with great detail," and so on. The old rhyme of 439 categories is of unclear reference. The "Southern New Records" states that Chen Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying" at the end of the Tianbao era. Dong Yuan suspects that the old rhyme refers to Tingjian's work, as both books are named "Yun Ying." The imperial compilation of the Tianbao era was likely an expansion of Tingjian's work, which is plausible.

However, according to the preface written by Jing Shen in the "Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds" by Seng Lin, the author of "Yun Ying" is "Yuan Tingjian." Therefore, Mr. Wang states in that article:

The author of "Yun Ying" is Yuan Tingjian in the preface of "Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds," and Chen Youyuan Tingjian in the "Southern New Records." It is unknown which is correct, and neither person can be verified.

When I was reading that article, I was also reading "Taiping Guangji," and in Volume 460, I discovered that the author of "Yun Ying" was Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian. I wrote a letter to inform Mr. Wang, and Mr. Wang wrote the following note on the margin of his "Guan Tang Collected Works":

Jiaxing's Tang Youlan believes it should be Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian, as seen in the bird category of "Taiping Guangji." (See the table of marginal notes on "Guan Tang Collected Works" by Yao Mingda in the special issue dedicated to Mr. Wang Jing'an in the "Journal of Sinology.")

However, the person who compiled Wang Zhongque's posthumous works deleted the phrase "it is unknown which is correct" from Mr. Wang's original sentence, "Neither person can be verified," and forcefully inserted the phrase "The bird category of 'Taiping Guangji' lists Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian," seemingly intending to revise Mr. Wang's article to perfection, but unknowingly committed a major error.

Because Mr. Wang's knowledge of "Yun Ying" came from Dai Dongyuan, he consulted the Jixian Academy notes and "Southern New Records" quoted in "Jade Sea." Dai Dongyuan quoted "Southern New Records" stating "Chen Tingjian compiled a ten-volume 'Yun Ying'," while Mr. Wang quoted "Chen Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume 'Yun Ying'," indicating that he had consulted the original text. However, we do not know which version he consulted, because both versions of the "Southern New Records" in my possession, from the "Xuejin Taoyuan" and "Yueyatang Congshu" series, clearly state:

During the Tianbao era, Hanlin Academician Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians. Tingjian died.

This is exactly the same as "Taiping Guangji." Mr. Wang's source lacks the word "Wang." Additionally, since Dai Dongyuan said "Chen Tingjian," he likely, due to a preconceived notion, read the two characters "Youyuan" together, becoming "Chen Youyuan," who was also called "Chen Tingjian." Thus, in the title of this article, he still calls it "Chen Tingjian Yun Ying," while in the article he says "Yuan Tingjian" or "Chen Youyuan Tingjian," not knowing which is correct, and that neither person can be verified. It seems as if Mr. Wang already knew it was "Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian," he definitely wouldn't be ignorant of the official title "Chen Wang." (Actually, when he wrote my statement in the margin, he already knew that "Yuan Tingjian" was correct.) This kind of casually altering other people's articles is an unforgivable crime.

In fact, the "Southern New Records" is simply a collection of anecdotes. This entry should be a record excerpted from Niu Su's "Chronicle of Events." Lu Xinyuan once collected Niu's book, but it is no longer seen. "Taiping Yulan" Volume 460, in the entry for Yuan Tingjian, states:

Chen Wang Youyuan Tingjian, a Hanlin Academician of the Tang Dynasty, formerly dismissed from the post of Military Advisor of a remote prefecture, lived in the mountains on the border of the prefecture and studied.... Consequently, Tingjian understood phonology and excelled in writing, unmatched at the time. He was versed in yin-yang arts and numerology. While at the Hanlin Academy, he compiled a ten-volume "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians, and Tingjian also died. This passage quotes the "Chronicle of Events," and apart from a few different words, it is entirely the same as the "Southern New Records," which can serve as proof.

Although Niu Su's portrayal of Yuan Tingjian's understanding of phonology and writing, granted by the Crow King, is mythical, he provides a more detailed account of Yuan Tingjian's life. We can learn that he first served as the Military Advisor of Suizhou, and later became a Hanlin Academician named Chen Wang You. (Chen Wang was Chen Wang Gui, the son of Emperor Xuanzong). While at the Hanlin Academy, he compiled "Yun Ying," which was not implemented before the Western Capital fell to the barbarians. This was in the first year of the Zhide era (756 AD), and Tingjian also died at that time.

Let's return to Wei Shu's Jixian Academy notes, which state, "At the end of the Tianbao era, the emperor, considering that ancient rhyme usage was not very distinct and Lu Fayan's 'Qie Yun' failed to rectify this, ordered a revision and compilation of the 'Yun Ying,' maintaining its five-volume structure," as well as the "Tang Huiyao": "In the fourth month of the fourteenth year of Tianbao, the imperial 'Yun Ying' in five volumes was issued, and the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it for use." Also, the "New Tang History, Treatise on Literature and Arts" notes on Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" in five volumes: "Compiled in the fourteenth year of Tianbao, the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it and send it to the inspection commissioners in various regions." These accounts are entirely consistent with the era of Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying." Yuan Tingjian was a Hanlin Academician at that time, and also well-versed in phonology. Who else but him would be responsible for Emperor Xuanzong's revision and compilation of "Yun Ying"? According to the "New Tang History," Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" was compiled in the fourteenth year of Tianbao, and the Jixian Academy was ordered to transcribe it and send it to the inspection commissioners in various regions. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, An Lushan had already captured the Eastern Capital, and the following year, the Western Capital was captured. Therefore, Niu's "Chronicle of Events" states "not implemented." This is clear evidence that Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" is the same as Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" or the "Tianbao Yun Ying." If Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" was merely a private work intended to compete with the emperor, it would definitely not be referred to as "implemented." As for the Jixian Academy notes, "Tang Huiyao," and "Tang History" all mentioning five volumes, while Niu's "Chronicle of Events" says ten volumes, this is simply because Niu divided each volume into two, which is not unusual.

Since Emperor Xuanzong's "Yun Ying" and Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" are the same book, the claims by Dai Dongyuan and Wang Jing'an that the old rhyme of 439 categories refers to Tingjian's version are obviously incorrect. In my postscript to Wang Renxu's "Qie Yun," I pointed out that the so-called old rhyme still refers to Lu Fayan's "Qie Yun," but in terms of rhyme categories, not rhyme headings. (Lu's book only has 193 rhyme categories.) The word "rhyme" is equivalent to the word "section" in "For Qi Yi Shi, divided into four sections."

Mr. Huang Cuibo knew that the "Chen" in Chen Tingjian should be "Yuan" (although he did not check the "Southern New Records"), and also knew that "Tingjian's book was also completed in the Tianbao era, so how could it be considered old?" However, he still believed that the "Tianbao Yun Ying" and Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" were two separate books. Because he was compiling the "Examination of Reverses in Seng Lin's Comprehensive Meaning of All Sutra Sounds," the result of his connecting the reverses was that the number of rhyme headings was even fewer than in "Qie Yun." Therefore, he said:

Thus, the method of analyzing the more than five hundred sections of the Tianbao "Yun Ying" is vastly different from Tingjian's "Yun Ying," and the two books are not related.

Here, we must ask whether this method of connecting reverses is trustworthy. We only need to open his table of reverses and tones to see that the first character, "ba," has a total of eight reverse spellings: jiu yi, jiu yi, ji yi, ji yi, ji yi, ju yi, ji yi, and jing qi. This indicates that when Huilin wrote the book, he did not rely on a single rhyme book for pronunciation, but rather copied them down randomly. Jing Shen's preface states:

In ancient times, reverses often used labials for double sounds, starting with Fu Qian, with no fixed standard. Wu sounds and Qin sounds were indistinguishable, and clear rhymes and muddy rhymes were difficult to discern. The use of wu and xian as double sounds, and qi and zhi as repeated rhymes, and the like, were not adopted. Recently, there have been Yuan Tingjian's "Yun Ying" and Zhang Zhi's "Examination of Sound Qie Yun." The current sounds are based on these.

He clearly stated that he based his work on these two books, but Mr. Huang insisted on saying that he relied solely on Tingjian's "Yun Ying," which is difficult to believe.

However, even within these chaotic materials, we can see why "Ling Ying" added more than one hundred and fifty categories compared to Lu Fayan. Jing Shen said, "The use of qi and zhi as repeated rhymes" refers to Lu Fayan's "qu zhi fan," where qi is in the fourth division and zhi is in the third division. This is one point where Yuan Tingjian, Zhang Zhi, and others were more precise than Lu Fayan in dividing rhyme categories. Labial sounds originally had independent rhyme categories in "Qie Yun," but not very consistently. In Huilin's book, they became independent. Guttural, dental, tongue, and sibilant sounds also occasionally had independent categories in "Qie Yun," and this tendency became even more pronounced in the reverses in Huilin's book. Therefore, the increase of "Yun Ying" to 580 categories is the result of using more precise upper and lower characters in the reverses than Lu Fayan. Since the system of reverses used by Huilin was not pure, and the pronunciations could not include every small initial consonant, it is impossible to find a complete and precise "Yun Ying" system from this pile of materials. Moreover, from Dai Dongyuan to Mr. Huang, they all considered the 580 rhymes to be the distinction between "dong" and "dong," and did not realize that it was the distinction between "hong" and "zhong." Therefore, they could never figure out how so many rhymes came about.

Now, we can conclude that "Emperor Xuanzong's Yun Ying" is the same as "Yuan Tingjian's Yun Ying." Due to the An Lushan Rebellion, it did not become popular, and only Huilin adopted it due to the Qin sound system. Later, it was lost.

### On the "Jian'an" Designation

— Wang Liqi

The name "Jian'an" of the Wei dynasty was commonly used by people of the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Song periods. The preface to Xiahou Xiaoruo's eulogy for the portrait of Dongfang Shuo in "Wen Xuan" states:

The Grand Master's name was Shuo, courtesy name Manqian, a native of Anci in Pingyuan. During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, Anci was divided to establish the Lelang Commandery, so he was also a native of that commandery.

The "So Yin" commentary on the "Records of Xiao Xiangguo" states:

The "Gazetteer of the Taikang Era" states, "During the Jian'an period of Emperor Wu of Wei, the Nanyang region was divided to establish the Nanxiang Commandery. Emperor Wu of Jin later renamed it Shanyang Commandery." The "Yiwen Leiju" Volume 55, the preface to the collected works of Zhou Yu of the Zhao Kingdom states:

Since the end of the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty and the Taikang era of the Jin dynasty, there have been three major changes in the style of calligraphy. Everyone claims to hold the pearl of the sacred serpent and embrace the jade of Mount Jing. Yan Shigu's commentary on the "Preface" of the "Book of Han" and the "Examination of Names, Titles, and Hometowns of Various Families in the Book of Han" states:

Deng Zhan, a native of Nanyang, served as General Fenwei during the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, facing Gao Le, Marquis of Xiang.

Wen Ying, courtesy name Shuliang, a native of Nanyang, served as an attendant to the Jing Province at the end of the Later Han dynasty. During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, he served as the Deputy Magistrate of Ganling. The "New Tang History, Biography of Song Zhiwen" states:

After the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty, and continuing through the Jiangzuo, poetic rules changed repeatedly. By the time of Shen Yue and Yu Xin, they subtly adhered to clear rhymes and precise antitheses. By the time of Zhiwen and Quanqi, they added more beauty and avoided tonal flaws. The phrases and chapters were standardized like brocade interwoven, and scholars followed them, calling them Shen Song, with the saying, "Su and Li in the front, Shen and Song shoulder to shoulder," referring to Su Wu and Li Ling. Accumulation of incorrect habits, this is one example. However, there are also those who doubt it. Li Shan's commentary on the preface to Dongfang Shuo's eulogy for the portrait in "Wen Xuan" states:

The Later Han Dynasty's "Book of Han" states that Emperor Xian changed the third year of Xingping to the first year of Jian'an. The current text says Wei, which is suspected to be an error.

He Yimen's "Reading Notes" states:

Jian'an was still a year of the Han dynasty. Even though the Han dynasty held the imperial court, how could it be attributed to the Wei? There is no doubt that it is an error.

Gu Tinglin's "Daily Knowledge Records" Volume 27, the entry on "Commentary on the Book of Han" states:

Yan Shigu wrote the "Preface" to the "Book of Han." The surnames listed, Deng Zhan and Wen Ying, both state, "During the Jian'an period of the Wei dynasty." Jian'an was the reign title of the Han Emperor Xian. Even though the government came from the Cao family, it should not be hastily attributed to the Wei.

Now, considering the aforementioned families, whether deeply knowledgeable in historical works or excelling in literary talent, how could they not know that Jian'an should be attributed to the Han and not to the Wei? However, they all followed suit, and this practice has persisted for generations. It is unlikely that those who use it are wrong and those who doubt it are right. Considering Liu Yuanlin's commentary on the "Wei Capital Rhapsody" in "Wen Xuan":

In front of the Wenchang Hall, there are bells, and their inscriptions say, "In the fourth year of the Wei dynasty, the year bing shen, the dragon in the fire, the fifth month bing yin, the bells for offering sacrifices were made, and also the Wu She bells." In the twenty-first year of Jian'an, the Yin bells were first placed in front of the Wenchang Hall, so that all directions could be informed.

The fourth year of Wei refers to the fourth year that Cao Cao was the Duke of Wei, which is the twenty-first year of Emperor Xian of Han's Jian'an reign. During the Han dynasty, feudal lords could declare their own first year, as stated in the "Huainan Astronomical Treatise": "The first year of Huainan, Taiyi was in bing zi." This is similar to the sixteenth year of Emperor Wen. In the "Table of Meritorious Marquises of Emperor Gaozu," the sixth year of Emperor Gaozu was the first year of Marquis Cao Shen of Pingyang. The sixth year of Emperor Hui was the first year of Marquis Jun of Jing. The fourth year after Emperor Wen was the first year of Marquis Qi of Jian. The fourth year of Emperor Jing was the first year of Marquis Shi of Yi. The fifth year of Yuanguang of Emperor Wu was the first year of Marquis Xiang of Gong. The third year of Yuanding was the first year of Marquis Zong of Jin. All these are examples. Ever since Cao Cao became the Duke of Wei in the eighteenth year of Jian'an and received additional gifts, in the seventh month, he first established the ancestral temples and altars of the Wei dynasty. Wang Can wrote the "Ode to the Grand Temple." In the beginning of the eleventh month, he established the six prefectures of the Shangshu and Shizhong. In the first month of the nineteenth year, he first plowed the imperial field. In the tenth month of the twentieth year, he established the titles of Marquis. In the third month of the twenty-first year, Cao Cao personally plowed the imperial field. Considering all these actions, none of them were not usurpations of the Son of Heaven. Canglang's "Poetry Talks" criticizes poetry, stating:

Liu Gonggan's poem presented to the General of the Five Offices, "In the past, I followed the first ruler, preparing the carriage to the southern countryside, passing the capital of Fengpei, flying together with you." The first ruler likely refers to Cao Cao, and going to the southern countryside refers to the time when he attacked Liu Biao. The capital of Fengpei is a metaphor for Cao Cao's deliberations on the commandery. Wang Zhongxuan's poem "Joining the Army" states, "Planning strategies in the tent, all depends on my sage ruler." The sage ruler also refers to Cao Cao. It also says, "I secretly admire the cauldron-bearing elder, willing to hone my dull talents." This is to emulate Yi Yin carrying the cauldron for Tang to attack Jie. At this time, the Han Emperor still existed, and the words of the two men were like this, one calling him the first ruler, the other calling him the sage ruler, just like Xun Yu comparing Cao Cao to Gao Guang. Some criticize Gonggan for treating beauties as not bending, which is not an understanding of people. The Spring and Autumn Annals' method of judging intent, how can the two men escape?

The deaths of Wang and Liu were both in the twenty-second year of Jian'an. At that time, Cao Cao had not yet died, and Pi had not yet usurped the Han. Yet their words were already like this. The "Commentary on the Biography of Emperor Hou of the Shu Kingdom of the Three Kingdoms" states:

According to ritual, when a ruler succeeds to the throne, the reign title is changed the following year. However, in the third year of Zhangwu, the reign title was changed to Jianxing, which is far from the principles of ritual.

Pei Songzhi's commentary states:

According to this, the reign titles of Jianwu and Jian'an were not changed for a long time. The former histories have not heard of this being praised.

Based on this, the reign title of Jian'an of Cao Wei was not changed for a long time, and the former histories have even criticized it. However, after the eighteenth year of Jian'an of the Han dynasty, the Son of Heaven held the imperial court, and the government was in the hands of the Cao family. Observing their division of fields and provinces to govern the world, such as the change of Lelang Commandery, even the Sima Jin dynasty mostly followed suit. Therefore, its lingering influence was far-reaching. Moreover, the Cao family, father and son, accumulated great talents and led the masses. Therefore, talented people emerged like clouds, forming a vibrant atmosphere, and later generations even had the term "Jian'an style." Therefore, the designation of Wei Jian'an, calling it by name, was a power taken from the old Han dynasty, adding Wei indicates a separation from Han. The name is a guest of reality, calling it Wei Jian'an, this is the historiographer's method of dividing eras.

### Reading "The Jin History in the Governance Essentials from Various Books"

— Ran Zhaode

Mr. Hu Shi:

Yesterday, I read your article "The Jin History in the Governance Essentials from Various Books" in the ninth issue of the "Literary History" section of the February 7th "Shen Bao." You believe that the Jin History collected in "Governance Essentials" is the Jin History of Zang Rongxu. Your evidence is:

I looked at Huang Shi's collection of the Jin Histories of various families, "Examination of Lost Books in the Hanxuetang (?)", and referred to the saying in Fang Xuanling's biography that "Zang Rongxu's Jin History was used as the main source." Then, using the current Tang-edited Jin History for comparison, I can guess that the Jin History collected in "Governance Essentials" is Zang Rongxu's Jin History... Try comparing the Biography of Liu Yi (of the Western Jin) in the Jin History of Governance Essentials, the Biography of Liu Yi in Zang's History collected by Huang Shuang, and the Biography of Liu Yi in the current Jin History. Then compare the Biography of Tao Kan in these three versions. You can then know that the Jin History collected in Governance Essentials is Zang Rongxu's Jin History..."

The conclusion you obtained through conjecture and comparison is absolutely correct. However, this issue has already been settled by previous scholars. It seems that we should no longer conduct another round of textual research.

The third series of "Juxuexuan Congshu" contains "Jingshi Shangyilu" by Zhang Congxian of Xicheng, which contains an article "Discussion with Vice Minister Ruan on Examples of Lost Jin History," which discusses the Jin History collected in the "Governance Essentials." Zhang cites a total of six pieces of evidence, thus determining that the Jin History quoted by Wei Zheng is Zang Rongxu's Jin History. Excerpts are provided below for reference.

### Discussion with Vice Minister Ruan on Examples of Lost Jin History

— Zhang Congxian

I have been shown the various biographies from the Jin History cited by Wei Zheng in Tang Dynasty's "Governance Essentials from Various Books," all of which are versions from before the Zhenguan era, and can be used to supplement lost texts. Now, examining the Jin History, from the Middle Revival and the Liu Song Dynasty, the Eastern (Jin) and Western (Jin) each had a separate history. It was only from Zang during the Southern Qi dynasty that the histories were combined into one family's history. In the Tang Dynasty before Wei Zheng, all citations of history that referred to "Jin History" were referring to Zang's history... The "New Tang History, Chronicle of Emperor Taizong" states in the tenth year of the Zhenguan era that Emperor Taizong ordered Fang Xuanling and others to revise the Jin History (note that neither "Liang Huiyao" nor "Liang Tangshu Chronicle of Emperor Taizong" record the re-compilation of the Jin History), using Zang Rongxu's Jin History as the base, and supplemented it with excerpts from various family chronicles and biographies. Therefore, the Jin History chronicles, treatises, and biographies cited by Wei Zheng are roughly the same as those contained in Xuanling's version, which is Zang's history. Shallow people see that the cited chronicles and treatises are similar in order to the current version and consider them to be the book of Fang et al. Qian Xiaozheng, Palace Attendant, wants to consider Wei Zheng's book as a false compilation, likely without examining it thoroughly. Those who cited Zang's Jin History during the Liang, Chen, and early Tang dynasties often did not attribute it to Zang, just as Tang people often did not attribute the "Later Han History" to Fan during the Tang dynasty... Wei Zheng's book cites the imperial chronicles beginning with Emperor Wen and ending with Emperor Jianwen. Emperor Wen is the third generation of the Western Jin, and Emperor Jianwen is the eighth generation of the Eastern Jin. This is the first piece of evidence that Zang's combined history can be verified. Wei Zheng's book cites the empress biographies, which Fang et al.'s book also treats as biographies. This is the second piece of evidence that Zang's book was used as the basis for Xuanling's work. The Western Jin books, such as Wang Yin's book, treat empresses as chronicles, using the example of Hua Qiao's "Later Han History." Fang et al.'s book uniquely treats them as biographies, which is still the old form of Zang's book. This is the third piece of evidence that can be verified. Rongxu's book divides records into chronicles, treatises, and biographies. The treatises in Fang et al.'s book are also based on the old examples. Therefore, Wei Zheng cites Zang's book as having treatises on penal law and treatises on officials. Wang Yin's Western Jin treatise book treats them as records, such as the "Record of Geography," seen in the "Water Classic Commentary." He Fasheng's Eastern Jin book treats the treatise on officials as a table of officials, using the example of Ban Gu's book in the former Han dynasty (original note, seen in "Beitang Shuchao"). Fang et al. still follow Zang's various treatises, and Wei's immediately cite Zang's book, which is not the book of Wang Yin or He Fasheng. This is the fourth piece of evidence that can be verified. Zhu Feng's book records from Emperor Gao to Emperor Yuan, which is the beginning of the Middle Revival. Wei Zheng's citation has already reached Emperor Jianwen, eight generations after the Middle Revival. Chu Yu's book records from Emperor Gao to Emperor Ming, which is the second generation of the Middle Revival. Wei Zheng's citation has already reached Emperor Jianwen, only three rulers away from the end of the Jin dynasty. This is definitely Zang's book, and not Zhu Feng's or Chu Yu's book. This is the fifth piece of evidence that can be verified. The records of Gan Bao, Lu Ji, Cao Jia, Xu Guang, Deng Can, Wang Shaozhi, and Liu Qianzhi, and the spring and autumn chronicles of Xi Shengchi and Tan Daoyue, all summarize events of different eras, without chronicles, treatises, or prefaces. The "Sui History" includes them in Miscellaneous History (note that the "Sui History" includes them in Ancient History, not Miscellaneous History) and does not list them with the official histories of Zhu, Yu, Wang, and He. Wei's citation further confirms that it is Zang's book, and not the records of the seven families of Gan, Deng, Cao, Xu, Lu, Wang, and Liu, or the spring and autumn chronicles of the two families of Xi and Tan. This is the sixth piece of evidence that can be verified. With these six pieces of evidence, we know that Wei Zheng's citation is Zang's book, and all single citations of Jin History during the Liang, Chen, Sui, and Tang dynasties that do not state the family name can be definitely determined to be Zang's book without doubt.

Zhang Congcheng's six pieces of evidence only establish arguments based on the style and beginning and ending points of the Jin histories of various families. Although he did not use the comparative work of each book, it is already sufficient to prove that the Jin History in "Governance Essentials" is definitely Zang Rongxu's Jin History. I do not know if you have any opinions for revision or supplementation regarding this statement? Respectfully wishing you peace, Ran Zhaode, bowing in sincerity (March 12th, Northwest University, Xi'an).

### Postscript

— Hu Shih

I am very grateful to Mr. Ran Zhaode for introducing Zhang Congcheng of Tongcheng's "On the Historical Examples of the Jin Dynasty with Minister Ruan." Zhang Congcheng's conjecture that the Jin Shu in Qun Shu Zhi Yao was Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu is a very rare insight at the time. However, older scholars often do not clearly understand the methods they use when conducting textual research, so their methods are often not very meticulous. For example, of the six pieces of evidence cited by Zhang, the second, third, and fourth are not sufficient as evidence. For example, the second piece of evidence says: "Wei Zheng's book quotes the Biography of Empresses and Consorts, and Fang Xuanling's book also makes a biography. This proves that Zang's book was the basis for Xuanling." This obvious evidence is not convincing.

Zhang's first, fifth, and sixth assumptions are tenable. However, these are all heavily focused on negative evidence, proving that what Zhi Yao collected was not the books of Zhu, Yu, Gan, Deng, and others. Positive evidence seems to be insufficient.

Therefore, I cannot agree with Mr. Ran's statement that "this issue has already been settled by previous scholars, and we do not seem to need to conduct another round of textual research." Because this issue has not been settled by previous scholars, compilers of lost works still do not recognize that what Zhi Yao adopted was Zang Rongxu's Jin Shu. Therefore, I propose using the method of comparing the content to strictly prove that the Jin Shu in Zhi Yao is indeed Zang's book. Only after this "textual research" can this issue be settled.

### Also on Thrift

— Jingwen

It is said that the authorities are going to ban luxury goods again, and nylon stockings and imported cosmetics will soon be banned from sale, with violators subject to confiscation. Similar news seemed to have appeared in the newspapers a few months ago, but the result, apart from promoting hoarding and raising the prices of such goods, has not seen any other effect. What will be the effectiveness of this time, probably can also be "wait and see".

At this time of hardship for the general public, the extravagant lives of a few should naturally be restricted, but in view of the failures of previous thrift campaigns, there is a clear need to change the method of restriction. Past methods of restriction have often focused on formal, rigid regulations, such as the customs having explicit prohibitions on the import of certain types of luxury goods, and confiscating smuggled goods that are seized. However, these confiscated smuggled goods eventually flowed into the market through customs auctions. It is said that cunning people even smuggle goods that are strictly prohibited, secretly report them to the customs themselves, and then buy them back when the customs hold auctions, thus both obtaining secret reporting bonuses and "legally" selling their goods at high prices, making huge profits in a turn of the hand, and posing as legitimate merchants seeking profit from their capital. The reason why imported luxury goods continue to flow into the market today is partly due to this.

However, nylon and Max Factor, etc., are they really like opium? In terms of the current economic situation of the general public, although these things are close to luxury, if everyone has the ability to consume them, then it is not far from the realm of a prosperous and strong country. In fact, the prosperity of a country's economy depends on the consumption capacity of its people. And seeking a beautiful and comfortable life should be said to be the goal of human civilization. Eating canned food, fruits, and milk powder, etc., from a strict economic point of view, cannot be said to be extravagance at all, but only normal consumption.

However, there is a prerequisite here, that is, the consumption capacity of the national economy must be averaged. Nylon stockings and Max Factor cosmetics themselves cannot be said to be luxury goods. Only when a few people wear nylon stockings and cause millions of people to go barefoot, and a few people's faces are radiant and make millions of people look pale, do these things become luxury goods. Now the authorities want to strictly enforce thrift and prohibit the sale of such goods, which is of course based on this.

In today's urban life in China, the contradictory phenomenon of "behind the crimson gates meat and wine go to waste, while out on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death" can be found everywhere. This not only exposes the serious weaknesses of the national economy, but also makes the social gap increasingly deep. The decline of public morale and the anxiety of the people can all be found in this unbalanced national economic life.

However, simply prohibiting the sale of luxury goods has no effect. In a country that respects the system of private property, you cannot interfere with a person's freedom to dispose of their property. Rich people all have the attitude of "I have plenty of money, you can't control me!" And as long as businessmen can profit from it, they don't care about official or private goods. Besides, even if a dozen pairs of nylon stockings are confiscated, it won't be a capital crime. Don't you see what the so-called frugal dishes are still the result of today? I predict that after some so-called luxury goods are banned from sale one day, transactions will definitely be even more intense, at most making the way of buying and selling more "underground."

I think that instead of issuing a formal ban, it is better to imitate the state monopoly system practiced in the Soviet Union before the war, that is, in major cities, the state operates special stores that specialize in selling high-end imported luxury goods, and raises their prices significantly. On the one hand, it prohibits ordinary stores from selling such goods, and violators will not only have their goods confiscated, but also be subject to severe punishment. And use the profits from this state-run store to allocate to undertakings that benefit the national welfare. As for the types of luxury goods listed as state monopolies, they can be increased or decreased depending on the standard of living of the general public.

There are several advantages to doing this. The first is that it can meet the needs of those who need them, and the benefits are for society, while the same is consuming foreign exchange. Secondly, if the price is so high that even the rich are discouraged, then it can be said that the ban is implied in the levy.

Some people may say: In this way, the social gap will be even deeper. Isn't it equivalent to openly acknowledging the existence of privileged people for the state to monopolize luxury goods? But I think this is irrelevant. Those who can afford luxury goods now are originally a small number of people. If everyone in China has the ability to enjoy what are currently called imported luxury goods, then they would no longer be luxury goods long ago. And for these few people, persuasive thrift and rigid bans will not have any effect. Therefore, it is better to openly acknowledge their special status, and the method of high-priced monopoly may have a slight effect of restraint.

However, from an economic point of view, reducing expenditure is originally a last resort, and it is best to be able to focus on increasing income. A country's economic policy, if it specializes in reducing people's consumption and enjoyment, is enough to say a word of pity. Especially if thrift is promoted and a few people are still allowed to live an extravagant life, it should be said to be unreasonable. If we really want to talk about thrift, then we should learn from the example of Britain after the war. The thrift policy they implemented is one that simultaneously focuses on increasing income and reducing expenditure. If our authorities do not have this courage, then they may as well adopt my idea, openly acknowledge the special status of the rich, which may be more practical than an ostrich-like thrift.

### Luxurious Stores

— Mao Yi

Although the center of the women's fashion industry in the United States is in New York, the giants of the fashion industry are not in New York, but in the "Neiman Marcus store" in Dallas, the capital of Texas. It holds a fashion exhibition at the Baker Hotel every week at lunchtime, and many rich ladies travel a long way to visit; it presents awards to the best tailors every year, and the New York newspapers publish these news in large formats.

Neiman Marcus is not only famous for its fashion, but also for its luxury. It sells fur coats for 16,500 yuan, clothes made for 695 yuan, handbags for 75 yuan, hats for 160 yuan, handkerchiefs for 150 yuan, and sapphire necklaces for 48,000 yuan—the prices are of course in US dollars.

What made this store successful were the extravagant Texans. They made a fortune from operating oil, wheat, cattle, sheep, or cotton, and spending thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars is nothing.

The store once published an advertisement selling a large diamond ring weighing 24.35 carats, priced at 127,000 US dollars. Soon there was a customer who wrote on an ordinary postcard: "Please send the diamond ring advertised, and charge the price to my account"—a big deal was concluded so easily.

Every year at Christmas, Neiman Marcus is decorated intricately, and last year's theme was "White Christmas." The entire window display was white: a white feather Christmas tree, hung with a sparkling white diamond bracelet, surrounded by fantastic white gifts, from silver fox robes to milky white glass tableware, everything was complete. A young oil tycoon saw it, and he did not hesitate to order the store to completely move the goods in the entire window to his home on Christmas Eve, at a cost of 35,000 US dollars.

The population of Dallas is only 450,000, but oil has fattened them, and the annual consumption of fashion reaches 12 million gold dollars, which shows how extravagant they are.

It is impossible to find where the spring has returned, the garden is full of singing birds and deep green shade. How much do you know about the falling of flowers in the forest? This made the poet chant all night long.

My heart is desolate in every way, thorns lie across the path, and the white sun sets in the west. Hearing the sound of returning, the cuckoo cries on the Tianjin Bridge.

Peach Blossom Remaining on a Branch in the Wind and Rain

Green on the study window, half leaning, light clouds as mist, willow silk drooping. Inadvertently realize that the spring is late, peach blossoms remaining on a branch in the wind and rain.

### Stealing Poetry

— Qian Dacheng

Meng Dongye has a poem called "Stealing Poetry." I have read it dozens of times and still don't know how to explain it. I don't know what his intention is. I think he must be referring to something. However, the fact of stealing poetry has existed since ancient times, and it is still unavoidable today. Plagiarism of articles is even more commonplace. It is said that Qu Wengshan, one of the three masters of Lingnan, stole a poem from a monk. Fan Fanshan took several volumes of Li Yueman's diary, so he always hid and did not come out. The biggest reason was that he had completely copied the Li poems in those volumes of diary. Ten years ago, a certain arrogant person stole on a large scale and in a special way. He not only stole poems from contemporary people, but also stole poems from ancient people. He even stole poems that everyone knew and would definitely recognize, which was too bold. Recently, the poet Chen Boying was also stolen dozens of poems by him. He was extremely angry and jokingly inscribed five four-character poems on the "elegant thief's" glorious poetry collection, ridiculing with joy and anger, which was very amusing. I will copy them below: "A book jumps out, dragons soar and phoenixes dance, everything has its origin, like Du Gongbu. (One) Taking the delicacies of the Five Marquises and forming one's own school of thought, being born a Buddha, this is called wisdom root. (Two) Using my brushwork to come to your writing essentials, being extremely familiar and flowing, this is also called knowing oneself. (Three) Beautiful eyebrows are jealous, and heroes appreciate each other. You are originally a beauty, why be a thief? (Four) Separating bones to return to father, separating flesh to return to mother, Nezha Prince, good luck white lotus root. (Five)" This person also copied other people's elegies, but he himself was only a young man at the time and had not yet married. It's laughable. At that time, leaders of the poetry world such as Chen Shiyi and Jin Songcen were deceived, and even compared him to Yi Shifu, calling him a child prodigy. In fact, this person was too fond of fame. At the same time, I also thought of Emperor Yang of Sui, who loved the line "Swallows fall on the empty beam, plastering mud" from his minister (I remember it was Xue Daoheng?), and wanted to take it away from him. When he could not take it away, he was extremely jealous and killed the minister. At the same time, he said, "Can you still write "Swallows fall on the empty beam, plastering mud" now?" With the dignity of an emperor, he became extremely jealous for the sake of a line of poetry. It is really difficult to explain his intention. Perhaps he deeply felt what Cao Pi said: "Life has a time to end, and glory and joy are limited to oneself. Both are inevitable and constant periods, not as good as the endlessness of writing," right? This is also a unique shot in terms of literary inquisition, rare in ancient and modern times. Loving other people's poems and having the idea and action of stealing them can still be considered the behavior of the weak. It is said that Yi Shifu, a talented man of Longyang, loved the line "Green shadows peek into the window" in the ghost poems of the eight-fingered monk Jichan, and wanted to buy it from Jichan, but Jichan refused. Yi Shifu's own poems were actually much better than Jichan's, which was really inexplicable, but it was passed down as a good story. Lu Xun said, "The article is good in itself." It is not necessarily entirely true. Some people feel that it is like a wife, and other people's are good too. Since there is stealing jade and comparing it to fragrance in the world, there will naturally be stealing poetry. Because of the love of fame and stealing poetry, compared to plagiarizing other people's articles for the sake of royalties, I still side with the elegant thief who steals poetry.

### Casual Talks on Letters

— Zheng Yimei

I have no interest in what people like in singing, dancing, dogs, and horses, but I like antiques, flowers, calligraphy, and letters from famous people, and I am especially fond of letters from famous people. What I have collected are mostly letters from the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, and contemporary celebrities, about hundreds of them. Some value their character, some value their calligraphy, and some value their words. And those who are extremely evil and wicked are also included. The stationery at that time was often self-made, such as Wu Keqi's Dragon Knot Stationery, Chen Jieqi's Yu Qi Stationery, Ye Juchang's Five Hundred Sutra Pillar Hall Stationery, Xu Huanong's Imperial Sacredly Bestowed Stationery, Wu Yinpei's Dew凝書屋 Stationery, Yuan Cai's Ju Yan Zhai Stationery, Liu Shishu's Small Suddenly Thunder Pavilion Stationery, Du Wenlan's Mandala Flower Pavilion Stationery, Xu Zhongke's Wash Feet Ten Thousand Miles Flow Stationery, Zhou Zhiqi's Yan Nan Xiá Stationery, Hu Shiyu's Plum Blossom Habit and Cold as Fate Stationery, Hong Jun's One 　Flower Shadow Stationery, Zhang Mingke's Cold Pine Pavilion Stationery, Yin Guang's Yongming Fire Master Four Materials 　; Bao Xi's Ink Edge Hall Stationery, Liang Dingfen's 　Hua Room Stationery, Luo Zhenyu's Great Auspicious Stationery, Yu Tingying's Tan Pian Shanfang Stationery, Liu Gonglu's Chu Garden Stationery, Yuan Hanyun's Han Bi Yu　Wen Stationery, antique and fragrant, I cherish them very much.

Although the era is very recent, those that are rarely seen outside of their hometowns, such as the great lyricist Kuang Zhou, Pan Lengcan, who died in the Huanghuagang Uprising of the seventy-two martyrs, Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the isolated army, the eminent monk Hongyi, and the Cantonese poet Yi Dachang, were given to me by friends, and they are as precious as jade. As the saying goes, things return to what one likes, indeed!

I saw a lot of Ming Dynasty letters at my late friend Pan Boshan's place, such as Wang Yangming, Shi Kefa, Yan Song, Tang Liuru, and Zhu Yunming. Although the virtuous and the treacherous are judged differently, their calligraphy is exquisite. And when they wrote letters at that time, the stationery was relatively large, probably because the so-called letter was measured in terms of being one foot long and wide. There are also palace letters from the Song Dynasty. I have a box of them, a total of one hundred frames. Those that are absolutely lovely, such as Shi Bi and Wen Yanbo, have extremely fluent characters, making people imagine the state of their writing like flying. Sima Guang is cautious and neat. Ouyang Xiu's style is noble and gorgeous, and his skill is comprehensive. Zhao Bu's letters have only a few words, but his seals are numerous. Wang Jinggong's strokes are unrestrained and have a unique cold charm. What Su Dongpo called the lawless law cannot be learned. Mi Nan Gong's letters are deep and flying, and are especially wonderful. Dongpo and his eldest son Mai are sparse and unrestrained, and they are all short letters. Xiao Su Ziyou is strong and good. Huang Tingjian's letter to Tongguan Scholar Zhi Wu Jiu is leisurely and full of meaning, which shows his high mind. Others, such as Han Zaiwang's boldness, Cai Junmo's flying, Li Gang's plumpness, and Qian Fu's Xiao San, each have their own faces, and their concise and lofty words can be a model.

Living in Shanghai is cramped, and the room is only enough to accommodate the knees. Only collecting letters takes up little space. Whether I display them in front of the window or appreciate them under the lamp, the dust and vulgarity in my heart are swept away, which is very pleasant! The only regret is that there are not many like-minded people who collect letters, and it is not as common as collecting stamps. Otherwise, we can learn from each other, exchange what we have and what we don't have, which is worth promoting.

### Long-Lived Emperors

— Guoping

The "long-lived emperors" I am referring to do not refer to long life, but to the long number of years in power. In fact, those who are in power for a long time are also long-lived.

The first is Louis XIV of France, who reigned for a full seventy-two years. Louis XIV's most famous saying is "I am the state." He built many extremely luxurious palaces, the most famous of which is the Palace of Versailles, which everyone knows. Unfortunately, his policies were wrong, foreign wars continued, and he squandered money, resulting in an empty treasury and suffering for the people, which caused the distant cause of the French Revolution.

The second is Queen Victoria of England, who reigned for sixty-eight years. Everyone knows that the Victorian era was the golden age of England, and politics, economics, literature, art, etc. all reached their peak.

The third is Franz Joseph of Austria, who reigned for sixty-eight years. When Joseph was in power, he happened to encounter Hungary breaking away from Austria and becoming independent, but with his ability, he finally kept the country safe.

### Eccentricities of Celebrities

— Jinlin

American novelist Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.

German philosopher Kant did not allow anyone to talk to him during his daily walks.

### 

With the implementation of the Constitution, everything is new, and someone asked about the official document format issued by the civil service office. The five branches of government are parallel, all being high-level central agencies. However, the members and heads of the Legislative and Control Yuans are elected, while those of the Executive, Examination, and Judicial Yuans are appointed. Therefore, when the President issues documents to the Legislative and Control Yuans, he must use "Consultation," while to the Executive, Judicial, and 　Yuans, he can use "Order." It seems that the system of the five Yuans cannot maintain the solemnity of "five peaks standing side by side." I said that the gains and losses in this can be compared with old precedents.

According to the terms and methods of "Consultation," they were based on previous generations, while "Order" was created in the Republic of China. In the old days, orders were used from top to bottom, and statements and details were used from bottom to top. Parallel lines used "Consultation" and "Transfer." In the Republic of China, "Order" was used from top to bottom, meaning command and order, which was very appropriate. But in the old days, only the military camps had orders, and the political world had nothing. And the old "Statement, Detail, Report" were all abolished. (Yuan Shikai changed it so that superiors used "Instruction" to subordinates, and subordinates used "Detail" to superiors, only the President could use "Order" to all subordinates. Therefore, the only old name that has been used for more than thirty years in the Republic of China and is still used today is "Consultation."

At the beginning of the Republic of China, only the Congress used "Consultation" to the President. The reason was that the members and speakers of both houses were elected, and that legislation and administration were parallel but not subordinate. At that time, the powers of the Congress were expanded, and its arrogance was boundless. All major ceremonies such as "Constitution Making" and "Electing the President" were organized jointly by the members of the two houses, which was nothing short of monopolizing them. And 　monitoring and impeaching could directly consult with the head of state, which was not only a legislative body, but directly like a Supreme Government, which was inherently unreasonable. The current system has been completely corrected, "Constitution Making" and "General Election" belong to the National Assembly, and legislation and supervision are also divided into two Yuans, which are already clear. The Legislative Yuan has the right to approve the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan also has the right to approve the heads of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, which is to respect elections and is a sign of democratic significance. Then the system of the Legislative and Control Yuans, although parallel to the three Yuans, the official document format cannot but be slightly different, which is very reasonable.
