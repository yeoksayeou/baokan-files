### Chairman Emphasizes Ensuring the Northeast; the Foundation of the Nation Rests There; the Government Is Determined; Fiercest Fighting Reached Its Climax in the Suburbs of Siping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Northeast Petition Delegation, consisting of Wang Huayi, Zhang Baozi, Li Zhonghua, and Tian Yushi, paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at 4:00 PM on the 8th to present their case. In addition to submitting a written statement outlining four demands, they also provided detailed accounts of the situation and difficulties in the Northeast. The discussion lasted for one hour, concluding at 5:00 PM. Chairman Chiang gave the most satisfactory responses to the delegation's four proposals: reinforcement, food transport, youth education, and currency reform. Furthermore, deeply concerned about the plight of the people in the Northeast, the Chairman repeatedly emphasized the importance of cooperation between the military and the civilians, stressing that the central government would never abandon the Northeast, stating: "Ensuring the Northeast is the foundation of the nation; the government is fully determined. We have already increased troop deployments to strengthen military forces, and the situation will gradually improve." The Chairman's firm tone left the delegation with a favorable impression. (The Chairman's personal assurance to the Northeast Petition Delegation regarding the reform of the Northeast currency system and the results of discussions with the Social Affairs, Communications, and Education departments regarding strengthening relief efforts are published in the second column of the second page.)

[Our Pan Yang Dispatch, 8th] The Battle of Siping has reached its climax. The bandits, with the main force of six columns and two independent divisions from North Manchuria, launched a general offensive on the 7th. The Third Column took on the frontal attack, with the Tiexi District (west of the railway) being the first to be repelled. The Nationalist army is in the Tiedong District (east of the railway), east of Tianqiao. According to the past experience of the Siping campaign, the Nationalist army achieved final victory in Tiedong, but this time the situation is different from the past, yet this can still buy time. Communication between Siping and Shenyang was lost for a time on the 7th but was restored on the 8th. On the 8th, the air force also made its best effort to reconnoiter and bomb the attacking bandits, and communication was established with the defending troops in Tiedong District. According to reports, although the defending troops are in a difficult situation, they are very brave. Furthermore, in Benxi, southeast of Shenyang, the situation is even better. Reinforcements arrived on the 7th. A certain unit, with a small number of troops, has held the Waitoushan station for more than twenty days. The Benxi garrison launched a corresponding counterattack, and met up with the reinforcements in Waitoushan, and are making continued efforts. In order to reverse the decline, the bandits in Anshan are also moving in that direction.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The fighting outside of Siping is still proceeding intensely. The previous report that Siping had fallen to the bandits was a mistake for Siping Airport falling to the bandits. On the 6th, the airport was heavily damaged by intense artillery fire in many places and could not be used. In order to concentrate firepower, the Nationalist army withdrew from the suburbs. On the 7th, the bandit army disregarded death and charged towards the strongholds of Boluo Linzi, Hai Wan Tun, and others dozens of times throughout the day, but they were all bravely repelled by the Nationalist army, with piles of corpses left behind, and they ultimately failed to succeed. Currently, the bandits in the area more than thirty kilometers outside of Changchun are moving frequently, attempting to resist the Nationalist army's southward advance, but the strong Nationalist forces in that area are still acting according to the predetermined plan.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The situation in Rehe Province is expected to improve soon. Before Zhu takes office, Fan Hanjie will first clear the eastern Rehe corridor. Yu Guozhen, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, will come to Beiping in a day or two to meet with Fan Hanjie to determine the plan for the military and political development.

### Nationalist Army Advances Rapidly Along the Tongyu Line; Annihilation War Is About to Begin; Remnant Bandits Fiercely Attack Dongtai County Seat, But Fail

[Our Dongtai Urgent Dispatch, 8th] (1) After the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu suffered a setback from the Nationalist army's resistance on the Grand Canal line, they regrouped the remnants of the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns and, on the night of the 6th, advanced from the coastal area and the border of Yandong towards Dongtai County. The Nationalist army and local units stationed there calmly responded to the attack, and the invaders suffered heavy casualties. Around 1:00 AM on the 7th, about four regiments of the bandit Eleventh Column launched another full-scale attack on the northeastern positions of the county seat, dividing into six routes and engaging in fierce fighting in the area around the county seat's automobile bridge, Erli Bridge, and Donghong Bridge. The bandit army launched a fierce attack on the county seat with dense artillery fire, but was ultimately repelled by the Nationalist army's superior firepower. That night, more than 2,000 bandits were killed. (2) On the night of the 7th, a part of the bandit Eleventh and Twelfth Columns advanced towards Su Yindun, Han Jia Yao, Lao Ba, Beiguan Bridge, and other places in the northwest corner of Dongtai County. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. (3) The bandit Qintong Independent Regiment, Xinghua Independent Regiment, Lao Si Regiment, and Xin Liu Regiment, on the night of the 7th, coordinated with the bandits attacking Dongtai, launching five attacks on Xixi and Shanghai’s warehouses, three kilometers away from Dongtai County, but were all bravely repelled by the Nationalist army and local forces.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] In the border area of Yancheng, Dongtai, and Xinghua, small groups of bandits infiltrated on the 7th, and land and water transportation to Dongtai was cut off. Xinghua County is still holding firm.

[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 7th] As of the afternoon of the 7th, the Chen bandits' Second Column, fleeing south, had not yet taken concrete action. Furthermore, in order to contain the Nationalist army's forces, a part of the bandit Twelfth Column attempted to move south along the Tongyu line from the 4th, spying on the bandit trails in Dongtai. It was discovered very close to the northeast of Dongtai, and a strong Nationalist army unit is intercepting them from the south of Yancheng.

### Two Mysterious Guests Suddenly Arrive in the Old Capital; After a Four-Month Trek from Outer Mongolia to Peiping; Rumored to Be Planning to Go to the United States to Request Powerful Assistance

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] (Zhou Dao) The Xihu Hotel in the old capital recently received two mysterious guests from Outer Mongolia via Zhangjiakou. Reporters made several attempts to interview them, but were unsuccessful. According to a Zhangjiakou dispatch in the North China Daily, they are two Outer Mongolian military officers who trekked for four months to reach Zhangjiakou. They are planning to go to New York to request powerful assistance from the United States for Outer Mongolia, so that Outer Mongolia can achieve true independence. It is said that one is named Du You Ali Ge, who studied education in the Soviet Union and served as a company commander in the Outer Mongolian internal defense team before leaving Outer Mongolia. The other is named Nawazhamusu, who studied military affairs in the Soviet Union. He was a colonel instructor in the entertainment corps, but they are wearing uniforms with blue corner sleeve trim and collar trim, which should be officer uniforms. Their journey south is full of legendary qualities. They escaped from Outer Mongolia to Suo Chang, where they met Yun Ze's younger brother, Yun Pu (head of the economic department of the Inner Mongolia government), and took out their own medals, saying they were awarded by the Outer Mongolian Prime Minister, Balanzhater. They were constantly called Outer Mongolian staff members along the way, and their travel permits were all written by themselves in pen or pencil. They easily passed through the Communist bandit checkpoints to Dolun, and then from Dolun to Zhangjiakou. They were recently escorted to Peiping by the Chahar Province Mongolian Banner Welfare Committee and relevant parties. It is said that yesterday (the 6th) they went to the western suburbs to meet Commander-in-Chief Chuan, but to journalists, they remain a mysterious enigma.

### Living Expense Index for Civil Servants and Teachers to Be Adjusted Starting Next Month

### Mobilize Manpower to Cooperate with the Nationalist Army; Protect the Locality and Rescue Refugees; The Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders County Magistrates of Dongtai, Xinghua, etc.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering the resurgence of remnant bandits in northern Jiangsu and the county magistrates' responsibility to defend their territories, has telegraphed the county magistrates of Dongtai, Xinghua, Taixian, and other counties, ordering them to mobilize a large amount of manpower to cooperate effectively with the Nationalist army to ensure local security. It must provide appropriate relief to the refugees. It is reported that recently, thousands of refugees from various parts of northern Jiangsu flee to Yang, Tai, and Zhenjiang every day, heading to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places along the rail line to make a living. When they arrive at the West Station to wait for the train, the Railway Bureau uses chalk to number the right arms of the refugees queuing for tickets in order to maintain order and prevent disputes from occurring out of order. This situation is a cause for concern.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The Northern Jiangsu Refugee Association, considering that the number of refugees fleeing from various places has been increasing in recent days and that most of them lack adequate clothing, has decided to distribute cotton clothing at the Provincial Party Headquarters. Poor refugees can go to the Association at the Provincial Party Headquarters to register. Registered refugees can receive one item of cotton clothing.

[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 7th] As a result of the failure of the bandits' military operations in central China, the northern Jiangsu battlefield has gradually increased in importance.

### Hankou Garrison Headquarters Orders the Dissolution of the Workers of the Clothing Factory and the Re-Registration in Preparation for Resumption of Work

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] The Wuhan Clothing Factory worker strike, which has been deadlocked for ten days, is finally coming to an end through dissolution. The Investigation Office of the Garrison Headquarters, believing that the workers have been delaying resuming work and are attempting to cross the line and riot, arrested 458 worker representatives who were inciting the strike at 2:00 AM last night. After interrogation, eight of them were released on bail. This morning at 8:00 AM, hundreds of family members and children of the arrested workers, carrying incense and clothing, went to the Pacification Headquarters to petition, demanding the release of the arrested workers and permission to send them clothing first. After officials from the Pacification Headquarters were sent to persuade and guide them, they still gathered at the gate for a long time. It was not until 3:00 PM that hundreds of armed police suppressed them, and they dispersed. Afterwards, according to Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, regarding the workers' strike at the factory, the workers' demands had been accepted, and they were allowed to increase their wages from 14,000 times to 20,000 times, in accordance with the standards of Nanjing and Shanghai. It was also recommended to the Joint Logistics Headquarters to readjust them separately according to the treatment of army technicians. However, after the workers expressed their acceptance, they still did not resume work, and this morning at 5:00 AM, they gathered 200 people to loot rice from the warehouse and attempt to continue the riot. In view of their actions, it was clear that they were being manipulated by treacherous bandits, so an order was issued to dissolve all the workers in accordance with the telegram from General Chen and the actual situation. Worker registration is currently being re-conducted, and active preparations are being made to resume work.

Mud and Wood Industry Workers Riot

Also, the mud and wood industry workers in Hankou, using the excuse of increasing wages, destroyed the Construction Industry Association on the 5th, and declared a general strike.

Many policemen were seriously injured, and 29 perpetrators were arrested. Currently, the daily wage for mud workers is 100,000 yuan, but now they are demanding one dou and two sheng of rice, and one catty each of oil and salt, which is excessive.

Shipyard Workers Strike

Also, the workers of various shipyards in Wuhan went on strike yesterday due to the issue of wages. The factory is mediating the problem.

### Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees Pass the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement

The proposal is to be submitted to the Yuan's plenary session to complete the legislative procedure

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The Foreign Affairs and Finance Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting on the morning of the 8th, chaired by Zhang Zhaoyuan, to discuss and approve the exchange of notes and attachments of the "Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement", and to submit them to the Yuan's plenary session for legislative procedure. Although this agreement was signed on January 21 of this year, and stipulated that it would take effect immediately, because our customs preparations were not yet complete, it has not yet been formally implemented, and the Hong Kong government has not yet submitted it to the Legislative Council for approval. It is therefore believed that the Executive Yuan should be advised to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Hong Kong side to handle it quickly, so that the agreement can be implemented as soon as possible to curb smuggling in South China.

### Martin Insists on Military Aid to China, Chennault Arrives in Washington and Testifies Immediately, American Newspapers Urge the Government to Quickly Clarify its Position on Policy Toward China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] House Speaker Martin stated that the House of Representatives will insist on providing weapons and financial aid to China. Martin said, "Financial aid to China is useless without the support of weapons." Martin had previously expressed support for military aid to China, but never with such strong wording as today. Several influential members of the House, led by Judd, believe that using weapons to combat the Communists should be the top priority of aid to China. Some members believe that China should receive at least one billion dollars, including both military and civilian aid.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] General Chennault arrived here today with his wife and will soon appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to state his views on the aid to China bill.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] The Washington Sunday Star, in its editorial on the 7th, strongly urged American civilian and military officials to issue a most authoritative statement clarifying their attitude, in order to clear up the confusion in the minds of the American public and Congress regarding military aid to China. The article pointed out that "Wedemeyer and MacArthur both strongly urge providing this kind of aid to China, while Marshall is clearly unwilling to do so," and then asked, "Which of these two factions is right?" The newspaper continued, "Before the American people can understand who is right and who is wrong, they must be informed of these opinions. It is time to issue a most authoritative statement clarifying our attitude, based on the consensus of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the State Department, and the White House." The newspaper emphasized that all considerations require prioritizing aid to Europe, but this does not mean that China can be ignored.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Well-informed sources predict that although the State Department opposes military aid to China, the United States will provide the Chinese government with substantial military assistance within a few months.

Although government officials strongly state that there are currently no plans for military aid to China, and that China has already received surplus American military supplies; however, as a result of the trend in Congress and general public opinion, military aid to China is still likely to be realized. The best-informed observers believe that, regardless of whether the State Department will automatically change its position, Congress will in fact include military aid in the aid to China plan, regardless of Marshall's hope that aid to China will be limited to goods and construction materials.

Well-informed observers point out that there are several factors that are increasing the possibility of the United States providing the Nanjing government with more military equipment every day. One factor is the rapid deterioration of the National Army's military position; another factor is General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer's indication to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that military aid is the only way to solve the China problem.

Editorial

### Prospects for Sino-Thai Relations

The new government of Siam has been officially recognized by our government since the 6th of this month, and countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have also restored diplomatic relations with Siam. This is a matter worth noting.

Since the coup in Siam on November 9th last year, the interim government organized by Khuang Aphaiwong has not been recognized by China, Britain, and the United States. Even the United Nations Far East Economic Conference has refused to allow Siamese representatives to attend. However, "non-recognition" is a political means, not a permanent state of diplomacy. As long as the "non-recognized" country improves its internal affairs, promotes good neighborliness, the environment can be improved. Therefore, in order to avoid isolation and strive for recognition by various countries, the Siamese government, in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution, held a general election on the 29th of this month and established a new parliament. Khuang Aphaiwong, the leader of the Democratic Party, won the popular election and was ordered to form a cabinet on February 20th, which was approved by the lower house on the 5th of this month. The first thing Khuang did after forming the cabinet was to notify various countries, declaring that the Siamese government would fully fulfill all its international obligations, especially hoping that Sino-Thai relations would be restored as soon as possible. The Chinese government, in view of the fact that the Siamese government after the popular election is a legitimate government unanimously supported by its people, decided to recognize the new Siamese government from March 6th and restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Our ambassador to Siam, Li Tieh-cheng, will soon return to his post, and the newly appointed Siamese ambassador to China will also come to China to take office. According to news from Bangkok, Siamese Prime Minister Khuang expressed great satisfaction with our country's rapid recognition of his leadership; Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and other countries also took action at the same time to restore diplomatic relations with Siam. From then on, the Siamese political situation and Sino-Thai relations have cleared away the clouds and gradually brightened.

Siam is a small country in Southeast Asia, but its geographical position is important and its agricultural products are abundant. Its relationship with China is interdependent. The total population of Siam is 15 million, and there are 3.5 million overseas Chinese, accounting for more than one-fifth. In Bangkok, the capital of Siam, Chinese people account for about 80%, which is enough to reflect the close relationship between China and Siam. The Chinese have made great contributions to the prosperity of Siam through immigration. Historical Siamese books record in detail that Siam was once a desolate place. Since Chinese scholars came by wind and waves, they have been diligent and hardworking, reclaimed land, built civil works, developed trade, and cooperated with the Siamese people to build today's paradise, which has improved the living standards of the Siamese people due to economic prosperity. Unfortunately, in the past half century, a few Siamese have forgotten history and opposed the overseas Chinese in every possible way, creating many unfortunate events. However, Siamese narrow-minded racialists, despite rejecting overseas Chinese with nationalism, have done everything possible to kill, exile, and confiscate property, but the victimized overseas Chinese have always been able to endure and forgive, adhering to the spirit of generosity, which has moved many enlightened and progressive Siamese people, who have been friendly and harmonious. Despite the rise of Siamese totalitarian politics several times, fascists such as Luang Phibunsongkhram's rule have recklessly advocated "Greater Thaiism," threatened overseas Chinese, enacted laws, and used violence to destroy overseas Chinese education and media, but the victimized overseas Chinese have been open-minded, selfless, and purely exchanged their labor for a living, without any political, economic, or territorial ambitions, and have ultimately been understood and recognized by enlightened and progressive Siamese people. The current Siamese Prime Minister, Khuang Aphaiwong, has a long-standing understanding of Sino-Thai relations and the position of overseas Chinese. His moderate attitude has won the trust of overseas Chinese. Khuang is an ideal bridge for this restoration of Sino-Thai relations and the future development of Sino-Thai relations.

Khuang Aphaiwong is a moderate advocate of cooperation and has formed a cabinet three times. The Democratic Party led by Khuang is centered on the middle class and was once an enemy of Phibunsongkhram, but later compromised with him. The coup in November last year was due to the dissatisfaction of the Siamese right-wing with the status quo and to curb the rise of communism, so they did not hesitate to use "coup d'état." In order to appease international public opinion and suppress the agitated public sentiment, Luang Phibunsongkhram supported Khuang Aphaiwong to form an interim government to mediate the opposing forces at home and abroad. In the past four months, Khuang has made contributions to internal suppression, but has gained nothing in easing relations with other countries, so he has requested to resign twice. On January 29th, the Democratic Party won the election, and Khuang formed a cabinet for the fourth time, advocating improving internal affairs, implementing democracy, and promoting good neighborly relations, which has won the understanding of various countries. Various countries have always held a loving attitude towards Siam. First, they hope that Siam's political progress will lead to external peace; second, they hope that enlightened democratic politicians in Siam will rise to abandon narrow-minded racialism with cosmopolitanism; third, they hope that Siam will contribute to the revival of the Far East economy. Now that Khuang has formed a cabinet, since he advocates internal democracy and external good neighborliness, various countries have recognized him, and we have unlimited hopes for the new Siamese government. For the sake of the future of peace in Southeast Asia, we are willing to see a new Siamese government that is democratic internally and open-minded externally, and we are willing to live in friendship with it and work for the peace of Southeast Asia and the economic revival of the Far East.

Sino-Thai relations are not only related to the future of Siam's economic development, but also to the survival and prosperity of 3.5 million overseas Chinese. Now that China and Siam have announced the restoration of diplomatic relations, we hope to resolve the issues of overseas Chinese migration to Siam, overseas Chinese operating rice industry, Siamese rice aiding China, and Sino-Thai trade through diplomatic channels in a peaceful and friendly manner, and we hope that the new Siamese government will change its course, with the maintenance of the rights and interests of overseas Chinese as its top priority, abolish the laws and regulations governing overseas Chinese, and grant overseas Chinese equal rights in law, politics, and economy. The "Bangkok Magazine" founded by Chinese people in Bangkok believes that Khuang's formation of a cabinet can open the key to Siam's diplomatic stalemate. The Chinese people, recalling the painful experiences of the past, have put forward the following demands, requiring the new Siamese government to express them in facts. (1) The "Private School Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2479," "The Second Amendment to the Private School Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2482," and "The Elementary Education Ordinance of Buddhist Era 2478" enacted by Phibunsongkhram in those years, which contain parts that violate the spirit of the Sino-Thai friendship treaty, should be explicitly abolished to remove the unfair situation of oppressed overseas Chinese education; (2) The emergency public security decree promulgated by Luang Phibunsongkhram in those years to expel overseas Chinese and the reserved occupation ordinance excluding overseas Chinese from employment should be explicitly abolished; (3) The "Immigration Restriction Ordinance" promulgated by the previous government is not in line with the spirit of friendship and should also be abolished; (4) Guarantee that there will be no resurrection of laws restricting overseas Chinese in the future. We sympathize with the demands of "Bangkok Magazine," value the voices of 3.5 million overseas Chinese, and hope that after the restoration of Sino-Thai relations, we will re-establish a good Sino-Thai relationship based on the spirit of the treaty and the opinions of overseas Chinese, and work together for the peace and prosperity of Southeast Asia. Khuang Aphaiwong's cabinet formation this time is a new page in modern Siam; Sino-Thai relations will also have a new beginning. This is our wish for the new Siam.

### Reforming the Northeast Monetary System, the Chairman Approved the Handling, and Agreed in Principle with the Opinions of the Northeast Petition Delegation

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Regarding the issue of reforming the Northeast circulating notes, Chairman Chiang has already agreed to handle it in person with the Northeast petition delegation on the 8th. The opinions put forward by the petition delegation are: (A) Circulation inside and outside the customs should be like the use of customs gold notes; (B) Opening up foreign exchange inside and outside the customs; (C) Determining a fixed ratio between circulating notes and legal tender, and at the same time hoping that the ratio is one to ten. The Chairman said that he agreed with all of them. The petition delegation believes that this agreement in principle is the biggest gain in the petition process. The delegation also inquired about the whereabouts of Chang Chia-ao, the president of the Central Bank, to Wang Yun-wu, the vice president of the Executive Yuan, who had just returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. According to Wang, Chang is currently in Shanghai discussing the issue of Northeast circulating notes with the Central Bank internally, and will decide to come to Nanjing within a few days to jointly discuss solutions.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 8th] Ning Jia-feng, the director of the Finance Department of the Xingyuan, went to Beijing on the 7th in response to a telegram from Chang Chia-ao, which may be related to the reform of the Northeast monetary system.

### Strengthening Relief, Strengthening Air Transport, Youth Education Qualifications Approved for Recognition, Three Matters in the Northeast Have Been Successfully Negotiated

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Wang Hua-yi, Zhang Bao, and other representatives of the Northeast petition delegation visited the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Education on the 8th to discuss issues such as relief, strengthening air transport in the Northeast, and youth education qualifications, all of which have achieved satisfactory results.

(A) Strengthening relief: Minister Gu has agreed in principle to accept it, and details will be discussed further with the petition delegation on the 11th. When the petition delegation held talks with Gu, it also involved the handling of the 570 million US dollar loan. (B) Strengthening air transport in the Northeast: After discussions with Vice Minister of Communications Ling Hong-xun, it has been decided in principle to shorten the flight distance, increase the number of flights, and use the planes of China National Aviation Corporation, Central Air Transport Corporation and Chennault's Air Transport Brigade to open up the Jin-Shen line and the Shen-Chang and Shen-Ji lines. It is estimated that if there are 36 planes per day, the task of air transport in the Northeast can be enhanced. As a result of the talks, it has been decided to open up the Jin-Shen line, and the Shen-Ji and Shen-Chang lines are scheduled to be discussed from the 9th.

(C) Northeast Youth Education Qualifications: It has been decided to approve recognition. This reply allows countless students in the Northeast to obtain legal status. The petition delegation was very pleased to hear this, but some technical issues still need to be discussed by another small group. The small group will be convened by Vice Minister of Education Hang Li-wu, inviting directors of relevant departments, as well as Ma Liang and Zhang Xuan-er, who are from the Northeast and are in Beijing. In addition, regarding the food issue, the military food part has already been reported in this newspaper's previous news, and it has been resolved. As for the civilian food part, the petition delegation has requested that the example of the allocation and sale system in the five major cities be followed, and requested the authorities to include Shenyang in the list of allocated and sold cities. Secondly, regarding the 1,000 tons of grain from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, it has arrived in Tianjin, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has sent Xie Zhi-gang and Gao Nian-zeng to handle the transfer procedures to Shenyang.

### Washington Observers Believe that the United States Will Eventually Provide Military Aid to China

(Continued from page 1) Another less recognized factor is the enormous commercial interests that the United States now or will have in China, which secretly prompts Congress to tend toward proposals for large-scale aid to China. Even State Department officials who severely criticize the Chinese government's "corruption and inefficiency" are becoming increasingly concerned about how to reverse the failures of the Nationalist army on the battlefield in recent months.

According to these officials, when Marshall returned to the United States after his mediation of the Chinese civil war failed, US policy was somewhat of a spectator policy, believing that if the Nationalists and Communists fought for another six months, they would be exhausted and gain nothing, at which time it would be easier for the Nationalists and Communists to negotiate a coalition government; however, the facts of the past six months have proved that it was not as expected. Today, even the officials who criticize the Nationalists most severely are beginning to admit that the United States cannot stand by and watch the collapse of the Chinese government. However, the best-informed observers believe that if this aid can be passed, it must be passed after the aid to Europe plan is safely passed, so as not to eliminate the Marshall Plan by increasing aid to China. After Marshall admitted that the Communists' control of China north of the Yangtze River would threaten the US position in Korea and cause a "very serious problem" for the US occupying forces in Japan, US newspaper editorials continued to ask: If so, why doesn't the government provide military aid to the Chinese government?

Marshall's explanation that economic aid can save China some foreign exchange to purchase a small amount of military equipment does not seem to comfort those who fear the failure of the Chinese government.

Representatives of companies with a direct stake in Far Eastern economic interests, such as representatives of Mobil Oil, have been very concerned about the various congressional discussions on aid to China. They do not hide their hope that the United States will increase its aid to Chairman Chiang, so that China will have the hope of achieving peace and stability, which is a prerequisite for them to fully restore or expand their long-suspended commercial activities in China.

The best-informed observers believe that if it were not for Marshall's high personal prestige, the government would not have been able to ignore the various demands for increased military aid to China for so long. Even so, when Bridges, Taft, and other members who support military aid to China unanimously demand it with all their strength, the government will not be able to prevent Congress from passing the military aid to China bill.

In the midst of heated discussions on military aid to China, less attention seems to be paid to the question of whether the United States will help stabilize China's monetary system. Judd and Washington Post reporter Hsu, among others, have suggested that restoring a hard currency silver dollar system in China may be effective, but this has not attracted special attention from Congress or public opinion.

US officials are also very indifferent to China's hope that the United States will provide a one-time loan to help the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Stabilization Bureau prevent excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate of legal tender. Most officials seem to believe that this is just another loan on credit to China, and it will not be of any benefit to the foreign exchange situation or the monetary system.

### Regulations for the Committee on the Return of Materials Have Been Formulated

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] In order to handle the return of materials looted from our country by Japan, the Compensation Committee has specially established the Committee on the Handling of Materials Returned by Japan, and its organizational regulations have been formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan.

### Regarding Japanese Ships Violating Our Fishing Rights, Japan Plans to Send Ships to Patrol, and We Have Resolutely Rejected It

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Regarding the Japanese government's proposal to designate the Japanese patrol ship Chihaya to be responsible for preventing Japanese fishing boats from violating Chinese fishing rights again, our government has resolutely rejected it. According to personnel from our delegation to Japan, the Chinese government's attitude has been notified to the Japanese government by the Allied Headquarters, but no reply has been received so far. It is said that incidents of Japanese ships violating our country's fishing rights are endless. Our government has protested to the Allied Headquarters government more than once. The Japanese government's proposal advocates that Japanese patrol ships patrol the Chinese sea area and the Japanese Hainan, so it has been rejected by our side.

### Our Commercial Commissioner to Japan, Tang Ju-sheng, Flew to Tokyo Yesterday

### Factories That Moved Inland During the War, the Petition Delegation Went to Beijing

Continuing to Call for Priority Compensation

[This city] Factories that moved inland during the war have repeatedly appealed to the government for priority in obtaining compensation machinery, but have not achieved results. Therefore, Xue Ming-jian, Chen Tian-he, and twelve others were specially selected to form a petition delegation, which went to Beijing last night, intending to continue to appeal to the relevant agencies. The delegation held a press conference at Guanshengyuan at 3:00 pm yesterday. Chen Tian-he reported on the purpose of the petition, saying that the purpose of going to Beijing to petition is to reiterate the position of the factories in the rear, and it is definitely not for personal interests, but purely for the future of the national industry. He hopes that the government will not forget the contributions of the factories that moved inland, which have long been following the government, to the country. In addition, he plans to report on their current situation and plans to contribute to the development of production by using compensated materials. The plan includes three major parts: (1) Manufacturing paper machines, (2) Manufacturing textile machines, (3) Manufacturing inland river ships. As long as the government provides the machines, we will raise funds ourselves, divide the work and cooperate, and the factories can be established. We hope that this trip will be successful, otherwise we can only resort to public opinion at home and abroad. Hu Yue-zhong said that the government should urgently support the outstanding members of the national industry. It is better to distribute the compensated machines early and promote production than to let them rust.

### Our Navy Xing'an Ship Sailed to Yokosuka Yesterday

### Grain Price in Wuxi Weakens

A request for approval has been submitted to the provincial government. Furthermore, the rise in rice prices in Suzhou is becoming increasingly frantic. Although the negotiated price in the market has only increased by 50,000, due to high expectations, those holding goods are reluctant to sell, leading to a concerted push that has created off-market transactions. The prices at the door have become chaotic, averaging around 3.7 to 3.8 million, approaching the 4 million mark.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] Plain cloth prices are soaring. Hong Wu Fu from the Second Factory has risen from 2.74 million to 3.01 million, and Chang Guang Shi cloth has risen from 2.76 million to 3.03 million.

### Yu Feipeng States in Changsha That Hunan Grain Purchases Will Not Be Increased

[Our Changsha Correspondent, 8th] Yu Feipeng stated in Changsha: The rise in grain prices is not entirely due to the procurement of military grain but is caused by the instability of domestic finance. The number of grain purchases in Hunan will not be increased. If rice merchants take advantage of speculation to raise grain prices, they will be severely punished. The Provincial Assembly submitted four points of opinion to Yu: (1) Reduce the military grain quota. (2) Increase the purchase price of tax grain.

### Hebei Cotton Industry Decides to Request Permission for Cotton Merchants to Jointly Purchase Cotton

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 8th] Before the war, Hebei's annual cotton production was over 2 million dan, which decreased from 1.6 million dan to over 600,000 dan during the enemy-puppet period. In the 36th year of the Republic, the Tianjin cotton industry's purchase was only over 200,000 dan. As the China Textile Corporation's unified purchase is about to begin, the cotton industry believes that the official price unified purchase will be disconnected from cotton farmers and cannot penetrate the rural areas. It has decided to request the authorities to allow cotton merchants to jointly operate.

### Interim Measures for Simplifying Pre-Audit Procedures Announced and Implemented

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] The pre-audit system has a feeling of difficulty in adapting to the current emergency affairs of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion. The National Government Committee previously resolved to temporarily authorize the Executive Yuan to handle matters expediently when difficulties arise. After the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan jointly invited the Audit Department, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance to discuss, it was deemed that fundamental adjustments required amending the Audit Law, the Public Treasury Law, and other related laws and regulations, which would take a long time. It seemed possible to simplify the pre-audit procedures first to adapt to the situation. Therefore, Interim Measures for Simplifying Pre-Audit Procedures were drafted and submitted to the National Government for approval, announced by decree, and implemented immediately. The full text of the measures is as follows:

Article 1: Resident auditors in the public treasury shall cease issuing public treasury checks.

Article 2: Military and political expenses of military and political organs in the pacification areas, handled in accordance with the provisions of Item 3 of Article 2 of the "Temporary Emergency Military and Political Measures for Pacification Areas and the Three Northeastern Provinces," shall be notified to the auditing organs for record after reporting to the Executive Yuan for record.

Article 3: The construction projects and procurement of goods by military organs may be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Interim Measures for Inspecting the Construction Projects and Procurement and Sale of Various Goods by Military Organs during the War of Resistance Against Japan," in accordance with the following measures. (1) Regarding military emergencies, bidding or mid-term increase or decrease in prices may be handled first with the approval of the competent authority, but the contract and related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification. When the project is completed, the auditing organ shall be notified to supervise the acceptance. When the purchased goods arrive, the organizing authority shall be responsible for the acceptance, and the results of the acceptance shall be notified to the auditing organ. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks. (2) Regarding military secrets, they may be handled with the approval of the competent authority, but the handling process and acceptance results must be notified to the auditing organ at any time. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks.

Article 4: The construction projects and procurement of goods by public business organs shall be handled in accordance with the following measures. (1) Bidding for construction projects or mid-term increase or decrease in prices may be handled first with the approval of the competent authority. The contract and related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification, and the auditing organ shall be notified to supervise the acceptance when the project is completed. (2) Bidding and acceptance for the procurement of goods may be handled with the approval of the competent authority, but the handling situation together with related documents shall be sent to the auditing organ for verification. The auditing organ may send personnel to investigate or conduct random checks.

Article 5: The inspection limits for central organs shall apply to the provisions of the "Measures for Inspecting the Construction Projects and Procurement and Sale of Goods by Gu Organs," and shall be increased or decreased at any time by the Audit Department according to the price index.

Article 6: The audit measures for military expenses shall be separately negotiated by the Audit Department and the military competent authority with reference to the "Implementation Plan of the New Budget and Financial System."

Article 7: These measures shall apply before the establishment of the political government and before the relevant audit laws are changed.

### Brussels Conference Progresses Rapidly, West European Alliance Treaty Being Drafted, Five Countries Close on Economic Issues

[Reuters, Brussels, 8th] A spokesman for the British and Belgian delegations participating in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Conference revealed that the five countries have reached an agreement on seven points in the draft of the West European Alliance Treaty and have handed it over to the drafting committee to draft the text based on the agreement. A Belgian spokesman said that this morning's meeting focused on economic issues, and the views of the countries are becoming closer. The aforementioned seven points do not all belong to economic issues, but include some statements of principle. The drafting committee includes British legal advisor Beckett, French representative Gross, Belgian representative Clasenbeer, Luxembourg representative Arm, and Dutch representative François. According to people close to the meeting, legal experts from various countries, based on Belgium's proposal, are studying how to request the International Court of Justice for arbitration when differences arise between the five countries. It is also known that opinions on overseas colonies have not yet been consistent. The UK and France advocate earnestly discussing the development of African and West Indian colonies at the meeting, while the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg advocate that the foreign ministers of the five countries discuss it after the West European Alliance is established.

[Reuters, Brussels, 8th] The Brussels Charter, namely the West European Alliance Convention, is expected to quickly determine the final form when the representatives of the five countries reconvene on the 8th. Representatives who stayed in Brussels over the weekend and did not go elsewhere held informal private talks. Representatives from the Netherlands and Luxembourg returned to their respective countries over the weekend to consult their governments, and French External Secretary-General Xu Faner also returned to Paris to report to the government. British Ambassador Rentel also submitted a report to his home government. According to well-informed sources, the new proposal recently put forward by the UK and France contains a wider range than the original proposal, such as including the overseas territories of member states in the Western Alliance. This new proposal, brought by Xu Faner and British External Assistant Webb from London on Friday, will be the basis for the five-nation convention along with the memorandum of understanding from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

[United Press, Brussels, 7th] British diplomatic circles report that the 50-year agreement between the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg will be signed on the evening of the 10th. The main future prospects of the recently drafted treaty will be economic. The treaty will eliminate all trade agreements between the five countries. Well-informed sources said that the political and military clauses in the treaty will be intentionally excluded, so that they can be concluded after detailed negotiations. The first negotiation will be the standardization of military equipment and training. This negotiation may begin when British Field Marshal Montgomery visits Belgium.

### Finnish President Paasikivi Announces Willingness to Negotiate a Treaty with the Soviet Union, Suggests Moscow as the Negotiation Venue

[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: Helsinki News, Finnish President Paasikivi announced that the Finnish government has agreed to negotiate the suggestion made by Stalin, that the Soviet Union and Finland conclude a friendship and military treaty. He said that he has suggested that negotiations be held in Moscow. It is reported that most of the political parties in Finland do not approve of negotiating a military alliance. The reason for suggesting Moscow as the negotiation venue is that the Finnish government deeply fears that the Finnish Communist Party may cause trouble during the meeting.

[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: Helsinki News, a Finnish government official said that the Finnish cabinet decided today to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union. The Finnish side has suggested that negotiations be held in Moscow, but the list of delegates has not been announced. As for the nature of the negotiations, whether a military alliance and a friendship agreement are both within the scope of the negotiations, nothing has been revealed. The reason why the Finnish cabinet made this decision is that most of the six party groups in the Finnish Parliament approve of exchanging views with the Soviet side, because the suggestion was made by Stalin, which is related to the dignity of the Soviet Union; secondly, Finland also wants to understand the content of the Soviet suggestion in more detail.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 8th] President Paasikivi visited Finnish Marshal Mannerheim, a veteran, on Saturday to discuss the situation.

Finnish Opposition Party Rally, Communist Party Disrupts

[United Press, Helsinki, 7th] The Finnish Communist Party, for the first time, violently dispersed a rally of the Radical Socialist Party, which has very few members, on the 7th. Professor Hanturen, the 60-year-old leader of the Radical Party, was delivering a speech to a crowd of 5,000 people in the train station square, protesting against the signing of a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Communist Party drove away the crowd and walked onto the platform, attempting to beat him. The police responded to the call for help and arrested six thugs.

### Slow Progress on the European Recovery Program, U.S. Government Quite Anxious

The European Situation is Becoming Increasingly Critical

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The slow progress of the Marshall European Recovery Program in Congress has made the government feel frustrated. This is especially true recently, with the Soviet Union intensifying its political and diplomatic offensive in Europe. Marshall made a moving appeal to several national leaders last week, requesting prompt action, and pointed out that the opportunity to aid Europe is rapidly being lost. The main factor that makes the U.S. government and congressional leaders feel the urgency of the situation is the Italian general election, which will be held on April 18. It is believed that if the Marshall Plan has not been approved and implemented by Congress by then, the Italian Communist Party will have more propaganda material in the election campaign, making it easier for them to overthrow the government and seize power. Another point that makes the U.S. government feel troubled is that even if Congress passes the Marshall Plan on April 1, the shipment of materials such as fuel and food to Europe will be no earlier than the summer. If Congress cannot pass the aid-Europe program on April 1, the situation in Europe will become more critical.

### Benes Receives Czech Premier at Villa

[Reuters, London, 7th] Prague Radio said: President Benes received Communist Premier Gottwald at the Usti villa today. This is the first meeting between the two since the reorganization of the Czech government.

[United Press, Tianjin, 7th] The Social Democratic Parties of Eastern European countries have been eliminated one after another. The Czech Communist Party also began to merge these Social Democratic Parties into a unified workers' party today.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Ankara Radio said that the Czech envoy to Turkey resigned today and left Istanbul for London, expressing regret over recent events in the Czech Republic before leaving.

### European Unity Committee Issues Declaration Yesterday, Supporting Western European Intelligence

[Reuters, London, 7th] The International Committee of the European Unity Movement issued a declaration, urging European democratic countries to draft a declaration of human rights and consider effective measures to protect human rights. The committee passed a resolution after a three-day meeting, welcoming the Western European Alliance Conference in Beijing and strongly advocating the organization of intergovernmental committees in Europe to take effective emergency measures required by the current political and economic situation. The units participating in the International Committee of the European Unity Movement include the United Europe Movement led by Churchill, the European Economic Cooperation Independent League led by former Belgian Prime Minister Van Zeeland, the French Committee for European Unity led by French National Assembly Speaker Herriot, and the European Federal Movement led by Burgman. The conference will hold a European Unity Congress in The Hague in May. The British Labour Party has refused to participate.

### Five Powers Confer on Holy Land Issue

[Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 8th] Representatives from the United States, China, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to meet on the 8th at the Park Avenue office of the Soviet Union's chief representative to the United Nations, Gromyko, to discuss the Palestinian issue. The United Kingdom does not intend to participate in the discussion but will send a representative for consultation. The major issues facing the four powers include: (1) Whether they should report to the Security Council that there have been acts of violence in Palestine that disrupt peace and require international armed action; (2) Whether the Palestinian Committee can begin to organize national militias and gather weapons for their use; (3) If the powers believe that an international force is needed to support the United Nations Committee, how should the international force be organized; (4) Whether the Security Council can agree to recognize the Palestinian Committee as the legitimate government of Palestine, pending the theoretical acquisition of full sovereignty by both Jewish and Arab states on October 1st.

[Central News Agency, Jerusalem, 8th, United Press] An unconfirmed report broadcast by a Jewish underground organization claims that the new partition plan proposed by the United Kingdom involves incorporating the Arab areas of Palestine into Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt, respectively. British officials have vehemently denied this plan.

### De Gaulle Appeals to the US for Military Aid to Western Europe; Delivers Speech Hoping to Regain Power

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] General de Gaulle delivered a speech today in Compiègne (fifty miles northeast of Paris), the site where the armistice agreements of the two World Wars were signed, announcing that he has completed all preparations to assume the responsibility of leading the country. De Gaulle has effectively changed the entire political situation in France, and political figures predict that de Gaulle is expected to regain power within the next six weeks. De Gaulle's direct request for the French government to be handed back to him and his followers is the first time since he resigned as Prime Minister in 1946.

De Gaulle's speech today stated that France is feeling threatened by a certain empire abroad that aims to dominate the world, and is also being disrupted domestically by those who are willing to serve these foreigners. If our country does not take decisive measures, it cannot put its affairs in order. The free countries of Europe must establish an economic, diplomatic, and military bloc, uniting their production, trade, diplomacy, and defense. Only a bloc with 250 million people can maintain its survival. France should be the center of this bloc, extending from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and east to the Rhine River. This bloc should include both Germany and Austria. We also believe that Europe and America must unite their forces to allow the entire world to be reborn. This means that the United States must provide substantial economic aid to Europe. The United States has already taken this initiative, which is both generous and far-sighted. In addition to economic aid, the United States must also accurately and clearly support Europe in terms of defense. The Soviet Union is trying to dominate the world. The Soviet Union has vast manpower and resources, and its people are obedient. Its 180 million people are under absolute dictatorial rule. The Soviet Union is using its trump card, and its neighboring countries, Finland, Austria, Greece, Turkey, and Iran, are feeling uneasy. Italy is in a state of fear, and the towns and cities of France are also feeling significant unease. In domestic affairs, De Gaulle believes that the parliamentary system has shown its fragility. He also said that, as far as he is concerned, he has completed all preparations so that when the environment allows him to assume the necessary responsibility, he will lead the country towards the path of self-salvation and greatness. His domestic policy advocates reducing government spending, striving to increase production, and advocating that trade unions should eliminate political colors. De Gaulle has begun to engage with leaders of all parties in the parliament except the Communist Party to prepare for the dissolution of the parliament and the holding of new elections.

### US State Department Plans Reorganization to Strengthen Work

[United Press, Washington, 8th] A plan to reorganize the US State Department is currently under study. According to those familiar with its content, the main purpose of the reorganization is to accelerate the work of various departments. However, whether it will be implemented will be decided by Secretary of State Marshall and President Truman. It is reported that routine diplomatic affairs will be presided over by the Under Secretary of State. US relations with Europe, Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East, and Africa will be his respective responsibilities. In addition, three or four Under Secretaries of State will be added to oversee domestic and foreign public relations, economic and United Nations affairs, and possibly the administration of occupied areas in Germany and Japan. This distribution of responsibilities will be fundamentally different from the current system. For example, political relations between the United States and other countries are currently presided over by Under Secretary of State Armour, economic relations by Thorp, and public relations by Allen. The vacancy for Under Secretary of Economic Affairs left by Marshall will no longer be filled in the future. Instead, a new position of Under Secretary of Administration will be established.

### Soviet Union Develops Arctic Route; Wilhelmshaven Port as Base

[United Press, Berlin, 7th] According to the most reliable sources here today, the Soviet Union is rebuilding the former German naval shipyard in Wilhelmshaven on the White Sea as an important base for developing the Arctic route. The chosen location is Molotovsk. The Wilhelmshaven shipyard was originally the main German base in the North Sea. In fact, the entire shipyard is being treated as reparations to the Soviet Union. Its machinery, electrical equipment, torpedoes, metal plates, smelting furnaces, and other factory equipment are being dismantled. Observers here are very interested in the Soviet Union's development of its Arctic route and its efforts to open a waterway between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, while establishing its naval position in the Baltic Sea. Pillau in the Gulf of Danzig has become the main base for the Soviet Baltic Southern Fleet. Soviet warships can load fuel and food here, and have the repair and construction facilities of the port of Königsberg as their support.

### British Government Announces New Economic Plan; Emphasizes US Aid Program

[Reuters, London, 9th] The British government today released a report reviewing the current state of the national economy, and also released the economic plan for 1948. It attaches great importance to aid under the Marshall Plan, believing that Britain must use this aid to strengthen Britain's working capacity and effectiveness, and develop the supply resources of the country and the sterling area. The report states that Britain has a dual plan for foreign recovery: one is to achieve a balance of international payments, and the other is to find a satisfactory way to pay for the prices of goods from the Western Hemisphere as soon as possible. Measures to implement this plan include (1) increasing the export rate, especially the export rate to the Western Hemisphere; (2) developing the supply resources of the British Commonwealth, especially the British colonies; (3) requesting countries in the sterling area to economize on the use of US dollars; (4) finally restoring multilateral trade and currency acceptance.

### de Valera Arrives in New York

[United Press, New York, 8th] The Prime Minister of Ireland, de Valera, arrived here today from Shannon and plans to travel throughout the United States.

### Soviet Union Attempts to Control All of Europe; Next Target Will Be Italy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th, United Press] The former leader of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party, Dimitrov, said that the Soviet Union is now attempting to control all of Europe in preparation for a final war with the United States. He said that part of this prediction is based on reports secretly transmitted from Soviet satellite countries in Eastern Europe. These reports indicate that the Soviet Union's next target is Italy, not Finland. The Communist Party will not rush to do anything in Finland because they are preparing to target Italy and make divisive efforts. What is even more dangerous is that the events taking place in Italy will be related to similar actions in France, Germany, and Austria, which means all of Europe.

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] The recent political developments in Czechoslovakia have aroused considerable sensitivity among Italians, but political observers cannot give a definite answer to the question of whether Italy will closely follow in Czechoslovakia's footsteps. The Italian general election is scheduled for April 18th, and the Communist Party's propaganda is quite effective in hitting the people's psychology. The issue that Italians are most concerned about at present is the colonial issue. The Communist Party is using the Soviet Union's reiteration that Italy should be placed in trusteeship over its former territories as a source of information to win the sympathy of the public. At the same time, the Italian Communist Party is also fiercely attacking the United States. The recent reduction in the number of strike movements in Italy may also be a means for the Italian Communist Party to win the favor of the public.

### Communist Party Plans World Revolution; Report Released by British House of Commons Subcommittee

[United Press, Washington, 7th] A subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Republican Representative Mrs. Bolton, studied the communist problem for a year and submitted a report yesterday, believing that the Communist Party believes that world revolution is imminent. It is said that the Communist Party's only goal is world revolution. Those people speculate that this revolution will come fiercely. Communist and non-communist politicians currently expect major changes to occur in Europe in the shortest possible time. In addition to the advent of any economic crisis, the Communist Party believes that the whole world is even in a political crisis. Those people believe that major regions of the world are now approaching revolution. The Communist Party hopes for the following changes: (1) the collapse of capitalism, which will come with the US recession; (2) this situation will spread rapidly to the whole world; (3) revolutions will break out; (4) the Soviet Union and the Communist Party want to encourage struggle, but try their best to stay out of it; (5) if they hope to wait and see, they will take advantage of the situation when the time is right and accept the broken world. The report is divided into three volumes. The upper volume is a general discussion, the middle volume is the statements of Soviet and Communist figures over the past century, and the lower volume is a variety of protests recently made by the United States against the words and deeds of the Soviet Union.

### Bulgarian Ambassador to the UK Resigns

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] The Bulgarian Ambassador to the UK, Professor Todorov, told reporters today that the recent incidents in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Czechoslovakia made it impossible for him to work in London again, so he had no choice but to resign. However, his resignation was purely voluntary. Todorov once served as the vice-chancellor of the University of Sofia and defended the leader of the Bulgarian opposition party, Petkov, during his trial in September last year.

### Schuman's Position is Stable

French Parliament Debate Government Has Won

[United Press, Paris, 8th] When the French National Assembly met at 10:00 am on the 8th to discuss the last and most controversial clause of the Schuman forced loan bill, Schuman's position seemed extremely firm. According to reliable sources, the French Communist Party plans to hold a demonstration in the Tuileries Garden this afternoon to protest against the forced loan bill. In the parliament's two-day debate on financial measures, the government repeatedly won, which can prevent Schuman from resigning. Many observers said that De Gaulle's relatively mild speech a few days ago actually strengthened Schuman's position.

### US Republican Party Convenes Presidential Primary

Wallace's Third Party Named Progressive Party

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The US Republican presidential campaign will have a major development at this week's primary in New Hampshire. Following this, there will be two more heated events: one is the Wisconsin primary on April 6th, and the other is the Nebraska primary on April 13th. The combined results of these primary meetings will, to some extent, obtain a trial decision on whether the Republican nominee for president this year is popular. The primary in New Hampshire is mainly a competition between New York Governor Dewey and Minnesota Governor Stassen. Political observers predict that Dewey will have a slight advantage. Dewey and Stassen will also face MacArthur in the Wisconsin primary for 27 national convention delegates.

[United Press, York, Pennsylvania, 7th] Wallace told a conference of 2,000 people at the first campaign convention of the Pennsylvania Progressive Party today: "The Truman Doctrine wants to provide military and economic assistance to various countries to resist communism. These people and their plans will never change because of the change of executors." The conference passed a resolution formally naming the third party led by Wallace the "Progressive Party."

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] Wallace gave a speech at an electoral assembly here on the 8th, saying that those who accuse us of being red communists and Soviet agents do not really fear communism, but they actually fear democracy. They are afraid of the anger of the people when wages are reduced, when savings are lost, and when anxiety increases. This is the result of their public discussion of the evil policy of war and is enough to waste our country's property.

### Japan and the Soviet Union Commemorate Women's Day

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Five thousand women marched and sang in the streets of Tokyo today, holding red flags and slogans: "International Women's Day - Demand Permanent Peace!" A group of Korean women also participated in the march. Military police monitored the route.

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] The Soviet Union held Women's Day today, and men must wear flowers to commemorate it.

### Japan's New Cabinet to be Established Soon; Socialist Party to Occupy the Largest Number of Cabinet Seats; All Parties Predict the New Cabinet Will Probably Die Young

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese observers said: Ashida may complete the cabinet formation work late on the 8th. It has been seventeen days since Ashida was elected as the new Prime Minister of Japan. At 5 pm on the 8th, Ashida decided to concurrently serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The distribution of cabinet members in the new cabinet will generally be: members of the Socialist Party, 7 from the Democratic Party, and 2 from the Cooperative Party.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The major problems of the formation of the Ashida cabinet have been resolved as of this afternoon, but the list of cabinet members has not yet been announced. The general public believes that this news may be short-lived. Political observers believe that the policies of the future cabinet will not be different from those of the Katayama cabinet. There will be more members of the Social Democratic Party than members of the Democratic Party in Ashida's cabinet. Ashida allowed the Social Democratic Party to choose first from among the 19 cabinet positions, and the Democratic Party only disputed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Shidehara Kijuro made a speech in Kiryu City on the 7th on the current political situation, saying: "Regardless of whether Katayama joins the cabinet or not, the Ashida cabinet is a short-lived cabinet because the left wing of the Socialist Party will adopt the same attitude as it did in the Katayama cabinet. In the case of non-cooperation from the left wing, Ashida's cabinet will not be able to occupy a majority of the seats in the parliament, so the life of the new cabinet may not exceed three months."

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese observers said on the 8th: Prime Minister Ashida is still facing difficulties in forming a cabinet, because the three parties that support Ashida have already begun to manipulate the "selection" of cabinet members' seats. It seems that the current Japanese cabinet cannot be completed before the 10th. At the same time, former Prime Minister Katayama said in his speech that even if Ashida can form a cabinet, its life will not exceed three months. His predecessor, Prime Minister Yoshida, is now leading a new party movement organized by conservatives.

### Dodecanese Islands Re-enter Greek Territory

[Reuters, Athens, 7th] Fifty islands in the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea were officially returned to Greece today. These islands were seized by Turkey in 1522, and then occupied by Italy in 1912. The Treaty of Paris in 1946 stipulated that they should be returned to Greece. King Paul of Greece and his wife arrived this morning on a destroyer at Rhodes, the capital of the main island of the archipelago.

[Agence France-Presse, Rhodes, 7th] A meeting was held here today to celebrate the return of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece. Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris gave a speech saying, "The Dodecanese is a link connecting Africa, Asia, and Europe." Then he mentioned the island of Cyprus, saying that this is one of the lost sections of the Greek island chain.

### Korean Committee Holds Regular Meeting

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The United Nations Korean Commission held its 16th meeting at 3:00 pm today, chaired by Chairman Menon. First, Menon reported on the content of the letter from the President of the United Nations Small General Assembly to Menon, which roughly stated: (1) Freedom of speech, assembly, and publication; (2) The establishment of the Korean National Government should be jointly assisted by the Korean people, but to achieve this goal, peaceful means should be adopted; (3) The places where universal suffrage can be implemented should be promoted as much as possible. A secret meeting will be held at 10:30 am on the 9th.

### Honduras-Guatemala Interrupted; UK Protests to Argentina Again

[Reuters, British Honduras, Belize, 7th] The Guatemalan authorities have banned a TACA Airlines plane registered in El Salvador from flying from Belize to Guatemala City from landing. Land, sea, and air traffic between British Honduras and Guatemala has now been completely cut off. At present, telegrams and telephones between the two countries are also unavailable, and the Guatemalan consul in Belize has refused to issue entry permits to Guatemala to the British.

[Reuters, British Cruiser Nigeria, Antarctica, 6th] (Delayed) The British warship carrying the Governor of the British Falkland Islands, Clifford, protested twice to Argentine ships on Deception Island while inspecting the Falkland Islands Antarctic Dependencies.

### Military Meeting Resolves Preventive Measures; Restricts the Migration of Eligible Young Men; Those with Legitimate Reasons Should Seek Guarantors to Apply; New Recruit Settlement Fees Should Be Allocated by the City Government

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's first conscription of 6,000 people this year is about to begin. The Military Service Association held its fourth meeting at the association at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than 20 people including Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xingbai attended. Chen Tianqiao, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Yao Wenying, section chief, were also present. Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported on the decisions made at the military service meeting on the 29th of last month, and the city council passed the conscription method in the city this year, which combines lottery and voluntary service. Later, Commander Chen, Director Zhang, Tan Yimin, and others made reports on their respective areas of responsibility. Director Zhang particularly pointed out that in Huangpu District, more than 200 eligible young men applied to move out in one day the day before yesterday. Other districts also report daily requests to move out in order to evade military service, urging to find ways to stop it. Subsequently, proposals were discussed and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the control of young men in the city, please order each district to temporarily suspend the application for moving out for eligible young men aged 21 to 25 during the conscription processing period. If there is a legitimate reason to apply for moving out, in order to prevent evasion of military service, a solid guarantor must be found in the city. If selected in the future, they must still serve. (2) Regarding the planning and development of the settlement fee for new recruits, please allocate 5% of the revenue from public utilities and banquet donations and entertainment donations in the city for this purpose. (3) The conscription fee for new recruits is 10,000 yuan per soldier allocated by the central government this year, which is not enough. It was decided to subsidize 100,000 yuan per soldier in the suburbs (Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Dachang, Xinjing, Longhua, Sisheng, and Yangjing) and 60,000 yuan per soldier in the urban area. This subsidy expense will be paid from the preferential treatment fund. (4) Those who applied for exemption from conscription in the 36th year and have been approved but have not paid the preferential treatment fee should continue to be urged to pay it. (5) Preferential treatment fees for conscripted young men in the 36th year will be collected continuously by formulating other measures. Last year, the preferential treatment fee for households without conscripted young men only received 1,645,980,000 yuan, and there are still many outstanding payments, which should be cleared within a limited time. Whether this preferential treatment fee will be collected this year will be reserved for later decision. (6) The advance payment of 12 billion yuan for the settlement subsidy for new recruits in the 36th year has no funds to return. It was decided to collect 90,000 yuan per exemption certificate to offset part of it and to recognize it retroactively. (7) The budget for the Propaganda Committee is 380 million yuan. (8) New recruits' consolation gifts will be handled by the Military Service Association at its discretion depending on the financial situation. (9) Other new recruits' consolation matters will be handled by the Military Service Association in a unified manner. (10) Revised draft of the organizational rules and procedures of various standing committees of the Military Service Association. At the end, two temporary proposals were also passed: (1) The lottery committee of the Military Service Association will be established on the 15th of this month. The date of the lottery will be decided after the committee is established. (2) The physical examination for new recruits will be held regularly according to the examination methods in the 36th year.

[Also reported] The Civil Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a symposium this afternoon to convene conference district security team leaders to formulate implementation measures for military service conscription and solicit their opinions on the actual situation of each district security team.

### Water, Electricity, Telephone, and Gas to be Adjusted Before the 15th; Telephone to Increase by One Time, Gas by 45%

The city's public utilities, including tap water, electricity, telephone, and gas, will implement new prices adjusted in March before the 15th. At 10:00 am yesterday, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau specially convened responsible persons from the American Telephone Company and the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to discuss the new prices for telephone charges.

It is reported that Wu opened Bingdong Grain Store at No. 305, Tianlun Building, Nanjing East Road, without obtaining a business registration certificate, nor was he a member of the Oil Business Association.

### Urban Planning Committee Explains Four Points Regarding the Issue of Factories Moving Out of Non-Factory Areas

[Our Report] The Urban Planning Committee recently delineated the built-up area of the city and stipulated that all factories in non-factory areas should be moved out. The plan has been approved in principle by the Senate and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. In order to clarify the situation to the outside world, the committee explained the following four points: (1) Most of the very dangerous factories that should be moved are due to simple equipment, and the loss of moving is not large. (2) There are many well-equipped factories in the designated factory areas, and the government does not force them to move to remote designated factory areas. (3) Factories that should be banned in the future should be determined based on their degree of danger. (4) Small factories mixed with residential households in the same neighborhood often cause disputes. If there are intentional accusations, good factories will be protected after the detailed rules for factory management and ban are passed.

### Mayor Convenes Relevant Agencies to Review Rice Distribution Work, Welcomes Criticism and Reporting of Corruption, Extends the Deadline for Purchasing Rice with Certificates, 500,000 Dan of Rice Distributed This Month, Divided into Three Categories

[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu convened Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Liu Xingji, director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, Ye Shifu, counselor, and representatives from the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Relief Materials and the China Relief Corps to jointly review the progress of rice distribution. Afterwards, a press conference was held in the city government auditorium. Mayor Wu first reported that after the full implementation of rice distribution, the price of rice in the city still increased. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Food to suppress prices in producing areas, efforts were also made to promote the efficiency of the rice distribution system. All sectors are welcome to criticize the rice distribution work and report corruption. Since the start of rice distribution, 100,000 dan of rice have been distributed as of yesterday, enough for one million people to purchase. There are still 400,000 dan of rice left, which can be delivered in succession before the 20th of this month. In addition, the deadline for purchasing rice with the rice distribution certificates for the first half of this month, originally scheduled to end on the 12th, is now extended to the 27th.

Rice Distribution Certificates for Foreigners Handled by the Police Bureau

Ren, the chairman, then reported: (1) Starting from April, the rice distribution certificates will be changed to one issue per month, regardless of the first or second half of the month. According to current estimates, the purchase of rice will not be crowded. As of the 5th of this month, 2,475,000 rice distribution certificates have been issued for the first half of this month, and the rice distribution certificates for the second half of this month will be issued before the 10th. (2) Because the household registration of foreigners is handled by the police bureau, the rice distribution certificates will also be issued by the police bureau and can be completed between the 11th and 15th. (3) All citizens who reported their household registration before the 10th of this month can receive a rice distribution certificate; otherwise, they can file a complaint. (4) The city has 5 million residents who need 500,000 dan of rice per month based on one dou per person. There are 1,950 rice shops in the city, and 892 of them are implementing rice distribution. In order to speed up the rice distribution work, the CITIC Bureau warehouses have been asked to continue working as usual on weekend evenings, opening eight warehouses every day and releasing 32,000 dan of rice. (5) Since the distribution of rice six days ago, 60% of the rice payments have been received. This is because there are not enough staff in the Bank of China and the Postal Remittance Bureau, which collect the payments. After the two places strengthened their work, 80% has been received yesterday, and it is expected to be fully collected today. (6) In terms of rice quality, the rice distributed this month is self-raised by the government. Among them, 250,000 dan is Siam rice No. 1, 150,000 dan is Burmese rice, and 100,000 dan is purchased by the Ministry of Food in the Yangtze River basin. The color of the rice may be worse, but they are all similar to medium-cooked rice. The public should not misunderstand. Starting in April, all of them will be US rice. The Civil Food Allocation Committee will also establish a unified news agency to announce the quality of rice distribution in each district every month.

Chairman Ren is Optimistic about the Future of Rice Prices

Chairman Ren is quite optimistic about the future of rice prices in the city. He said that rice distribution accounts for two-thirds of the total demand in the city's rice market and has the power to control rice prices. Although the free market rice price has recently risen, it is accidental and he believes that it will definitely fall back in the future.

They held a press conference before departure. Chen Tianhe of Huaimin Experimental Factory reported at the press conference that the purpose of the petition is to reiterate to the government the position of inland factories to fight for Japanese compensation materials, and not for personal interests. The inland factories made great contributions during the war, and now the final victory has finally been achieved, but the factories are still willing to continue to serve the country and intend to contribute to the government's plan to increase production by using compensation materials. Because the compensation machines are the mother machines for manufacturing machines, the plan is to form three groups of factories: (1) manufacturing papermaking machines, (2) manufacturing textile machines, and (3) manufacturing inland river ships. Finally, he said that this petition must get a concrete answer. If the authorities cannot answer immediately, they are willing to wait in Nanjing for a long time.

At about 6 pm, the employees of the banks and bureaus accepted the persuasion and left voluntarily. This unprecedented "extension of work" was not realized.

The Ministry of Finance Sends a Telegram Urging Earnest Persuasion

After learning of this dispute, the Ministry of Finance sent a special telegram to the national banks and bureaus yesterday, urging them to earnestly enlighten them. The telegram stated: "The treatment of employees of national banks and bureaus has always been better than that of general public and education personnel. Recently, the government adjusted treatment and resolved that the salaries of personnel in state-owned enterprises should be strictly handled in accordance with the regulations on the calculation of salaries for personnel in state-owned enterprises. This resolution has not yet been reported to the banks and bureaus. Some employees, in addition to the current various extra preferential treatments, have asked for increased treatment, which is not appropriate. I hereby telegraph to instruct the heads of the relevant banks and bureaus to earnestly enlighten and be responsible for guiding them. If there is any transgression, they should be severely punished immediately in order to correct discipline."

Jointly Publish a Letter to Colleagues

The four banks and the CITIC Bureau also jointly issued a "Letter to Colleagues," stating: "This time, the government originally stipulated that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should not exceed 30% of the treatment of public and education personnel. In order to take care of the lives of colleagues, the banks and bureaus have repeatedly negotiated with the authorities. In addition to maintaining the original treatment, the living allowance will also be calculated according to the index of public and education personnel. The original meal expenses in the public kitchen have also been repeatedly requested and only reluctantly retained, but the differential must be cancelled. This is a government regulation, and the banks and bureaus cannot change it." It also said that recently some people have been distributing leaflets and posting slogans in the name of colleagues in the banks and bureaus, agitating the situation. The Municipal Security Bureau is paying close attention to this action because finance is the lifeblood of the social economy. It also stated that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, disturbing finance and hindering security are clearly stated in the law. All acts that are close to coercion or interfere with the freedom of others not only violate the discipline of the banks and bureaus, but also will not be allowed by the security authorities. I hope colleagues will not test the law.

### Serious Famine in Chaoshan, Appealing for Support from All Walks of Life, Zhang Shengtong and Others Report on the Process

[Our Report] Zhang Shengtong, a senator from Shantou City, and Ding Guoqiu, a major general counselor from the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, have recently been dealing with the extremely serious famine in Chaoshan. They went to Nanjing to meet Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food and agreed to purchase food in Taiwan, Hankou, Wuhu, southern Fujian and other places to supplement it. Yesterday, they specially hosted leaders of Chaoshan descent in Shanghai and the press at the Dadong Restaurant. Zhang and others immediately reported on the Chaoshan famine and the efforts made to appeal in various places, hoping that people from all walks of life would sympathize and support them.

Frequent Disasters, Widespread Suffering

According to reports: The eleven counties and cities in the fifth district of Guangdong, Chaoshan, are all located with mountains on their backs and facing the sea, with very little grain production. Before the Anti-Japanese War, they relied on the import of about 4 million dan of foreign rice every year. However, the local population (excluding those going to the South Seas Islands) is about 4,420,000, and the annual grain requirement is about 20 million dan, which is less than half of the annual grain production of only about 10 million dan. Now, foreign rice from Siam and Vietnam is prohibited from opening, and various domestic rice-producing areas have successively restricted the export of grain, and the supply of foreign rice has been interrupted invisibly. In addition, there was a drought in 1946, a flood at the beginning of 1947, and then a typhoon in the late harvest, resulting in a serious disaster and widespread suffering. Now, even more so at a time when the old grain has been exhausted and the new grain has not yet ripened, the shortage of grain is becoming increasingly serious. Fortunately, the Chaoshan Grain Adjustment Committee was established on January 13th of this year. As a result of running around and appealing, President Song of Guangdong Province first allocated 20 billion yuan as the committee's fund. On the one hand, Zhang Shengtong and others were sent to Taiwan, Fujian, and other places to purchase rice to alleviate the emergency, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will show sympathy and support.

### Commemorating Women's Day, Celebration at the Majestic Theatre, Awarding Certificates for Essays and Speeches

[Our Report] Yesterday was "March 8" International Women's Day. Women from all walks of life in the city held a celebration at the Majestic Theatre yesterday morning at 9 am. More than 1,000 people from various women's organizations and female students attended. The presidium was composed of Tang Guanyu, Jin Zhenyu, Huang Zhuoqun, Ling Weicheng, Mrs. Yu Shuping, Mrs. Zhao, Mrs. Zhang Xiangwen, Ling Qishen, Zhang Hongwei, Lu Huimin, Lu Lihua, Ling Yingzhen, Chen Hailun, Chen Shaoqing, Xie Yonghua, Fang Yingda, Zhou Jinping, and others. After the ceremony, the whole assembly sang the national anthem and the March 8 Women's Day song. Jin Zhen, the chairman, gave a speech stating that International Women's Day not only has a glorious value in human history, but also fully demonstrates the significance of the national father realizing world harmony. The reason why the permanent peace of mankind has not yet had a solid foundation is that political power is in the hands of men. I hope that female compatriots will reflect on themselves while commemorating International Women's Day, and hope to unite the power of the female world to seek happiness for mankind!

Then Huang Zhuoqun gave a speech stating that "March 8" has profound meaning for our country. The word "three" can represent Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People: Nationalism represents freedom, Livelihoodism represents mutual assistance, and Democracy represents equality. The word "eight" can represent the eight virtues of China, namely loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, and harmony. Next year will be the 38th year of the Republic of China, and next year's Women's Day will be a "double March 8" commemoration. I hope that everyone will work hard to make the emancipation of women a success.

Then Ms. Tang Guanyu said in her speech that this year's "March 8" Women's Day is more glorious than last year because the constitution has confirmed that women have the right to participate in politics. In order to progress and emancipate, women hope to participate in social activities and production undertakings as much as possible while taking care of family life.

The congress then passed a resolution to pay tribute to President Chiang and his wife, and to pay tribute to the soldiers at the front. It also put forward a temporary motion to send a telegram to Zhang Dulun, the mayor of Chongqing, asking him to respect women's rights and protect women's occupations.

List of Winners of Competitions

Finally, Ms. Huang Zhuoqun presented awards to the winners of the essay contest, speech contest, and basketball game.

Over 130 shanties were burned down, leaving over a thousand male and female residents displaced, supporting the elderly and leading the young, crying bitterly by the roadside, a truly tragic scene. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. Chu Guitong, the cause of the fire, was arrested by the police of the Hongzhen Police Station of the Tilanqiao Precinct and taken to the precinct for investigation.

### Robbery on Jiulong Road

[Report from this Newspaper] The Tilanqiao Police Station received a tip-off the day before yesterday that Zhou Shihong, a fugitive robber from the Liling Road Yuanchang Lane 34 robbery last year, had recently returned to Shanghai from Changzhou and was hiding in the Hailong Inn in Zhabei.

### Shanxi Travelogue (4) - The Pillar of Suppression

[Report from this newspaper, Taiyuan, 2nd by Airmail] The Northwest Industrial Construction Company has been the largest material pillar of Shanxi's political, economic, and defense construction for the past fourteen years. In the past, it laid the foundation for Shanxi's light and heavy industries with its abundant underground resources. Today, it has transformed into a supply department for the suppression of bandits. Cement and steel for building bunkers, rails and trains for transportation, fabrics, fuel, and electricity for people's livelihood - if one or two of these supplies were in short supply, the 17 counties and one city in central Shanxi would definitely not be able to maintain the rock-solid stability they have today.

Thirty-Six Factories

Organizationally, the Northwest Company is one of the largest private enterprises in Shanxi Province. However, due to the obstruction of Shanxi's external transportation, the government now centrally controls the purchase of raw materials and the sale of finished products from the factories. The accounting between the government and private sectors cannot be sorted out for the time being.

Including 52 heavy industrial units such as wool weaving, leather, cement, electrochemistry, locomotives, steel smelting, papermaking, and power generation, only 36 units were left after the eight-year War of Resistance. No one expected that while recovering from the damage and striving for revival, they would have to resist the rampant bandits. Under the slogan "Factories are Fortresses," entering each factory, one would see chimneys spewing black smoke behind the telegraph poles and bunkers. The loss of many mines over the past three years has also been marked by tragic and painful battles.

Mobile Fortress

The press corps visited the locomotive factory, steel mill, paper mill, and textile mill here. In addition to the normal repair of locomotives, passenger and freight trains, the locomotive factory spent six months building a "Revival" locomotive and a "Awakening Lion" mobile fortress. The walls of this fortress are made of 150 cm thick cement, with rifle ports, machine gun ports, and artillery ports. It can accommodate 20 soldiers. Even if the tracks are destroyed, it contains enough food for 15 days, allowing them to fight in isolation without fear. Other military weapons include improved rockets, which were the weapons that ultimately defeated the bandits in the Datong Defense Battle last year, and the Type 36 7.5 cm mountain gun, which has a range of 8,000 meters. In order to ensure the smooth progress of these tasks, a "struggle" wave was launched in the factory to purge the disguised enemy.

After Anshan fell into the hands of the bandits, the Northwest Steel Mill, built in imitation of the Krupp steel factory, became the only place in the country that could completely produce coke, iron, and steel. When coal and iron mines in Datong, Dingxiang, and other places could not be reached, these underground resources were found in the mountains east and west of Taiyuan after more than two years of exploration. Currently, 50 tons of pig iron and 60 tons of steel are produced daily, and the production is planned to increase to 200 tons this year. The main equipment of the factory includes two 5,000 kW turbine generators, one 240-ton regenerative coke oven with by-product recovery, one 120-ton and one 40-ton blast furnace each, and two 30-ton steel-making open hearth furnaces, and two sets of medium and small-sized steel rolling equipment.

Appealing for Support

The production increase plans of other factories have also been formulated. From these figures, it is not difficult to see the true face of the current central Shanxi industry: The machine factory has produced more than 700 various machines in the past two years, and plans to increase to 1,000 this year. The textile factory produces 20,000 bolts of 14-pound white cloth per month, and plans to increase to 40,000 bolts. The power plant currently has a maximum load of 10,000 kW and plans to increase to 30,000 kW. The No. 1 coal mine plans to increase from 30,000 tons per month to 60,000 tons. Currently, more than 20,000 employees work almost 10 hours or more every day. Wages are completely uniform, and an average of four sheng of wheat per person per day is calculated in kind, with half paid in kind and half converted into legal tender.

The biggest difficulty facing the Northwest Company is the severance of transportation. Last year, the company only managed to import 1,500 tons of raw materials and export 1,800 tons of products by air. They appeal: Politics, military affairs, and economy are mutually causal. Today, increasing military aid to Liaoyang and providing economic support to Taiyuan means stabilizing the Northeast and North China. And the stability of the Northeast and North China is also consolidating the cornerstone of the government. (Report from this newspaper, Yang Wenyu)

### Anniversary of the Birth of the Great Loyal Official Hai Rui of the Ming Dynasty; Hainan Island to Hold Expanded Public Memorial Service on April 1st

[Report from this Newspaper, Hainan Island, 5th by Airmail] The 22nd day of the second lunar month, i.e., April 1st of the new calendar, is the anniversary of the birth of the great loyal official Hai Rui of the Ming Dynasty. The Ninth Administrative District Office believes that Hai Rui was originally from this island, and his scholarship, writing, integrity, and morality are all admired by later generations.

### Jiaxing Kaleidoscope

[Report from this Newspaper, Jiaxing, 7th] After several rounds of spring breezes and spring rains, green buds have sprouted on the mulberry branches, and peach blossoms are also budding, filling the air with the atmosphere of spring, adding a smile to every silent face.

The cries of "Going to South Lake!" have already been heard from the mouths of the boat women. Yes, South Lake is what Jiaxing can offer people for spring outings. However, it is too aristocratic. Hiring a maiden's boat costs more than a million yuan. Just to take the ferry to Yanyu Tower costs at least 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The number of tourists this spring is not as many as in previous years, but the railway nursery seems to be attracting more attention from tourists.

Conscription and Grain Collection

After the beginning of spring, conscription and grain collection in Jiaxing are at a tense juncture. Senior officials from the province have come to Jiaxing almost ten times during this period. At the same time, county-level personnel are also mostly touring the townships to supervise and assist in the collection. As for the township and pao-jia organizations, it goes without saying.

One thing worth praising in this year's conscription work in Jiaxing is that, so far, there have been no cases of fraud, which is a significant improvement compared to previous years. It is hoped that this integrity can be maintained until the end. As for the family settlement fees for volunteers, the amount is considerable, at 15 shi of coarse rice per person. The settlement fees collected by the township offices from the recruits are also calculated in rice, at 5 dou of coarse rice per person.

Regarding land tax, 241,000 shi have been collected so far. Jiaxing's total quota is 390,000 shi, so more than 60% has been collected. The collection is still being stepped up, and according to personnel in the land tax office, it is likely to reach 80% by the end of this month.

For households with old tax debts and large tenant farmers who are in arrears, County Magistrate Pan personally invited the landlords for talks in his private capacity, urging them to pay through persuasion. This approach has yielded great results in the collection of land tax.

Cultural Crisis

Jiaxing's cultural undertakings are relatively developed compared to other counties. It is not easy to see three broadsheet newspapers (Jiaxing Commercial Daily, Jia District Republican Daily, National Daily) in a county town with a population of 420,000. However, the Lunar New Year was passed smoothly, but the onslaught of spring prices has become difficult to cope with. Newsprint has reached the 3 million yuan mark per ream, and employee salaries are increasing with the cost of living. In order to make up for the huge deficit, the price of newspapers has been raised continuously, and advertising rates have been adjusted. As a result, circulation has shrunk, and revenue has still not been able to increase. The plan to expand the business has finally failed. In order to sustain themselves in the days to come, the newspaper industry association has held emergency meetings for days, but has not come up with a satisfactory solution to the seriousness of the problem. The reporter speculates that the final solution to this problem may be the merger of the three newspapers. The reason why they are struggling to support themselves now is that they hope that the allocated newsprint can be purchased at a price within a short period of time in order to save themselves. Otherwise, the continuation of their survival may be very questionable.

Gambling Wind Not Checked

Hangjiahu has been known as the land of fish and rice. Because of the past abundance of food and clothing, the extravagant and decadent life of the people of Jiaxing has developed today. After years of anesthetic education by the enemy and puppets, the simple customs have changed. During the Spring Festival, the prevalence of gambling in Jiaxing can be said to have set a new record in previous years. The number of casinos has spread to every corner of the county, and there are even incredible stories of betting with 20 taels of gold. Although the local authorities have implemented township autonomy pacts in order to curb the gambling wind, stipulating that those who gamble and are arrested must be fined between 200,000 and 1 million in cash, which will be used as funds for township autonomy, its effect is minimal.

In order to catch gamblers, many unfortunate incidents have occurred in the police bureau. For example, gamblers booked rooms 105 and 106 in the Taihua Inn in the eastern gate of the city, gathering day and night to gamble wildly for several months. When the police bureau dispatched Police Chief Song Tianpei to lead eight police officers to arrest them, they were resisted by the gamblers with their large number of people, and instead suffered gunshot wounds. Chief Song was shot in the right waist, and the bullet exited from the left abdomen. By the time a large number of police officers arrived, the place had long been deserted. Although the injured did not die, they have not yet been discharged from the hospital. A similar incident also occurred in Zhongdai Township. Police officers who arrested gamblers were tied up, insulted, and forced to write "confessions" before being released. In addition, there were also incidents of councilors being beaten for trying to stop gambling, which is truly shocking!

Conservative Superstition

In addition to gambling, during the Spring Festival, people are busy staging operas to thank the gods and worship Buddha. The peasants have never been able to get rid of the concepts of "conservatism" and "superstition." They always attribute what they harvest in the fields to the "Buddha," so they don't care about spending a huge amount of money on staging operas to thank the gods and worship Buddha! The method of raising funds is mostly calculated based on the amount of land, for example, raising 10,000 yuan or 1 sheng of rice per mu of land, which is very easy. If it is for public undertakings, such as raising funds for township education, it is more difficult than begging for food, because they simply look down on scholars, and they don't want their children to study, because today's scholars are not as good as those who wield hoes. They can eat four full meals a day, with fish and meat, and get a salary of five sheng of white rice. Which civil servant's treatment can match theirs? This is another sad reality in the countryside today. (Report from this newspaper, Chen Jianxiong)

### Building the Wanshou Bridge - Good News

[Report from this Newspaper, Fuzhou, 7th] One of the largest bridges in Fujian Province, the Fuzhou Wanshou Bridge (commonly known as "Daqiaotou"), is entirely built of steel, reinforced concrete, and stone, with a total length of 382 meters, spanning the Min River and being very imposing. During the Rongyu turmoil in 1944, when the Sino-American Mixed Air Force came to bomb Rongcheng, two holes in the main body of the bridge were destroyed by bombs. In order to maintain the transportation of the entire city, the enemy forces immediately used wooden beams to pave the bridge the next day. After the victory, it has been used until now. The Rongcheng government previously requested the central government to find a way to repair it. Now, a concrete reply has been received. The funds for the repair are approved to be raised, and the materials part is approved to be allocated six steel beams by the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Engineering Office for application. The city government has sent someone to collect them. If the funds are allocated, construction can begin in the shortest possible time.

### Unidentified Male Corpse in Taixian County; A Piece of Gold Found

[Our Newspaper Taixian Dispatch, 4th] An unidentified male corpse was discovered on the 3rd in a pillbox in the northeast corner of the city. The deceased appeared to be in his thirties, dressed in a gray foreign crepe cotton robe, a gray factory cloth coat, and black foreign crepe cotton trousers. His head was wrapped with five or six sets of cotton rope, his face was covered in mud, his tongue was slightly protruding, and the tip of his tongue was bitten through. His nose bridge was broken, and there was a wound in the back of his head. Next to the corpse was a yellow, plain military cap and a piece of city brick stained with blood. There were no identification documents on his person, so his identity remains unknown. Inside his undershirt, a red paper package was found containing a piece of gold, weighing about two taels. From various signs, it is suspected that this case is a murder for financial gain. The corpse was inspected by a coroner dispatched by the District Procuratorate and then taken for burial by the Ba長 (local leader) with a written guarantee. The gold piece is being held on record by the District Procuratorate.

### Ascending the Goose Pagoda and Treading Greenery at Qujiang

The pagoda rises like a spring,
Solitary and tall, piercing the celestial palace.
Ascending, one leaves the mundane world,
Stairway winding through emptiness.
Abruptly pressing down on the divine land,
Towering as if by ghostly craftsmanship.
Its four corners obstruct the white sun,
Its seven stories grind the azure sky.
Looking down, one points at high-flying birds,
Listening, one hears the startling wind.
The mountains connect like waves,
Rushing together as if heading east.
Green locust trees line the road,
The palaces and pavilions, how exquisite!
Autumn colors arrive from the west,
Vastly filling the Guanzhong region.
On the Five Mausoleums and northern plains,
For ten thousand ages, a misty green.
Pure reason can be understood,
A karmic result of past lives.
I vow to hang up my official hat and leave,
To awaken to a Tao that provides infinite resources. (Poem by Cen Shen)

[Our Newspaper Xi'an Air Dispatch, 1st] People who have been to Xi'an are mostly familiar with the Big and Small Goose Pagodas. The main reason is that it is a famous Buddhist temple and has a Goose Pagoda as high as three hundred feet. Every year after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the sixteenth day is the grand Goose Pagoda Festival. The citizens of Xi'an go to the Ci'en Temple in droves. Outside the South Gate, carriages and horses gather, loudly shouting, "Who's going! Going to visit the Big Goose Pagoda." From the Tang Dynasty to the present, it has been like this every year. Except for the flames of war that burned Chang'an, this ancient festival is always lively.

The Great Ci'en Temple

Located seven li south of Xi'an's southern suburbs, the Big Goose Pagoda is inside the temple. According to historical records, it was established in the 22nd year of Zhenguan by Emperor Gaozong for Empress Wende. It now occupies about thirty mu, and its scale is far from the past glory of "double-layered buildings, cloud pavilions, and cave chambers." Only old buildings remain, paired with crumbling walls, covered with wind, sand, and dust, creating a desolate sight. If it weren't for the towering seven-story pagoda still standing, perhaps no one would visit anymore.

The Goose Pagoda is in the back courtyard of the temple. Xi'an people call it the Big Goose Pagoda to distinguish it from the Small Goose Pagoda in the Dafu Temple. It has seven stories, with brick on the outside and earth on the inside. It is said that in the past, there were over a thousand relics on each floor. The inside of the pagoda is hollow, with stairs for climbing, spiraling upwards to the highest floor. If the weather is clear, looking north towards Xi'an, everything is clearly visible as if in a painting. The surrounding rivers and mountains are all in view. At the bottom of the pagoda, there is a stone tablet inscribed by Chu Suiliang of the Tang Dynasty. Now, due to rubbings throughout the ages, the writing is slightly blurred. The carvings on the tablet are detailed, far beyond the ordinary. It is said that this is a famous stele in calligraphy collections.

Even though the writing is not clear now, the black stains on the tablet show that people are still making rubbings.

South of the pagoda, across two heavenly halls, are numerous stone tablets. This is the famous "Goose Pagoda Inscriptions." Since the Tang Dynasty, scholars who passed the imperial examinations would come to the Goose Pagoda and inscribe their names on the stone tablets, hoping to be remembered for generations. Later, the capital was moved to other places, and the Goose Pagoda Inscriptions no longer saw imperial graduates. Only the licentiates and students from the Shaanxi provincial examinations inscribed their names. Now, the inscription tablets are far from the original ones, with only the provincial examination tablets from the Ming and Qing dynasties remaining.

Two li south from the Goose Pagoda is the Qujiang Pool. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, this was a popular spring outing destination.

Ladies were as numerous as clouds, and the scenery was luxurious. They were mostly famous ministers and even used rouge as red bait, hanging it on poles and leading horses forward. As the saying goes, "The six dragons travel south to the Furong Garden, and the fragrance drifts ten li into Wucheng." Now, only some villages remain. Except for the Goose Pagoda Festival, when there are many tourists, it is usually like any common village in the north. During the Anti-Japanese War, a part of the Central Military Academy trained here, painting all the walls in the village anew. But now it has "returned to its original state."

Wujiapo is located southeast of Qujiang, in a gully. This gully is what is known as the Honggou River in Beijing opera. "Cold Kiln" is on the south bank of the gully. According to people, this is where Wang Baochuan waited eighteen years for Pinglang to return. Now, the outside of the cave is neatly arranged with houses, and even the cave where Wang Sanjie sat is now paved with ancient bricks and bluestone. The smoke and fire are more prosperous than in other places, and the cave is small and crowded, with a warm atmosphere, without a trace of "cold." There is little vegetation on both banks of the Honggou River. Further away, it is again covered with vegetation, perhaps due to the soil. However, the locals say that Wang Sanjie ate all the vegetable during the eighteen years of cold and hunger. Wujiapo is also called Wudianpo. It is not recorded in the Xi'an gazetteer, and like its protagonist, it is unknown. It became famous in the twentieth century due to the opera "Red Mane Stallion."

A villager from Qujiang Pool told the reporter that an inglorious thing happened in their village last year. The wife of a soldier who had been away for three years could not bear to sleep alone and committed adultery. Her husband's uncle discovered it and sued her in the Chang'an court. She was convicted according to the law. This is a common tragedy in wartime, but it is thought-provoking that it happened near Wang Sanjie's "Cold Kiln."

In all the temples, people were seeking divine guidance. Many old ladies, with faces of sincerity, knelt before the Buddha statues, holding divination sticks, shaking them, and telling the clay figures that their sons had gone to war and there had been no news for several years, asking the gods for guidance. One of them sighed after getting up: "When will there be peace?" Tears streamed down her face. In times of turmoil and famine, those who have not been educated have even less faith in people. They all place their hopes at the feet of the gods. (Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Xianzhou)

### Tinglin Town Self-Defense Team Members Shield and Indulge Drug Traffickers; Zhangnian Police Sub-Bureau Telegraphs Songjiang County for Investigation

[Our Newspaper Jinshan Dispatch, 6th] The Zhangnian Sub-Bureau in Jinshan, based on the confession of drug trafficker Pan Fushou, recently sent agents to Tinglin Town in Songjiang County to purchase a small packet of heroin (valued at 100,000 yuan). They also seized a large quantity of drugs on the spot. Before the agents arrived, the town's self-defense team, led by the deputy captain and seven or eight armed soldiers, surrounded Police Chief Wu. Using the pretext of contacting the town government, Police Chief Wu explained the case and presented his warrant. The deputy captain unreasonably tore it up and confiscated his No. 2 pistol, allowing the drug trafficker Li Huixiang to escape. When the agents arrived and negotiated, they learned that the son of the drug trafficker Li Huixiang was a member of the self-defense team, hence the self-defense team shielded and indulged him. The negotiation was ineffective. The Zhangnian Sub-Bureau has urgently reported to the County Bureau, which has reported to the County Government. It is reported that County Chief Wang of Jinshan has telegraphed County Chief Xu of Songjiang for investigation.

### Bandits with Evil Intentions Set Up Checkpoints for Extortion; The National Flag and Boatmen Suffer Intolerable Harassment

[Our Newspaper Wujin Dispatch, 7th] Unemployed vagrants Wu Qi-da and Ye Jinxiang from Henglin, and Shu Bao-chen from Danyang colluded to privately set up a "tax checkpoint" at the canal dock in front of Ding Town, west of Qishuyan Town. They planted a national flag and forced passing boats to dock, extorting millions or hundreds of thousands of yuan depending on the size of the boat. They created a fabricated name "National Flag Donation", but after donating, they did not give a national flag, only a printed flag purchase certificate. Wu, Ye, and Shu all wore military uniforms, similar to tax police, so boatmen dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. The city defense learned of this and sent personnel to the countryside to arrest them, seizing eighteen national flags of various sizes, a large book of flag purchase certificates, half a book of "National Flag Usage Essentials", seven order forms, and a round seal of "China National Flag Society Distribution Office". They were immediately taken to the Sixth Military Law Group for interrogation. According to their confession, they colluded to set up checkpoints for extortion. They also claimed that similar situations existed along the canal in Danyang, Benniu, Lucheng, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places. Whether this is an organized group or serves other purposes is still under investigation.

Yiguang Highway Under Construction

[Our Newspaper Yixing Dispatch] The Yiguang Highway, which spans the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui border regions and connects to the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, starts from Yixing in Jiangsu Province and ends in Guangde in Anhui Province, with a total length of 160 li. It meanders and winds, and the vehicles pass through mountains and foothills. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the entire road project was completed. However, it was deliberately destroyed during the enemy's invasion. Since the victory, the bandit atmosphere in the border regions of the three provinces has been restless, and orders have been given to rebuild it. Currently, the 60 li from Yixing to Zhangzhu, the bridges and culverts have been gradually repaired, and it is expected to be open to traffic soon. From Zhangzhu to Guangde, civilian labor is being mobilized to build it in sections. The sectional method stipulates that each Bao completes a certain number of Li, which doubles the efficiency and saves financial resources. If the entire road is restored, it will not only facilitate military operations and suppress bandits, but also allow for the full exploitation of mineral and mountain resources, greatly increasing exports and laying the foundation for the livelihood of the people in the border region.

### Secretary of the British Universities China Committee to Visit China; Purpose is to Visit Educational Institutions

[British Information Service London Dispatch, 8th] The British Universities China Committee, whose main purpose is to promote Sino-British cultural relations and which serves as the British agent for the Board of Trustees of the Sino-British Educational and Cultural Endowment Fund, has been settling and caring for students sent to the UK by the Board of Trustees for fifteen years. Up to now, there have been nine groups of students, totaling about 200 people, all of whom have obtained higher degrees in the UK, without exception. There are also quite a few who have distinguished themselves in various research fields. After completing their studies, they have all taken on important jobs in their home countries, with university teaching being the most common.

Mr. Maughill, the secretary of the China Committee, set off by plane on the 6th to visit Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. The purpose is to meet with leaders in the Chinese education community and visit educational institutions, so as to directly learn what kind of most beneficial assistance the UK can provide to China in this area. It is expected that he will stay in China for more than a month.

Before his departure, Mr. Maughill told reporters about the past achievements of the China Committee and the purpose of his visit to China: "We dare to say that this project has contributed to promoting mutual respect and strengthening cultural ties between the two countries. The purpose of my trip is to discuss the future of this project with the Board of Trustees, as well as some practical issues involved in the implementation of the project. I will also ask them to make suggestions on other ways in which the Committee can serve China. The Committee hopes to express its confidence in the future of China on a small scale and is willing to cooperate closely with people who have many common points in terms of concepts. The Board of Trustees is deeply grateful for this expression of trust, as it sent its last group of scholarship students to the UK when life in our country was difficult. The chairman of the Board of Trustees visited the UK from 1945 to 1946 and visited several universities in our country. I hope to visit some universities in China as well. Some scholars from the Board of Trustees have come to the UK to study animal husbandry. Dr. Zhang, a professor of animal husbandry at National Sichuan University, is currently investigating animal husbandry methods and conditions here. As a countryman, I especially hope to see such departments and experimental venues in China, if time permits. But practical problems in daily life that can be helped by Sino-British universities to seek solutions are only one aspect. The vision of Chinese universities will help to provide all the categories of science in which students and experts from both countries can mutually benefit from the exchange of methods and conditions. I really want to see China, about which I have heard a lot but know very little."

### Sichuan Education Institute to Become a University: Preparatory Committee Established, Deng Xihou Appointed as Chairman

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 5th] In July of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Supervisory Office specially invited Gan Jiyong to purchase 1,400 mu of land in Longyin Township, Ba County, to establish a rural normal school specialized program, which is the predecessor of today's Sichuan Provincial Education Institute. In July of the following year, it merged with the Sichuan Central Agricultural Experiment Field and expanded into the Sichuan Rural Construction Institute, with "Social Studies" and "Agriculture" departments. This expanded the scale and contributed significantly to rural governance and agricultural improvement in Sichuan Province.

After Gan Jiyong became the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, he resigned from the position of Dean in August of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), and Gao Xianjian succeeded him. The Ministry of Education deemed that the structure of the institute did not align with the current academic system. In June of the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), it was proposed to reorganize the institute into the Sichuan Provincial Education Institute, with the departments renamed to (1) Social Education Department and (2) Agricultural Education Department. Subsequently, it collaborated with the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Third District of Sichuan Province to conduct experimental zones in nine counties under its jurisdiction, using the power of education to assist in advancing political facilities. The results were remarkable.

During the Anti-Japanese War, Gao Xianjian resigned due to illness, and     Xin took over the post. Subsequently, Education and Chinese Language special programs were added, increasing the "Chinese Language," "Mathematics," "English," "Agronomy," and "Agricultural Chemistry" departments. After Dr. Chai Youheng, who had a doctorate in education from the University of Paris, became the President of the institute, the "History and Geography," "Natural History," and "Horticulture" departments were established. As of now, the institute has eleven departments, more than twenty classes, and over six hundred students (including over two hundred female students). The spacious campus has long possessed the foundation of a university with faculties of Arts, Sciences, Agriculture, and Education.

Since the victory, to commemorate this holy site of national revival, the National Political Council suggested that the institute be upgraded to a university. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly also made several decisions to this effect. Therefore, there was a strike starting on January 19th, marking the third school expansion movement since the establishment of the Sichuan Education Institute.

The Sichuan Provincial Government, in its provincial affairs meeting on February 27th, re-deliberated and decided to establish a preparatory committee for the university upgrade. Chairman Deng Xihou was appointed as the director of the committee, with Deputy Director and Secretary-General Deng Hanxiang, and Education Director Ren Juewu. The other members of the committee included Xiang Chuanyi, Wu Jingbo, Chai Youheng, and twelve others. The first meeting of the committee was held in Chengdu on the first day of this month, and the plan for the university upgrade was discussed in detail. However, according to the results of various interviews by our newspaper reporters, the supplementary examination for the last semester and the start date for this semester have not yet been decided as of the time of publication. This is because the minimum requirements of the school expansion committee are: (A) Insisting on the name "Peidu University" (Wartime Capital University), and the preparations must be completed within this semester, and students should be enrolled under the name of the university in the next semester. (B) Immediately allocate the school construction funds of 60,000 shi of yellow grain and 3 billion in national currency, which were approved by the Provincial Affairs Conference on February 27th. President Chai Youheng and student representatives Peng Zhifu, Peng Qiyu, Li Wenyang, and others will only return to Chongqing from Chengdu after the above two recommendations of the Expansion Committee have received a definite response. (Special Correspondent of this newspaper,      Yang      )

### This Week's First Division Football: Dongqing to Play Simultaneously, Separately Facing the Kang Team and the Jewish Team; Second and Third Divisions to Hold Finals

In addition to the First Division which is yet to continue, the divisions of the second and third tiers have already entered the finals stage. The schedule for this week was arranged and announced yesterday by the organizing committee. After the Mayor's Cup loss, the two giants of the First Division, Donghua and Qingbai, will play against the Kang Team and the Jewish Team on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, both competing at the Yiyuan Stadium. In addition, the second division final, Qunli vs. Central Aviation, will be held at 10:00 AM on Sunday at Yiyuan. The Youth Cup and the Third Division Third Group finals are all scheduled to take place at the Zhongzheng Public National Stadium.

The organizing committee stipulates that the finals of the second and third divisions will adopt an elimination system. If the second division match ends in a tie, it will be extended by 30 minutes (15 minutes each half), and the third division will be extended by 20 minutes (10 minutes each half). If there is still no winner, the match will be replayed on another day.

In Saturday afternoon's first division match, Qingbaiqing meets the Jiji Team. Qingbaiqing is the champion team of the previous Mayor's Cup. In this year's football league, they have been victorious in every match since their debut and are determined to win the league championship. The whole team has been practicing hard since returning to Shanghai from the inter-city competition in Hong Kong, and they are indeed a formidable opponent for all teams in the first division. Although the Kang Team is a rising force this year, they lack experience, leading to defeats in every match. Meeting a strong opponent on Saturday, defeat is undoubtedly inevitable.

In the other match, Donghua vs. the Jewish team, Donghua has been recruiting troops and expanding its operations in Hong Kong to consolidate its strength in the football season. In addition to Xie Jinhong, who has already shown his face in Shanghai a few days ago, Guo Yingqi will soon report for duty. Several other generals will also come to Shanghai from Hong Kong in succession. Judging from their active reorganization, it is conceivable that they have great ambitions for the championship. The Jewish team is not weak and has a reputation as a dark horse in the football world. Although their talent is uneven this year, their strength is still profound and unpredictable. When Donghua meets them, they must proceed with caution. The schedule for this week is recorded below:

March 13 (Saturday)

Qingbaiqing—Kang Team (First Division) 3:00 PM, Yiyuan Stadium

March 14 (Sunday)

Donghua—Jewish Team (First Division) 3:00 PM, Yiyuan Stadium

Qunli—China Aviation (Second Division Final) 10:00 AM, Yiyuan Stadium

China Textile 17—Qingbai B (Youth Cup) 10:00 AM, Zhongzheng First Field

Yin Team—Xinfeng (Third Division Third Group Final) 10:00 AM, Zhongzheng Second Field

It was decided to appoint Committee Members Zhang Ziheng and Zhang Haotang as mediators for both parties, hoping that they would accept the competition to be in line with the association's purpose of promotion. As for the rumors that the Nanyang team in the Western District had non-union members participating, there was no evidence from other teams, so it was not discussed. The last match between the Post Office and Nanyang in that district was held a few days ago. As a result, the Post Office defeated Nanyang with a score of 4 to 3, winning the championship, and Nanyang took the runner-up. The results of both sides and the full rankings are recorded below:

### Junior High School Scout Curriculum Still a Required Subject

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch] At the expert conference on secondary education of the Ministry of Education, it was proposed to merge the junior high school scout curriculum into other courses. Representatives from the scout education community in various places were sent to Nanjing, including Fang Guoliang, the general director of the Hankou City Branch of the China Boy Scouts, to ask the Ministry to reconsider. According to Wu Zhaotang, the director of the Department of Secondary Education, "This issue is only a proposal in the conference and has not become a final decision. Now, after the final decision made by Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education and the Chairman of the Boy Scout Association, the junior high school scout curriculum is still listed as a required course, one hour per week, and special attention will be paid to extracurricular scout activities. As for the transfer of the Boy Scout Association to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, it also means that we attach importance to the active development of scout education. All representatives are very satisfied.

### Regrets from the First Round Not Yet Dissipated: Dagong and Chenyou Meet Again: Three First Division Matches in Tonight's Basketball League

The third basketball league will hold three matches as usual starting at 5:30 PM today, still in the gymnasium of the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets will still be sold for 30,000 yuan upstairs and 60,000 yuan downstairs, and the Siwei Boy Scouts are invited to maintain order on site. The program for today is recorded below:

Jianle—Dahua (Second Division A) 5:30 PM Referees: Jin Botao Jin Jiabiao

Donghua—Jiashen (Second Division B) 6:30 PM Referees: Zheng Zhifang Xuan Hegao

Dagong—Chenyou (First Division) 7:30 PM Referees: Liu Hesheng Wu Zibin

Second Division Matches

In the first match, Jianle vs. Dahua, Jianle is organized by members of the Youth Association. The warriors under its command are extremely rich in experience on the basketball court. However, due to the job-related relationships of each team member, they do not often practice, so sometimes the contact is not enough. Today, meeting Dahua, the situation between Dahua and Jianle is similar, and the outcome of the battle is difficult to predict. And the victory or defeat of the two teams in this group has little to do with the overall situation, and at the time of engagement, Jianle may be able to overcome Dahua.

In the second act, Second Division B group, Donghua and Jiashen face off. Looking at the past results of this group, both sides have been able to maintain undefeated, and they have become established with equal strength. They have become incompatible, and they are all trying to grab the championship seat in the group. The warriors of both teams are equally full of long-term strength. Donghua is mostly famous football players, accustomed to driving, and Jiashen is relatively more advantageous in terms of contact. Victory is king, defeat is bandit, this move is extremely important. At that time, each will fight with all its strength, and it is not difficult to predict that it will be tense and exciting.

### Prices at Production Sites Continue to Rise; Rice Prices Break New Highs; Arrival Volume Does Not Decrease; Owners Hold on to Prices and Refuse to Sell

Yesterday's rice market was even more volatile. It is rumored that China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) is purchasing in Wuxi, and prices continue to rise, which has affected the Shanghai market. However, yesterday's arrivals increased compared to the previous day, with a total of 11,195 dan arriving in the north and south markets. However, the owners sold less, resulting in few samples matched by brokers, and few old samples. Prices rose sharply in the morning market due to the strong support of the owners. In the North Market, special high-quality japonica rice was once quoted at 3.9 million, and Xibai japonica rice was quoted at 3.8 million. At the close, prices fell back, with special high-quality japonica rice at 3.88 million, Xibai japonica rice at 3.7 million yuan, and thin indica rice at 3.7 million yuan, all up nearly 400,000 yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. Baiyuan was also at 3.7 million, and Yinyuan was at 3.65 million. Prices in the South Market were 100,000 yuan lower than in the North Market, with Bai japonica rice and thin indica rice each at 3.6 million yuan.

Flour

The speculative atmosphere is very strong, with fluctuations of as much as 80,000 yuan. The morning opening was due to the sharp rise in rice prices, and the owners took this opportunity to raise prices significantly. Old Car brand flour actually reached 1.56 million yuan, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared to last week. In the end, because the opening price was too high, actual sales decreased, and the wind turned. Old Car closed at 1.48 million. Bingchuan opened at 1.53 million, but closed at 1.47 million, still up 40,000 to 50,000 compared to last weekend. Hongfeng and Jiancheng both opened at 1.52 million and closed at 1.46 million. The market situation for bran is also the same.

Miscellaneous Grains

Soybeans opened the highest. Due to the insistence of both buyers and sellers, trading only started very late. Hankou Zhaza beans initially opened at 1.75 million, but later due to sluggish sales, it fell slightly to 1.72 million, and finally to 1.7 million, and it was still not easy to sell. Raw peanuts from Guangdong were slightly absorbed, and the price rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Mung beans also rose by more than 200,000 yuan. Although Tianjin sesame was not taken, it also followed the rise in rice prices. Hankou white sesame was 3.3 million, and Jiujiang milk sesame was 3.05 million, each rising by more than 200,000 yuan. Corn was affected by electricity problems in Qingdao, which prevented flour milling. Although the four arrivals of grain all rose, corn alone fell by 50,000 yuan. Jianqing rose by 100,000, and red sorghum rose by 50,000.

Cooking Oil

There has been no shortage of arrivals recently, and market prices could have been stable. However, with the rise in rice prices, the owners' minds are quite firm and they are trying their best to raise prices. Recycled factory soybean oil initially opened at 6.7 million (Tongfeng), and later the factory also opened slightly at 6.68 million, up about 250,000 compared to last weekend. Raw rapeseed oil rose by 150,000, and the closing price of raw oil was even weaker. Qingdao Jibao raw oil initially opened at 7.7 million yuan, but later retreated to 7.6 million, and finally the slightly inferior goods were only quoted at 7.5 million yuan. Jiangbei Jibao raw Shantou oil was also 7.5 million yuan, which was about the same as the closing price last week. Chongqing Jibao cooked rapeseed oil hit the 7 million mark, and small car sesame oil rose by 250,000 yuan. Soybean cake initially rose by 20,000 to 30,000, but later also fell back, and the result was the same as last week.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Su freighter, which transported 8,853 tons of foreign rice from Rangoon, arrived at the port at 4:00 PM yesterday and is currently berthed at Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong for unloading.

### COFCO Denies Purchasing Rice in Wuxi

It is rumored that the fluctuation of rice prices in this city is due to COFCO's large-scale purchases in Wuxi. According to the person in charge of the business section of COFCO's Shanghai office, the company has not purchased rice in Wuxi at all in the past two weeks, and only processed 2,000 dan of original rice in the Wuxi rice mill. He also said that the company currently has only 300 million yuan in deposits in Wuxi banks, which has not been used at all. This proves that someone is purchasing rice in Wuxi, which has nothing to do with the company. At present, the company's main business is to purchase rice from the producing areas in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces under the entrustment of the Food Bureau, and to transport food to the Northeast and Taiwan. The most recent 136,000 bags of flour from the Food Bureau were recently sent to Taiwan by the company.

### Outside Stimulus Strengthens; China Stocks End Strong

The cotton fabric market has entered the spring selling season. In recent days, merchants from the northern and Yangtze River regions, along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line, have been coming to Shanghai to purchase goods in increasing numbers. Market conditions, due to the skyrocketing prices of raw cotton and yarn, coupled with rising labor costs, have led to significant increases in the prices of singlets, undershirts, and coarse and fine yarn shirts. 3901 Goose brand singlets rose to 4 million yuan per dozen, 410 Flying Horse to 2.35 million yuan, 802 Monk Hat singlets to 8.2 million yuan, 302 Monk Hat to 2.3 million yuan, 201 Goldfish Brocade shirts to 2.8 million yuan, 32-count Yanshou men's shirts to 520,000 yuan, and 84-count Red Lion brand Suzhou yarn dance socks to 1.86 million yuan, up from 10% to 30-40% compared to last week.

Dyeing factories initially showed some selling pressure, and bids briefly declined. Soon after, merchants from Hankou aggressively purchased jean and satin drills, and merchants from Guangdong also competed for goods. With limited supply from the China Textile Construction Company, external parties dragged and absorbed goods, pushing all cloths to unprecedented new highs.

### Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Plans to Develop China's Rubber Industry

The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office believes that rubber industrial products are directly related to national defense industries and are of great importance to people's daily life. However, the domestic rubber industry has been unable to fully develop its capabilities and achieve self-sufficiency due to insufficient rubber import quotas. In order to develop this industry, the office yesterday drafted a plan to promote the industry and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review and approval. The details are as follows:

The maximum monthly rubber requirement for all rubber factories in domestic ports such as Shanghai, Taiwan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang is approximately 3,800 tons. The current difficulties are: (1) Insufficient rubber import quotas to meet actual needs, so factories cannot fully utilize their production capacity. (2) Too many newly established small-scale rubber factories, whose purpose is to collect officially priced rubber and resell it on the black market for profit, causing further panic for raw materials for large factories. (3) The domestic annual demand for automobile tires is approximately 270,000 sets. Currently, only factories such as Great China, Zhengtai, Qilu, and Shenyang are manufacturing, with an annual output of less than 100,000 sets, a difference of more than 170,000 sets. Machinery for manufacturing automobile tires must be imported, and rubber factories cannot easily obtain foreign exchange, so they cannot increase production. (4) The manufacturing of V-belts and rubber belts is relatively developed in Shanghai. If imports are prohibited, this industry will become more prosperous. Promotion methods: (1) Increase rubber import quotas; (2) Restrict the establishment of new factories. New factories that produce products such as galoshes and running shoes will not be allocated foreign exchange; (3) Allow the import of machinery for manufacturing automobile tires, and stipulate that the import volume of automobile tires will reach self-sufficiency within three years; (4) The quality of domestic V-belts and rubber mass can meet the needs of various industries, and regulations should be put in place to gradually restrict imports. If the above plan can be implemented, it is expected to achieve the following results: (1) Stipulate the monthly import volume of raw rubber to meet actual needs. (2) Promulgate regulations for the allocation of foreign exchange for newly established factories. (3) Find ways to subsidize private factories to purchase new modern machinery from foreign countries, and then establish factories capable of manufacturing 20,000 sets of automobile tires (both large and small) per month. (4) Stipulate measures to gradually restrict the import of V-belts and other items, and subsidize private factories to ensure that the production of V-belts is sufficient for all factories in the country.

### In Memory of Professor Whitehead

— Xie Youwei

Professor Alfred North Whitehead, a great figure in the contemporary academic world, passed away on December 20, 1947, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. He was eighty-six years old. The death of this great master seems to have gone unnoticed in the newspapers in our country. It has been two months since Whitehead's death, and only now has the author learned of this news from an American magazine. Although the news is late, my feelings of sorrow and respect have not diminished. I am writing this to express my admiration and respect.

Whitehead was not only a great philosopher but also a great scientist. His achievements in learning are beyond doubt. In terms of his position in the history of Western philosophy, his position can certainly be compared with Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and, more recently, with Bradley, Bergson, Dewey, and Russell. In terms of the breadth, depth, subtlety, and infinity of his thought, we can say that Whitehead is today's Hegel. Anyone who has read Whitehead's books must share the author's feelings. As for his status as a scientist, his research on the principles of mathematics is enough to establish him as a master in his own right. The book "Principia Mathematica," co-authored with Russell, has become a classic for those engaged in mathematical logic. Even pure mathematicians cannot ignore it. His book "Science and the Modern World" is unique in its exposition of scientific principles. Therefore, it is fitting to say that Whitehead was also a great scientist, and Whitehead deserves this title without shame.

Whitehead was British. He was born on February 15, 1861, in Ramsgate, on the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, England. His ancestors were engaged in education, religion, and local government. His grandfather, Thomas, was once the headmaster of a local private school. His father, Alfred, was also a teacher and later became a pastor. Whitehead grew up in such a family, so even though he later studied mathematics and philosophy, he also had a passion for education and religion. At the age of nineteen, he entered Cambridge University. After graduating, he worked at the university for more than twenty years. The courses he taught were mathematics. From 1911, he became a professor at the University of London. While in England, Whitehead had already written philosophical works, but the academic world did not yet regard him as a philosopher. In 1924, Harvard University in the United States hired Whitehead as a professor of philosophy. It was at this time that Whitehead really made philosophy his career. Since then, Whitehead's important philosophical works have gradually been published, his position has become increasingly secure, and his reputation has grown, and the philosophical world has had to regard him as a master of his generation.

Whitehead's main works include the following: (1) "A Treatise on Univercal Algebra" (1898), (2) "Principia Mathematica" (1910, co-authored with Russell), (3) "An Introduction to Mathematics" (1911), (4) "An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Natural Knowle gc" (1919), (5) "The Concept of Nature" (1920), (6) "The Principle of Relativity" (1922), (7) "Science and The Mo r n World" (1925), (8) "Religion In The Making" (1926), (9) "Symbolism, Its Meaning and Effect" (1927), (10) "Proceos and Reality" (1926), (11) "The Function of Reacon" (1929), (12) "The Aims of Elucation and Other Essay" (1929), (13) "The Adventure of Ldeas" (1933), (14) "Modes of Thought" (1938), (15) "Essays in Science and Philosophy" (1947). Of the above books, only "Science and the Modern World" and a part of "Modes of Thought" discussing "Life and Nature" have Chinese translations (see the Commercial Press, Universal Library). To the author's knowledge, the rest have no Chinese translations. This is not because Chinese philosophers ignore Whitehead, but because Whitehead's books are extremely difficult to translate. If translated literally without explanation, even philosophical experts will find it difficult to understand.

Whitehead's thought cannot be described in this article. What can be briefly said is that various philosophical doctrines and schools of thought, such as idealism and realism, cannot be unconditionally applied to Whitehead. In the past, some people regarded Whitehead as a neo-realist, but after the development of Whitehead's thought, neo-realism could no longer encompass his thought. Whitehead himself called his school "the philosophy of organism" or "the philosophy of organic interdependence," meaning that everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent, like an organism. He believes that the fundamental or real nature of the universe or nature is neither mind nor matter, but a kind of "event" or "actual entity." This "event" or "actual entity" is the ultimate reality of the universe, the basis for constituting the universe. Man and nature, or mind and matter, are all formed by this "actual entity" in different organizational forms. This "actual entity" has transience, so it is not fixed and static but is a process of activity. This "actual entity" also has extensibility, that is, one "actual entity" invades other "actual entities," and other "actual entities" also invade this one "actual entity," so they are not isolated but are interconnected. Therefore, everything in the universe is in a process of change, all influencing each other, all things are interwoven, one thing contains other things as its elements, and other things also contain this one thing as its elements. The Chinese saying, "One is all, and all is one," can be said to have this kind of meaning in Whitehead's philosophy.

Whitehead has many facets, and the author can only briefly mention one or two. When Whitehead taught at Harvard, many Chinese philosophers studied under him (such as He Lin, Shen Youding, Qu Xiaochen, etc.). From 1929 to 1931, the author also had the honor of being among his students. Although I am ashamed of my little understanding of my teacher's theories, I have a very deep impression of my teacher's personality. Whitehead's personality can be described as kind and approachable. Every Friday evening, Whitehead welcomed students to his home. Whitehead and his wife would greet them with smiles. Surrounded by a dozen or twenty students, he answered every question without any sign of fatigue. His kindness, sincerity, easygoing attitude, and profound words, even a few words, were enough to inspire people. He was truly a complete person in the academic world.

The above is a brief account of Whitehead's life, works, and thought. I respect Whitehead's thought, and I also respect Whitehead's personality. In terms of Whitehead's achievements, Whitehead is immortal.

### On the Use of Two Languages

— Haoran

In large cities, people from all over gather, and many people learn to speak more than two languages, a phenomenon generally referred to as Bilingualism. In some cases, this is unavoidable. For example, some families who only speak Cantonese, if they live in Shanghai, may have to learn three languages: Cantonese at home, Shanghainese outside, and Mandarin at school. Many foreign children speak Chinese to their "Ama" [nanny], their native language to their parents, and "Pidgin English" to Westerners. These are all unavoidable. However, some families with a higher cultural level and a greater degree of Westernization are using very forced means to encourage their children to speak two languages—English at home and Chinese outside. This approach poses some potential dangers to children, which we will briefly mention here.

Does the use of two languages ​​have a negative impact on children's language development? The Frenchman J. Ronjat made a very careful observation of this. His son Loui spoke French with him but German with his mother. According to Ronjat, his son was no more behind in either language, whether speaking or reading, than someone who only learned one language. But the question is: Can this one case be used as a lesson? Not entirely.

The American D.T. Spoerl has published several papers on this issue. She believes that unless the two languages ​​are clearly separated, for example, the mother speaks German and never speaks a word of French, and the father only speaks French and never speaks German, without any confusion, development may be normal. If there is even a slight mix, the situation is not so ideal, and language development may at least be temporarily delayed. As for whether this impact is permanent, opinions are divided. The Englishman S.S. Laurie said: "If a child can learn two languages ​​at the same time and still be equally good, he is being ruined. His intellectual and cultural development is not doubled as a result, but halved."

Smith's research on the language development of various children in Hawaii showed that children aged two to six all experienced developmental delays due to using two languages. She said that bilingual speakers often use exclamatory short sentences and fewer complex sentences. The period of sentences specifically referring to object names is longer. General research seems to prove that the use of two languages ​​is detrimental to children's language development.

We know that the speech organs and hands are neurologically connected. The use of two languages ​​may affect actions. For example, one study asked children to raise their right hand, point to their left ear, and other actions, and bilingual speakers made more confusion, mistakes, and hesitation than monolingual speakers. Henss had a son who grew up in the Netherlands and only spoke Dutch until the age of four. He used both hands well. At the age of four, he entered a German school, and his German progressed quickly, but he began to use his right hand exclusively. When he grew up, he went to a German school again, and as a result, he used his right hand exclusively. At this time, he spoke Dutch and German equally well. At the same time, he began to stutter, and it only stopped when he left the Netherlands and forgot Dutch. Researchers unanimously agree that bilingual speakers are more likely to stutter.

The greatest danger of using two languages ​​seems to be emotional. Learning two languages ​​at the same time can be a heavy burden for people with below-average intelligence. If the teaching method is poor and there is slight confusion between the two languages, emotional conflicts may arise. Stuttering is one way of expressing this. Furthermore, language is a medium of culture. It can not only be used to convey meaning, but it is also a preserver of tradition. Each language represents a society. No two are completely comparable. For example, foreign children speak Chinese to their nannies and English to their parents. Then, Chinese becomes a humble language, and his personality when speaking Chinese is different from when he speaks English. In other words, because these two languages ​​represent two societies and two cultures, using two languages ​​inevitably leads to conflict—a conflict of two different statuses or values. A person, especially someone who is not strong and is still developing, may experience personality disintegration due to this conflict. This is a very serious danger. However, in adults, or in children with strong abilities, this conflict can be avoided. On the one hand, his synthesis ability is stronger, and on the other hand, his psychological structure is more distinct. The danger of using two languages ​​is not so obvious in adults, but it cannot be measured by adult standards in children.

### The Relationship Between Mind and Body According to Bosanquet

— Han Yuwen

The mind is spiritual, and the body is material. The body occupies space and is limited by it; the mind does not occupy space and disregards spatial distances and boundaries. All bodily movements or changes in the brain are mechanically driven by the conditions of the body and are passive. Therefore, our unconscious bodily actions, strictly speaking, cannot be considered our own. Only actions originating from the spontaneous mind can be said to be truly our own, because the inherent nature of the mind is active, free, and creative, unlike that of material objects.

Given that the mind and body are so different, what is their relationship to each other? This is an age-old question. Dualists first affirm that the mind and matter are two completely different and independent entities. Then, they assert a causal relationship between them, claiming that bodily and mental actions influence each other. Bosanquet argues that this not only disrupts the connection between mind and body, misinterpreting their activities as requiring external causes, but also simultaneously considers the mind to be both non-material and material. This is, of course, an illogical argument.

As for parallelism, it eliminates the reality of both mind and matter, regarding them as two different attributes of a single spiritual entity. These two attributes each have their own set of causal order, and do not interfere with each other, yet correspond perfectly. This argument seems reasonable, but it still carries the suspicion of splitting mind and matter into two separate entities. Moreover, why can two completely different attributes have a completely corresponding order and function? This remains a difficult mystery to explain.

Subjective idealists only acknowledge the reality of the mind and deny the existence of matter. For example, Berkeley believed that everything in the world is an idea. They thus preserve the unity of mind and matter. However, Bosanquet argues that our minds cannot unconditionally be the cause of ideas and abilities, nor can they create or manufacture a superior organism. The unconscious natural phenomena in the universe are full of exquisite miracles that transcend human planning and creation. In the evolution of nature, material reactivity, attraction, and the like came first, followed by the life of organisms, and then the development of our minds. Therefore, the conscious mind is a later development. Our minds have an unconscious life, etc., as their foundation, and social consciousness or cultural spirit, etc., as their upper layer and ideal. Our minds can rather be said to be a means for organisms to achieve their most complete ideals. Changes in organisms, such as cell division, directly cause changes in life. Every psychological system must have a physical system as its tool of expression; the mind must use the nervous system as its engine. Therefore, matter is indispensable, and it cannot be ignored or denied.

However, matter is only an externality, not a substance. Things cannot arise from nothing, and the mind cannot be born suddenly. Therefore, materialists who exclusively recognize non-mental matter as the ultimate reality and explain the mind as a byproduct of matter have a one-sided view, just like subjective idealism.

In fact, mind and matter are originally one. There is no mere mind or mere matter in the universe, only individuals in whom mind and matter are united. This unity is neither a pure unity without distinction, nor a combination of two things, but a unity of differentiated identity. We know that an individual is a whole that contains many different parts and qualities. When we see it fragmentarily from its parts, we see it as matter; when we see it completely from the individuality of the whole, we see it as spirit. The mind can be said to be the expression and self-awareness of this holistic spirit. The relationship between parts is an external, mechanical, and causal relationship. Therefore, Bosanquet says that a material system is a causal system. The relationship of the whole identity is an internal, organic, and logical relationship. Therefore, Bosanquet says that the mind is a logical system. Then the mind can be said to be the inner nature of the individual, and matter can be said to be the external of the individual. However, the inner and outer contain each other, and mind and matter are inseparable; therefore, the inner is the outer, and the mind is matter. If we consider ourselves, from the mind's ability to express itself in space, the mind is the nervous system; from the concentration of the nervous system, with the spirit striving towards unity, the nervous system is the finite mind. Therefore, if we can understand well, it is originally not impossible to say that the mind has a physical character and matter has a psychological character. However, the mind ultimately occupies a dominant position and has the power to transcend matter. The mind can be said to be the substance and meaning of the material system. For example, music is the substance and meaning of the vibrations of material strings and bamboo; when a needle pricks our body, the pain is the substance and meaning of the prick. Meaning is an interpretation of material change. Although it depends on material change, it is not the result of matter alone. The relationship between mind and body is like the relationship between music and strings, and pain and needle pricks. We can say that in one conscious thought the whole is mind, and in one moment of unconsciousness the whole body is matter.

### Anecdotes from the Academic World (XII)

— Zhang Qiyun

Regionalism

At the end of the First World War, the Allied Powers largely accepted President Wilson's proposal. On January 8, 1918, Wilson attended both houses of Congress, detailing the war aims, divided into fourteen articles, namely the historically famous Fourteen Points, the fourteenth of which was the organization of the League of Nations. "Its purpose is for countries to mutually guarantee political freedom and territorial integrity, regardless of size, all enjoying equal protection." The various provisions of the Paris Peace Conference, although sometimes taking other considerations into account, were generally based on this principle to determine the territorial allocation of European countries. Therefore, post-World War I Europe was composed of many nation-states, many of which were small and sparsely populated. At that time, the emphasis was on national rights rather than regional interests. Looking back at Europe from 1919 to 1939, this experiment of emphasizing small and weak nation-states can be said to have failed. It is a universally recognized fact that small and weak nations have no ability to defend themselves. We do not deny the contributions of small countries to the world, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, which are prominent examples. However, small countries are, after all, small countries, and it is impossible for them to stand on an equal footing with powerful countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union. Based on past experience, in order to enable all nations to be independent and free and have ample opportunities for development, the idea of regionalism emerged with the tide of World War II.

The trend of moving from small to large is one of the new trends in the world. A world government is not something that can be achieved overnight. Economic regions or geographical boundaries, located between nations and the world, can serve as a preliminary step in promoting great unity. Regional organizations and the organization of the United Nations are actually mutually supportive and do not conflict with each other. The United Nations is like the first line of defense, and regional organizations are the second line of defense. If the first line of defense is lost, one can retreat to the second line of defense. Regionalism had already begun to sprout after World War I. At that time, European writers had the idea of a European international society, aimed at eliminating disputes between countries. They observed that the development of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was an inevitable trend. Comparing it to China, China's territory is larger than Europe, and China has long been a unified country. Why can't Europe be? However, the era of the League of Nations was the height of small countries, and such ideas were not valued. After the outbreak of World War II, there were many writings on European federation. Practical politicians also made serious suggestions. In September 1946, Churchill, in a speech in Zurich, Switzerland, called this new structure the United States of Europe, jointly led by Germany and France. He advocated the speedy establishment of a new, disarmed Germany to jointly assume responsibility for leading Europe with France. At present, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly tense. It is still unknown in what form the international society of Europe will appear. We only see that on one side there is the Communist International of Eastern Europe, and on the other side there is the Marshall Plan of Western Europe, with strict barriers and mutual hostility. But from a distance, isn't it an important step towards a European federation? Regionalism also has some that have already been realized, such as the Arab League, which is a good example. The alliance is a new combination of Middle Eastern Islamic countries (including Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Arabia, Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan, etc.) and has become a diplomatic unit in international politics. According to the Middle East region, the oil fields and strategic relations are the places where the forces of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union come into contact. If the Islamic countries can truly implement mutual assistance and unanimously resist foreign countries, they may become a stabilizing factor. Regional organizations are part of the world security system. If they can focus on protecting the territory and the people, producing and building, it is hoped that the sources of chaos in various regions of the world can be eliminated.

### Explanation of Lao Tzu's "Gate of All Marvels" and "Gate of the Mysterious Female"

— Yan Qun

Lao Tzu says in Chapter One: "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth; named, the mother of all things. Therefore, constantly without desire, to observe its subtleties; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries. These two are the same, but diverge in name. The same is called profound; profound and profound, the gate of all subtleties." In Chapter Six, he says: "The valley spirit never dies, is called the mysterious female. The gate of the mysterious female is the root of heaven and earth." This can be called the "Gate of All Marvels," the "Gate of the Mysterious Female," which is where Lao Tzu speaks of the "Tao." Legalists rarely understand this for certain and often get a glimpse of its secrets. Regardless of my own ignorance, I will explain it as follows, to be scrutinized by scholars.

"Can be told" means can be spoken. "Eternal" means "independent," "unchanging," and "unerring"; in modern terms, "independent" means absolute, "unchanging" means immutable, and "unerring" means without error. "Eternal Tao" possesses these three virtues, so it is the Tao of all Tao (i.e., the Tao scattered among all things), which is also the true source of all Tao. The many Tao are "not the eternal Tao." "Not the eternal Tao" is partial, while "Eternal Tao" is complete. What can be spoken is "not the eternal Tao," because it can be thought about. Thinking is the act of comparison. The act of thinking arises from comparing one partial Tao with another. "Eternal Tao" is the completeness of Tao, beyond which there is no Tao, that is, everything is in everything else, so what else can it be compared with? Must it compare with itself? Comparing with itself is not comparison. Since there is nothing to compare, it cannot be thought about; what cannot be thought about cannot be spoken, because speaking is the manifestation of thought in words. "Can be named" means can be given a name. The name that can be given a name is "not the eternal name," therefore it is said, "The name that can be named is not the eternal name." Because "Eternal Name" must be correct, why? Because "name" is used to point; pointing is pointing to something, and not pointing to something else. If pointing and not pointing exist, there must be a distinction between one and the other. If "Eternal" is everything in everything else, there can be no distinction between one and the other, so there is nothing to point to, and there is no use for "name"; therefore, to say "name" and call it "Eternal" is redundant. "Origin of heaven and earth" means before the creation of the universe. Before the creation of the universe, everything was "mixed into one," with no use for names, therefore it is said, "Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth." The unified body of the Tao was divided, and then all things were born; once they are called "many," they need to be distinguished and pointed out, otherwise, they would all be merged back into one, therefore it is said, "Named, the mother of all things."

"Without desire" means without prayer; "subtleties" is tiny and subtle. What is tiny and subtle cannot be perceived by the senses, it is the Tao beyond form. "With desire" means with prayer. "Boundaries" sounds similar to "distinct" and "clear," and may be a variant of "clear" (Chapter 14 says, "Its upper part is not clear, its lower part is not obscure"). "Clear" means to clarify, clarity means material things or events below form; because the boundaries between each other are clear only when there is division, and division arises from prayer. Without prayer, one can confirm the subtle Tao beyond form, because it "circulates everywhere without error," encompassing everything without exception. With prayer, one can see the clear boundaries of things below form, what is prayed for here must not be prayed for there; therefore it is said, "Therefore, constantly without desire, to observe its subtleties; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries." "These two" refers to "without desire" and "with desire"; "These two are the same" means "without desire" and "with desire" both belong to this unified body of the Tao: without prayer, one is without prayer within this body of the Tao; with prayer, one is with prayer within this body of the Tao. The body of the Tao is one and only one, so they are "the same." "But diverge in name" means that this body of the Tao is called "without desire," "with desire," "nameless," "named," because of the presence or absence of prayer and division. "Without" and "with" are different names, but in reality, they are the same body of the Tao. "The same" is the "Tao" above form, "the different" is the "tool" below form: (i.e., so-called "things and events") "Tools" are many and "Tao" is one, "Tools" are complex and "Tao" is simple, "Tools" are scattered and "Tao" is total. The reason why "Tao" is one, simple, and total is because of its profundity; the reason why "Tools" are many, complex, and scattered is because of their detail. "Profound" means hanging, "hanging" means suspended, not limited to form. Only "Tao" can be "profound," and only "profound" is "the same," because it can be one, simple, and total. "Tools" are many, complex, and scattered. One "Tao" can encompass many "Tools," so "Tools" are different and "Tao" is the same. However, this "Tao" encompasses some and not others, this is the many Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao." "Not the eternal Tao" is called "profound" because it can encompass many "Tools." However, there are still degrees of profundity, so there is "profound" above "profound," to the point that it reaches its limit. Then the many profundities all return to the same, therefore it is called "the gate of all subtleties." "Subtleties" means tiny and subtle, tiny and subtle means "profound," the Tao above form; "all subtleties" means all of these, the so-called "not the eternal Tao." "Gate" is "eternal Tao," "eternal Tao" encompasses all "not the eternal Tao" and is what they all point to, therefore it is called "gate."

"Valley" means emptiness, "spirit" means endlessly responsive, "never dies" means inexhaustible. These three virtues are encompassed by the "mysterious female," therefore it is said, "is called the mysterious female." "Mysterious" means suspended, "female" means empty; only the suspended and empty can be a valley, can be spiritual, can never die, only "Tao" is sufficient for this. However, the Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao," also possesses these three virtues; for example, the Tao of gravity does not depend (add explanation, same below) on any one falling object, is it not empty? It encompasses all falling events, is it not inexhaustible? Its encompassing of falling events does not fail, without error (i.e., without exception), is it not unyielding? However, this Tao's response to things ends with falling events, other events cannot reach it, so it is finite; it does not depend on any one falling object, but is limited to all falling events, so it is dependent; regarding all falling events it does not fail without error, but other events are not like this, so it is unyielding. It can be seen that the Tao scattered among all things, the so-called "not the eternal Tao," has not yet reached the full extent of the "mysterious female's" abilities. What fully reaches the extent of the "mysterious female's" abilities is only the Tao of the many Tao, the so-called "eternal Tao." "Eternal Tao" is what "not the eternal Tao" points to, therefore it is called "the gate of the mysterious female; "the gate of the mysterious female" means: Great Profundity is what all profundities come from. Therefore it is said, "Eternal Tao" is Great Profundity, it is the source of all subtleties and profundities, this is called "the root of heaven and earth."

### Advantages and Disadvantages

— Ji Mo

I do not intend to play with the mysterious theory that "advantages are disadvantages, and disadvantages are advantages," or the game of words; however, nothing in the world is entirely advantageous or entirely disadvantageous.

For example, gambling is often criticized by righteous gentlemen, who say that it indulges in frivolity and is extremely harmful. However, according to a friend who loves to play "Russian Poker," getting a good hand has good ways to play, and getting a bad hand also has bad ways to play. It seems to train the virtues of "decisiveness" and "calmness."

Also, being punctual can give a good impression and increase work efficiency, but in an extreme example, as recorded in this article about the beginning and end of Yamamoto Fifty-Six's death, he was shot down by Allied aircraft because he was punctual.

Speaking of Yamamoto Fifty-Six, it reminds me that Japan's defeat this time was initially very unfavorable to it, but now it seems that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I was listening to singing programs from Tokyo on overseas radio programs. Although I couldn't understand what they were singing, the tone was sonorous and vigorous, which was different from the current popular "decadent music." Although we cannot say for sure what this music symbolizes, Japan, under MacArthur's control, seems to be on the rise.

As for personal views on advantages and disadvantages, they vary from person to person. When everyone is frowning and worrying about the price of rice, one gentleman in the audience alone has a complacent look. Later, after asking around, I learned that this gentleman owns a rice store. The advantages and disadvantages of the world should all be viewed in this way.

### Idle Talk about Devout Men and Women

— Nian Hong

Shanghai was originally a complex city, where contradictions could be found everywhere. Even on Nanjing Road, where people are bustling and cars are weaving, there are large companies and hotels, with flourishing businesses and a magnificent scene. However, in contrast, there is also the Baoshan Temple, where many people burn incense and seek divination every day, crowded and unbearable. When it is some Bodhisattva's birthday or memorial day, the scene is even more grand. Devout men and women squeeze in, just like buying household rice during the enemy-puppet period, and they can't see the shadow of the Buddha for a long time. They often have to make do with burning some ingots and candles and kowtowing in front of the door gods and heavenly generals to fulfill their wishes.

In fact, having Baoshan Temple on Nanjing Road is not necessarily a laughing stock for the West, otherwise it may be sealed off because it hinders the appearance of the city and affects international views. Because in recent years, although Catholicism and Christianity have also spread in China, they are ultimately not as numerous and deeply rooted as Buddhist believers. Therefore, temples in the city are "abnormally prosperous," just like there are churches and cathedrals standing in foreign metropolises, symbolizing the beauty of religious architecture. Not only that, it also shows the traditional religious freedom of the ancient Eastern country - one of the most free "freedoms" for Chinese people.

Not only is Baoshan Temple doing well, but the New City God Temple, the Old City God Temple, Jing'an Temple, Qingliang Temple, and all the large and small temples, including whatever Guans and whatever Palaces, all seem to have good incomes and thriving incense. In a year when the economy is unstable and the market is not prosperous, it is often heard around the New Year's Eve that some large companies have insufficient turnover, some large factories have suspended operations, and some large stores have closed down. But there has never been news that some temple has been unable to make ends meet due to huge expenses. If anything, I only remember that not long ago, there were two monks who had a lawsuit over the temple property they were in charge of. From this, we can infer that it is better for our minority ethnic capitalist families who are desperately supporting some small-scale light industries with investment to close their doors and rebuild their factories as temples. Judging by the prosperity of the Bodhisattva in front of the racecourse, the profit is 120% guaranteed.

Most people's belief in religion still stems from a selfish point of view. The first type is like Jiangyang bandits, who often make vows to the Bodhisattva before preparing to commit a crime. Speculators pray silently, saying that if the Bodhisattva blesses their speculation to succeed, they will definitely rebuild the statue with gold. In such cases, to put it harshly, they simply treat the clay and wooden statues of gods as objects to share the loot. It is said that Buddhist doctrine prohibits the use of ill-gotten wealth, but the colorful gold and incense candles on many gods and Bodhisattvas mostly carry a bloody smell. The second type is when people have no way out and can't go to heaven or enter the earth, then they think of the Bodhisattva and God. For example, people who are disheartened with all worldly affairs often chant scriptures and recite Buddha's name to spend the rest of their lives. Westerners shouting God in times of crisis and Chinese people chanting Guanshiyin in times of crisis can be said to come from the same mentality. But whether they are believers of the first or second type, they are simply gamblers who are betting their lives and pitiful bugs who have no way out. The so-called "devout men and women" are just like that.

From this point of view, it is easy to imagine the outline and content of this society when looking at the devout men and women crowded inside and outside the temples.

### Lamp Wick

— Hu Yahui

While reading an old book under the lamp, I suddenly found a thin white lamp wick.

I can't remember why this lamp wick was stuck in the book. The old book was brought from the countryside. I suppose it was casually taken from under the lamp when people still used rapeseed oil lamps in the countryside and used as a bookmark? -- This lamp wick has been around for many years.

Looking closely at the lamp wick, it is still thin, long, and white as ever, without any damage. It must be the lamp wick's good fortune to be kept in a book, retaining its original appearance.

Rapeseed oil lamps have long been discarded, and lamp wicks are also about to disappear. Being able to accidentally find it in a book today is like meeting an old friend, and I feel very close. It was my good companion for many years, and under its light, I finished reading many books and gained many inspirations.

But now that kerosene lamps and electric lights are used, it is no longer valued. With the renewal of the times, it has fallen behind. Therefore, I feel sad for it. It also burned itself to give off light, shining on every corner and shining on people's eyes; even now it can still give off light, and in the darkness, it is still people's savior. Have people forgotten it? Or has it failed people? I am angry and indignant for it! I plead for it!

Writing this, I remember a poem about lamp wicks made by someone. I will write it down now as the ending of this short article: "Endowed with a light and gentle nature, holding itself white like autumn frost, but able to make the world bright, going into fire and boiling water is no obstacle." (Written to commemorate Teacher Xu)

### Casual Talk About Rockets

— Mao Yi

Rockets are called "child prodigies" in this war. If this were really the case, then George Bernard Shaw would only be considered a budding writer, and Albert Einstein would be just a promising young scientist. We do not deny the importance of rocket weapons; we also do not doubt that future rockets will carry humans to any corner of the Earth, or even to another planet. However, we find it difficult to silently acknowledge that rockets are the "child prodigies" nurtured by 20th-century science. This is because the British were already using rocket weapons in the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.

The accuracy of rockets has never been well established. Therefore, when someone attached special equipment to the tail nozzle of rockets two years ago, causing them to rotate and improve accuracy, scientists unanimously praised it as an "unprecedented invention." Indeed, rotating rockets are a significant improvement. But is this an unprecedented innovation? No, we should not forget that rotating rockets were already exerting their power in the Mexican War a hundred years ago.

In 1805, when Napoleon dominated Europe and wanted to turn his attention to invading Britain, Sir William Congreve's war rockets shattered his dreams. These rockets destroyed Boulogne near Paris in 1806, and a year later, destroyed Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, preventing Napoleon from crossing the Strait due to the need to defend his rear. Later, rockets were also used by the British army to attack the French fleet: in Koge, Danzig, and the Battle of Leipzig, rockets also demonstrated their power.

When the War of 1812 broke out between Britain and the United States, there was a rocket brigade in the British army, which defeated the Maryland militia in Bladensburg, allowing them to directly attack Washington City. In the battle for Fort McHenry, the British also used rockets to gain an advantage.

However, Congreve's rockets were still immature weapons. They were unsafe and completely undirected. At the time, each rocket was tied to a fifteen-foot pole to direct it in an approximate correct direction. They had advantages, but also many limitations. Many countries were engaged in improving rockets. In 1846, William Hale, an American, invented the first rotating rocket, solving the problem of accuracy. He used the heat generated by the rocket itself to obliquely spray onto the three curved wings at the tail, causing the rocket to rotate in flight. Rotating rockets had a much higher hit rate than early rockets.

After official testing by the U.S. military, Hale's rockets began to be manufactured at the Washington Arsenal. At that time, there were two sizes, one with a diameter the same as the current U.S. military's Bazooka recoilless rifle; the larger one was one inch larger in diameter and had a range of 2,200 yards. To use this new weapon, the United States organized a rocket corps. They soon participated in the Mexican War. One group landed in Veracruz, and another helped attack Chapultepec Castle near the capital of Mexico. Due to the smooth military progress, the rocket corps' reputation grew. Unfortunately, military authorities were only enthusiastic about celebrating victories and forgot to record the effectiveness of the rockets themselves.

Therefore, we say that rockets are not a new invention, and rotating rockets are not a new gadget either. Tracing back even further, William Congreve's rockets were actually imitating the Indians. In the Anglo-Indian wars of the late 18th century, the Indian army used rockets more than once to counterattack the British army. This news reached London, and the success of the Indian rocket corps of the Prince of Mysore stimulated Congreve, making him a famous arms dealer in the early 19th century. And who can say for sure that rockets were born in India two centuries ago? Perhaps it has an even longer history! Therefore, I do not admit that rockets are a new invention of the 20th century, although modern rockets are more ingenious, refined, and effective than ancient ones.

### Xiaoyao Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (92)

Qiwan saw that he spoke very calmly and elegantly. In this boring and depressing situation, being able to have such a good guest was enough to break the silence. So, the two of them leaned against the railing and discussed their experiences on stage and screen, enjoying the conversation more and more. They talked for several hours before returning to the house. Qiwan felt that this man was romantic and suave, even better than Zhu Zhai. For a person who is extremely bored, the sudden arrival of a stimulating friend who relieves their depression and comforts them with words will leave a lasting impression on their mind. Qiwan had been depressed and listless for days, but today's conversation with Daoyun rekindled the embers in her heart, making her feel that a person cannot be confined to one place in society but must travel around and seek their own survival. This time, she had been so angry that she tried to commit suicide by swallowing gold. If she had died then, society might not have sympathized with her, and might even have added negative criticism to her. Now that she thought about it, this action was too reckless and ignorant. Just now, she heard Daoyun talk about the situation in the Shanghai theater world. If she was willing to perform in Shanghai, she might be able to make a name for herself. Why should she stay in Beijing all the time? Changing the environment would also make her feel mentally happy. Qiwan thought about this and wanted to go to Daoyun's ward to discuss it in detail, but since they had just met today, it seemed inappropriate to go to his ward at night. At the same time, she thought that Daoyun's words and actions were somewhat like Zhu Zhai, and talking to him was interesting. He had been working in the film industry for many years and had extensive experience, and discussing art with him would also be beneficial to her. That night, Qiwan lay in bed, tossing and turning, thinking for a while, and then fell asleep. When she woke up early the next morning, she soon heard a light knock on the door outside. Qiwan said "Please come in" from inside the room, and Daoyun pushed the door open in response. She saw that he had taken off the white hospital gown that the hospital had given him and put on a very beautiful Western suit, which made him look even more handsome and suave. As soon as he entered the door, he bowed to Qiwan and said with a slight smile, "So Miss Gu is already up. I came to the hospital early this morning, and when I didn't see Miss Gu come out, I thought you were not feeling well, so I came to visit you." Qiwan smiled and said, "I'm not feeling unwell, but I didn't sleep well last night, so I woke up late today." Daoyun said, "I also went to sleep very late yesterday." As he said this, he looked at Qiwan, and Qiwan felt that his words seemed to imply something, and her face could not help but blush slightly. She really wanted to tell him that she had thought about going to his room to talk last night, but it was just inconvenient to say so.

### Xia Yu Is Not a Worm Anymore

— Sun He

Professor Gu Jiegang is an authority on ancient Chinese history. Many of his works contain surprising arguments. He used a skeptical eye to look at all the classics, and more than twenty years ago issued the conclusion that "Wan (夏) is a worm."

The academic community once caused many people to be surprised. Some people questioned the skepticism, and some people thought that Mr. Gu's statement was absurd and made a stern satire. Lu Xun was one of them, which once stimulated Mr. Gu and made him furious. He wrote a letter to Lu Xun, who was teaching at Sun Yat-sen University, asking him not to leave Guangzhou, because he thought it was a great insult and was waiting for him to file a lawsuit and open the trial. In the end, Mr. Lu Xun did not obey and wait, but just returned a satire and left. Mr. Gu did not proceed with the lawsuit, otherwise, it would have been a good story in the history of academic affairs to go to court for academic differences.

Ten years after Lu Xun's death (the 34th year of the Republic of China), we found the following paragraph in the editorial of the special issue of ancient history of the Literature and History magazine edited by Mr. Gu Yigang in Chongqing—

Our ancient history felt that the literature of the Xia and Yin dynasties was insufficient in the time of Confucius. By the time of Confucius, even the literature of the Western Zhou dynasty was felt to be insufficient. Therefore, if we want to study the historical facts of ancient times, we cannot rely solely on a few books. We can only devote ourselves to archaeology and work hard to excavate relics underground, just like the British people's study of ancient Egyptian history. Relics are certainly also fragmented, but they are always physical objects of that time and are direct materials, unlike ancient books, which have undergone many transcriptions and re-editions and have many later trivial problems. Many relics have been discovered in the past forty years. As long as we are patient and carefully explore the relics themselves, we may be able to build a system with our imagination. (Omission in the middle) However, judging from the relics we have already excavated, we can only explore the history of the Yin and Shang dynasties. We still feel very confused about the Xia kingdom. Although the existence of Xia is undoubtedly unquestionable, the history of Xia is not easy to start. Many steel tools have been unearthed, but none of them are from Xia. Many ancient characters have been discovered, but none of them were written by the Xia people. Since there is no bronze ware, are they still stuck in the Neolithic Age? Since there is no Xia writing, is there no writing at that time, or has it not yet been discovered? When we mention these questions, we are really very confused. There is insufficient literature and no relics exist, so we cannot speculate out of thin air. Therefore, as of now, our ancient history can only be written from the Yin and Shang dynasties. The historical events before the Shang dynasty still need to be searched for by archaeologists who continue to work hard.

Although Mr. Gu used Confucius's saying in the Analects, "I can speak of the Xia ritual, but the state of Qi is not enough to prove it," to show that the "one worm" theory was not too absurd, he still had some regrets about his "early work," and after all, he denied the past practice of studying only old papers without relying on physical objects. Moreover, he affirmed that "the existence of Xia is already undoubtedly unquestionable" and repeatedly admitted his "ignorance" of Xia history, without any intention of concealing his mistakes. This progressive spirit in scholarship is worthy of special mention. Mr. Gu would probably laugh at himself for the lawsuit he wanted to file back then.

### A Money-Worshipping Society

— Yun Gong

In the countless European and American novels that I have read, one that I read more than a decade ago has left a particularly deep impression on me. The general idea is that a wealthy man, Mr. A, in order to test the fickleness of the world, deliberately put on a tattered cloak and attended a certain banquet. The guests at the meeting cast contemptuous glances at him and subjected him to ridicule. However, he slowly took off his cloak, revealing that the clothes underneath were brand new and the accessories he was wearing were worth the entire city. As a result, everyone rushed to flatter him, reversing their original "long faces."

This novel is naturally intended to satirize the world, and I am afraid that there may not be such a real event. However, the detestable aspect of a money-worshipping society lies in this, and the lovely aspect also lies in this.

In small ways, as long as your clothes are neatly pressed and your leather shoes are shiny, you will be respected and welcomed everywhere, whether you are riding the streetcar or buying things. The ticket seller will never glare at you and push you, saying, "Where's the ticket?" He will definitely say, "Sir, do you have a ticket?"

A friend, Mr. So-and-so, even talked to me about a small incident of buying pepper. It turned out that my friend suddenly had a whim to eat noodles one day. After the noodles were cooked, he suddenly wanted to eat pepper, so he strolled to a pharmacy at the corner of the street and asked the shop assistant to buy 5,000 yuan of pepper. The shop assistant glanced at his unkempt clothes and said coldly, "Buy from 10,000 yuan!" As a result, Mr. So-and-so, wearing a one-carat diamond ring, waved 5,000 yuan in banknotes at him and refused to buy it out of anger.

It is said that the Cubans in South America regard clothes as their first life, and diet comes second. A Cuban with a snow-white shirt and shiny hair may not have a full stomach. In this money-worshipping society, Cubans seem to be something that cannot be done but can be done.

### Connected Words

— Chen Xuexueyuan

Modern scholars attach great importance to folk literature, and often gain significant harvests from "unadorned" texts. Yesterday, I read Shen Bao (25) again and got a wonderful couplet, which has more research value than General Li's masterpiece in Hong Kong (24). The spring couplet of the recluse in Xi'an is "Our housing is too expensive," "and the rent is going to increase fourteen times," and the plaque is the three characters "Cannot afford to live," which is also a kind of complaining. I think the viewers may think it is a vulgar saying, and even if they sympathize with his "injustice," they will definitely laugh at the production of this couplet.

However, this kind of couplet can indeed represent a part of "folk literature" and can provide a reference for Chinese and Western literary organizations.

The first thing to pay attention to is that the number of words in these two sentences is the same, and they are posted on both sides, with a neat and parallel shape, which already has the basic conditions of a couplet. The second thing to note is that the words in his upper and lower sentences are not opposite at all, and they do not constitute the main condition (parallel sentences) of a couplet, but he uses another unnecessary condition (rhyme) as the element of completing the weaving of the couplet. This is naturally a mistake. A couplet is a kind of "parallel sentence," not "rhyme," and "rhyme" cannot be used as a substitute for "parallelism," so the rhyme between "expensive (貴)" and "times (倍)" is meaningless, needless to say. But in his view, in addition to "the number of words being equal," "the sound and rhyme are also coordinated," so "rhyme" is also considered to be an additional element of composition, and he is satisfied.

Although it is unreasonable to use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," it cannot be "laughed off," and it must be admitted that there is a reason for this kind of unparallel couplet. Now let's analyze it from the perspectives of "folk" and "Western translation":

Novels, imposters, and random play scripts are all popular works and public appreciations. There is a so-called "reading couplets" in random plays, that is, non-opposite couplets, which often use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," such as the evil village schoolmaster Ye Tianli reading the first sentence: "Cheng Guan is like a bird in a cage," Wu Tianqiu reads the second sentence "Let him insert his wings and it is difficult to escape"; such as Qionglin Banquet Nao Fu Ge Dengyun reads the first sentence "Ge Hu will go this time and do not regret it," Ge Hu answers the second sentence "Be sure to see blood with a steel knife." This is called "going off stage couplet," which is read when people on the stage are about to go off stage to end the performance. (The above is read by two people, if there is only one person on the stage, he can also read two sentences by himself. It can also be used in the middle stage and on stage, which will not be listed here.) And in novels, at the end of a stage, such as "Treading through iron shoes without finding it," "It's all effortless to get it," are all of this kind. The upper and lower sentences do not "parallel" but rhyme, and that is considered a "couplet." There are also some that "parallel" and also "rhyme," such as "Planning to capture the jade rabbit in the moon," "Planning to capture the golden island in the day"; such as "Treading through the sky and flying a colorful phoenix," "Suddenly opening the golden lock and walking a dragon" which is both opposed and the two sentences have the same meaning, which is "clapping hands," which is also a lower grade in parallel sentences. However, in the manufacturing technology of the people, parallelism is actually more difficult than rhyme. Being able to parallel is also a rough way of paralleling. If you can't parallel, use "rhyme" to make it up. If even the "plaque" can't be done well, then just having the same number of words is considered good, such as "Full of heart and abdomen," "Everything is unsaid," also called "couplet." From this, the following conclusions can be obtained:

(1) A mood, using words to express to the public, is best to post it out in the form of a couplet, which is based on natural requirements. The square single-syllable Chinese language is a very readily available good condition.

(2) The upper and lower sentences have the same number of words, and they are posted out on the left and right, then they have the qualification of a couplet.

(3) It is best if the whole body can be matched into a parallel sentence. If it is really not parallel, then use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," which is considered to be an extra layer of production effort.

Secondly, let's talk about Western translation. There are many Chinese works translated into Western languages. Because the square single-syllable characters are incompatible with the syllabic spelling characters of the couplet, the work of translation is not only difficult, but also some important places are fundamentally impossible. The most obvious is the parallel sentence, such as Liao Zhai Zhi Yi's

With flowers and wine, spring is always here,

Without moon and lamp, the moon is bright by itself.

What a scene it is to translate such groups of paired upper and lower sentences into Western words of unequal length is not difficult to predict. But the translator seems to have a way. The English translation of these two sentences in Liao Zhai is:

With wine and flowers we chase the hours,

In one eternal Spring;

No moon no light to cheer the night,

Thyself that ray must bring．

It becomes a very good short poem, full of "rhyme," the sentence is "rhyming," Jian is "alliteration," melodious and easy to read. Although the rhyme is full, it is impossible to match it into a parallel sentence. Although it is not a parallel sentence, the upper and lower sentences are divided into four lines of different lengths, which are roughly even, and that's all that can be done. Its painstaking efforts are similar to those of our people who use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism," which can be said to be the same disease and sympathy. Our people use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism" because people's writing level is not enough, or they have not used the mind of parallel sentences at all. Westerners use "rhyme" instead of "parallelism" because their words have no possibility of parallelism at all. What they call Couplet only needs two sentences (or words) whose meanings and forms seem to become a "pair," but they can never have a couplet, and their Couplet cannot be divided or suspended, such as the style of Chinese door couplets and cooperative posts.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

A wife who is not virtuous causes trouble for her husband. Separating and going their separate ways.

Xu Yongjian: When I was ten years old, I was introduced to marry a woman surnamed Zhang from the same village as a child bride. We got married in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. At first, we were still harmonious, but later, due to family difficulties, I was often insulted by Zhang. Later, I came to Shanghai for employment and still sent money back home every month. Unexpectedly, Zhang took advantage of a small amount of money to be unable to make a living, so she spent it arbitrarily and even attempted to abscond. I was forced to discuss with her parents and divorced in the 28th year. All the divorce procedures were handled by my maternal grandmother, Zhao. Zhang's parents issued a receipt and were willing to pay one hundred and ten yuan to settle the matter. Now there are legal questions, please give me an answer: (1) Is the letter of divorce signed by the maternal grandmother on behalf of her valid in law? (2) How to handle the legal procedures? (3) The receipt issued by Zhang has been lost. How can it be remedied? (4) If I marry another woman, does the other party have the right to interfere? (5) If there is a lawsuit between the parties, can letters be used as evidence for prosecution? (6) If Zhang remarries and raises children, can she testify?

[Lawyer Fu Kuang's answer] (1) Zhao's signature on behalf of the divorce agreement is valid if she is authorized to do so. (2) The two parties should invite more than three witnesses to re-establish a divorce agreement. (3) The loss of the receipt only needs to be proven in fact, and there will be no problem. (4) The divorce procedure is complete and marrying another person is not restricted. (5) The letter is only sufficient to prove that there is such a fact and is irrelevant to the case. (6) The adulterous spouse has already remarried and has ten daughters and is no longer involved.

### On Behalf of the Post Office

It is hereby approved that the Social Service Section of the Editorial Department of Shen Bao transferred to us a letter from your office to the editor of the newspaper on February 19 of this year regarding inquiries about postal exchange rates. In order to serve and facilitate the public, the post office has been reducing the exchange rate as much as possible. Recently, the exchange rates of various banks have generally been high, especially for remittances to Fujian and Guangdong. The post office has had to refer to the bank rates to charge exchange fees to avoid difficulties in payment. However, the exchange rates in various places change at any time. The letter stated: "The post office has raised the exchange rate for remittances to various places in South China (Fujian and Guangdong) so high, some places as high as 18 percent." I plan to indicate the date of payment, the amount of remittance, the bill number, the name of the issuing bureau, and the name of the paying bureau to the bureau for investigation. If there is any overcharge of exchange fees, the overcharged exchange fees will be refunded in full, and the responsible personnel will be punished. As for the family funds and children's education expenses of service personnel of public and private institutions, according to the regulations of the Joint Head Office of the Four Banks of China, only this bureau and other branches of the bureau in various places can handle them, and post offices in various places do not handle them. A corresponding letter is replied, and I hope you will check it. To Mr. Shizhou Postal Reserve Gold Exchange Bureau
