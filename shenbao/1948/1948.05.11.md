### First Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan; Decides to Establish a Committee to Draft Rules of Procedure

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Legislative Yuan, established under the constitution, held its first preparatory meeting on the 10th. After the meeting was called to order with a bell at 9:30 am, Wu Tiecheng, the chairman of the preparatory office, first reported that the total number of members was 773, with 442 registered and 346 present, which was sufficient for a quorum. He then said that the candidate for the temporary chairman was still planned to be rotated according to age. This meeting should be chaired by Fei Youjun, a member from Sichuan. However, some members expressed disagreement with this method, believing that the chairman should be alert and perceptive, and that the elderly might not be up to the task. In the end, Wu was publicly recommended to take the position. Wu repeatedly declined without success, and then presided over the meeting. Then, there was a deadlock and debate over the decision of the candidate for the temporary secretary-general. Some advocated that the temporary chairman should nominate and the general assembly should decide, while others advocated that the general assembly should elect on its own. Some people supported Li Zheng, who was fluent in the national language, and some supported Lou Tongsun, who was experienced. After a vote, Lou was elected with 212 votes (317 members present). Starting at 10:10 am, Chairman Wu announced the start of the discussion on the "Drafting Rules of Procedure" proposal. Mei Zuozhou, Chen Guda, Zhang Jinjian, Tan Tiwu, Wu Wangji, Zhang Po等人 and 10 others spoke successively. Except for one or two members who advocated that the general assembly or the preparatory office should draft it, most believed that a drafting committee should be established. After a 15-minute break at 11:00 am, Chen Bosheng proposed to put the opinion of establishing a "Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee" to a vote, which was approved by 266 people (302 members present). As for the generation of members, according to Zhong Tianxin's suggestion, the opinions of the meeting were put to a vote. As a result, with the approval of 287 people, it was decided that each unit should nominate one person. The unit for the election of members was a unit, and with the approval of 210 people, the nomination was carried out in the meeting place. Zhang Dao等人 and others proposed to discuss the last item of the agenda, "Drafting the Method for Mutual Election of President and Vice President", but it did not receive the support of the meeting due to insufficient time. The proposal was postponed to the next preparatory meeting for further discussion. At 11:55 am, Chairman Wu announced the extension of the meeting time and dismissed the meeting, allowing each unit to gather separately to conduct nominations. The entire venue was transformed into smaller units. Within 15 minutes, each unit completed the meeting, and the general assembly was reopened. The temporary secretary-general, Lou Tongsun, reported that among the election units, except for the border minorities, overseas Chinese, Xikang, Qingdao, Liaoning, and Mixia, six units were not elected due to the small number of people present. The remaining 59 units elected "Members of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee". The results are as follows: Chen Haicheng from Jiangsu, Lou Tongsun from Zhejiang, Zhang Qingzhen from Anhui, Peng Chunshi from Jiangxi, Yang Qing from Hubei, Dai Xiujun from Hunan, Li Boshen from Sichuan, Liu Jiaju from the Tibetan ethnic group in Xikang, Wang Bingjun from Hebei, Du Guangxun from Shandong, Deng Lihao from Shanxi, Zhang Jinjian from Henan, Chen Guyuan from Shaanxi, Yang Jiji from Gansu, Zhao Pei from Qinghai, Liu Tong from Fujian, Huang Guoshu from Taiwan, Zheng Yanfen from Guangdong, Lei Yin from Guangdong, Dou Zijin from Yunnan, Zhouzhou Song Shuqiao, Andong Liu Butong, Liaobei Hong Sheng, Jilin Li Xien, Songjiang Li Feng, Hejiang Liu Minghou, Heilongjiang Du Xun, Nenjiang Yi Yuehu, Hinggan Zhao Xianwen, Rehe Cheng Fengyi, Chahar Dong Guanxian, Suiyuan Zheng Zhihou, Xinjiang Hua Shengmu, Nanjing Hu Chanyu, Shanghai Wang Xinheng, Beiping Wu Zhuren, Tianjin Wen Shiyuan, Chongqing Bao Huaguo, Dalian Mu Chao, Harbin Sun Guijie, Guangzhou Wu Shangying, Hankou Fei Xia, Shenyang Hu Gengnian, Xi'an Yang Daqian, Mongolia Li Yongxin, Tibet Ji Jinmei, Fishing Group Xu Pan Yun, Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association Qin, Western Medicine Practitioners Association Yu Songyun, Teachers Group Zhou Hongjing, Education Association Ye Suchong, Farmers Association Wu Wangji, Labor Union Lu Jingshi, Lawyers Association Fang Jida, Journalists Association Chen Bosheng, Business Group Zhu Huiqing, Technician Farmer-Miner Zou Shuwen, Industrial and Mining Industry Guo Zhengjiajun. Finally, Chairman Wu announced: The date of the drafting committee meeting will be notified by the temporary secretariat, and the second preparatory meeting will be held on the morning of the 11th. The meeting adjourned at 12:20 pm.

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold the second preparatory meeting on the morning of the 11th to continue the discussion on the "Drafting Method for Mutual Election of President and Vice President" proposal.

### Bandits Quietly Leave Islands Near Jinshanwei

National Army's Strict Defense Leaves No Room for Exploitation

[Our News] Taixu Mountain and Baishan, two small islands about 60 li northeast of Jin Sinangju (a coastal town on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces) in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, less than 100 kilometers from Shanghai, were once occupied by Communist bandits at dawn on the 8th of this month. The bandits arrived by eight large sailing ships from the sea in eastern Zhejiang. There were about a thousand people, carrying various guns and weapons. Their designation was the "East China Guerrilla Column of the People's Liberation Army". The bandit leader's surname was Wu, and his name is unknown. It is rumored that he was a former subordinate of Zhang Dapeng. It is speculated that they intended to take the opportunity to land on the beach between Zhapu and Jinshanwei. Upon receiving the report, the Pinghu County government immediately telegraphed the Jiaxing First District Security Command to report the警報 alarm. The command immediately dispatched a company of security troops from Wuxing and Jiaxing to Pinghu, and contacted the Jiangsu Third District Security Command.

In the afternoon of the 9th, Deputy Commander Li Yingchang personally led troops to search the coast. Jiaxing also concentrated four companies of troops to prepare to attack at any time. Yu Shuluan, the commissioner of the First District, rushed from Wuxing to Jiaxing on the evening of the 9th to sit镇 center. The Communist bandits on the island learned that there were precautions, so they quietly retreated. Yesterday, people were sent to investigate again, and there was no one on the two islands. All the troops have returned to their original defense.

### Direct Sino-Japanese Telecommunications; Under Negotiation with the Allied Headquarters

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] Ministry of Communications News: Regarding the restoration of direct communication between China and Japan, Wang Shufang, the representative of our delegation to Japan, contacted the Allied Headquarters in April 1946 to restore the direct radio telegraph circuit between Shanghai and Tokyo, and agreed on a price of one French franc and twenty centimes per word for ordinary telegrams. The Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications has also ordered the Shanghai International Radio Station to prepare for trial opening. However, the Allied Headquarters insisted on paying for both incoming and outgoing telegrams in China and settling in US dollars when settling accounts with the Japanese side. Our side believed that this method would cause us to lose a large amount of foreign exchange, and it would also be difficult to collect fees from the recipients. It was argued that the telegram fees should still be collected by both China and Japan according to general practice, and the difference should be converted into US dollars and paid to each other, which led to failure to reach an agreement. Later, in order to facilitate communication, the Telecommunications Administration negotiated with the Transportation and Mackay Companies to change the round-trip telegrams between China and Japan to be transmitted via Manila, with a price of one務 station per word to communicate with the Chinese delegation in Tokyo and transmit government telegrams. Direct communication between China and Japan should be restored as soon as possible. The problems of charging and settling debts are still being solved.

### Chairman of Shaanxi Province Reviews Military and Political Affairs; National Army Grasps Initiative and Victory Can Be Secured; Local Defense Forces Need to Be Improved

[Our Xi'an Office, 10th] Zhu Gangju, the chairman of Shaanxi Province, reviewed the military and political affairs of the province in a frank tone on the morning of the 10th and said: The National Army has grasped the initiative and frequent reports of victory have been received. The work of suppressing bandits in the province can be secured. However, political measures need to be improved: (1) Some county magistrates did not effectively organize local defense forces at ordinary times, and they also failed to control the armed forces of townships, so county towns became isolated when bandits came. And they did not investigate lurking elements at ordinary times, and township personnel lost control and connection after the incident. (2) The gentry lacks sufficient awareness and should be mobilized to assist the government with local forces. (3) County magistrates should be instructed to strictly examine township personnel, adopt measures to strengthen the handling of bandit-ridden areas, and thoroughly eliminate lurking elements.

### Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week: Xu Baiyuan Reports on Finance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 10th. Committee Member Zou Lu presided, and after leading the ceremony, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan gave a financial report. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 AM. The original text of Mr. Xu's report is as follows:

The current financial situation is one of the most concerning issues for the entire nation. Therefore, I hope to take this opportunity to briefly analyze and review the more important financial issues based on the facts.

First, let's analyze the state treasury's income and expenditure, and the tax revenue situation. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, in the main tax revenue portion of the state treasury's income, the central government's tax revenue, including customs duties, salt taxes, commodity taxes, and direct land taxes, which account for 20%, has shown a gradual improvement in the proportion of the total state treasury income each year. For example, in the 34th year, tax revenue only accounted for 4.9% of the total state treasury income. In the 35th year, it increased to 12.5%, and in the 36th year, it increased to 22.4%. In the first quarter of this year, it increased to 23.7%. If combined with other material disposal, business, and debt income, etc., the tax revenue of all kinds in the 36th year accounted for 33.8% of the total annual income, and in the first quarter of the 37th year, it accounted for 39.2% of the total income during the same period. This is the period since the War of Resistance where the fiscal revenue and expenditure have been closest to being balanced.

Due to the needs of the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of the rebellion over the past ten years, as well as other necessary supplies, the state treasury's expenditure has increased year by year. Especially in recent years, the budget has been uncontrollable, and the actual expenditure often exceeds the original budget by several times. For example, in the 34th year, due to the huge expenses for repatriation and construction, the original budget was over 260 billion yuan, but the actual expenditure reached over 2.3 trillion yuan, exceeding it by nine times. In the 35th year, the original budget was over 252 billion yuan, but the actual expenditure was over 936 billion yuan, exceeding it by three and a half times. In the 36th year, the original budget was over 937 billion yuan, but the actual expenditure reached over 4 trillion yuan, exceeding it by more than four times.

The increase in expenditure is, of course, due to the rising prices, which necessitate appropriate adjustments and additions. However, another major reason is the large increase in the government's burden. We can understand this by comparing the current government burden with that before the war. After eight years of the War of Resistance and two years of destruction by the Communist bandits' rebellion, the government's burden in military, administrative, educational, and social aspects has not only not been reduced, but has increased significantly compared to before the war. Whether it is the number of military personnel or the number of central and local public employees and students, the average has increased more than threefold compared to before the war. Just taking the publicly funded students in colleges and universities as an example, which did not exist before the war, there are now as many as 140,000 to 150,000.

Furthermore, comparing the total state treasury expenditure with the price increases over the years, the difference is generally not very large. For example, the average price index in the 35th year was 3,785 times (the price index in the report is based on the statistics of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics), and the state treasury expenditure index for the same year was 3,796 times. The average price index in the 36th year was 30,62 times, and the state treasury expenditure index for the same year was 23,584 times. In theory, the treatment of military, administrative, and educational personnel should not be inferior to that before the war, but because the number of personnel has increased significantly compared to before the war, the actual income per person has decreased proportionally.

In order to meet various needs, the Ministry of Finance has continuously strived to increase revenue. In addition to handling enemy and puppet materials, surplus materials, utilizing foreign loans, and promoting the public debt policy, special attention has been paid to the rectification of tax revenue. As mentioned earlier, in the past three years, the percentage of tax revenue in the total state treasury income has increased from 4.9% in the 34th year to 23.7% in the first half of the 37th year. However, analyzing the overall economic situation of the country, there is indeed still the possibility of appropriately increasing tax revenue. We can clearly understand this by comparing the multiple of tax revenue increase with the price index. For example, the tax revenue in the 34th year increased by 108 times compared to the tax revenue in the 25th year before the war, and the average price index for the whole year in the same year was 1,630 times, approximately a ratio of 1 to 16. The tax revenue in the 35th year increased by 1,104 times, while the average price index for the whole year in the same year was 3,785 times, approximately a ratio of 1 to 3.5. The tax revenue in the 36th year increased by 8,650 times, while the average price index for the whole year in the same year was 36,062 times, approximately a ratio of 1 to 4. If we compare the price index at the end of each year, the difference is even greater. According to general estimates, the average multiple of tax revenue increase is only about a quarter of the price index. In other words, the current burden of the people on the government is only about a quarter of what it was before the war. Although this is due to the destruction by the Communist bandits and the contraction of production during the suppression of the rebellion, leading to the depletion of tax sources, and the customs tariff rate cannot be increased in proportion to the price index due to the implementation of managed trade and foreign exchange control policies, it is obvious that there is still room for appropriate adjustments to commodity taxes, salt taxes, direct taxes, and local taxes.

Studying both the state treasury's income and expenditure, if the government's expenditure burden and the people's tax burden can both be restored to the pre-war standards, it would be possible to balance revenue and expenditure immediately and have a surplus. If both sides can reach 50% of the pre-war standard, financial management will also be easy to handle.

As for local finances, the government's policy has always been to support the establishment of an independent financial system, in line with the goal of local autonomy. However, the fact over the years is that 50% of the land tax at the county level can still be used for funding, while the provincial finance is generally in a difficult state due to fewer tax sources and a larger administrative organization. In the 36th year, the central government's subsidy to the provinces accounted for 82% of the total income of the provinces, with some exceeding 90% and at least reaching 70%.

Currently, local governments and groups are raising self-defense taxes to cope with self-defense needs, and collecting surcharges on central tax items such as edible salt, cotton, tobacco leaves, and coal, and there are overlaps between them, leaving merchants and people at a loss. This is also a serious financial problem at present. The tax system should not be easily disrupted. The Ministry of Finance is currently finding ways to correct and stop this, and the necessary expenses for these surcharges will still be verified by the central government for their actual use and allocated accordingly.

Prices began to show signs of rising in late April, and in the first week of May, they actually began to skyrocket. This started with financial commodities, and the extent of their rise was the most severe. From May 1st to 7th, the black market Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by 40%, the black market gold yuan rose by 35%, while Wing On and Ewo cotton yarn also rose by about 40%, and rice yarn rose by about 25%. The weekend of the 8th saw a slight lull in the price surge, but after Sunday, yesterday, Monday, the price surge resumed. Apart from financial commodities, rice rose by 500,000 yuan in one day, and cotton cloth reached new highs. Wing On cotton yarn in Shanghai stock exceeded the 3,000 yuan mark. Daily necessities also rose across the board. The ferocity of the price surge is almost unimaginable, creating what everyone calls the "May Price Surge." This threatens the lives of every citizen. If the authorities concerned do not take strict measures to suppress the soaring prices, the May price surge will continue unabated, making it impossible for us ordinary people to survive!

Every time a price surge occurs, rumors inevitably circulate in the market. This price surge is no exception. Especially this May, people are apprehensive about the Communist bandits' "crossing the river in May" rumor offensive, and are even more suspicious. All kinds of rumors are pouring in. Even yesterday, some people in the market attributed the non-attendance of the Legislative Yuan meetings by the legislators of the Minqing and Youth parties as a factor driving up prices. The oversensitivity of speculators has reached this level, which is both ridiculous and pitiful. However, the use of rumors by speculators to stir up trouble in the market and fuel price increases is only one factor. We have identified the following main reasons for this May price surge: (1) The government's heavy expenditure has deepened the vicious cycle of currency inflation; (2) The loose monetary policy has allowed floating capital to infiltrate the market; (3) The relocation of industries to Hong Kong has caused a sharp rise in the black market Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, which has led to a general rise in prices.

During this period of suppressing the rebellion, military affairs come first, which goes without saying. Considering only the military expenditure, the heavy expenditure makes it difficult to balance the national budget. Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is an old saying, but it is also an unbreakable economic principle. Even the United Kingdom and the United States followed this principle during wartime to deal with their most difficult financial problems. In terms of expenditure, efforts should be made to save where savings are possible. In terms of income, efforts should be made to increase revenue as much as possible, but efforts should be made to tap into the wealthy and shift the majority of the national burden to the wealthy. However, the actual situation in our country is contrary to this, because the government, in order to create a false sense of peace, does not hesitate to waste a large amount of funds on useless things. For example, the convening of the National Assembly this time involved a lot of waste. The election tickets were too elaborate, which only increased the expenditure of the National Assembly and had nothing to do with the solemnity of the election. Another example is that a Nanjing evening newspaper reported that the Printing Bureau of the National Government's Civil Service Office had sent personnel to Shanghai to transport 570 taels and 4 mace of gold to Nanjing in preparation for making commemorative medals for the National Assembly. If this news is true, it is obvious that the government has not made its best efforts to reduce expenditure. Since the government does not pay attention to economic principles in its expenditure, and the special treatment for public employees has been adjusted again and again recently, the government's expenditure has only increased, and the source of these expenditures is the mass production of the printing press. The increasingly severe currency inflation cannot be saved. In terms of national income, the government, in view of the situation that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer during the period of suppressing the rebellion, also knows that the national expenditure cannot completely rely on the increase in currency issuance. Therefore, it also launched the "Special Relief Donation," hoping to use this to equalize the wealth of the Chinese people and shift the economic burden of suppressing the rebellion to the wealthy. However, the so-called "Special Relief Donation" has been delayed again and again and has not yet materialized. We boldly say that if the special relief donation had been implemented in April, the government would not only have issued less currency, but also there would not have been so much floating capital, completely infiltrating the market and stirring up trouble there, resulting in the May price surge. This is a misstep by the government, and the government should deeply reflect on it.

However, observing the actual dynamics of the market, the occurrence of this price surge is due to the loose monetary policy. Since April 5th, the monetary policy in Shanghai has begun to loosen, and the loosening has increased until the end of the month, because the expenditure of the national treasury is heavy, especially the US dollar bonds that must be repaid with principal and interest of about 2 trillion yuan at the end of April, making the national banks unable to withdraw the monetary policy. The situation is the same in these few days, which has further increased the impunity of speculators, who desperately raise prices. However, if the authorities respond properly to the loose monetary policy, the price surge is not inevitable. The Central Bank has also used its most effective tool for tightening monetary policy—short-term treasury bills—but it has not exerted its effect in absorbing floating capital. Instead, it has swept away the caution of merchants in the market, so prices, like a wild horse, have become uncontrollable.

In fact, the leaders of this price surge are these financial commodities, especially the black market Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, which has not only become the only target for wealthy merchants to hedge, but also has become the standard for the rise and fall of all prices. Although the black market prices of gold and US dollars are prohibited from being published, the prices of the black market Hong Kong dollar exchange rate and the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars against gold and US dollars are published by various newspapers. Although the Financial Bureau has cracked down on the black market for gold yuan, the price of gold yuan is known to everyone. However, the reason for the daily and nightly increase in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate lies not only in this, but also in the lack of patriotism among general merchants, especially general speculators, who are blinded by greed and only know their personal interests and losses, regardless of the rise and fall of the country and the life and death of the people. They cannot resist the rumor offensive of the Communist bandits "crossing the river in May," feel deeply the danger of the country, and rush to hedge with Hong Kong dollars, or relocate industries to the south, or evade funds to Hong Kong, preparing to spend their lives as "Chinese White Russians." Under this supply and demand situation, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate will naturally rise without return.

Although we have pointed out the reasons for this price surge above, we still cannot but admit that this is a bad result of our country's financial and fiscal policies in recent years. If the competent authorities cannot deeply reflect and thoroughly self-examine the current financial and fiscal policies, then even if the May price surge subsides, the June price surge will follow one after another. Therefore, on the passive side, we hope that the competent authorities can immediately take strict measures to put out the May price surge; and on the active side, we believe that the current financial policy must be re-examined, and the new government after the implementation of the constitution must change its course, adopt a new style, and implement a new financial policy to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, so that we ordinary people can survive.

We are deeply moved by the Chairman's gracious audience amidst his busy schedule. Here, we would like to express our gratitude to the Chairman on behalf of the 6.5 million compatriots. The Chairman has carried on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy, implemented the Three Principles of the People, engaged in the great cause of nation-building, devoted his life to the revolution, led the victory of the War of Resistance, and laid the foundation for world peace and human happiness. His great achievements are admired by the entire nation. The implementation of constitutional government this time and his glorious election as the first president are celebrated by all and rejoiced by the whole country. Taiwan was occupied for fifty years. Since the victory, the lost territory has been regained. The people of Taiwan have returned to the embrace of the motherland. All the people of Taiwan are moved to tears. The land of Taiwan was developed in the past when Zheng Chenggong led the uprising of the Fujian and Guangdong youths. Therefore, although Taiwan has been ruled by the Japanese for fifty years, the spirit of national resistance of Zheng Chenggong, which is the tradition of the people of Taiwan, still exists. Therefore, the land of Taiwan will always be the land of the Republic of China, and the people of Taiwan will always be the citizens of the Republic of China. At this time of national crisis, the compatriots in Taiwan will absolutely support the government. Under the leadership of the Chairman, we will unite with the compatriots in the motherland, work hard to suppress the rebellion, to repay the Chairman's kindness in recovering Taiwan, and to complete the mission of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

France's Position on Germany: Security First

Foreign Minister Bidault Delivers a Speech

[Reuters, Toulouse, 9th] Foreign Minister Bidault spoke today at the annual meeting of the Popular Republican Movement, solemnly denying that France had succumbed to British and American views during the three-power London conference on the German question. On the two points of control of the Ruhr area and the establishment of a German federal constitution, the French government remains committed to its original position. He said that although France does not adopt a "all or nothing" attitude, it will never accept any solution that France deems insufficient. France's security is a global issue that depends on international cooperation and the United Nations organization. The Western European Five-Nation Alliance is an unprecedented alliance, and is even a prelude to the organization of all of Europe. The five Western European countries have agreed to live together, striving for a better life and rejecting the worst life. Although the current international situation is not good, there is no need to be afraid. Those who are afraid will inevitably fall into trouble. Representatives from the Christian Social Democratic parties of Germany, Italy, and other countries were present as observers at the meeting.

When Churchill mentioned that "the way of life and freedom that you and we have built must not be destroyed by any form of totalitarian tyranny," the crowd gathered in the square and around the windows and rooftops of the surrounding buildings responded with cheers that resounded through the clouds. Churchill then stated that "any alliance that Britain, the Netherlands, or other free governments will conclude is not directed against any country or people, but against evil forces, no matter who they are or where they come from. We are here this time to follow the policies of freely elected governments and work together to further revive Europe's inherent glory, and help this continent, which has shaken the world, to become an independent and self-sufficient hemisphere again."

[Associated Press, Amsterdam, 9th] Churchill did not mention the Soviet Union or the Communist Party, but his speech was generally regarded as containing anti-communist implications. He hinted that there was no important difference between Nazism and Communism. He said, "Tyranny has various forms, although its names are different, its essence is the same. Whether you are in the Arctic or the Antarctic, both places are very cold and the north wind is fierce. Of course, the only difference between these two places is penguins and polar bears."

To Stabilize Prices of Public Utilities, City Council Decides to Jointly Petition Various Sectors

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the City Council held its second meeting yesterday afternoon. Twenty councilors, including Jiang Hao and Gao Shuan, attended. In addition to discussing the methods of conducting investigations, Councilor Fei Shusheng made a temporary motion to jointly petition the central government to thoroughly stabilize the prices of public utilities. The committee resolved that although the committee has repeatedly petitioned the central government to subsidize or adopt other stabilization measures for various price increase factors such as foreign exchange, fuel, and labor costs, there has been no satisfactory result so far. Therefore, it was decided that the committee will jointly petition the central government with various sectors of the city to adopt the above-mentioned principles and effectively resolve the issue thoroughly.

As for the methods of conducting investigations, it was resolved that: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau should first collect information on the operating profits and losses, personnel allocation, fuel consumption, and calculation formulas of various companies, and submit it to each group for detailed review.

Mayor Wu Analyzes the Reasons for Price Fluctuations; Selling Yarn and Rice is Not Difficult to Suppress

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Prices have fluctuated drastically in recent days, and yesterday the price of rice jumped by hundreds of thousands, causing panic among the people. Mayor Wu met with reporters yesterday to analyze the reasons for this price fluctuation, which was due to the rise in the Hong Kong currency and rumors that foreign exchange would be liberalized starting tomorrow. Food rice, cloth, etc. were all driven up by the soaring black market for gold and currency. The Mayor said: "It is difficult to say that there is no manipulation of the black market for gold and currency, but it is not in Shanghai, but in Hong Kong." Regarding the Hong Kong currency issue, the government is currently negotiating a currency agreement with Hong Kong. In addition to strict inspections by the economic police, special measures have also been discussed with President Zhang of the National Bank to crack down on the black market for gold and currency. Regarding yarn and cloth, there is no problem with the source of raw materials such as American cotton. The seventh economic meeting recently resolved to ask the Economic Ministry's Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Management Committee to sell yarn to suppress the market price. Regarding the rice price issue, Mayor Wu believes that it cannot rise any further. This morning, he will convene a People's Food Allocation Committee and rice merchants from the north and south markets to study suppression measures. If necessary, the People's Food Allocation Committee will sell a large amount of rice. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Food to suppress prices in the producing areas.

Fictitious Company Used to Divide Goods and Profits Reached More Than 10 Billion Yuan; Attempt to Escape Discovered and Detained for Investigation

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Liu Zhufeng and other members of the Xincheng Police Station were patrolling near Xinchang Road on Beijing West Road at 7:00 pm the day before yesterday when they noticed a tricycle carrying ten pieces of corduroy, which looked suspicious.

Subsequently, employees Liu Yongfan, broker Xin Wenyi, and Han Wenguang were arrested in various places, and more than 40 pieces of cotton cloth were seized. The main culprit Qian Chao is on the run and has not been apprehended. The bureau is continuing to interrogate the arrested criminals.

Seedlings of Rural Industry – The Budding A-S
Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Huang Chao-ru
[Dispatch from Changsha, May 5th] Industrial salvation is a universally acknowledged principle. A modern nation must be industrialized to possess the conditions for independent and free survival. Therefore, to revive China, one must start with industry, which is the popular industrial salvation theory of modern times. However, China has its special circumstances. We have a vast territory and the traditional spirit of "establishing the nation on agriculture" for thousands of years. Farmers account for more than 80% of the national population. When discussing industry, one should not forget rural industry. In other words, one should start with rural industry. This view does not mean that China should only be an agricultural nation, because agricultural nations are always ruled by others. However, a country that cannot abandon more than 80% of its farmers and break away from their traditional occupations, if it emphasizes urban industrialization and neglects the countryside, is abandoning the root and pursuing the branches, equivalent to building a tall building on a sandy beach. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agreed to use some relief materials to establish AIS (Agricultural Industries Service), a new type of enterprise that addresses China's needs. The initial plan was to establish demonstration groups in Shaoyang, Hunan; Qujiang, Guangdong; and Zhongmu, Henan. Later, Qujiang never formally established due to lack of funds and equipment, and Zhongmu had to withdraw midway due to communist disturbances. Only Shaoyang progressed smoothly and has now taken shape and is continuing to develop.
Last June, this reporter made an introductory report on the Shaoyang demonstration group. At that time, although the group had been preparing for a year, everything was still in its initial stages. Some factories had just been completed, while others were still under construction. It was actually still in the embryonic stage, so naturally there was no efficiency to speak of. Now, almost a year has passed since last year. Although various demonstration works are still in the testing stage, the efficiency seen is still not high, but there is a little bit of performance. Since UNRRA ended, the affiliation issue of the group has recently been resolved, changing the temporary relief organization to a permanent one, affiliated with the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Commission. The "group" was changed to "office," with the general office in Shanghai and Shaoyang as one of the branch offices, headed by Dr. Ma Jie, the former director of the Henan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch. The Shanghai general office was established on March 26, and Director Ma and his entourage flew to Shaoyang in late April to take over. This organization has entered a new stage of further development. The people of the country are naturally concerned about this emerging enterprise. In order to report the latest situation of this emerging enterprise to the people of the country, this reporter took the opportunity of the Changsha journalist group's visit to Shaoyang and made an on-the-spot visit.
Demonstration Work
AIS is the abbreviation of Agricultural Industries Service. As the name suggests, it is an organization that serves rural industry, that is, it does demonstration work for rural industry. Therefore, it is completely different from general business organizations that aim to make profits. The deputy director of the office, American Joseph Stepanek, said very clearly at the reception for the reporters: "This office is an educational institution, not a business organization that aims to make money, and its significance is the same as that of a state-funded university that loses money. Some people suggest, and even doubt, why this office does not take the road of self-sufficiency. That is because they do not understand the purpose of setting up a demonstration institution. After our demonstration work here is successful, we will abandon this place and go to other places, so as to spread it throughout the country."
Overview of Experiments
Currently, the office has established four factories—a machinery factory, a sulfuric acid factory, a cement factory, and a soap factory. In addition, there is an experimental workshop and water supply. The machinery factory among the four factories is the mother of all factories, and there is nothing to criticize. The sulfuric acid factory was originally intended to manufacture the chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate, but due to insufficient technology, it could not extract ammonia, and the chemical fertilizer failed. It can only produce sulfuric acid. Of course, sulfuric acid is also the foundation of industry, and it cannot be said that it is unrelated to rural industry, but its use in China's rural industry is still small, so it is inevitable that the outside world will criticize it with doubtful eyes. The establishment of the cement factory was because the foreigners who presided over the office at the beginning of its establishment did not understand China's national conditions and thought that industry could not be separated from cement and that small industries also needed a small amount of cement, so they specially set up a factory to manufacture a small amount of cement to meet the needs. However, China's old handicraft small industry is not the same as that in European and American countries. There is no need for cement at all, so the cement factory is equivalent to a redundant facility. The fertilizer factory is not aimed at manufacturing fertilizer, but focuses on the perspective of hygiene. This is directly related to the health of citizens, but Chinese people, especially those in the interior, still lack this kind of hygiene knowledge. They do not feel any high degree of interest in this kind of facility, and thus believe that the establishment of the fertilizer factory is irrelevant. Only the water supply, the entire city of Shaoyang, today has a water supply, which can be called a miracle in Hunan Province, and the common people really get a little practical benefit, but it is limited to urban residents. There is also an experimental workshop, which is equipped with wooden textile machines, oil presses, and sugar presses. These machines are improved by the engineers of the office based on the original local machines, and their efficiency is better than that of the local machines. Taking the sugar press as an example, it pressed sugar for the villagers last year and extracted 10% more juice, which was quite popular with the villagers. Unfortunately, the machine has not yet been mass-produced to meet the needs of the local area. In addition, the sulfuric acid factory is equipped with a brick kiln, which is also improved based on the original local kiln and is being tested. There are also insecticide machines and the manufacture of insecticide powder, which are more directly related to the interests of farmers.
Speaking of which, what Shaoyang rural industry needs is not very important, except for sugar production. What is important is leather making and paper making. It is a pity that the demonstration work of the office failed to grasp this point. However, according to the report of the office, papermaking has already started to cooperate with farmers in Xinhua, and leather making is being prepared, but it has not yet started due to the lack of technicians. When we visited the office, we offered some suggestions on leather making and papermaking, hoping that the office can make more efforts in this area in the future.
Looking to the Future
The office has gained a lot of experience and understanding after a year of testing. Director Ma has great confidence in this work. He has the experience and ability of working in the Yellow River flood area in Henan in the past. He said that he is willing to dedicate his life to rural work. He believes that all recovery is in the countryside, and the only way to save the country is to industrialize agriculture. In short, (1) widespread water conservancy, (2) mechanized farming, (3) industrialization of agricultural products, with agriculture as the center, gradually introducing the stage of industrialization, so that rural areas are not threatened by water and drought disasters and the terror of hunger, and greatly increase production. He has consulted domestic experts and scholars and university professors and students to cooperate and discuss and plan the work of the office in the future. The deputy director of the office, American Stepanek, this friend of Chinese farmers, is willing to spend his old age in China and serve Chinese farmers forever. He has a high degree of interest and enthusiasm for rural industrial demonstration work. He believes that China cannot leave the needs of small-scale handicraft industries within 20 years, that is to say, within the next 20 years, China's rural areas must achieve complete industrialization, and then urban industrialization, so that the Chinese people will enter the garden of happiness. Mr. Stepanek believes that since the demonstration work is like a money-losing university educational institution, it naturally needs a lot of funds. According to him, the current funds of the office are supported by the money from cotton stored in Shanghai, which is estimated to last only until 1949. Therefore, funds should be prepared in advance, and the sources of funds are only two: one is the International Bank, and the other is the Marshall Plan, that is, a part of the recent US loans to China is used for farmers. Therefore, he announced that he will return to the United States recently to strive for a loan for this purpose.
Rural industrial demonstration work is of course still in its budding stage, and significant results have not yet been seen, and it is extremely difficult work. However, now that the office has been reorganized and new forces have been added, with Dr. Ma Jie's knowledge and courage, and Mr. Stepanek's enthusiasm, as long as there are no difficulties in funding, I believe the future is still optimistic.

### The First Pass Under Heaven – Activity and Might Undiminished
Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao
This throat of entry and exit to Northeast China, the key to opening and closing the pass, today still stands tall like a "majestic mountain pass," and also still shows that it has not diminished its "activity and might" of being the "First Pass Under Heaven" in those days by swallowing and spitting out large amounts of materials and soldiers!
However, everyone is worried about its often-occurring malignant throat disease. The inside is tight and the outside is swollen, which will make it suffer and suffocate.
I have passed through here three times. The first time was after the "September 18th" Incident, when I quietly left Northeast China. In a bright morning, I escaped the enemy's and puppet's inspection and stepped into the pass. The most dazzling thing was a bright national flag. At that time, I wanted to salute, cry loudly, and go crazy.
After the victory, batches of national troops went out of the pass and stepped on the recovered territory. At that time, I was infinitely excited and happy. This time, flying from Shanghai to Ping, and from Ping to Shanhaiguan, there was an indescribable feeling.
Linyu County, where Shanhaiguan is located, is a poor county. The grain produced by a good harvest in a year is only enough for the county for three months. The rest is completely dependent on foreign aid. Most of its economic lifeline completely depends on the movement of the wheels, that is, the traffic inside and outside the pass. When the wheels cannot turn, it is when it is sick.
Shanhaiguan's hotels, restaurants, and prostitutes are known as the "three excesses." This is also the main pillar of Shanhaiguan's economic life. Recently, the road has not been broken and the cars are still running, so it is still quite prosperous.
Most of the shops are concentrated in the area outside the South Gate station. There is a cinema directly under the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, a theater, and a small teahouse that sings Ping opera.
In the city, in the central location, there is a small brick building called "Wenchang Pavilion." From the foot of the building, there are four streets leading to the east, west, north, and south. Except for a few cloth shops and grocery stores near the South Gate, most of the other places are simple and unadorned residential houses.
The highest administrative organ here is the county government, located on a square inside the East Gate. The buildings and official residences built during the enemy and puppet period are still quite presentable.
There are several schools on both sides of the Confucius Temple in the southwest of the city. There are county-run junior and senior high schools here, with seven or eight hundred students, a women's normal school, with more than three hundred students, and several town and village elementary schools, with many students. This is a gratifying phenomenon.
The famous "First Pass Under Heaven" signboard is hung on the East Gate tower. In the past, this was the only way to "run to Guandong" and "enter Beijing." Later, after the train was opened, everyone changed to entering outside the South Gate. This place has become deserted, and only the sound of bells of men and women riding small donkeys breaks the silence.
The Great Wall starts from the seashore and climbs up the overlapping mountains. Standing at Shanhaiguan, looking at the Great Wall blockhouses in the undulating mountains, connected to the winding Great Wall, gives people the inspiration of "the greatness of human power."
Shanhaiguan overlooks the mountains and the sea. Looking forward to the Liaoxi Corridor, it connects the traffic inside and outside the pass through the Beining Road. Looking back at the Qinhuangdao seaport, it connects sea and land transportation. In ancient times, it was a place that soldiers had to fight for, and it still maintains many important aspects today.
However, at present, what is constantly pouring into the pass is a large number of refugees, and what is going out of the pass is rice and flour and Kailuan coal that urgently need relief. Everything is abnormal and strange!

### China's Hollywood Under Secret Construction
[Hong Kong Dispatch, May 6] In Pingchou Lane, Kowloon Tong Village, Hong Kong, by the winding green hills, a new-style factory building has been built, but the workers are still making the sounds of "Hang Yo," "Hang Yo," labor songs. Carpenters, masons, and electricians are gathered there, working hard and sweating together to complete the most perfect construction of the factory building. This is the new photography studio of Hong Kong Yonghua Company. It is not only the factory building that is brand new, but what is more worthy of mention is that the company's photography machines and equipment are all the latest in 1948. This set of equipment is still unique in the Far East. In this photography studio, there are two studios, 260 feet long and 60 feet wide, which can be put together to form two long streets. The recording room is on the upper floor between the two studios. The windows on both sides can overlook the entire view inside the studio. The film washing and printing room is located on the south side of the studio and is an independent room, separated by asbestos boards, which can prevent fire. The room is equipped with a temperature regulator, and the temperature is always kept neither cold nor hot, which greatly facilitates work. On the other side of the studio, there are a dozen or so dressing rooms in a row, each forming its own household, with a dressing table, dressing room, and bathroom.
On the north side of the studio, there is a row of fourteen offices with wide corridors. Connected to the offices is the screening room. The screening room can accommodate 400 people and is simply a small theater. The music room is attached to the screening room, but it is separated by glass, so the sound is not disturbed.
Yonghua Company was founded by Chinese industrialist Li Zuyong. Mr. Li is 44 years old this year and is from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He studied history and literature at Boston Cambridge and other universities in the United States for more than ten years. After returning to China, he served as a university professor. Later, he changed to engage in industry. The motivation for founding the company was aroused when he visited Hollywood. He wanted to use the beneficial tool of film to give Chinese people education and proper entertainment. The capital of Yonghua Company is expected to be one million US dollars. All photography machines, tape recorders, and film washing and printing machines are ordered from famous American manufacturers. Because the company strives for practical architecture, excellent equipment, and improved production standards, the current investment has exceeded 1.5 million US dollars.
Yonghua Company plans to shoot 24 films every year, hoping to achieve some results. Li Zuyong said: Yonghua's equipment can produce 36 to 40 films a year. He hopes to make them perfect, so he only shoots 24 films. The company has a special committee to handle screenwriting and directing affairs. The screenwriters and directors in this committee include Ouyang Yuqian, Bu Wancang, Zhu Shilin, Wu Zuguang, Gu Zhongyi, Zhou Yibai, and Li Pingqian. (De Xiu)
The factory site started construction in July last year, and the main buildings have been completed one after another. New factory buildings are still under construction. The new machines were shipped to Hong Kong at the end of last year and placed in studios built according to Hollywood standards. The characteristics of these new devices should first be discussed from the camera.
They already have three cameras that can shoot color movies and "outdoor background" plays. The camera has automatic lifting equipment, which can shoot plays at any angle in the studio. The machine for shooting "outdoor background" is called "Background Projector." This machine is not only not available in Hong Kong, but also cannot be found anywhere else in China. This machine can first shoot the outdoor scenes needed in the film, and then bring it to the studio for projection as a background. For example, in the company's film "The Secret History of the Qing Palace," the outdoor scenes of the Forbidden City in Peiping are needed. Then the company will first send a photographer to Peiping to shoot the above outdoor scenes, and then project the outdoor scenes on a special giant "nylon screen." The actors perform in the scenery in front of the screen, and the written material shot is the same as that shot in the Forbidden City in Peiping. For example, if you need desert, high mountains, sea, or heavy snow scenes, you can also shoot them using the same method. The company's first film, "National Soul," recently filmed the interior scene of the Mongolian army's tent and the outdoor scene of the northern desert, and used the "outdoor projector." The film shot was excellent and very vivid.
The second new device is a film washing, drying, and printing machine. This machine is 50 times faster than the current manual washing speed. Normally, a 1,000-foot film is put in, and it can be washed, dried, and rolled up in just five minutes. The length of a film is about 10,000 feet, and it can be washed in 50 minutes, which is shorter than the time it takes to show it in a movie theater. Its speed can be known.
The third piece is the tape recorder. All of their recording equipment is produced by the American Western Electric Company, and major Hollywood film companies are also supplied by this factory. The characteristic of the tape recorder is that it can control the recording range. For example, if you want to record within ten yards, then the sound outside ten yards will not be picked up, which saves a lot of trouble and increases the speed of filming. Because often when everything is ready and you want to call "Camera!", suddenly there is the sound of an airplane in the distance, although it is far away, it affects the filming. With this kind of tape recorder, this trouble can be avoided.
According to Li Zuyong, the general manager of the company, Yonghua's equipment is certainly not as good as several major Hollywood companies, because they have a long history and have been operating for many years to reach their current state. However, in terms of Yonghua Company's current equipment, some major Hollywood companies have no more than this. (Xiu)

### The Mystery of Yang Mei, Who Has Not Eaten for Nine Years
Special Correspondent, Ouyang Chun
[Chongqing Dispatch, May 6] When Health Director Li Zhiyu saw this newspaper's reporter interviewing him, he immediately said: "You must be here for Yang Mei, who has not eaten for nine years." He said that Nanjing Health Director Wang Zuxiang had also written to inquire, but he absolutely doubted the authenticity of this matter. (1) The human body cannot survive without increasing heat; (2) The cells of the human body must metabolize; (3) Even if she had not eaten or drunk for nine years, how could Yang Mei have grown and developed in the past nine years? Hu Xianwen, the director of Zhongzheng Hospital, further strengthened Director Li's opinion with the above three points.
This incredible mystery can be solved by scientific examination. Zhongzheng Hospital has prepared a special ward, all free of charge for Yang Mei's diagnosis, but Mrs. Zhang insists that she must wait for the female Senator She Deyu from Shizhu to come to Chongqing before she can decide.
Senator She is the niece of Mrs. Zhang, the mother-in-law of Zhuo Songdai, the director of general affairs of the National Women's Normal College in Jiulongpo. The Yang family of Senator She's husband is from Edu, and is from the same family as Yang Mei. According to what Mrs. Zhang told this newspaper's reporter: Yang Mei was sent to Chongqing by Bai Zhaoyi, the new county magistrate of Shizhu, and Senator She was asked to send her to Chongqing, but she must be responsible in person only when Senator She comes. Zhuo Songdai also holds the same view. Because the Yang family sent a letter from Laofengdian, Edu on April 21, the content of the letter is copied as follows:
Greetings, Niece Mingqin: ... The meaning of my letter is about the person in Qiaozhen who does not eat. I saw in the newspaper that they said they wanted to have an operation. (Note by the reporter: The Yu City Daily Evening News did not publish this news.) Now everyone in Edu does not agree with this matter. Now please tell Zhuo Ge not to have an operation, as long as there is no disease. Otherwise, if there is an accident after the operation, what should we do? Please do not have an operation. (Note by the reporter: A circle is added next to the above sentence.) We will take her back in a while. Aunt's letter. (March 10th of the lunar calendar)
[Also, I just received a letter from Sister Deyu (i.e., Senator She, note by the reporter.) saying that Yang Mei's family needs someone urgently, so a familiar person is returning to the capital. Please ask her to send her back.]
The letter was written by Senator Yu's mother. Mingqin is Mrs. Zhuo, and she is currently working as a clerk in the Dasha. With this letter, Mrs. Zhang has more reason to refuse the treatment of experts. Yang Mei still lives in the Zhuo family. This morning, the messengers of the Women's Normal School and the male workers of the Zhuo family all said that they were accompanying Mrs. Zhang, (the reporter also caught a glimpse in Mrs. Zhang's bedroom, because Mrs. Zhang was still in bed, although the door was open, it was not convenient to intrude.)
After Mrs. Zhang got up, she hesitated again and said that Yang Mei had returned to the capital. When asked about the exact date, she said that the plane had entered the city. Residents of Jiulongpo all know that a woman who does not eat has come to the Zhuo family, but except for a few people in the Zhuo family, no one can confirm: Whether Yang Mei has eaten anything? But Mrs. Zhang said: Yang Mei just doesn't eat. She only drinks a few mouthfuls of cold water every few days. She is the same as ordinary people: cleaning and washing.

### Han Tomb and Han Bricks Excavated in Dongjiaxi, Jiangbei
[Chongqing Dispatch, May 6] In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China, archaeologist Wei Juxian and others excavated at Xiangguo Temple in Jiangbei, which once caused a sensation. Recently, the Municipal Cisco Agricultural Vocational School in Bijiaxi, Jiangbei, excavated a Han tomb and many Han Dynasty artifacts due to the construction of school buildings on the farm. According to Principal Cao Guowei, what Wei Juxian discovered last time was not as much as this time. According to his measurement: this tomb is two and a half meters wide and three meters long. More than 300 Han bricks have been excavated, each brick is four inches thick, seven inches wide, and one foot and three inches long. There are more than ten kinds of patterns. The characters on the bricks are blurred, but a few are engraved with "Wealth and honor" and "Made in July of the fourth year of Yan Guang," and there are also seals with unclear characters. It is said that "Yan Guang" is the reign title of the Eastern Han Emperor, so this tomb is at least 1,828 years old.
In addition to Han bricks, there are several pottery objects in the tomb, such as "Ying" and "Fou," a total of six, two metal bracelets, three grasshopper-shaped wine cups, and a clay chicken, all different in size and form. The largest is five inches wide and one inch high. Among them, the clay chicken is the most vivid, and the head and body are complete. Although the "Ying" and "Fou" pottery objects have been buried for thousands of years, the glaze has not been completely removed, and the spiral patterns are still vivid.

### Producing Areas Report Price Increases, Owners Hold On to Prices
The Rice Market's Rising Trend Intensifies
The People's Livelihood Investigation Committee Investigates, to Continue Selling
Comprehensive Rationing Decided to Be Extended to the End of March Next Year

The price of rice rises without end. Yesterday's rise was even more intense than in the past. All kinds of rice reached their peak. Due to the crazy rise in Wuxi the day before, people were excited. In the morning market, there was still fear that the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee would sell rice, so the increase was still somewhat restrained. Some people on this street were also waiting for the sale of rice, so they also imported less. However, after the rice sale did not move at all, this street rushed to import, and the owners held on to prices even more strongly. White japonica rice in the North Market rose sharply by 500,000, reaching a new high price of 5.5 million. Early rice and indica rice each rose by 400,000. In the South Market, each rose by about 300,000, with white yuan reaching the 6 million mark. Yesterday, the two markets received 4,297 shi of goods.

It is also reported that yesterday the rising trend of rice prices intensified, and the highest price outside the market was nearly 6 million. The People's Livelihood Regulation Committee, in order to resolve to flatten rice prices, in addition to continuing to contact the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, etc. to assist, supervise the market, and crack down on the black market, also dispatched special investigators yesterday to investigate rice sources, transportation, and origin prices, and the situation of goods arriving. If the rice source transported to Shanghai is insufficient, it is decided to sell it to the market without limit.

According to reliable information from the People's Livelihood Regulation Committee, the comprehensive rationing of rice in Shanghai has been decided to continue until the end of March next year. The second phase is four months from July to October this year. The rice supplied is all American rice, because during this period of food shortage, the government purchases rice in the market to stimulate grain prices. During the third phase of five months from November to the end of March next year, the Chinese government will supply more parts. This method has been formally discussed and decided by both China and the United States on the 9th of this month.

It is also reported that the People's Livelihood Regulation Committee previously planned to purchase surplus rice in the market, but it has now decided to stop doing so. It is said that the rice comprehensively rationed in the four months of July, August, September, and October is all relief rice shipped from the United States to China.

It is also reported that according to reliable sources, the central government is extremely concerned about the recent rice price fluctuations in this city. It has been instructed that the price of rice to be rationed next month must not exceed 4 million. According to the calculation that the price of rice in this city is 5% off the current rice price, the market price may be suppressed to around 4.2 to 4.3 million.

[Report from Wuxi, May 10th] Today, prices have risen again due to hoarding by four households. Cotton yarn is fierce, rushing to the 200 million mark. White japonica is 5,360,000, white yuan is 5,826,000, yang indica is 5,226,000, wheat is 5.5 million, white wheat is 5.8 million, flour is 1.958 million, soybean oil is 2.193 million, and cotton yarn is 203 million.

There is no formal transaction in the flour market, because the price of each flour has risen beyond the limit. Because the price in the inland areas of Suzhou and Wuxi rose sharply before, the owners were very strong in holding up the price. Under the excited hearts of the market, they unanimously increased by 120,000 to 130,000. Old cars and warships are each 1.93 million, and bran is difficult to buy even at 1.4 million. The wheat factory opened at 2.85 million, plus 200,000.

Miscellaneous grains are running to high peaks. Because the rising trend of each item has not stopped, the owners' hearts of holding up the price have not diminished, and people's hearts are still unanimously looking high. The origin of soybeans has few goods and high prices, and oil factories also absorb them, rising by 100,000 to 150,000. Pinghu beans rose by 300,000. Corn arrived quietly and sold actively, rising sharply by 10%. Red sorghum continued to rise by more than 100,000. Green beans are being taken by the Qingdao gang, jumping up by 300,000 to 400,000. Picking green increased slightly by 50,000, and sesame seeds were high and firm. Raw peanuts were not taken by the Guangdong gang, and the price dropped by 400,000 to 500,000.

The rising trend of edible oil is surging and becoming more and more fierce, especially soybean oil, which is seeing a crazy rise. The speed of its surge has also broken records. Because the oil factory did not open, the transactions on the market were all returned warehouse receipts. Retail investors were enthusiastic about speculation, and the highest price was once seen at 13.5 million. The later market was at 13.2 million, up 1.4 to 1.5 million compared to last Saturday. Raw oil rose more moderately, higher than 700,000 last week. Raw vegetable oil also increased by 1.5 million. Raw sesame oil and small car sesame oil each rose by 700,000, and soybean cake rose sharply by as much as 1.4 to 1.5 million.

### Taiwan Sugar Raises Ration Price, Sugar Market Turns Tight in the Afternoon
[Report from This Newspaper] The 31st meeting of the Food Sugar Group of the Price Evaluation Committee was held at 3 pm yesterday. Representatives from the South Goods Association, Taiwan Sugar Company, and other representatives attended the meeting. The following items were agreed upon: (1) The ration price of each level of Taiwan sugar will increase by 2.5 million from the next period. (2) The 11th phase of sugar sales per capita will start on the 11th, and each citizen can purchase one catty, and the collection price is still 24,000 yuan. Also, the 12th phase of sugar sales may start in early next month.

Yesterday, the sugar market was very flat and soft in the morning, so the association's trading, such as spot goods, 24 coarse white, 4 and a half white, and 20 medium sand white, did not rise or fall much, and local sugar even saw a loose drop. Oil-extracted green opened at 5.6 million, slightly higher than 200,000, cotton red at 6.5 million, and the next highest at 5.6 million. Xinghua white was 8.35 million to 500,000, slightly higher than 200,000. Xing red high-quality goods were only 6.2 million, ordinary goods were 5.6 million, and slightly weaker than 10%. Diao green was 5 million, slightly higher than 400,000 to 500,000. Hainan red was 5.45 million, and the 19th phase warehouse receipt for immediate delivery was 8.7 million to 850,000. The first delivery today was 8.86 million, once slightly lower to 600,000, and then rose to 9.2 million. In the afternoon, because the Taiwan Company's 20th phase ration price was decided to increase by 2.5 million, but the quota was reduced instead, according to the original quota of the 18th phase. This is an official price increase, so the 19th phase warehouse receipt suddenly turned tight and rose, directly exceeding the 10 million mark, and the remaining 600,000 to 450,000 were returned.

The opening in the afternoon jumped to 415 million, and the highest reached 322 million, closing slightly lower at 228 million, a huge increase of 50 million compared to Saturday.
The factory warp market was quieter yesterday, so the rising trend was more moderate. All levels of five-dan goods lacked transactions.

[Our Newspaper] Rome, 10th Broadcast: The Italian Parliament failed to elect a president in the first round of voting today, but it seems that Foreign Minister Sforza's ultimate victory is no longer a problem. In the first round of voting, Sforza received slightly fewer votes than interim President Nicola.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 10th] The Italian Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting in Montecitorio Palace this morning to elect a new president. The first round of voting failed to produce a result. Although former President Nicola received 396 votes, he still fell short of the required number. Foreign Minister Sforza received the second highest number of votes with 353. Einaudi received 20 votes and Bonomi received 10 votes. The total number of votes cast was 868, with 15 abstentions, one invalid vote, and 56 blank votes. When Nicola's leading vote count was announced, left-wing members stood up and cheered in unison, but Christian Democratic Party members did not participate. The second election will be held at 4:00 PM on the 10th.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The Italian Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to hold a joint meeting on the 10th to elect the President of the Italian Republic. Among the candidates, Foreign Minister Sforza has the highest support. Since the end of the war, Sforza has appeared in various international occasions as the spokesman for Italy, enjoying a high reputation abroad and deep support from centrists in the Italian Parliament. However, the Communist Party and extreme left-wing factions all oppose Sforza. Sforza has been working hard to rectify fascist elements since the liberation of Italy, which has aroused dissatisfaction among extreme right-wing elements. The other two presidential candidates are economic expert Einaudi and former Prime Minister Bonomi. Einaudi is currently the Minister of Finance and is regarded as a liberal by left-wing elements, which they do not like, so the People's Front may support Bonomi, who is seen as a neutral figure. Bonomi served as Prime Minister twice before Mussolini came to power and after the liberation of Italy. He was re-elected as the Speaker of the Senate yesterday. The Christian Democratic Party, which holds approximately 450 seats in the 900-member parliament, will generally elect Sforza as president.

### South Korea's Voting is Extremely Enthusiastic; Riots and Disturbances Continue Under US Military Supervision; Election Results May Be Announced on Wednesday

[Reuters, Seoul, 10th] The most serious violence to date occurred in Kaesong City, near the border of the Soviet-occupied zone. Four bombs were thrown in the city's heated center this afternoon, and police and rioters exchanged gunfire, killing one police officer. Later, rifle fire was heard near the airfield outside the city. It is said that the results of the election irregularities will not be revealed until Wednesday.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 10th] The people of American-occupied Korea began their first election this morning at 7:00 AM under the supervision of a United Nations delegation, for a total of twelve hours. The number of voters was very enthusiastic and was not deterred by weekend riots, Soviet boycotts, or threats from the North Korean Communist Party. The election results will be available in a few days, at which time they will be reviewed by the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA) delegation and reported to the United Nations General Assembly. According to the US military authorities, the Communist Party instigated riots in an attempt to create terror and force the United Nations to deny the election's legitimacy. Since the 8th, a total of 53 people have died, including 38 Communist Party members, one candidate, nine right-wing members, two election office staff, and two police officers. United Nations representatives requested that the police station be allowed to interrogate four Communist Party members arrested this morning, but the request was refused. The police station believes that this request must be made by the US military headquarters. The voting situation in each constituency was orderly, with equal numbers of men and women, all dressed in their best clothes, as if on a Sunday outing. As of noon, more than 500 of the 900 registered voters in one district had already voted. In another district, about 30 people were lined up waiting before the election began. There were a total of 800 voters in the district, and 120 people had completed voting within two hours, with 250 people still waiting in line, including 25 nuns from a nearby Catholic orphanage. The police, armed with bayonets, protected the polling places and were ordered not to act without instructions from election officials. The United Nations delegation supervised the voting in several groups, and US Commander Hodge personally inspected various places, patting the heads of the children watching and preventing the police from shouting at people to make way. He said, "Let these people stay there, they are our friends."

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 10th] According to the election authorities, the results of the election in Seoul will be announced tomorrow morning, while other places will not be revealed until the 13th. There are several areas where elections have not been held, either because there were no candidates or because the election procedures have not been completed.

### Pyongyang Holds Another Conference, Invites South Korea to Send Representatives

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 10th] According to a Pyongyang broadcast, Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the North Korean People's Committee, stated in a broadcast address to the people of South Korea today: "The North Korean People's Committee is purely an organization of the Korean people and is very willing to discuss and resolve the entire Korean issue jointly with the people of South Korea. Therefore, we hope that the people of South Korea will elect two representatives to attend a meeting in Pyongyang on the 14th of this month. At the same time, we hope that the US military authorities will not obstruct this matter. If the people of South Korea cannot arrive in Pyongyang for negotiations on schedule due to the US military, the North Korean People's Committee will consider that South Korea is unwilling to cooperate with North Korea, and the North will stop supplying electricity to the South."
