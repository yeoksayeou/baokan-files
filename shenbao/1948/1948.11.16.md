### My Views on Developing Import and Export Trade

Since the economic reforms of August 19th, import and export trade has plummeted. After the abandonment of the price control system, import and export trade has become almost nonexistent. The former Finance Minister Wang lacked a comprehensive plan for the overall economic policy, nor did he have reasonable and adaptable solutions. Speaking only of import and export trade, his entire plan only focused on reducing import quotas, and the only approach to export trade was to squeeze it dry. He only knew how to increase foreign exchange earnings and reduce foreign exchange expenditures to increase national wealth, without knowing how to use foreign exchange to benefit the country and its people. Such a plan not only failed to adapt to the environment but also violated economic principles, and the failure of his reform plan was only a natural result.

Now that Finance Minister Xu has taken office and made another adjustment to the gold and silver exchange rates, this cannot be said to be an appropriate measure to adapt to the environment. He seems to be a realist. Following the adjustment of the gold and silver exchange rate, he must have proper measures that are reasonable and adaptable to the environment to encourage import and export trade. Before the entire economic plan is revised, I want to offer some suggestions as a reference for the government to learn from its mistakes.

1.  First of all, the Import and Export Management Committee should be abolished to remove obstacles to the development of import and export trade. The past and current quota allocation and export foreign exchange settlement system are extremely unfair, superfluous, and hinder the development of import and export trade. It is correct to limit imports to necessities. However, the consequences of strictly setting quotas and allowing foreign exchange settlements give special classes of Chinese and foreign merchants the opportunity to make a fortune, while producers are subjected to endless exploitation. Because the import of essential raw materials is limited by quotas, those who are allocated quotas can hoard goods for profit. Although the government allows foreign exchange settlements, are merchants willing to sell to producers at the settlement price? If there are no restrictions on the import of all production raw materials, wouldn't the import of raw materials increase? As supply increases, prices can be stabilized, and they will not be manipulated by a small number of importers. As for the export level, it should be encouraged without a doubt. This is not only for the sake of exporters but also for the sake of farmers who produce. The foreign exchange earned from exports must be settled with the government at the exchange rate stipulated by the government. If exporters cannot reach their costs, they will naturally stop trading, and farmers' products will have no outlet, leading to the risk of bankruptcy. If there is no export foreign exchange settlement method, exporters can use the foreign exchange earned from exports to exchange for import goods approved by the government, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? If the government is for the sake of revenue, although there is no tax on exports, there are various burdens in the production area and during transportation, which are not light. Why should there be an Import and Export Management Committee to manage it? Therefore, I say that the Import and Export Management Committee is unfair, superfluous, and hinders the development of import and export trade.

2.  The government should not control the foreign exchange required and obtained for import and export trade. The government does not have the obligation to supply all the foreign exchange required for import trade, nor should it seize the foreign exchange obtained from export trade. Whether merchants use their own foreign exchange or use the foreign exchange obtained from exports for the foreign exchange required for imports, as long as merchants can provide for themselves to import goods approved by the government, the government does not need to interfere. In order to adapt to the real environment, it is best for the government not to issue a nominal foreign exchange listing by the Central Bank. If it is to absorb overseas remittances, it is better to hand it over to the Bank of China to specialize in foreign exchange trading, making flexible adjustments according to market conditions. If this is done, there will be no lack of opportunities to absorb them at any time.

3.  Encouraging exports should be the responsibility of the government. Now, the huge capital required for export merchants to do export trade is a huge problem. The legal tender has been converted from 3 million yuan to 1 gold yuan, and now it has been devalued to one-fifth. The people's wealth has been almost completely plundered by the government, and the cost of exported agricultural products has increased, and their prices have also increased accordingly. If we don't find a way to buy them in large quantities, it is inevitable that the goods will be discarded on the ground, accelerating the collapse of rural areas. If we want to find a way to buy them, merchants do not have such large funds, so it is the government's undeniable responsibility to relax all export loans. It must be known that in order to smoothly promote the chain system of import and export trade, the opportunity for export trade to develop must first be created.

In short, the development of import and export trade is an important part of maintaining the entire social economy. In the past, restrictions were too strict. The government only knew how to collect revenue, not to regulate, only to exploit, not to support, resulting in the current paralyzed situation. Now we are directly forced into this situation, and it has reached the point where it must be completely opened up. Why doesn't the government make a quick and decisive change?

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan Financial and Economic Committee group held a secret meeting on the morning of the 15th to preliminarily review and amend the standards for clearing pre-war loans.

The clearance standard for current deposits and loans shall be calculated at half.

They believe that the Soviet Union will certainly have its own opinions on the time and place of the meeting, but it will not be difficult for the Soviet representatives to agree on this at this time in the four-power meeting. Although Stalin is not currently in Moscow, this is not an obstacle to holding the meeting. If the four-power heads of administration meeting agrees to be held, Stalin may shorten his vacation. Foreign observers believe that the Soviet Union is very willing to hold high-level meetings on important world issues, and its attention to this plan has been going on for some time. Therefore, if the meeting is realized, the Soviet government will not only discuss the Berlin dispute, but also intends to discuss all outstanding issues between East and West, including the German-Japanese peace treaty.

[United Press, Paris, 14th Electric] United Nations officials said informally today that they hope that Premier Stalin will immediately agree to the peace appeal of UN General Assembly President Evatt and the two UN leaders. The question is how President Truman will respond. Evatt and Lie asked the heads of the four countries to personally meet to resolve the Berlin issue. This direct negotiation method has always been opposed by Truman, but the moral force of the United Nations may change Truman's original intention.

### The United States Considers Taking New Action to Force an End to the Holy Land War: Israel Refuses Order to Withdraw Troops

[United Press, Paris, 15th Electric] Well-informed sources said today that the United States is considering taking new action in the Security Council to force an end to the Palestine war. The US delegation to the General Assembly has consulted with representatives of Israel and some Arab representatives on new proposals. The Security Council is scheduled to meet in the afternoon to discuss the Palestine issue.

[Associated Press, Paris, 15th Electric] The Political Committee convened a meeting this afternoon to deal with the thorny Holy Land issue, but neither the United Kingdom nor the United States intends to express their views before the 16th. British Representative McNeil may speak on the 16th, indicating that the United Kingdom still supports the suggestions of the late Count Bernadotte and amends the original UN resolution on the division of Palestine. The plan will also force the Arab and Jewish sides to formally conclude a peace treaty. However, the success or failure of the Bernadotte plan depends on the attitude of the United States. US officials said that they do not intend to speak at the moment and will have to wait for another day. The General Assembly has taken action to ensure that the debate on the Holy Land issue will begin immediately and avoid delays that lead to repetition. The General Assembly, regardless of the opposition of the Soviet bloc, established a special committee to discuss six of the eleven issues still in the Political Committee.

However, Israeli Representative to the United Nations Eban declared here that the Israeli government is determined to oppose any modification of its borders. He continued that the work of the United Nations General Assembly is to seek peace, not to modify borders. Israel is willing to negotiate directly with the Arab countries. "We have tried to conduct such negotiations in the past and we still welcome direct negotiations."

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 15th Electric] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy announced on the 14th night that Egypt accepts the decision of UN Acting Mediator Dr. Bunche regarding the Negev, that is, to order both warring countries to withdraw beyond the temporary truce lines and order the Israeli army to withdraw from Beersheba, which will be managed by Egyptian civil officials.

### Atlantic Treaty

Will Not Be Completed Before February of Next Year

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th Associated Press Electric] US officials expect that the planned North Atlantic Security Treaty will not be submitted to the Senate for approval until early February of next year, but they hope to submit it after the new Congress opens in January. This treaty will integrate the defense of the United States, Canada, and Western European countries into a system of common resistance to aggression. According to the designers of this treaty, the factors that move the timetable backward are: (1) the postponement of the resumption of the preliminary meeting after the ambassadors of the five European countries held meetings with other countries; (2) the final drafting meeting may take several weeks, and in each process, consultations will be held with President Truman and congressional leaders. State Department officials hope that the ambassadors of the five countries can again hold talks with Acting Secretary of State Lovett this week. One of the major issues to be discussed is whether to invite countries such as Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Iceland to be signatories to the above treaty. However, the Italian peace treaty will make Italy's cooperation impossible.

### French Cabinet Position Stable: Middle Forces Form Unified Front

[United Press, Paris, 14th Electric] The French government's position has been temporarily stabilized today. The Queuille cabinet was originally precarious under the attacks of the de Gaulle faction and the Communist Party. The decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to hand over the Ruhr coal and steel industry to the Germans for management has dealt it a new blow. However, the People's Republican Party and the Socialist Party, the backbone of the cabinet, held separate meetings today and decided that the ministers of the two parties would remain in office temporarily. However, for each proposal, the Socialist Party requires Queuille to guarantee to suppress prices or increase wages within two months, and also requires a 25% reduction in military spending. The People's Republican Party requires Queuille to implement a financial, economic, and social policy of equal burden.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th Electric] The Socialist Party's National Congress convened in Paris today, calling on the nation's "third force" to unite, formulate a new economic plan, stabilize prices, and consolidate the "French Republic."

### Various Circles in Japan Call for Commutation of Sentences for War Criminals Such as Tojo Sentenced to Death: Webb's Opinion on Exempting from the Death Penalty Has a Great Impact on Japan

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 15th Electric] People from all walks of life in Japan, mainly members of Buddhist organizations, are now requesting that the sentences of Tojo and other Class A war criminals sentenced to death be reduced and that they be exiled to St. Helena Island, where the former French Napoleon was imprisoned. The representative who made this request to MacArthur and other Allied delegation leaders was Buddhist spokesman Hengxiang Monk.

It is also learned that because Emperor Hirohito has not been prosecuted by the court, some Allied countries will insist on commuting the sentences of the criminals when MacArthur seeks opinions from various countries on the 20th. Australian Judge Webb, the President of the International Military Tribunal, had already advocated in his statement that the war criminals should be imprisoned for life outside Japan in a place isolated from the outside world.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th Electric] Webb, President of the Far East International Military Tribunal, has several opinions that differ from the court's verdict, namely (1) Japan is guilty; (2) opposes the death penalty imposed by the court; (3) there is no conspiracy in national policy. Webb's above opinions have a major impact on the Japanese people.

King George VI and the Queen of England, and the Duke of Edinburgh were waiting quietly in the palace since dusk. At 9:00 PM, more than 6,000 people were waiting quietly outside the palace for good news. When the police reported the good news of the birth of a prince, the crowd cheered loudly, which could be heard in the depths of the palace. The first person to learn the good news was Philip. He, along with the King and Queen of England in evening dress, were waiting in the neighboring room. The Queen immediately hugged Philip, and the King also warmly shook his hand to congratulate him. Before the delivery, Philip, like a normal anxious father, paced back and forth in the long corridor for a long time. After the doctors checked in the delivery room, they determined that both mother and child were safe. Doctors Guillebaud and Weir came out of the room together and told Philip; "It's a prince." The agency announcing this good news immediately began working. Sir Lascelles, the King's secretary, ordered the word "Prince" to be filled in on every telegram. The news was immediately broadcast everywhere within minutes. The first message reported to Queen Mary, the second message reported to Princess Margaret. The Queen Mother rushed to the palace after receiving the news. Other members of the royal family were each notified by telephone. When Buckingham Palace issued its official announcement, the BBC was already broadcasting, and the national anthem was played after the announcement. The day of delivery was six days before the anniversary of the wedding of the Princess and Prince Philip.

Prince Weighs Eight Pounds: To Be Baptized Within Days

[Associated Press, London, 15th Electric] According to information obtained on the 15th, Crown Princess Elizabeth and her newborn son slept soundly all night on the 14th.

The baptism ceremony has not yet been arranged and may be held at St. Kingham, where the royal family will also hold communion. The ceremony will be presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Not long after dawn, Buckingham Palace was again surrounded by cheering crowds, and the servants in the palace were all given celebratory cakes.

British Throne System Table: Twelve People in Total

[Associated Press, London, 14th Electric] The son born to Princess Elizabeth today will automatically be the second in line to the throne after the princess herself.

After careful deliberation, it was resolved that the employee living cost index for this period (the first half of November) is 8.1 times the base period (August 19th). Subsequently, due to concerns among the committee members that various manufacturers may have difficulties in disbursing wages, four methods of wage payment were specifically passed as follows: (1) Wage payment should be made in one lump sum in principle. (2) If the employer is indeed experiencing financial difficulties, half of the wages may be paid first to those with lower salaries, and the remainder must be paid to those with lower salaries no later than the 25th. (3) If the factory is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot pay wages in full, a portion of the finished products (daily necessities) may be issued, with the price calculated at the wholesale price. (4) The unified name for the index will henceforth be "Employee Living Cost Index," without distinguishing between staff and workers.

### Private Schools Continue to Collect Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees; Director Li Urges Them Not to Implement It; Hopes the Schools Will Invite the Board of Directors and Parents to Find a Solution

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since private primary and secondary schools decided to continue collecting two to four times the tuition and miscellaneous fees, most parents have expressed opposition. Director Li of the Bureau of Education is consulting with the Private Primary and Secondary School Federation to encourage the principals to be responsible for inviting the board of directors and parents to jointly find a solution, rather than resorting to collection methods.

[Another Report] The Private School Friendship Association and the Faculty and Staff Friendship Association decided to collect four times the original tuition again, which has aroused protests from general poor families, who plan to jointly request relief from the education authorities. Yesterday, Chairman Jiang of the Private School Friendship Association made the following statement to reporters: First, it is true that poor students' families cannot afford this fee decision, and we express our deep sympathy.

### Public Utilities: Wage Payment Issues: Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Labor and Management for Discussion; Both Parties Present Their Difficulties

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Municipal Government released the employee living index for the first half of November yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately convened representatives from both labor and management of the city's six major public utilities at 4:00 PM to discuss wage payment issues. Those present included Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director, Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, Li Kaidi, Consultant of the Public Utilities Bureau, and representatives from various public utility companies, for more than four hours. The labor side believed that the living index for this period was too low. In the past, monthly wages could buy three dan of rice, while the wages for this period were only worth the price of one dan of rice. At the same time, the rationing of daily necessities has not yet been issued, and after buying rice, there is no money left to buy daily necessities, so they requested that the authorities make public the content of the compilation of the index for this period. The management side also stated their difficulties, pointing out that the authorities have restricted the prices of public utilities, and the increase in the living index is now higher than the increase in the prices of public utilities. It is difficult to pay the salaries of employees for the first half of this month, but it will be more difficult in the second half of the month, so they requested that the prices of public utilities be automatically adjusted.

### The Lin-Hui Brigade of Bandits in Pudong Attempted to Harass and Was Crushed; Bandit Brigade Commander and Others Were Arrested, and Weapons and Documents Were Confiscated

[Central News Agency] Commander Xuan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters received intelligence in mid-October that Gu Hanmin's (aka Gu Xiao Changgen) unit of the Lin-Hui Brigade of Bandits in Pudong was attempting to sneak into Shanghai to harass and rob. He immediately ordered He Longqing, Director of the Investigation Division, to instruct the Garrison Brigade to instruct the Third Team Leader Yan Jinwen to be responsible for the investigation and to crack the case. After receiving the order, Team Leader Yan selected Squad Leader Zhao Zhencai and led officers Sui Wenzhi and others to Pudong to conduct an investigation and sent informants in disguise to infiltrate the bandit area. They learned that Gu was instructed by his brigade commander Zhou Genfu to send squadron leader Tan Bingsheng to lead his troops to rob Shanghai because his strength was insufficient. They also planned to purchase weapons and military supplies after obtaining funds and transport them to Pudong to replenish their strength and wait for an opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion of Shanghai. Team Leader Yan reported to Brigade Commander Xia Lian and then to Director He, and ordered the informants to return to the bandit area to track the bandits, and ordered Squad Leader Zhao in Pudong to secretly contact the informants. On October 22, the bandit Tan Bingsheng indeed led a group across the river. Squad Leader Zhao and others followed and monitored them. After Tan and his bandits arrived in Shanghai, they hid at No. 2, Ronghua Lane, Lane 457, Malang Road, while the remaining bandits were scattered in various places such as Zhaozhou Road in the South City and Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, using a certain lane in Linsen Middle Road as a central contact station. That night, Tan sent three bandits, Chen Zhixiong, Song Linsheng, and Lu Jinhai, to rob a wealthy family in Western Shanghai. Squad Leader Zhao immediately telegraphed Team Leader Yan with the location of the bandits and their planned robbery. The Garrison Team immediately dispatched personnel in batches. After Squad Leader Zhao contacted Team Leader Yan by phone, he left personnel to monitor Tan's actions and personally led Sui Wenzhi and others to follow Chen Zhixiong and other bandits to the vicinity of the Paris Theater on Linsen Middle Road, where they met Team Leader Yan and others who were ambushing there. The informants pointed out the bandits, and they suddenly stepped forward to "inspect" passersby and arrested the two bandits, Song Linsheng and Lu Jinhai. A live pistol was found on Song. The remaining bandit, Chen Zhixiong, seeing that the situation was not good, turned around and fled westward, firing backward into the crowd, injuring a passerby, Jia Shouchang (Jia works at the Huaan Department Store on Linsen Middle Road). Because the area was a bustling city with many pedestrians, Team Leader Yan strictly ordered his subordinates not to return fire but continued to pursue relentlessly. When they reached Fuxing Park, Sui Wenzhi and other members of the Garrison Team had caught up from behind, and the bandit fired again. Sui then drew his gun and returned fire, hitting the bandit in the back and capturing him. At this time, the dispatched personnel had arrested the bandit squadron commander Tan Bingsheng and successively arrested the bandit party members Zhu Baogen, Yuan Qiugen, and Xia Meijuan in a shed on Xinzhaozhou Road in the South City, arrested the bandit officer Shi Gengen at No. 292 Haifang Road in Western Shanghai, and arrested Niu Zhengbua and others on Linsen Middle Road. After interrogating them overnight, Brigade Commander Xia also led the informants to Zhangjiawan, Yangjing, Pudong, surrounded the Lin-Hui Brigade Headquarters, and arrested the bandit brigade commander Zhou Genfu and cadres Du Xincai, Xu Xiuzhang, and others, confiscating many weapons and documents, which have now been sent to the military court for interrogation. It is reported that the confiscated documents and the confessions of the prisoners contained detailed information about the strength of the Communist bandits in Pudong and their distribution. The security of Pudong can be further stabilized in the future.

### Rationed Grain Prices Will Be Re-Determined in Six Cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao; Previous Rationed Sales Price Bridge to be Abolished

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to Liang Xin News Agency: The Executive Yuan previously stipulated in the urban rationing method that the rationing rice prices for November in the three cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, and Qingdao should be approved before the 5th of this month. The price in Beijing was 40 yuan per dan, 50 yuan per dan in Guangzhou, and 35 yuan per bag of flour in Qingdao. Subsequently, the price limit was canceled, and grain prices rose more than ten times. If the distribution was carried out at the previously approved prices, the national treasury would still suffer huge losses. In order to take care of the suppression of the rebellion's finances, the government decided to abolish the aforementioned circular and re-determine the rationing prices for the six major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao together, which will be announced uniformly within days. Furthermore, Beijing is still owed 13,000 dan of rationed rice from October. The Central Cooperative Bank has now raised 10,000 dan, which will arrive in Beijing immediately. It is expected that all the rationed rice for October can be distributed by the end of this month.

The Economic Cooperation Administration dispatched a special plane on the 11th to rescue the grain shortage in the city, carrying gauze to Nanchang in exchange for five tons of rice.

### Qian DaKui, Fake Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, Escapes Death; Re-Trial Judgment Changed to Life Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Qian DaKui, the fake Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, was accused of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to death on January 21, 1947. Qian refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial, which was sent back for retrial. Yesterday, the High Court pronounced its judgment again, changing Qian's sentence to life imprisonment and depriving him of his civil rights for life. The reason for the judgment was that although Qian served as the fake Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank and had the crime of colluding with the enemy and disturbing finance, the president of the bank was the traitor Zhou Fohai, and all economic policies were decided by Zhou. Qian only carried out the fake orders, which is somewhat forgivable in light of the circumstances. Therefore, his death sentence was commuted and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

### Exchange of Gold and Silver Can Begin Soon; Detailed Implementation Rules Approved Yesterday

Responsible persons from various departments of the Central Bank held an important meeting yesterday, and after review, approved the detailed implementation rules for the exchange of gold and silver based on the revised Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Regulations, and decided to submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.

It is reported that the exchange of gold and silver and foreign currencies is expected to begin on the 22nd of this month, and deposits will be accepted for one year at the same time. All gold and silver exchange businesses have been entrusted to the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to jointly conduct the exchange. It is said that the Central Bank's gold reserves will be allocated to the Central Mint in the coming days to be cast into gold yuan coins and small gold bars for exchange.

According to officials, this change of the Gold Yuan Coupon to an exchange standard system is one of the most important aspects of the revised regulations. This measure can bring back a large number of Gold Yuan Coupons circulating in the market, stabilize the legal price of the Gold Yuan Coupon, and cause prices to fall.

Furthermore: Since the government announced the gold coin exchange of Gold Yuan Coupons, all parties in the city have attached great importance to this measure by the authorities. Financial authorities said that the government's announcement that Gold Yuan Coupons can be fully redeemed will greatly help eliminate the black market for gold, silver, and foreign currencies. They pointed out that the black market for gold in the future will hardly exceed 2,000 yuan due to the government's permission for full redemption, and with the narrow range of fluctuations, it will be more difficult to obtain exorbitant profits. Adventurers will naturally abandon their illegal transactions as a result. As for the public's concern about the government's stipulation in this announcement that the amount of Gold Yuan Coupons issued can be changed by order, the authorities believe that there is no need to worry. According to a person in charge of the Central Bank who recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, the government is determined to maintain full reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan Coupons.

### Grain Continues to Trend Downward as Cargo Arrives Steadily from Various Routes; White Japonica Retreats into the 400 Yuan Range

Grain cargoes arrived steadily from various routes yesterday. Street vendors near the North Station were selling grain along the street. White japonica could be sold for 400 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). In recent days, grain prices in Wuxi production areas have fallen to the three-yuan level. All parties are still bearish on grain.

A large amount of grain arrived yesterday. High-quality white japonica was trading at 420 yuan in the two markets, thin rice at 420 yuan, early rice at 370 yuan, and Yangxian rice at 390 yuan.

The flour market was extremely active yesterday. Since grain merchants have no definite grasp on grain prices, and flour prices are still relatively stable, most have shifted their targets, using floating capital to buy flour. Therefore, the flour market yesterday showed a trend of weakening first and then strengthening. Bingchuan flour opened at 120 yuan and closed at 125 yuan, level with Saturday. Lao Che was vigorous, opening at 120 yuan and closing at 130 yuan, up 7 yuan from the end of last week. Other flour futures were also on the rise, as was bran. Fuxin large bags were 93 yuan.

The miscellaneous grains market was also active, with mixed gains and losses. Soybeans fell, with Poyangzi soybeans at 160 yuan. Corn rose 20 yuan. Raw peanuts and sesame were stable.

The edible oil market was still active, with mixed market conditions. Raw oil from this factory opened at 960 yuan, and Jiangbei pure raw oil at 1,040 yuan, down 60 yuan from the end of last Saturday. Rapeseed oil was 580 yuan, down 20 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was stable, with Jietong's small cars at 750 yuan. Bean oil from this factory initially opened at 700 yuan, but as credit in the industry eased, the futures price rose to 720 yuan, and the market price was level with the end of last Saturday.

Soybean cakes were quite vigorous, and the market price rose slightly by 5 yuan. Yu Ji soybean cakes were 70 yuan.

### Stable Tea Market

Although the tea market was still tight yesterday, brokers, in view of the scarcity of goods, did not relax their willingness to sell. However, due to the tight prices of export box tea abroad, exporters remained in a wait-and-see attitude, and the process was quiet. As for domestic sales across the country, they have continued to be unhidden, so the buying interest is endless, the market is lively, and the market price is beautiful.

### Stable Sugar Market

The sugar market's credit eased yesterday, transactions became active, and local street merchants were very diligent in adding inventory. Brokers' sales were also active and smooth, and the market was stable. Number 45 car refined white sugar ended at 350 yuan, with fluctuations of only 5 to 10 yuan from opening to closing. Coarse sand trends were also stable, and the remaining Xinghua white and other high-quality sugars were all at the same level as last Saturday.

### Cigarettes, Soap, and Matches Strengthen

The cigarette market reappeared strong and beautiful, and all cigarettes unanimously called for higher prices, because credit had eased, buying interest had increased, and the removal of goods from shops was unhindered, and replenishment was plentiful. The prices of various Chinese cigarettes, which had already fallen to factory prices, have all risen by 4 to 5 yuan. Yizhong cigarettes have also risen by 10% to 20%. The general view is that cigarettes are currently in a hot selling season, and if credit continues to ease, the future should still be optimistic.

Daily necessities such as soap and matches have also seen a strong rise. Gu Ben rose by more than 40 yuan per box, Arrow Knife rose by 50 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao was calling for 260 yuan per box. Matches were stable, with Meili matches still calling for 2,600 yuan.

### Lin Chaiyong's Resignation Approved

Appointed Full-time Secretary-General of the Central Bank Rediscount Committee

Lin Chongyong, Secretary-General of the Central Bank Rediscount Committee, has been concurrently serving as the Director of the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau for more than three months. Mr. Lin recently stated that the business of the Rediscount Committee is complicated, and after the four-bank joint office was ordered to close, all loan business was merged into the Rediscount Committee, which greatly increased the workload. It is difficult to take care of the concurrent position in the Financial Administration Bureau, and it has been approved. In the future, he will serve as the full-time Secretary-General of the Rediscount Committee in order to achieve sound development of the national bank's rediscount business. As for the successor to the Director of the Financial Administration Bureau, the Ministry of Finance is carefully selecting a candidate.

### Credit Eases

Yesterday was the middle of November, and the amount of cash in the market was extremely scarce. Banks were exhausted to fulfill obligations, and strictly limited cash withdrawals for customers. Therefore, the street discount rate was as high as 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan. As for the trend of credit, it gradually eased, with secret interest rates between 9 jiao and 1.2 yuan, and turnover was quite cheap.

### Yarn and Cloth Rebound Yesterday; Coarse Yarn Trend Is Sharper

Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of easing credit, with various gangs actively expressing intent to buy, and the removal of goods was especially healthy for 20-count coarse yarns. The market supply was not smooth, and the price quotes were even sharper. The rise in fine yarn prices was moderate due to weak buying interest in the weaving industry.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially called for 10,023 yuan, but there were sales along the way, and the price once retreated to 9,300 yuan. However, as it approached the noon close, various parties stepped in to buy, and the price quotes gradually rose, advancing from 9,350 yuan to 11,200 yuan. Finally, due to profit-taking, the price retreated to 10,200 to 10,300 yuan.

40-count Jincheng was 9,300 yuan, 32-count Yinyue was 8,600 yuan, and 21-count Shuangma yarn once rose to 8,200 yuan, but finally closed at 7,800 yuan. Overall, the price quotes for coarse and fine yarns rose by about 10% compared to the weekend.

Cotton Cloth Strengthens

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market still had good external trends. Both local and foreign gangs were buying, and those with goods were unwilling to sell, so price quotes rose steadily. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially called for 290 yuan, but rose to a high of 365 yuan as cloth merchants and retailers rushed to buy, up 50 yuan from the weekend.

Sijunzi Yuan Bi Ji rose from 300 yuan to 335 yuan, where someone bought in, and then rose to 375 yuan, also up 50 yuan. 190 Shilin cloth called for more than 600 yuan. Other poplins, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth were also strong.

Cotton Market Continues to Weaken

Brokers continued to sell off existing cotton yesterday, while factories had little buying interest. Prices fell further. Guide traded 200 bales at 1,100 yuan, Shashi traded 300 bales at 1,550 yuan, Hankou fine velvet traded 50 bales at 1,400 yuan, and Zhoupu zihua was currently trading at 260 yuan, with futures at 280 yuan.

Textile Construction Allocates Yarn

Textile Construction allocated 60 pieces of cotton yarn yesterday, totaling Gold Yuan 501,700 yuan. The allocation price was 57,000 yuan for 15-count Fengnian, 60,000 yuan for 20-count Tianguang, 85,000 yuan for 40-count Baoguang, and 92,000 yuan for 42-count Shuanggu Honglima.

Furthermore: Textile Construction has changed the date for allocating yarn to the weaving industry starting yesterday. The procedure is as follows: Every Monday, dyeing and weaving industries in levels A, B, C, D, E, and F will apply for purchase. On Wednesdays, the underwear manufacturing industry and the knitting industry will apply for purchase. On Fridays, the towel industry, handkerchief industry, bed sheet industry, canvas industry, wood yarn industry, hand knitting industry, and hand cotton weaving industry will apply for purchase.

### Woolen Fabrics Continue to Fall

Wholesale prices for woolen fabrics have continued to fall recently. Zhanghua woolens, which sold for as high as 350 yuan, can now be purchased for 175 yuan per yard on the market. People still expect prices to weaken further, and actual transactions are not numerous. The reasons for the consecutive sharp declines are nothing more than the following points: (1) Free price quotes were inflated too high. (2) The government announced that coins would be issued soon. (3) The Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign had uncertain outcome. (4) Credit was tight, and interest rates were extremely high. (5) The rise was too sharp, and actual sales were sluggish. (7) Gangs from Nanjing and elsewhere continued to bring goods to Shanghai for sale. Few people opened up with the China Textile Corporation and China Trust Company, and prices were deliberately quoted low, and they did not care much about whether or not they were successful.

### Directorate General of Supplies and the Oil Allocation Committee Announce the Total Amount of Diesel and Gasoline Imported

The Directorate General of Supplies and the Oil Allocation Committee reported: From January to September of this year, the total amount of gasoline imported within and above quota has exceeded 49 million U.S. gallons, with an average monthly import of 5.5 million U.S. gallons. The highest import was in February, exceeding 9.6 million U.S. gallons, while the lowest import was in September, with only over 1 million U.S. gallons.

The total amount of aviation gasoline imported from January to September of this year has also exceeded 7.8 million U.S. gallons, with an average monthly import of 850,000 U.S. gallons. The highest import was in February, reaching 2 million U.S. gallons, but there were no imports in January and July.

Diesel can be divided into three categories: (1) Light diesel: From January to September of this year, approximately 140,000 tons were imported, with an average of slightly more than 15,000 tons per month. More was imported in January, with over 27,000 tons, while only 2,480 tons were imported in April.

(2) Medium diesel: Approximately 190,000 tons were imported during this period, with an average of slightly more than 21,000 tons per month. In addition to imports within quota, the most was imported in August, with over 30,000 tons, and only 480 tons in September.

(3) Electric diesel: There were no additional imports in the nine months. The total amount exceeded 14,000 tons, with an average of nearly 1,560 tons per month. Nearly 4,000 tons were imported in July, while there were no imports in February, June, and September.

From January to September of this year, approximately 560,000 tons of fuel oil were imported, with an average monthly import of slightly more than 62,000 tons. The least was imported in June, with 31,500 tons, while there were 93,000 tons in August.

### Silk Market Wavering

Yesterday, the silk market showed a turnaround. Credit in the market was easing, and dealers were not lacking orders, but holders quoted prices without selling. However, silk weavers were already satiated and had little interest in buying. Local merchants only purchased in small quantities, making it difficult for the market to rise, and the closing was quite stable. On the No. 120 overpass, the morning opening was shouted at 10,500 yuan, but retail investors sold continuously, and prices softened again, reflecting a value of 10,000 yuan. Afterwards, the market hovered around 9,000 yuan, with a slightly bullish closing, showing little difference from last Saturday.

The raw silk market entered a consolidation phase. Credit within the industry had eased, and the market atmosphere was relaxed. Sales were not robust, and local demand was also weak, limiting price fluctuations.

Due to the consolidation of raw materials, silk and satin dealers were unable to raise prices. Credit in the market was very loose, but actual sales were sluggish. Customer demand was dismal, and local sales were stagnant. Bedding and other goods were ignored, and crepe and broadcloth were also not selling well. Confidence was weak. The opening showed some positive signs, but there were still many declines, and the closing was unremarkable.

### Agricultural Bank Purchases Wheat Seeds, Already Over Ten Thousand Dan

The China Agricultural Bank, in order to meet the actual needs of wheat seed loans for the coming spring, entrusted the China Agricultural Supply and Marketing Company to carry out purchases. The wheat seed purchases were difficult to initiate due to price controls. Currently, the purchase work can proceed as usual. It is reported that the company has now purchased over two thousand city dan of wheat seeds, but some of this is being purchased on behalf of the Jiangsu Agricultural Improvement Institute.

### Pakistani Raw Cotton Still Has Room for Negotiation

The yarn and cloth market can also be greatly expanded

Regarding this year's Pakistani cotton quota for our country, since the country's Deputy Minister of Commerce Hasni expressed the hope that our country would send a trade delegation to negotiate, the textile industry and cotton merchants have paid close attention to this.

It is generally believed that it is naive and ridiculous for Pakistan to use this as a weapon to improve relations between China and Pakistan, but at a time when our country's raw cotton problem urgently needs to be resolved, it is also necessary for our government to take this opportunity to actively strive for it.

To understand the export situation of Pakistani cotton this year, and the possible increase in our country's quota, the reporter visited Mr. Zhao Feijun, a cotton magnate from Shanghai who recently returned from Pakistan, yesterday morning. According to Mr. Zhao, the total amount of raw cotton available for export from Pakistan this year is about 1.3 million bales. Although the current allocations have been largely determined, if our government can seize the opportunity, it is very possible to add another 50,000 bales on top of the existing quota of 15,000 bales. Moreover, of the 650,000 bales supplied by Pakistan to the Indian government, it is stipulated that India must purchase a certain percentage before the end of January next year. If India cannot purchase half of it within this period, Pakistan is free to dispose of the remaining raw cotton. Therefore, if our country strives for it properly, exceeding 50,000 bales is not absolutely impossible.

Mr. Zhao also pointed out that the importance of this issue lies not in the increase in this year's quota, but in the future supply of raw cotton and the competition for the Pakistani yarn and cloth market. He said that Pakistan, with a population of 100 million, has only 50,000 spindles, so the import of yarn and cloth accounts for the largest share of the country's imports every year. This great market is now being eyed by the Japanese textile industry. How our country's government and people can seize the opportunity is a question worth studying.

### New Loan Policy of Banks and Bureaus Has Been Decided in Principle

The new loan policy of national banks and bureaus was discussed in Beijing in mid-last month by the Ministry of Finance, which invited responsible personnel from the Central Bank and decided on the principles. The proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and is now in the final stages of implementation. According to Mr. Lin Chongyong, Chief Secretary of the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank in this city, the Ministry of Finance is currently conducting further research on this matter. The new policy has been decided in principle, aiming to minimize applications for re-pledging and rediscounting with the Central Bank, in order to achieve the goal of completing the new loan policy without increasing the issuance of currency.

### Commercial Briefs

The China Trust Bureau will hold a public auction of woolens on the 18th. It is said that these woolens were imported from Japan and are not of very good quality.

The market for large and small hardware continues to weaken. Pig iron opened at 3,000 yuan, matching the allocation price of the Resources Committee. Bamboo steel was seen at a low price of 9,000 yuan. Wire nails continued to soften, with fine patterns opening at 450 yuan and coarse patterns opening at 400 yuan.

For building materials, except for bricks and tiles which were stable, lime fell sharply again, down to 100 yuan. Cement was still in short supply, lower than the factory price of 80 yuan, with offers of 70 to 75 yuan.

Leather prices fell by 10% to 20% due to weak actual sales and stable sentiment. Sole leather factory prices were as low as 20 yuan per pound, while retail investors were selling at around 16 yuan, with varying offers.

Savings Bonds Redemption Method

Reply from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to Mr. Zhang Xuchu

The National Construction Savings Bonds were issued for savings based on specific wartime regulations and are currently calculated based on the face value of the legal tender.  The interest rate is then converted to gold yuan for redemption. The government has not issued additional redemption methods. When savings bonds are due, they should be redeemed at the original issuing branch, but any postal remittance bureau may be entrusted to redeem them from the original issuing branch.

### A Profile of General Huang Baitao

— Song Renying

His achievements were the greatest during the Central Plains Campaign, and he has achieved brilliant results in the current Xuzhou Campaign.

General Huang Baitao, courtesy name Huanran, is from Hebei Province. He is a man of few words, humble and gentle, with the demeanor of a cautious general. He is a model soldier of our time and is worthy of the title. During the Central Plains Campaign in the summer, he made the greatest contribution. President Chiang Kai-shek awarded him the highest honor, the Order of Blue Sky and White Sun, and personally pinned it on his chest. In the current Xuzhou Campaign, Huang is serving as the commander-in-chief of the eastern wing, and after six days and nights of bloody battles, he has annihilated more than 46,000 enemy troops. It is expected that a great victory will be achieved in the near future.

General Huang had great ambitions since he was a child. When he was studying in elementary school, he often ordered children to practice military exercises, saying, "If we practice well today, we can defeat the foreigners who invade us in the future." When he commanded the children, he was very organized in tactics such as advance, retreat, attack, and defense. His teachers and others were amazed by his actions, praised him unanimously, and gave him the title of Little Huang Zhong.

Although General Huang is strict in governing the army, he treats his soldiers extremely well. When training soldiers, he often personally tests various combat techniques and never lets anyone be perfunctory or get by with mediocrity. Soldiers' food, clothing, housing, and transportation are also equal, without distinction between high and low. Those who have contributed to the corps or those who are selfless are especially respected, valued, encouraged, and rewarded. Wherever his army goes, it does not commit the slightest offense, and even chickens and dogs are not disturbed. The local people all carry pots of pulp to welcome the kingly army. He marches quickly, and his combat effectiveness is also very strong. During the last Central Plains Campaign, when Luoyang and other places were in great danger, his troops were still stationed in northern Jiangsu. After receiving the order from his superiors to provide rescue, he immediately set up camp that day and ordered his subordinates to arrive at a certain place by daytime. At that time, the enemy was very proud of the war. Unexpectedly, Huang's army suddenly attacked in the middle of the night and was beaten to pieces and fled in panic. Seeing that the war had been won, Huang was slightly relieved, but seeing the tragic situation on the battlefield with corpses lying everywhere and blood flowing like a river, he could not help but burst into tears. Huang often hopes that the Communists will lay down their butcher knives, save the country, and save the people, and even hopes that the Communists will sacrifice the small self, take care of the big self, and unite with all parties to jointly revitalize China.

Huang's family has none of the extravagance of today's dignitaries and can be compared to Zeng Wenzheng's family's advocacy of frugality and simplicity. The author went to Huang's residence the other day for something and saw Mrs. Huang wearing old clothes and managing miscellaneous affairs at home. Mrs. Huang is known for her virtue and wisdom and teaches her children well. Her eldest son, Xiaoxian, studied with me in the first half of the year and is now studying at the Naval Academy. He is excellent in character and academics and is expected to have a great future.

### All Aspects of Longdong

— Our Reporter Song Lin

[Our newspaper Xifeng Town dispatch on the 10th] Someone once said that due to the coincidence of history, geography, and culture, Longdong's position in Gansu is like that of the Nine Eastern Provinces in China, and Xifeng Town, the command center of Longdong, should naturally be considered the Shenyang of Gansu.

In terms of military and political facilities, Xifeng Town commands the center of the nine counties of Longdong and serves as half the barrier of the Northwest. The result of the bandits' coveting over the years has led to the Longdong Annihilation War in the spring of this year, occupying a glorious page in the history of bandit suppression. The traces of the battle left after the battle can still be vaguely recognized today, but many of the evil seeds sown by the bandits—bandits and lurking sporadic forces—have not yet been completely eliminated.

Under the principle of "seeking stability in destruction and seeking construction in stability," the local government has launched urgent clean-up and soothing work. The implementation of policies such as baojia and disaster relief is progressing day by day and fermenting in every corner of the counties. The people and the government have a common desire: stability and construction. Xifeng Town, located in the mountains, cannot escape the impact of the Gold Yuan currency wave. Although it suffered a lot of panic during the Longdong battle, it immediately returned to the status of a financial and economic center after the battle. After the "August 19" new economic reform, the management agencies have been slow to establish themselves. Merchants and people initially took a wait-and-see attitude, and later began to speculate. For two months, prices have been rising every day. Although there are no measures such as "price limits," it is the same as "having a market but no sales." Hard currency still has an extremely strong lineup in Longdong, causing trouble at any time, causing each dou of wheat to increase from more than 3 million legal tender to two or three times. Other goods naturally also rose. The daily necessities close to the bandit area are being searched for by the bandits at a higher price, and many ignorant people have been hooked by the temptation of profit.

Longdong's appearance is simple, frugal, and industrious. Under the warm autumn sun, the crops in the countryside have been harvested, and the ochre soil has also been cultivated, spreading the fragrance of the earth. Ox carts drag golden wheat stalks and slowly transport them to the threshing ground. The farmers on the threshing ground are even more busy threshing the wheat. Only the ragged old farmers, with旱烟嘴made of cattle bones, are sunbathing in front of the desolate village.

But Longdong is still shackled by the shackles of decay and decline. The people here suffer from a cultural anemia. Newspapers have become a luxury enjoyment here, and only a very small number of people can access them. The general public is abnormally ignorant of current affairs. The "New Long News" comes out every other day, with a small page size, blurred printing, and poor and rigid content and layout. Only the local garrison listens to the radio every day and posts a few brief messages. What can these dozens of words tell people? "Oh, it turns out there is such a 'big thing'!" This is what I heard.

Under the call of the provincial government's economic, cultural, health, and self-defense construction, the counties of Longdong have been concentrating most of their energy on self-defense construction, which is naturally due to the urgent requirements in reality. The local self-defense forces in the counties of Longdong have been established little by little through a long period of actual combat experience. They have made indelible contributions during the Longdong battle, but in that battle, they also exposed the weakness of mutual disharmony and fighting on their own. The government, in order to cherish this force that has fought the Communists for two years, has also retrained self-defense cadres, focusing on the inspiration of combat techniques. A month ago, it was ordered to reorganize the Security First, Third Regiments, and Cavalry First, Second, Third Companies into the new 29th Brigade, with Chen Zhuo, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Security, transferred to serve as the brigade commander. At present, the brigade's establishment, weapons, equipment, and treatment have all been raised to the level of the National Army's reorganized units. With the abundant fighting spirit of each team and the glorious past achievements, it is expected that it will form a strong force to protect the Northwest in the future.

### Wang Jishan Embezzlement Case: Court Files Public Prosecution

[Our Newspaper Liu'an, 10th dispatch] The lead protagonist of the widely spread embezzlement case of the grain official is Wang Jishan, the former Section Chief of the First Section of the Field Grain Administration. Ever since the county government placed Wang under custody, it has been investigating this case from many angles and collecting evidence. Now, it is learned that the county government has reported the Wang case to the provincial government for instructions on handling. The provincial government has approved them separately. For the part of Wang's grain borrowing, the county government will handle it with administrative penalties. As for the part of falsely reporting grain losses in the warehouse, it should be transferred to the court for trial. After receiving the order from the county government, the entire case has been transferred to the local court.

### Ningbo Old City God Temple: Opening Ceremony Set for the 20th

[Our Newspaper Ningbo, 15th dispatch] The Old City God Temple in this port was repaired after Mr. Jin Tingsun and other local gentry raised funds. It took half a year and cost a great deal of money. The entire project has been largely completed, with painted rafters and carved beams, and a golden and brilliant appearance. The temple has been completely renovated. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 20th of this month, and it is the only major event in the midst of the port's general decline.

### Changzhou Ten Thousand Stones of Rice: Allocated for Fair-Priced Sale of Rice

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the Danyang Branch of the Central Cooperative Bank purchased more than 10,000 stones of rice at high prices in Changzhou during the "August 19" price-restricted period, falsely claiming that it was purchased from other ports and processed in Changzhou. Recently, the county government, fearing a panic in the county's rice supply due to shallow reserves and blocked grain sources, launched an inspection of various factories and shops and learned that the materials were suspicious. On the 11th, it specially dispatched the Social Affairs Section Chief to conduct a strict investigation with the Field Grain Administration before the truth was revealed. The processing of this rice is planned to be carried out by the Field Grain Administration at the "August 19" price limit, and the rice will be allocated for the fair-priced sale of rice in Changzhou. Moreover, it is widely rumored in the city that this rice was colluded by a small number of senior officials of the Central Cooperative Bank with local gentry, who used the name of the Central Cooperative Bank to hoard and purchase rice, intending to make huge profits.

Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper Report] The market here has gradually returned to normal, but because the prices of various goods have risen to several times to more than ten times their original prices, the purchasing power of the people has declined.
