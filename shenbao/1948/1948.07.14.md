After the meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, the first item was the report of previous matters. The minutes of the previous meeting and the administrative Yuan's submission regarding the agreement and exchange of notes between the Chinese and American governments on economic aid were passed without objection and were approved for record. It was also decided that the proposal by Yang Zhonghua and others to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to change "National Frontier School" to "National Frontier College" would be referred to the Frontier Affairs and Education & Culture Committees for reference, according to the procedures committee's recommendation. Regarding the proposal by Duanmu Jie and others to grant amnesty to encourage self-renewal, it was also decided, according to the procedures committee's recommendation that, as there were no clear legal provisions on whether the Legislative Yuan could propose amnesty, the matter would be discussed after the Judicial Yuan's interpretation. Subsequently, the Procedures Committee's report on improving the efficiency of meetings and the Education & Culture Committee's report on the review of petitions from subsidized students studying abroad were heard and accepted by the assembly. At 10:15 AM, the discussion of items began, continuing the discussion of the draft Supervisory Law.

It was also decided that the three old laws related to the Supervisory Yuan during the period of political tutelage, namely the "Impeachment Law", the "Provisional Measures for Exercising Supervisory Power during Extraordinary Periods", and the "Implementing Rules for the Provisional Measures for Exercising Supervisory Power during Extraordinary Periods", should all be abolished. This point will be stated in the letter accompanying the bill to the President. Then, the report of the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan on the review of the postal rate increase was discussed. The committee members held different opinions on whether to increase rates and by how much. After heated debate, a vote was taken, and with the approval of 99 people (out of 192 committee members present), the review opinion was passed, namely to uniformly double the current postal rates, increasing the rate for ordinary letters to 15,000 yuan, with other rates increased accordingly.

After Sun Guiji, the convener of the committee, explained the reasons for the review opinion to retain the proposal, several members expressed their opposition. The result of the vote was that only 20 members (out of 173 members present) opposed, and the review opinion was thus established.

### Restoring the Pre-War Living Standards of Educational Personnel; Proposal by Quan Shao-xian and Others Referred to the Financial and Economic Committee for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th, it was decided that the proposal by Quan Shao-xian and others to "formulate various methods for freezing issuance, balancing the budget, and restoring the pre-war living standards of public educators, requesting that it be transferred to the Executive Yuan for effective implementation, and be set as the standard for budget review by the Legislative Yuan, requesting a public decision" would be referred to the Finance and Banking Committee for review, in addition to the budget committee's review and attention. The methods related to restoring the pre-war living standards of public educators in the entire proposal are: (1) Starting from July, the salaries of public educators will be fully adjusted based on the cost of living, implemented in phases, with 70% of the total amount adjusted in July, increasing monthly to 100% in October. (2) All agencies will be responsible for thoroughly investigating and registering the family population and economic status of their personnel, and based on this, a mandatory savings system will be determined for a portion of the personnel, with a portion of the adjusted salaries paid in kind or bonds, to be repaid by the state in installments with interest after the suppression of the rebellion is completed. (3) The Legislative Yuan will jointly form a cost of living index review committee with the Supervisory Yuan and the Executive Yuan to strictly implement this. Quan's proposal has attracted the attention of public educators in the capital. When the Legislative Yuan staff met on the 13th, they distributed a letter from all staff to all committee members, expressing their excitement about the proposal and appealing to all committee members for unanimous support to ensure its smooth passage. The letter also included four specific recommendations: (1) Promptly implement the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same location. (2) The cost of living index should be calculated based on the prices for the current month. (3) The cost of living index should be announced every half month. (4) All staff salaries should be paid in full on the day following the announcement of the index. Most committee members attached great importance to this.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th, the review opinions of the Education and Culture Committee on the petitions of translators and subsidized students studying abroad were accepted.

### Ten Democratic Socialist Party Legislators Report and Attend Legislative Yuan Meeting Yesterday; Party Issues Statement Explaining the Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Democratic Socialist Party legislators Wang Shihuan and others arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 13th, accompanied by Xu Fulin and Yang Junming. Guang Lang, Director of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, and Hou Zhong, Chief of the Protocol Section, greeted them at the station and accompanied Wang and others to rest at the Democratic Socialist Party office in Meiyuan New Village. At 8:30 AM, together with the ten committee members in Nanjing, they went to the Personnel Department of the Legislative Yuan to report for duty. At 9:00 AM, they visited President Sun, who expressed his warm welcome and immediately invited them to attend the meeting on the 13th. After the report items listed on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan meeting were completed, President Sun announced this news, and the assembly responded with enthusiastic applause. It is reported that the remaining eight people will also go to Nanjing to report for duty and attend the meeting within days. As for the five Youth Party legislators, they are currently scattered in various places, and the party has notified them separately that they can also come to Nanjing to report for duty one after another in the short term. In addition, about ten Youth Party candidates who failed to win the election for legislators may serve as special committee members of the Legislative Yuan.

[Our City News] The Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement yesterday (13th) as follows: Since before the election of the National Assembly legislators last year, our colleagues believed that after many years of political tutelage, public elections between minority and majority parties would inevitably lead to unrest among the people. Therefore, there was an agreement on the number of people elected. During the election, whether it was a party recommendation or a local signature, the expected result was not achieved. Although the number of National Assembly representatives did not match the original number, the difference was not too great. As for the number of legislators, the ruling party suddenly changed to the "standard of election based on the number of votes" on the day of announcing the list. Our party's public activities have not been long, and if we focus on the number of people agreed upon, we cannot avoid betraying our party's original intention of promoting constitutional government regardless of its own interests. According to the political parties in Western democratic countries, their first election may get one or three or four seats, and they can attend the meeting in the same way as the majority party. However, because the government's promise on the number of people is not entirely consistent, there has been a delay in the back-and-forth negotiations. Now that the Legislative Yuan has been in session for two months, in addition to the greatest confidence in the government to fulfill its final promise, all legislators elected by our party have decided to attend the meeting from the 13th of this month. According to the established practice of opposition parties in various countries, regardless of the number of members, all attend the meeting, and our party's legislators should fulfill the people's trust and contribute to legislation for the people and supervision of the government, so as to lay the foundation for the beginning of constitutional government. The foundation of democratic politics lies in public opinion. The process of the Legislative Yuan election is known to the world. Now that it is a public law institution, it should fulfill the obligations and responsibilities that both the majority and minority parties should fulfill, and be able to handle itself accordingly. In other words, the majority party is the ruling party, fulfilling its responsibility to preside over national affairs, and the minority party is the opposition party, fulfilling its responsibility to assist and supervise in the meeting. Once this principle is established, both sides will not interfere with each other, and each will be able to fulfill its responsibilities. This statement is made specifically for the attention of the people of the country.

### Capital Authority Observer Criticizes "Middle Road Line" People; The CCP Acts as an Echo of the Communist International; Those Compromising with the Communists Should Cease

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to the Xinhua News Agency's English broadcast from northern Shaanxi on the 12th, "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has resolved to endorse the resolution of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau Congress on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" (see the third edition of yesterday's newspaper). A certain authoritative observer here believes that this is another resolution of the Chinese Communist Party appearing as an echo of the Communist International and a follower of the Soviet Union. It also criticized speculators, the so-called "middle road line" people. It is said that based on the content of the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, it can be seen that the Chinese Communist Party is following the Communist International and the Soviet Union step by step, and there is virtually no objection. However, there are still some speculators and reactionary groups who dream of holding a so-called "new political consultative conference" with the Communist Party and establishing a so-called "coalition government." They do not know that, in the Communist Party's view, they have long regarded them as the bourgeois class of counter-revolutionaries.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Supervisory Yuan is scheduled to hold its eighteenth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th to exercise its right of consent to the candidates for Grand Justice nominated by the President. In accordance with the Supervisory Yuan's consent right exercise method, the full committee review meeting was first held on the 13th to review the candidates for Grand Justice and Examination Committee members nominated by the President. The meeting was conducted in secret. Liu Pingjiang chaired the morning session, and Mao Yiheng chaired the afternoon session. In the morning session, opinions were widely expressed, and it was decided that the principle was that each province should have one Grand Justice or Examination Committee member. When sending the results of the vote to the President, it was requested that attention be paid to the regional distribution of candidates and personnel from the Mongolian and Tibetan regions when making supplementary nominations.

It was reported that there were many opinions from the committee members. However, by the time the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, fifteen of the seventeen people had been agreed upon.

### The Economic Situation is Greatly Affected by Hong Kong; Our Authorities Discuss Countermeasures; Negotiations Will Be Conducted with Hong Kong in the Short Term

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Among the various efforts of the government to stabilize the current economic situation from many aspects, close attention has recently been paid to the adverse impact of Hong Kong on China's economic situation. The diplomatic and related authorities have discussed countermeasures and plan to negotiate with the Hong Kong government to eliminate this factor that is causing China's economic situation to deteriorate. According to a certain authoritative person who spoke to reporters on the afternoon of the 13th, since the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement was signed on January 15, the trade part of the agreement has not been implemented by the Hong Kong government because the Hong Kong Council refused to approve it. Although the financial part of the agreement has been approved and implemented, the Hong Kong government is not serious in its implementation, so it has not had a real effect. The Sino-Hong Kong agreement originally stipulated that it should be implemented within one month after signing. The trade agreement has been delayed until now, and the Chinese government has urged it repeatedly, but the Hong Kong side has not given a concrete reply. Therefore, even if the Chinese government makes efforts to stabilize the economy in many ways in the future, if the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement cannot be implemented, the factors of smuggling and disrupting the financial market will still exist, and the economic situation will still be adversely affected. The authoritative person also said: According to what he knows, the Chinese government has paid close attention to this, and will discuss with the Hong Kong side in the shortest possible time.

Editorial

### Several Issues in Handling Agricultural Loans

Since the Fourth Session, deeply concerned in mid-March, decided to restore agricultural loans, it has been more than four months; all parties in the country attach great importance to the implementation of this work, all believing that if this issue can be handled properly, it will be beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; otherwise, it will only deepen the concentration of rural wealth, fuel the rise in prices, and not be slightly ignored. Now, we put forward several practical issues concerning the handling of agricultural loans to arouse the attention of the authorities and for the research of the people.

The first is the issue of the amount of agricultural loans. At present, the agricultural loan of 200,000 yuan per mu is less than one-thirtieth of the actual needs of the morning people. Regarding food production loans, the loan amount per mu is only stipulated to be 200,000 to 300,000 yuan; at present, a single soybean cake requires seven to eight million yuan; and each mu requires at least one soybean cake to be used as fertilizer, which is really a drop in the bucket, what good is it! Moreover, recently, the average loan amount per mu of food loans in various places is only more than 100,000 yuan, which is only one-thirtieth of the actual needs. May I ask, how can this kind of agricultural loan, which is famous but not real, reduce the economic difficulties of farmers? And the main purpose of agricultural loans is to increase food production, so how can we expect it to be effective with such a small amount? Therefore, most farmers are not very interested in agricultural loans, and there are quite a few who even voluntarily give up.

The second is the issue of the timing of issuing agricultural loans. In terms of the time of agricultural work, food loans must be issued in early July to be effective. Because in early July, it is the most difficult time for farmers when they are in between harvests; in terms of farming, most of the fields have been planted at that time. According to farmers, fertilizing after mid-July is too late; and agricultural loan institutions in various places mostly issue food loans in kind, and ordering, delivering, and transporting goods all require a considerable amount of time. Therefore, this summer, food loans must be allocated to various places before the beginning of July and ordered quickly to be effective. However, some food loans in various places have only allocated about half of the quota, and although the loan procedures have been completed, the funds have not yet been allocated; if this continues to be delayed, it is very likely that the time for fertilizing rice fields will be missed, affecting this year's autumn harvest. Who should be responsible for this? It is self-evident.

The third is the issue of individual food loans to farmers. Recently, in terms of agricultural loans, most of the loans are individually loaned to farmers for farmers to operate and manage themselves; taking the area along the Jinghu line as an example, individual loans to farmers account for more than 90%. However, the amount of individual loans is limited, and the effect that occurs cannot be great; it is even more difficult to see the specific results of loans for farmers' scattered operations. Members and cooperatives only have a relationship of borrowing and repaying loans, and the opportunity to contact cooperative organizations is still not much, and the understanding of cooperation is even shallower; moreover, at present, there are not many cases where various townships, towns, and baos raise funds by themselves. These loan associations only collect a small amount of interest, and some cooperatives are not even enough to open, and there is little contribution to increasing the public property of the association. In the event of disasters or other accidents, the recovery of loans is also a problem. Therefore, we advocate that agricultural loan institutions in various places should strictly supervise branches in various places in the future, actively encourage various communities to engage in collective management business, among which, agricultural product processing machinery, new agricultural tools, and rural sideline equipment are especially important. The results of this loan are easy to see, and the profit situation of the cooperative is also more obvious.

The fourth is the issue of the way agricultural loans are handled. We believe that human and financial resources should be concentrated to avoid the dispersion of funds. At present, agricultural loans in various places are almost completely passive. Local gentry and various agencies mostly advocate average distribution by township, town, and bao, regardless of whether the organization is sound or not, regardless of the public security situation, loans must be issued. However, cooperative business is not a charitable business, and agricultural loans are not relief funds. This loan has its own special mission and necessary conditions. If it fits, it is loaned, if it does not fit, it is not loaned. Therefore, in some places now, the eastern township applies for loans to the eastern township, and the western township applies for loans to the western township, with no overall plan in advance, so that limited funds are scattered in various places, supervision is not convenient, and malpractices are very likely to occur. We believe that after the quotas are determined, agricultural loan institutions in various places should select several areas according to the conditions of the main crop producing areas in the area: whether the cooperative business is developed? Is the transportation convenient? Is the public security good? Are there many poor farmers? And other conditions, formulate a practical and feasible phased implementation plan, concentrate human and financial resources, strive to take the initiative everywhere, and gradually implement it according to the plan. Loan methods should be as collective management as possible, and it will be possible to establish a considerable foundation for local cooperative business and give full play to the results of cooperation!

The fifth is to change the style of helping a few people get rich. It is undeniable that in the past, most agricultural associations and cooperative organizations at all levels, except for a small number of sound ones, were manipulated by local tyrants. Therefore, in the distribution of agricultural goods, with a little carelessness and lax supervision, this small number of writing staff will arbitrarily transfer the use of loans for their own benefit and practice corruption. Most farmers did not benefit from it, but were used by a small number of people. Therefore, we believe that in places where agricultural loans are handled, if this phenomenon is found, the local administrative agency must be strictly punished, killing one to warn a hundred, so as not to allow this trend to spread to an unmanageable level. According to our investigation, most of these groups do not announce their accounts, meetings are not held regularly, they arbitrarily manipulate business, and spend money at will. If agricultural loans are loaned to these groups, they will only help a few people get rich and indirectly promote the concentration of rural wealth. Therefore, we require the authorities to pay special attention to poor farmers and middle peasants when handling agricultural loans in the future, and must ensure that loans can be sent to those who are in real and urgent need, and must never allow a small number of people to use agricultural loans as capital for personal enrichment.

In short, after eight years of resistance against the war, our country's rural areas were devastated by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the communist bandits' rebellion followed one after another, and the rural areas were poisoned by the communist bandits, resulting in a thousand holes and a hundred sores, broken to an indescribable degree. The rural economy is collapsing there, and the hard-working farmers are no different from being in deep water and fire, and the government's relief is very urgent. This situation is also recognized by the government authorities. The annual agricultural loans are nothing more than to relieve farmers' economic difficulties and assist them in applying a little more fertilizer to increase food production. Although the situation of handling agricultural loans in the past two or three years has not been as ideal as we would like, we must not "give up eating because of choking." We not only require the government to continue handling agricultural loans, but also hope that the organizers of agricultural loans will improve at any time so that agricultural loans can truly have their effect. Not only should it reduce the economic difficulties of farmers, but it should also achieve the purpose of increasing food production.

### Baoding Students Cause Trouble - Beating and Injuring the Speaker and His Wife - The Senate Asks for Punishment of the Murderers and Investigation of the Principals

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 13th] A shocking incident occurred in Baoding. Students from the private Sizcun Middle School and Social Education Normal School, organized by Zhang Yinwu, wanted to demolish the school site because Baoding was strengthening city defense works. In addition, the County Government recently sealed the three cooperatives run by the school, and on the 12th, they gathered a crowd to destroy the residence of Wang Wenquan, the Speaker of the Qingyuan (Baoding) Senate, and beat and injured the Speaker Wang Wenquan and his wife. Yesterday morning at 5:30, when the curfew in Baoding was lifted and the city gates had just opened, 100 students from the two schools entered the city from Caokun Park in the South Gate to the Southwest Gate to reach Wang Wenquan's residence at An 27, the former site of the Shi family. Along the way, they posted slogans and shouted slogans such as "Down with the standard local tyrant Wang Wenquan who rapes public opinion" and "Down with Qingyuan County Chief Liu Liyuan." After arriving at Wang's residence, the crowd rushed in, and without saying a word, they beat Speaker Wang to the ground. Bricks, tiles, wooden sticks fell together, and he suffered a serious head injury and immediately passed out. His wife, Liu, who was the only one at home, was also severely beaten. The doors, windows, furniture, lights and telephones were completely destroyed, and then they returned to school. Speaker Wang and his wife were sent to the hospital and are no longer in danger. After the case occurred, in addition to explaining the facts to all sectors, the Senate also sent a letter to the local military, government and police agencies, saying that the Sizcun Middle School had recently sheltered the three flower shops of merchants Deji, Minfeng, and Yongxin, falsely using the name of the Sizcun Cooperative to collect flowers and draw commissions, infringing on local tax revenue, and the Qingyuan County Government had sealed them up for investigation, and both parties had filed a lawsuit. In addition, the stationed troops strengthened city defense works and set a time limit to demolish the houses within the moat that obstructed the line of fire, and Caokun Park, which was occupied by the Sizcun Middle School, could not be an exception. In the above two points, the rights and wrongs are self-evident. The Senate only bears the responsibility for suggesting and part of the responsibility for the above two measures, but Principal Zhang Yinwu was angry with the Senate, which led to this unfortunate incident. The Senate also made three requests: (1) Severely punish the perpetrators, (2) Investigate the principals behind the scenes, (3) Compensate Speaker Wang for his personal losses.

Sizcun students were also prohibited from entering the city on the 13th.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 13th] Baoding is strengthening city defense works and demolishing obstacles in the moat. Ordinary people have lost their homes and have no houses to live in.

### Precautions for Merchants Trading with Japan - The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approved and Distributed for Implementation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Private trade with Japan has gradually started. In the early stage of this Sino-Japanese trade, in order to enable merchants to earnestly fulfill contracts and establish foreign credit, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recently approved "Six Points for Reviewing the Observations of Merchants Trading with Japan", which have been distributed for implementation. The above-mentioned precautions are recorded as follows:

(1) When a merchant applies to change the trade plan, the categories of imports and exports to be added or changed must be within the scope of the government-approved list of goods imported and exported to Japan in that year. (2) When a merchant applies to change the trade plan, if the categories of imports and exports to Japan are not limited in quantity in the list of goods imported and exported to Japan, the commercial commissioner may approve and report it for verification; if the categories are limited in quantity, the Ministry must be consulted for approval in advance. (3) When a merchant applies to add or change the categories of imports and exports, if the quantity or value exceeds the original plan, the commercial commissioner should first telegraph the Ministry for approval. (4) For the categories listed with a limited amount in the original plan, if both parties agree to give each other, and the total amount after the concession does not exceed the sum of the original amount of both parties, and does not affect the interests of third parties, the commercial commissioner may approve it and report it to the Ministry for verification. (5) When a merchant exports goods in accordance with the approved plan, if the total selling price stipulated in each contract is less than 50,000 US dollars, the commercial commissioner may review and approve it to the head of the representative group in Japan before signing the contract. If it exceeds 50,000 US dollars, the situation of the existing goods preparation must be checked before approving it; as for the amount of the contract that has been signed but not fulfilled, it should be calculated together when renewing the contract. If the newly signed contract and the contract of the original unfulfilled part total more than 50,000 US dollars, the situation of the existing goods must be checked before handling it. (6) The commercial commissioner should directly telegraph the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Guidance Office for the responsible investigation and reply for contracts exceeding 50,000 US dollars. If the preparation of existing goods for the exceeded part is more than 60%, the merchant should be allowed to sign the contract according to the number. If it is less than 60%, the Ministry should be consulted in advance for instructions.

### Bernadotte Recommends to the Security Council Armed Intervention in the Holy Land Conflict and Requests the Issuance of an Emergency Ceasefire Order

[Our Newspaper] New York, 13th Broadcast: UN Mediator Bernadotte, at an emergency meeting of the Security Council today, requested that the Security Council resolutely intervene in the Palestine war and declare its determination to take various steps to stop the war. Bernadotte urged the Security Council to issue a ceasefire order immediately, and those who violate the order will be sanctioned. He stated that if such an order could be issued, there would be another period of truce between the Arabs and Jews.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th dispatch] Bernadotte submitted a report to the Security Council, stating in the strongest terms that the expansion of the Palestine conflict would cause a world war and that only armed intervention by the United Nations could stop the dramatic changes in the Holy Land. Bernadotte pointed out that his mediation mission was stalled due to three major factors: partition, the State of Israel, and immigration. He also solemnly stated that time is running out, and if the Jews and Arabs continue to adhere to their positions, the war will expand. He suggested that the Security Council immediately send armed forces to the Holy Land, otherwise the raging tide of war will engulf parts of the world, not just the Jews and Arabs. Regarding the situation in the Holy Land during the truce, Bernadotte said that neither the Jewish side nor the Arab side had gained any military advantage due to the truce. On the whole, his truce monitoring team was very satisfied because the frontline commanders of both sides were generally able to abide by the ceasefire order. Bernadotte admitted that in the current situation where the opinions of the warring parties are vastly different, he still does not know how a compromise can be reached, but he intends to use every diplomatic method to restore reason to the Jews and Arabs. If it is unsuccessful, the Security Council will take action. Bernadotte did not specify how many troops the United Nations needs to send to solve the problem, nor did he specify how this international army would be organized or whether it would include Soviet troops. These details will be decided by the Security Council. British representative to the Security Council, Cadogan, asked Bernadotte whether he was still optimistic. Bernadotte did not indicate whether he was, but said: "This depends on the Security Council's ability to deal with this emergency situation."

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th dispatch] The report of the United Nations Palestine War Mediator Bernadotte to the United Nations Security Council was distributed to the representatives of the member states last night. Bernadotte's report concluded that an immediate ceasefire in the Holy Land is only the first step. "The problem that must be solved now is whether the world is willing to allow force to be the method of solving the Palestine problem. If so, the peace of the entire Near East and a larger area will be in great danger."

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th dispatch] United Nations Palestine War Mediator Bernadotte personally urged Britain and the United States tonight to strongly urge the Security Council to pass a resolution to deal with the situation in Palestine. US representative Jessup and British representative Cadogan both agreed to take concerted action to promote a ceasefire, but the details of their proposals have yet to be adjusted.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th dispatch] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss the situation in Palestine. Mediator Bernadotte first met with UN Secretary-General Lie and Security Council President, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky. Shortly afterwards, US representative Jessup and British representative Cadogan were also invited to the meeting. Bernadotte then told reporters that he had drafted a 21-page report describing the negotiations with the Arab and Jewish sides, and the Security Council meeting tomorrow will use this as a basis for discussion. Bernadotte also said that both the Arab and Jewish sides have asked me to continue to mediate. If I thought reconciliation was hopeless, I would have given up long ago. I will return to Rhodes Island on Friday to continue mediating. In short, I hope to restart the ceasefire on the one hand and negotiate a permanent solution on the other.

### Arab League Military Steadily Losing Ground: May Accept Another Ceasefire. Emergency Meeting Being Held in Lebanon.

[Reuters, London, 13th dispatch] The war after the end of the Holy Land ceasefire order seems to have been dominated by the Jewish army. The Arab League Political Committee held an emergency meeting today in a mountain area in Lebanon. After the Jewish army occupied the important towns of Lydda and Ramle, the Israeli army's bulletin today said: "The Jewish army has advanced 15 miles east along the Har Aviv-Jerusalem highway from Ramle."

The bulletin from Tel Aviv stated: "According to frontline reports, the Arab army on the northern front has completely collapsed, and the Jewish army is pursuing the fleeing Syrian army. The vanguard has entered Syrian territory." The situation in the Holy Land has affected the cotton and stock markets in Cairo. The market opened weak this morning, and there was no improvement even after the news of Egyptian aircraft bombing Tel Aviv. Observers, after pointing out the hesitation of the Arabs in both military and political aspects, said that they believe that the emergency meeting in Lebanon may decide that if the Security Council formally proposes an extension of the ceasefire after listening to Bernadotte's report, it will be accepted. An Israeli bulletin reported the battle situation on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway, saying that the Jewish army had completely controlled the section of the road from May Tai Er to Latron. It also said that the Jewish army is preparing to attack the Arab stronghold of Latron and open the route to Jerusalem. A Jewish frontline report also said that the Jewish army fought fiercely with the Egyptian army 27 miles south of Tel Aviv overnight, completely defeating the Egyptian army. A Cairo report stated that the Egyptian Air Force was very active. Egyptian bombers attacked the Jewish army front line west of Jerusalem, and Spitfire aircraft attacked the Aqir airfield 8 miles southwest of Tel Aviv and Lydda.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 13th dispatch] Jewish troops captured the city of Rishon Lezion on the 13th, which controls the Jerusalem water supply station.

[Associated Press, Transjordanian Capital, 12th dispatch] The Transjordanian General Command announced today that our army patrols in Palestine have occupied Golive, east of the Lydda Airport.

### Additional New Uranium Mines Being Opened

[Associated Press, Ottawa, 12th dispatch] Canadian Minister of Commerce Howe said that a company operated by the Canadian government is mining new uranium mines in the northern Saga Tai Gold Bay. For safety reasons, he did not disclose the exact location of this plan. The discovery of uranium mines in Canada is not surprising, as most of the mines are nearly exhausted.

### Parliament of Panama Removes Current President, Elects Barrio as President

[Central News Agency, Panama City, 12th Associated Press dispatch] The Parliament of Panama recently resolved to remove President Jiménez by a vote of one vote and elected Barrio as President for a term of four years, with Sucley as First Vice President and Marules as Second Vice President. Barrio will take office on August 1. During the transition period, Panama will be managed by the parliament's leadership. The parliamentary resolution declared that Jiménez had failed to ensure the country's stability and that the recent unrest and political struggles had caused "the people of Panama to suffer more."

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The Panamanian Ambassador to the United States, Fan Larina, issued a statement saying that the Panamanian Parliament's dismissal of President Jiménez was an unusual and illegal move. Fan continued, "There have been no new disturbances in Panama, and the country is absolutely peaceful."

### US Democratic Party Convention Begins Voting Today to Elect Presidential Candidate; Pepper is Truman's Only Opponent

[US News Agency, Philadelphia, 12th dispatch] The Democratic National Convention opened today to select the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the November election and to formulate the 1948 party platform on domestic and international issues. It is generally believed that President Truman will be nominated as the presidential candidate, serving a full four years in the White House, but one of the major issues is who will be elected as the vice-presidential candidate. The delegates will begin voting on Wednesday to elect the presidential candidate. To win the nomination, at least 618 votes are needed.

In the presidential nomination, Truman's only opponent is Florida Senator Pepper, who suddenly entered the race on Wuqi Day. Pepper admitted that he could not get more than six and a half of the 20 votes in his hometown of Florida.

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 13th dispatch] Senator Barkley's nomination as the vice-presidential candidate was almost a certainty on the 13th. However, President Truman seems to lack enthusiasm for Barkley because he believes that having a person from neighboring Kentucky, Missouri, run at the same time as him is a disadvantage in political strategy. However, after listening to Barkley's opening speech to the conference as the temporary chairman, the delegates expressed great support for this 70-year-old senator, and their enthusiasm far exceeded that for Truman.

### Factional Struggle Between North and South Caused by the Issue of Black People

Foreign Policy Platform May Have No Major Disputes

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 12th dispatch] The Democratic Party's 1948 presidential campaign platform is almost completely passed except for the civil rights program. Due to the deadlock on the civil rights issue, the rift between the party's Southern conservatives and Northern liberals is likely to widen. This civil rights issue, in essence, is the black issue. The two factions have fought repeatedly for this. Senator Myers, the chairman of the proposal committee responsible for drafting the Democratic platform, told reporters: "There is no dispute over the foreign policy network, and the domestic policy program will largely follow the New Deal policy, which is why it represents the plans in the minds of Roosevelt and Truman." Myers said: "The platform has included the important proposals Truman has made to Congress." Myers believes that the detailed content of the platform is a secret that should be kept, but he claims that the Democratic Party's platform will be more detailed and specific than the Republican Party's. The issues of aid to China and the extension of the Sino-US Reciprocal Trade Agreement, which are disputes between the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress, still depend on whether the Democratic platform will refute the accusations of Republican candidate Dewey, saying that the US government's attitude towards China is stingy, and whether it will accuse the Republican congressmen of "hindering" the reciprocal trade agreement plan.

### Using New-Style Iron Lungs to Treat Tuberculosis

[Associated Press, New York, 12th dispatch] The National Tuberculosis Association held its annual meeting here today, and a paper was read on the spot to prove that the latest treatment for tuberculosis is to use a new-style iron lung to allow it to get complete rest. This rest is an important step in the recovery of tuberculosis. The iron lung is a round, long steel tube with plastic windows that allow a person to freely enter, lie down, talk, read, and breathe as usual. The patient's lungs do not expand or contract, but if a button is pressed, the movement of the lungs and muscles can be stopped completely.

### Internal Division of the Eastern European Bloc: Washington Watches Its Development. Cannon Reports to Truman on the Political Situation in South Country.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th dispatch] The US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, has recommended to the State Department that the United States should adopt a close watch policy on the strife between the Yugoslav Communists and the Cominform. After returning to China, Cannon has submitted a report to Truman. He will return to Belgrade later this week. Cannon refused to disclose the details of his discussion with Truman, saying only that he had reported on the state of the division of the Eastern European Communist camp. He felt that the rift between Tito and the Cominform had reached an extremely deep level.

[Associated Press, Yugoslavian Capital, 13th dispatch] The government announced today the dissolution of the Socialist Party on the grounds of reducing the efficiency of the National Front. This move is tantamount to further supporting the Communist Party's leading position in the National Front.

### Hann Recommends Convening a Six-Nation Conference to Discuss International Control of the Ruhr. Ruhr Workers Oppose Dismantling Factories.

Britain is considering France's proposal but has not yet responded.

[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 12th dispatch] The Executive Committee of the Trade Union Federation in the British-occupied area of Germany recently issued a statement protesting the Allied order to dismantle Ruhr factories, calling it an economically unconscious act.

### Commanders-in-Chief of British and Soviet Forces in Germany Return to Berlin with New Instructions. Britain and the United States Increase Airlift to Break the Blockade.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch] The most tense stage of the Berlin crisis has begun with the return of the British and Soviet Commanders-in-Chief to Berlin from London and Moscow with new instructions. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson stayed in London for two days and visited Foreign Secretary Bevin, Minister of Defense Alexander, Chief of the External Affairs Office Styphen, and Chiefs of Staff, respectively. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky met with Stalin and Molotov in Moscow for four days.

After Robertson arrived in Berlin, he revealed that he had requested reinforcements from the government during his trip to London, and British Air Force Minister Huntenson, who was investigating the state of the British airlift in Berlin, revealed for the first time that the British and American Dakota aircraft that were responsible for the airlift between West Germany and Berlin were armed aircraft. He also said that the Soviet side will cause shooting incidents in order to obstruct the airlift. Earlier, the old military government issued a statement this morning, saying that the Soviet aviation authorities could no longer tolerate the repeated violations of Berlin aviation regulations by Britain and the United States.

[Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch] A spokesman for the British War Office solemnly denied that Britain has decided to increase its troops in Berlin or the British-occupied area of Germany. Political figures here believe that the increase in troops must be approved by the cabinet.

The British, American, and French notes to the Soviet Union were submitted six days ago, and Moscow has not yet responded. The German "Forward Newspaper" in the Soviet-occupied area said yesterday that traffic between Berlin and West Germany will only be restored after the Western powers return to the Potsdam path and agree to convene a round table conference on the German issue.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The United States is increasing the number of transport aircraft supplying Berlin by air. By the 13th of this month, the number of twin-engine and four-engine aircraft supplying the airlift will reach 160. Nine C-54 "Sky Master" aircraft will arrive in Germany tomorrow, each carrying seven tons of cargo.

### Communist International Information Bureau Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia (Continued)

(7) In order to be concerned about the situation within the Yugoslav Communist Party (CPY) and to enable the CPY leaders to find a way out of this situation, the Central Committees of the Soviet Communist Party and other fraternal parties decided to discuss the internal situation of the CPY at a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau. This discussion was based on formal principles, as the activities of other countries' communist parties had also been reviewed at the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau. Despite various suggestions from fraternal parties to discuss the CPY's situation in the Communist Information Bureau, the Yugoslav leaders' response was a refusal. They refused to attend the Communist Information Bureau meeting under the pretext of "not having equal rights," in order to avoid legitimate criticism from fraternal parties.

However, it must be stated that this statement by the Yugoslav leaders is completely false, because everyone knows that when the communist parties of various countries organized the Communist Information Bureau, they established an indisputable principle: that each party must report its activities to the Communist Information Bureau, and each party has the right to criticize other parties. At the first meeting convened by the communist parties of nine countries, the CPY extensively exercised this right. Yugoslavia's refusal to settle its activities before the Communist Information Bureau indicates that the country violated the principle of equal rights for communist parties of all countries, which is tantamount to Yugoslavia demanding a privileged position in the Communist Information Bureau.

(8) In view of the above, the Communist Information Bureau agreed to re-evaluate the CPY's situation, to criticize the CPY Central Committee's erroneous actions, and to agree with the political analysis of the CPY's erroneous actions described in the letters sent by the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee to the CPY Central Committee from March to May this year. The Communist Information Bureau has reached a unanimous conclusion that due to the CPY leaders' opposition to the party, opposition to the Soviet Union, violation of Marxism-Leninism, and refusal to participate in the Communist International Information Bureau, they have placed themselves in the ranks of opposition to the CPY. They have deviated from the socialist united front against imperialism, embarked on a path of betraying the international solidarity of the working masses, and embarked on a transitional path toward national egoism.

The Communist Information Bureau believes that the above results prove that the CPY Central Committee is willing to separate itself and the entire communist party from the international communist family, from the communist united front, that is, from the ranks of the Communist Information Bureau. The Communist Information Bureau believes that all the mistakes made by the CPY leaders are based on an indisputable fact: that in the last five to six months under the leadership of the party, nationalists have been openly active and unscrupulous. The CPY leaders have moved far away from the party's international line tradition and embarked on the path of nationalism. The Yugoslav leaders have taken a wrong direction in the international situation and are panic-stricken by the threat of imperialism. They believe that if they continue to make concessions to imperialist countries, they will be able to obtain grace, conclude agreements with imperialist countries regarding Yugoslavia's independence, and gradually influence the Yugoslav people to take the path taken by imperialist countries, that is, the capitalist path.

At the same time, they tacitly adopted the bourgeois-nationalist argument that capitalism is less harmful to Yugoslavia's independence than the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav leaders do not know, or at least pretend not to know, that similar nationalist consciousness will lead Yugoslavia onto the path of a typical bourgeois republic and cause the country to lose its national independence in the face of imperialists. The Communist Information Bureau does not doubt that in the center of the CPY, there are sufficiently sound elements who are truly loyal to Marxism-Leninism, who are loyal to the CPY's international line tradition, and who are loyal to the socialist united front.

These sound elements of the CPY have a purpose: they will force their current party leaders to openly and faithfully admit the mistakes they have made and correct them, while separating from nationalism and arranging various methods to resist the socialist united front of imperialism. Or, if it proves that the current leaders of the CPY are unable to undertake this work, then sound elements will rise up and take their place, rising from the lower levels to build the leadership of the CPY's new international line. The Communist Information Bureau has no doubt that the Yugoslav Communist Party can accomplish this task.

### No Result in Adjusting Freight Rates; Private Vessels Refuse to Transport Japanese Supplies

The second batch of Japanese reparations supplies, totaling a relatively small amount of over 15,000 tons, of which 3,000 tons have already been shipped to Shanghai, with the transportation of the remaining 12,000 tons again reaching an impasse. The reason is that the freight rates for transporting Japanese reparations supplies were too low for the private shipping companies in this city, and their request for adjustment has not yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, at present, all private shipping companies are uniformly refusing to transport Japanese reparations supplies. Currently, only the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is solely responsible for transportation, and it is expected that the completion date for transporting the second batch of Japanese reparations supplies will be delayed by about two weeks. Furthermore, the quantity and types of materials in the third batch of Japanese reparations supplies have not yet been approved by the Allied Headquarters, so the date for commencing their transportation to China is also difficult to determine.

### Shipping Industry Adjusts Freight Rates, Scheduled for Implementation on the 17th

### China Farmers Bank Loans Chemical Fertilizer of 800 Tons in Jiangsu Province

Entrusted by the National Bank, the China Farmers Bank has loaned 800 tons of chemical fertilizer in Jiangsu Province. The distribution areas include Wujiang 400 tons, Suzhou 50 tons, Jiading 200 tons, Shanghai County and City and reserve amount 150 tons. The method is based on the principle of lending in kind and receiving in kind, that is, farmers' groups and village cooperatives that borrow one jin of chemical fertilizer should accept two jin of rice, and pay 30% of the grain in advance when borrowing, and pay the remainder at the autumn harvest. At that time, the Farmers Bank will process it and hand it over to the National Bank to enrich the people's food.

### Air-Conditioned Train Service Postponed

### Postal and Telecommunications Bureaus in Extreme Difficulty

[Reported by this newspaper] The long-brewing postal and telecommunications price increase has not been approved by the Legislative Yuan, and the finances of the postal and telecommunications bureaus in this city are in extreme difficulty. It is rumored that the Telecommunications Bureau is unable to cope with the payroll period of the 16th of this month and applied for a loan of 200 billion yuan from the Bank of Communications, but the Bank of Communications only approved half. Director Yu has been running around trying to find a solution for this matter. The Postal Bureau has always been a loss-making institution, and in today's era of constantly rising prices, its economic hardship can be imagined. According to a spokesman for the bureau: before the war, the postage for a regular letter was five cents, equivalent to five large pancakes or two newspapers, while today, each large pancake costs 30,000 yuan (yesterday's price), which is a far cry from the 5,000 yuan postage for a regular letter. The application to increase postage to 20,000 yuan per regular letter months ago has not been quickly approved by the Legislative Yuan, and with the current high rate of price increases, 5,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan are only fifty steps and a hundred steps apart, he said with great emotion.

### Japanese Reparations Machine Tools Allocated for Second Batch of Distribution

Originally, it was intended to postpone acceptance, but since they have already arrived in Shanghai, it has been decided to allocate them for the second batch of distribution, with the 320 manufacturers who submitted compliant applications to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce before the April 15th deadline as the distribution targets. The distribution time will begin after the first batch is completed.

### Supplies from the Supply Bureau Flow into the Black Market; Allocation Methods Should be Improved

[Reported by this newspaper] The Supply Bureau previously entrusted 20 retailers in this city to distribute a large number of surplus materials. Due to the limited distribution quantities stipulated by each retailer and the recent severe inflation, most of the materials flowed into the black market, especially the cold drinks such as ice cream powder and lemon powder that are urgently needed in summer. "Scalpers" selling at stalls are everywhere on Albert Road, Tongfu Road, Haining Road, and Yu Qiaqing Road, and their black market prices are often more than double the distribution prices. Citizens who go to the designated retailers to buy them line up early in the morning, but in a short time, they mostly claim that they are sold out, which further creates the phenomenon of "scalpers" holding onto the goods and not selling them, and the black market prices rising step by step. At a time when the government is trying to suppress prices and determined to sell off supplies, the general public hopes that the Supply Bureau can quickly improve the allocation methods and strictly manage or restrict the retailers.

### Wuxi County Government Responds to the Ministry of Food, Rice and Grain Reserves are Not Large, and Tax Grain is Only 70,000 to 80,000 Dan

[Reported by this newspaper from Wuxi on the 13th] The Ministry of Food previously received a telegram from the Mayor of Shanghai requesting a thorough investigation into the hoarding of rice in Wuxi. In addition to telegraphing the Wuxi County Government to conduct a thorough investigation, it also sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi for an on-site investigation. It is learned that the Wuxi County Government has submitted the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Food, stating that the current reserves are not large, and due to recent high demand and brisk sales, half of the reserves have been depleted in several days. According to the situation before the war, the reserves in Wuxi were around 3,000,000 shi, which is far from the current reserves. Furthermore, the Mayor of Shanghai telegraphed Premier Weng requesting a thorough investigation into the hoarding of large quantities of grain in Wuxi under the guise of tax grain. It is learned that the amount of tax grain purchased and stored in Wuxi by various counties is only 70,000 to 80,000 dan. Due to the lack of grain for price stabilization sales, it is also planned to add a commission for price stabilization sales. Furthermore, the price of goods in Wuxi City continues to rise amid the investigation, and the market still lacks opening. White japonica rice is sold for 30,000,000 yuan, Yangxian rice for 29,500,000 yuan, Buxian rice for 29,000,000 yuan, wheat for 20,500,000 yuan, and soybean oil for 65,000,000 yuan.

### Major Fire on Changning Road in Broad Daylight; Celluloid Factory Causes Disaster; Neighbors Suffer Heavy Losses; Casualties Reach Fifteen

[Reported by this newspaper] A fire broke out at the Mei Hua Celluloid Factory at No. 200, Lane 296, Changning Road, West Shanghai, at 10:10 AM yesterday, resulting in as many as fifteen casualties. The Mei Hua Celluloid Factory is located on the outer layer of the premises, and the inner section of the house is rented to the Shanghai Machine-Made Button Factory. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out in the Mei Hua Factory. The raw materials stored were all flammable materials such as waste film, collodion, and alcohol. Therefore, once ignited, the flames soared into the sky, becoming a prairie fire. In an instant, it affected the warehouses of the Shanghai Button Factory, etc. A total of more than ten houses were burned down, including the entire warehouse, two machine rooms, two drying rooms, a building behind the Zhongxing Wood Company, the floors of the buildings at No. 232 where the Jin He Shang lived, No. 234, the Qinglong Noodle Cooking Factory at No. 244, the Bean Sprout Workshop at No. 242, and a resident at No. 240. The Shanghai Button Factory had more than 40 tons of raw materials "tree fruit" and 15 barrels of film, which were also all destroyed.

After receiving the report, the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau was led by Sub-Bureau Chief Shao and Section Chiefs Lu Xui Rui and Shi Jairen, officers Zhu Yingzhang and plainclothes police to maintain order on the scene. At the same time, fire brigades from Jing'an Temple, Huashan Road, and Yichang Road districts drove to the scene, and vehicles from private Zhenru and Caojiadu fire brigades also dispatched one after another. Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Chief of Staff of the General Team Ye Binyong, personally arrived on the scene to direct operations, until the fire was brought under control at 11:00 AM and extinguished by noon. Afterwards, the police officers took the arsonist, Wang, to the sub-bureau for interrogation. It is learned that the cause of the fire was a damaged motor in the sawing room, sparks flying out and landing on a pile of raw materials, resulting in a major disaster.

When the fire broke out, some workers from both factories could not escape and were buried in the fire, including: Su Zhongliang (plasterer, 22 years old, from Suzhou), Ye Yihai (22 years old, from Xuzhou). The injured included Shen Chengkang (34 years old, burns to hands, back, and feet), Yao Awu (female worker, 42 years old, injuries to back and left arm), Wang Lanzhen (female worker, 14 years old, injured left leg), Wang Xiaomei (female worker, 50 years old, injuries to hands and feet), Lai Qifu (male worker, 26 years old, injured right arm), Cheng Hengcai (25 years old, injured right arm), Zhang Yunan (23 years old, injured back), Chen Modao (26 years old, injured neck), Lu Binfu (injured neck and right palm), Zong Baoqing (injured north arm), Li Binghe (19 years old, injuries to hands and back), Ju Yuanxing (18 years old, injured head and face, in critical condition), Gu Xiangjuan (45 years old, injuries to left and right elbows), and 13 others. The above-mentioned injured male and female workers were sent to the Red Cross Hospital by police car for treatment.

### The Two Banks' Staff and Workers Employ a Hunger Strike, Proposing Adjustments to Their Remuneration and Continuing to Work While Awaiting a Resolution.

[Report from our Newspaper] Approximately 600 employees of the Siming Bank Shanghai Branch at 240 Beijing Road, its five sub-branches at Nanjing Road, Lin Sen Central Road, Hongkou, Carter Road, and Minguo Road, and the bank's warehouses have initiated a hunger strike as of yesterday. In the afternoon, reporters visited and observed that the employees continued to work as usual, but did not eat lunch. According to bank employees, "Colleagues collectively signed a request to the bank for a reasonable minimum living wage. The bank has yet to provide a formal response, only stating that it has been submitted to a board of directors meeting without a scheduled date. Colleagues are enduring skyrocketing prices, with rice already costing over 30 million yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), making each day feel like a year, and we can no longer wait. Moreover, we understand that other banks' minimum wages for clerks in July, for example, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank has already exceeded 100 million yuan, the 'Four Banks and Two Bureaus', the Central Industrial Bank, and the National Products Bank are above 90 million yuan, and the 'Four Banks and One Association', the China Trust Bank, are above 80 million yuan. Looking back at what our colleagues received in June, only 22.2 million, which, based on the June cost of living index of 560,000 times, means our base salary is only about 40 yuan, how can we cope with the continued rise in July? Furthermore, considering that the bank's administrative expenses are higher than personnel expenses, it is even clearer how meager our colleagues' remuneration is. Today, in order to request the bank to consider the difficult lives of our colleagues and immediately agree to our demand to use a base salary of 100 yuan based on the current month's cost of living index as the basis for calculation, we have decided to fast starting from noon today, awaiting a response." After the employees implemented the hunger strike yesterday, the bank convened a meeting of the standing directors at the 240 Beijing Road branch to discuss the employees' demands. As of 8:00 PM last night, there was still no resolution, and negotiations will continue today.

Furthermore, the employees of the China & South Sea Bank Shanghai Branch at 7 Zhongzheng East 1st Road have also initiated a hunger strike due to remuneration issues since the day before. Yesterday, employees of the five sub-branches at Henan Road, Lin Sen Central Road, Jing'an Temple, 16 Pu, and Yushichang successively responded, but the employees continued to work as usual.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Denies Changes to the Arbitration of Department Store Salaries

The dispute over the salaries of department store employees was already arbitrated by the Social Affairs Bureau earlier this week. It was determined that the annual workers' salaries would be increased by three yuan, and the performance appraisals would be carried out by the companies themselves. Yesterday morning, the representatives of the Universal Department Store Association, Li Kangnian (manager of the National Products Company), Mai Youyun (secretary of the Wing On Company), and Liang Bingjian (secretary of the Sincere Company), visited Shen Ding, the director of the Labor Affairs Department, to request two points regarding the arbitration decision: (1) to combine the annual salary increase and performance appraisal; (2) to reduce the figures again. Director Shen stated that the arbitration had been finalized and did not allow changes. He immediately advised the representatives to abide by the arbitration decision to avoid disputes.

### Yesterday, the City Was Abnormally Sultry Due to a Warm Air Mass.

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, the city was under the influence of a Pacific warm air mass and a southeastern tropical air current, resulting in abnormally sultry weather.

### Fan Shaozeng Was Sued and Sentenced for a Real Estate Dispute.

[Report from our Newspaper] The Mobil Oil Company, due to business needs, purchased from Fan Shaozeng on August 1, 1947, the mansion located at 11 Donghu Road in this city, along with 3 mu, 7 fen, 8 li, and 8 hao (units of area) of land. At that time, the company paid a price of 4.23 billion national currency, and the two parties jointly applied to the Executive Yuan for approval, and subsequently requested the city government to approve the transfer. However, the relevant contracts for the real estate were not handed over, and Mobil's negotiations with him were ineffective. Therefore, Mobil filed a lawsuit with the district court, believing that the real estate had been approved by the Executive Yuan and was lawful, and sued the defendant, along with the guarantors Zhu Linxi of the Chongqing Commercial Bank Shanghai Branch, Wang Fangqiao of the Fuhua Bank, and Ji Juefen, to be responsible for fulfilling the transfer contract, and ordered the Bank of China to hand over the receipt from the Land Administration Bureau. The district court ruled yesterday that: the defendant Fan Shaozeng should transfer the house and land at 11 Donghu Road, 3 mu, 7 fen, 8 li, and 8 hao, and the relevant contract and the receipt from the Land Administration Bureau to the plaintiff, and jointly apply to the city government for approval to obtain the land ownership certificate in the plaintiff's name. If this is not fulfilled, the defendants Chongqing Commercial Bank and Fuhua Bank should jointly fulfill it. The defendant Bank of China should hand over the receipt from the Land Administration Bureau to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff provides a guarantee of 1 billion yuan, a preliminary execution will be announced. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant Fan Shaozeng.

### Disaster Originates from Words: A Tobacco Shop Is Brutally Vandalized.

[Report from our Newspaper] At around 5:00 PM yesterday, a worker from the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department came to the Yongmao Tobacco Shop at 1637 Zhonghua Road, Fangbang Road in the South City with a 5 million yuan check from the Bank of China to buy a pack of Brandy cigarettes. A shop assistant, Ye Bangting, replied that they did not have that much money to give change, which led to a conflict. Nearby officers arrived to mediate and resolved the matter. Before the worker left, he was subjected to harsh words by the manager of the shop, Yu Wenda. Less than an hour after the worker left, he gathered 70 to 80 workers, who arrived in two trucks, parked at Laoximen, and swarmed in. They were all armed with leather whips, wooden sticks, and iron rulers, and they smashed all the counters, showcases, cigarettes, soaps, and other goods in the Yongmao shop, and severely beat the shop assistants Yu Xinhao and Yu Xinchuan, and dragged Ye Bangting onto a truck and left. Fortunately, the officers contacted the branch office by phone and reported to the main office, which dispatched a flying fortress to chase after them. They were finally caught at Xiaoximen, and Ye Bangting was released. The case is now being handled impartially by the police station.

### Fishmongers Are Attacked by Scalpers: Guns and Axes Are Used, and Seven People Are Injured.

[Report from our Newspaper] Recently, it was discovered that scalpers were directly purchasing goods from fishing boats at the fish market, which aroused the anger of the fishmongers in the market, who agreed to fight in the market at around 1:00 AM yesterday. After receiving the report, the Yulin Road Police Branch, led by the branch chief Zhou Weiting and the section chief Rong Yongzhao, led a large number of police officers to ambush around the market. No scalpers were seen until three trucks of fishmongers arrived. They were stopped and claimed that they were only there to buy goods and had no intention of fighting. The police officers then released them. After the three trucks entered the market, they saw that no one had arrived from the other side, so they retreated. Unexpectedly, when passing through the area of Fulu Street, Baidaitou, the ambushing scalpers suddenly attacked, surrounded the trucks, and fired shots as a warning. They also used iron rulers and sharp axes to injure seven fishmongers, including Xu Binchun (injured in the chest and legs), Chen Jianxiu (injured in the face and back), Yuan Rongchun (injured in the back), Chen Wanjia (injured in the back), Weng Shenbao (injured in the back and abdomen), Wang Jincai (injured in the back), and Zhang Xiaoyang (injured in the left leg). The scalpers then dispersed. The Yulin Road Branch rushed to the scene after hearing the news and only arrested one suspect, Hu Zhongren. The injured were sent to the Public Aid Shanghai East and other hospitals for treatment.

### The Speaker Donates His Winnings as a Special Contribution: The Security Police Abstain From Food for One Day to Aid Disaster Relief, and the Mayor Commends and Returns the Original Funds.

[Report from our Newspaper] Pan Gongzhan, the Speaker of the City Council, had intended to donate 500 million yuan to promote disaster relief by the end of May. However, due to the serious illness and death of his second son, Wei Zhen, he did not write to Mayor Wu until June 10, reiterating his intention to donate and depositing the funds with the Shenbao Accounting Department, but the authorities were slow to collect it. At the beginning of this month, Pan entrusted Bao, the Deputy General Manager of the City Bank, to withdraw the funds and deliver them to Mayor Wu to forward to the Special Disaster Relief Donation Solicitation Committee. After receiving the funds, the mayor wrote back to Pan, expressing his deep gratitude.

[Another Report] The entire police force of the First Regiment of the Municipal Police Bureau's Security Police, in response to the special disaster relief donation, collectively abstained from food for one day and donated all of the funds, 72.9 million national currency, requesting Mayor Wu to review and forward it. After receiving the report, Mayor Wu returned the original check, stating that the police's living conditions were already extremely difficult and they were not the target of the special disaster relief donation. He also issued an order to commend the entire team for their abstaining from food to aid disaster relief, expressing his deep gratitude.

### Finch FRS—140C Facsimile Telegraph Machine

— Yi Xiaodong

The Finch FRS—140C facsimile telegraph machine is designed specifically for transmitting official documents and letters. Its sending and receiving components are housed within a single casing, offering an aesthetically pleasing appearance and precise mechanisms. Although the circuitry is complex, the wiring is compact, and small vacuum tubes are used, minimizing the space it occupies. As a result, the entire machine is about the size of a teletype machine. The operational method is mostly automated, making it very convenient. The operator does not need special skills. However, if a malfunction occurs, the closely packed components may make it difficult to quickly repair. A brief description of its circuit and mechanical parts is provided below, along with a comparison to the facsimile telegraph machines currently used by our bureau from Western Union.

This facsimile telegraph machine has both its receiving and sending components housed in the same casing, each with a rotating drum driven by a synchronous motor, rotating at the same speed of 180 revolutions per minute. The light source, photocell, and amplifier of the sending component are all mounted on a carriage. For every 105 rotations of the sending drum, the carriage moves one inch to the right, parallel to the drum's axis. Therefore, the scanning density is 105 lines per inch. Our bureau's existing Western Union facsimile machine also has a drum speed of 180 revolutions per minute and a scanning density of 100 lines per inch. Therefore, in terms of receiving detail and transmission speed, the two are only slightly different.

The receiving method of this machine involves a raised helical groove on the surface of the receiving drum, with the pitch equal to the length of the drum, and the drum length equal to the circumference of the sending drum. There is also a printing bar parallel to the drum's axis, pressed against the drum. As the drum rotates, the contact point between the printing bar and the drum represents the various points on the helical groove. The receiving paper moves upwards between the printing bar and the drum. Each rotation of the drum scans one line onto the paper. After 105 rotations, the receiving paper moves one inch upwards, so the number of times the contact point scans the paper is exactly equal to the number of times the original document is scanned by the light source. The receiving paper is a special electrochemical paper. The signal current is applied to the drum, flows from the helical groove through the receiving paper and the printing bar, and then returns to the power source. The areas of the receiving paper where the current flows turn black, and the degree of blackening is approximately proportional to the strength of the current. Therefore, it can also receive photographs and drawings of varying shades. Testing has shown that its performance seems to be better than the receiving method used by Western Union. The receiving paper used is an 8-inch wide paper roll that moves continuously upwards between the drum and the printing bar. Therefore, there is no need to change the paper after each receipt, and the operator can observe the receiving process to see if it is good and notify the other party to adjust or resend at any time. However, this type of receiving paper must be kept at an appropriate humidity, which is an inconvenience.

The loading and unloading of the original document for sending are both automatic, but the width of the sending paper must be between 8 inches and 2 inches, and the length can be up to /1 inch. The original document for sending is attached to the drum by two rows of small nails, which leave nail holes on both sides of the paper. If the automatic mechanism malfunctions slightly, it may damage the original document and prevent it from being sent. A malfunction of the automatic unloading mechanism may also damage the original document, which is a drawback of this machine.

In terms of photoelectric components, a focused light source is used to illuminate the original document, and the reflected light is directed onto a photocell. At this time, the output of the photocell is a direct current pulsating current, which is amplified by a DC amplifier 6AG5 to obtain an inverted output - the output is greatest when the light source scans a black area, and the smallest when it scans a white area - another identical amplifier 6AG5 has an output that balances the output of the first one, the purpose of which is to prevent distortion of the output.

The modulation method of this machine uses a balanced modulator, with two 6BE tubes connected in a push-pull configuration. An oscillator 6AG5 generates the required subcarrier - 1700 Hz - using a phase inverter 6AG5, two carriers with the same amplitude but opposite phases are obtained and input to the second grids of the two balanced modulator tubes. The signal voltage output from the balanced amplifier is simultaneously input to the first grids of the two tubes, and an amplitude modulated wave is generated in the plate circuit. The original pulsating signal voltage is not present in the output, so transient voltages are eliminated.

The modulation method of the Western Union facsimile machine uses a mechanical chopper, so the output of its photocell is direct current, which can use an audio amplifier. That is its advantage, but the chopper is installed in the optical system and feels quite bulky. Its carrier frequency is neither stable nor easy to be symmetrical, not as good as Finch's using an oscillator.

After modulation, the signal is finally amplified by a 6J6 tube and connected to the output line. At the same time, a portion is sent to the receiving component of this machine, so that the sending end operator can monitor the quality of the transmission.

The circuit of the receiving component is relatively simple. After amplification by 6BE6, 6AG5, and two 6V6 tubes in parallel, and rectification by a selenium rectifier, the original direct current pulsating current is obtained, which is connected to the receiving drum and draws a copy of the original document on the receiving paper.

Another part is the automatic phasing equipment. This machine connects a relay between the receiving end motor and the power supply. The action of the relay cuts off the power supply, causing the synchronous motor to slip, changing the relative position of the receiving drum with respect to the sending drum to achieve phasing. The key to controlling the relay is to send a phasing signal after each rotation of the sending drum. The sending drum axis is equipped with four cams of different shapes. The first and second cams are connected in parallel to the plate circuit of the last stage amplifier of the sending circuit. Normally, the first cam connects the plate voltage, so the signal current is output. However, when the light source finishes scanning one line of the sending and starts the second line, corresponding to a time of 45 degrees of drum rotation - because the sending paper is shorter than the circumference of the drum, so there is no signal current output during this time - the first cam cuts off the plate voltage of the amplifier tube, but during 25 degrees of this 45 degrees, the second cam connects the plate voltage. At this time, the third cam has cut off the anode voltage of the photocell, with the cut-off time corresponding to 35 degrees of the 45 degrees. Therefore, the output of the amplifier tube is actually a completely black signal corresponding to 25 degrees long, with a white signal of 10 degrees before and after this black signal. Each rotation of the drum, i.e., each time the light source scans a line, has this signal output. This is the phasing signal.

After the receiving end receives this phasing signal, it is amplified together with the signal current by the 6BE6 and 6AG5 stages, and then input to the automatic phasing circuit through a cathode coupler. This circuit has two phasing tubes (2-6AG5), and their screen grid voltages are controlled by the fourth cam on the drum axis. Normally, there is no voltage, only when the light source scans between the two lines, corresponding to 7 degrees of one drum rotation - i.e., the middle 7 degrees of the above 45 degrees - the voltage is connected. If the phasing signal is appropriately input at this time, after the circuit with the two clipping tubes (the two parts of the dual diode 6AL5) and the two phasing tubes, it has no effect on the multivibrator 6J6, and the relay also has no effect. The motor drives the drum to rotate as before. This situation indicates that the relative positions of the two drums at the sending and receiving ends are correct, i.e., they are in phase. However, when the phasing signal is input to the phasing circuit, and the phasing tube screen grid has no voltage - due to the different relative positions of the two drums - the second phasing tube outputs current, causing the multivibrator to have a trigger effect, and the amplifier (6AG5) connected to this tube generates a plate current. This current passes through the relay coil, causing the relay to act and cut off the motor power supply. The duration of the cut-off is sufficient to cause the motor to slip a small angular distance, thus causing the receiving drum to pause for a moment. If the position of the drum after the pause is still different from the sending drum, and the timing of the phasing signal still does not match the time when the phasing tube is applied with the screen grid voltage, the relay acts again, until the relative positions of the two drums are correct before stopping. At this time, phasing is achieved, and then the two motors drive the drum to rotate in the normal state.

This kind of phasing equipment seems too complicated in this small facsimile machine. Because when the power supplies of the sending and receiving machines are the same, it is only necessary to obtain phasing at the beginning of the start-up, and then phasing can be maintained. If the power supplies at the two ends are different, it is necessary to add a synchronous power supply equipment, so it is only necessary to obtain phasing at the beginning. This equipment sends out phasing signals every week, in addition to the initial few signals, the rest of the signals seem to have no effect. The bureau's Western Union facsimile machine automatically phases at the beginning of each report, and the circuit used is simpler, but when the transmission circuit conditions change, manual adjustment is still required. The two seem to have their own advantages and disadvantages.

In summary, the Finch facsimile machine is more modern, and the test results are satisfactory. However, if the mechanical aspects can be made more precise, flexible, durable, and undamaged, it would be quite adoptable.

### The Story of Telegraph Registration

— Hong Dinghua

The Beginning of the Story

One day, a simple and sincere face asked the lady at the public service desk:

"Miss, where do I register for a telegraph?"

"Send a telegraph... register where?" The lady's surprised gaze rested on the stranger's face. In her mind, she thought that this customer must have made a mistake. Thus, with the politeness and responsibility that a salesperson should have, she explained, not fearing the tediousness:

"Sir, you're mistaken. You don't need to register to send a telegraph." She opened the drawer and took out a piece of paper: "This is a telegraph form. Please take it, fill it out, and hand it in at window number four."

What is "Telegraph Registration?"

Sending a telegraph requires registration; that was a misunderstanding. It turned out that something called "Telegraph Registration" was at play in that person's mind. So, what exactly is "Telegraph Registration"? Here, let's first give it a definition.

"Telegraph Registration" is a number that a user registers with the telecommunications bureau, representing the user's name and address. By using this registration, the user can obtain convenience when sending telegrams and save unnecessary telegraph costs.

Now, let's talk about its first benefit—convenience and speed.

After you have registered a telegraph registration number, your branch offices, business associates, or friends in other locations can use it to send you telegrams. (Of course, you must first let them know what "number" you've "registered.") The telecommunications bureau handles telegrams for registered users more simply than for general telegrams, using a ready-made wooden stamp (which will be discussed below) to stamp on the telegram envelope to replace the trouble of manual writing and to avoid errors, and also to achieve the purpose of speed.

Let's talk about its second benefit—saving telegraph costs.

Suppose you want to send a telegram to "Dahua Enterprise Company, No. 135 Linsen Road, Chongqing." Counting the words, apart from "Chongqing," which is calculated as one word according to regulations, the recipient's address alone has sixteen words. (Even if you write 135 in parentheses as (135), it still requires twelve words.) Now, suppose the registration number of that Dahua Company at the local telecommunications bureau is 1129. Then, this messy, long address of sixteen words becomes simple, with just "1129 Chongqing," which is counted as two words. It saves fourteen words compared to the original. Assuming that an ordinary telegram costs one million per word, you can save fourteen million at a time. If it's urgent, you save twenty-eight million. If you average one telegram per day, you'll accumulate more than eight million in a month. What about in a year? More than one hundred million will be spent, plus the interest. Isn't it an even bigger loss?

How to Register Your "Telegraph Registration?"

The telecommunications bureau serves the public by not only speeding up telegrams but also planning for the economic benefits of its users everywhere. "Telegraph Registration" is a clear example.

So, how do you get a registration number? Here are some ways to do it:

Telegraph registrations are divided into two types: Chinese and foreign. Chinese registrations consist of four Arabic numerals. Foreign registrations consist of four or more, but no more than ten, English letters. However, because the situation in Shanghai is special, the 10,000 Chinese registrations from 0000 to 9999 are not enough. Starting from January 7th of this year, six-digit registrations have been exceptionally adopted. This way, the quota can be expanded, and users will not be turned away.

You probably still remember that in the past, on the first day of each month, there was a long line of people at the entrance of the telecommunications bureau early in the morning, all squeezing to register. Some even came from far away, but went back empty-handed because they couldn't get a registration. Since the adoption of six-digit registrations, this situation no longer exists. Users can register for a number at any time.

The validity period of a telegraph registration is divided into two types: long-term for one year and short-term for three months. The registration fee is 1.2 million for one year and 300,000 for three months, paid in full at one time.

Having understood these things, you can now go to the registration group (No. 25 Changzhi Road) of the telecommunications bureau to get a telegraph registration application form. Fill in the registration number, household, address, telephone number, and registration period on the form, sign and seal it, and submit it to the clerk inside along with the registration fee.

Here is a point that you need to pay attention to. If you are registering for a Chinese registration number, leave the "registration number" column blank. The telecommunications bureau will give you an appropriate number based on which area your address belongs to. It's not up to you to pick or designate, because Shanghai users are really crowded and your chosen registration number might already be taken.

If you are registering for a foreign registration number, please do not use proper nouns such as the names of countries, provinces, or cities, or other common nouns. The ideal is to use the initials of the company's name plus a CO. For example, the registration number of Far Eastern Sanitary CO. is FESCO.

After you receive a telegraph registration certificate from the registration group clerk, you can start using it after three days.

To speed up the delivery of your telegram, you need to prepare a rubber stamp that is 1 inch long and ½ inch wide, and have your "registration number," "name," "address," and "telephone" engraved on it, and hand it over to the registration group for use.

Several Points to Note

1. Regarding relocation—when your address is relocated, please notify the registration group in writing so that it can be changed and delivered according to the new address. If your new address is in another area (the telecommunications bureau's delivery area is different from the post office's), you must send the original registration certificate to the registration group for cancellation and receive a new registration number and a new certificate.

2. Regarding expiration—three days before the registration expires, the registration group will send you a "Telegraph Registration Expiration Notice Card." If you want to continue using the registration, please fill it out as instructed, sign and seal it, and send it to the registration group along with the registration fee payable to receive a new certificate. If you do not intend to renew, the registration will be invalid on the day after the expiration date. However, for the convenience of users, long-term registrations will be tried once within two months after expiration, and short-term registrations will be tried once within one month after expiration. After the expiration date, delivery will be stopped.

3. Regarding transfer—telegraph registrations cannot be transferred to others to avoid confusion. However, if the company is reorganized or for other reasons and needs to change the name, you can apply in writing, stating the reasons in detail, and continue to use it after paying another fee, otherwise it will be cancelled.

Telegraph Registration Today

Telegraph registration is now widely used. According to the latest statistics from the registration group, there are more than 13,000 Chinese registrations and more than 6,000 foreign registrations. There are also dozens of new applications for registration every day.

Telegraph registration will give you many conveniences, indirectly help the development of your career, and the cost is not expensive. So, friends, please go to the telecommunications bureau to register a number!

### The Innovation of Telegraph Codes

— Zhang Binhui

—Introduction to Idiom Code Book

In recent years, in order to reduce the number of words in telegrams, people in China who use telegrams often compile consecutive words or common idioms into telegraph codes. Although this is a good method, it is mostly limited to a certain unit or a certain specialized business. Not only is the scope of application too narrow, but it is also not perfect and cannot be used universally. Sometimes, because the meaning of the telegraph words is unclear, the telecommunications bureau calculates the fees as if they were codes, so there is not much saving for the person sending the telegram.

In view of these shortcomings, the Ministry of Communications appointed several experts in the field of telecommunications to study and collect various materials, including the names of various agencies and commonly used phrases in telegrams in various businesses, as well as various nouns related to daily life, to compile a book of idiom codes that can be used by the public. Using a new classification method to facilitate character retrieval. The advantages of this newly compiled code book are:

First, it saves telegraph costs. One code can replace a group of words.

Second, because one code replaces a group of words, the efficiency of telegraph transmission is also greatly improved. Both the translation process and the telegraph transmission are shortened, and the efficiency of telecommunications is improved.

Third, in terms of materials, it also saves a lot of labor and materials.

Fourth, in terms of manpower, the translation of codes and the processing of telegrams can save a lot of procedures.

Fifth, the collection of idioms is extensive and can be widely applied.

Sixth, the classification and arrangement are novel, making it very convenient to translate codes or words.

Seventh, the content is substantial. After the main text, it is also accompanied by phonetic symbols, English letters, various commonly used symbols, calendar rhyme titles, contemporary names, foreign place names, etc., for reference.

The creation of idiom codes is indeed a new contribution to the telecommunications industry. The book is divided into two volumes, upper and lower, with a total of 100,000 codes. All single characters in the newly compiled code are included, so the application is very convenient. The book is expected to be published in mid-October, and reservations are now being accepted from today. The cost of each book (two volumes) is temporarily set at 1.5 million for reservations. The reservation period ends at the end of August this year. The location for making reservations is the Business Inspection Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau on Fuzhou Road.

### Shanghai Dental College Hospital Entrusts This Column to Solicit Preferential Treatment Vouchers

Shanghai Dental College, located at No. 40 Fuxing West Road in this city, has observed that students and teachers often suffer from dental diseases, and are often unable to find time for diagnosis and treatment due to schoolwork and teaching duties, allowing the diseases to spread, which greatly affects their health. Therefore, during the summer vacation of this year, it launched a free dental treatment campaign for the academic community, with a quota of 200 people. All dental patients who are students of any grade or faculty and staff of any school may apply for diagnosis and treatment. Application procedures are still handled by this newspaper on their behalf. A written application form must be filled out, stating the applicant's name, address, and the name of the school they attend or work for, and certified by the principal's seal. Enclose with the application letter a stamped envelope with the address and the recipient's name. Those who pass the review by this newspaper will be issued a free treatment voucher, which can be used to seek treatment at the hospital.

Telecommunication Knowledge Talk (12) Zhang Jiayu

Fifth Lecture: Writing in Telegrams (Continued)

Although Chinese cipher telegrams are written in Chinese, when translated into code for transmission, they are not newly translated according to the Ministry of Transportation's new codebook. Instead, they are translated according to a different codebook mutually agreed upon by the sender and receiver. Therefore, unless one possesses the same codebook, the contents of the telegram cannot be understood. Even the telegraph office staff handling the telegram are no exception. The characteristic of cipher telegrams is that they easily maintain confidentiality. According to the Ministry of Transportation's regulations, Chinese ciphers are limited to groups of four or five numerals.

Speaking of this, perhaps some readers, recognizing the confidentiality benefits of using ciphers, intend to try sending telegrams in code. Then, the author can conveniently tell you some good news: for the benefit of customers, the Ministry of Transportation has long hired experts since before the war to compile Chinese idiom ciphers. Each cipher group can replace up to fourteen characters, which is not only confidential but also cost-effective. It is currently being typeset and will soon be published for sale.

Plain language telegrams in foreign languages are telegrams written in a certain foreign language. The meaning must be clear, the sentences must be coherent, and the original interpretation of the words must not be lost. The use of letters or numeral combinations without secret meanings is also permitted in plain language telegrams, such as telegraphic registered addresses, business logos, exchange rates, and various abbreviations commonly used in general or commercial correspondence, such as FOB, CIF, CAF, SVP, LBS, YD, DR, DORS, STLG, and so on.

Foreign language code is stipulated to be formed of five letters in a group, translated according to a secret codebook agreed upon by the sender and receiver. Its characteristic is not only confidentiality, but also cost-effectiveness. Various countries in Europe and America have complete foreign language idiom codebooks for distribution. Shanghai bookstores or used bookstores sometimes sell them. The rate for international code telegrams is 40% cheaper than for similar plain language telegrams, so most agencies and businesses with more international telegrams usually send telegrams in code.

Foreign language composed words include: (1) single or grouped foreign language letters, not in groups of five letters (as in foreign language code), and without a clear explanation, or (2) superficially complete foreign language words, but with disjointed sentences that do not conform to the original meaning of the words, or (3) single numerals or numeral combinations with secret meanings.

Telegraph offices can accept telegrams written in a combination of Chinese and foreign languages, or plain and cipher languages. The only exception is that any mixed combination of numerals and letters containing secret meanings, or a combination of letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, is strictly prohibited. (End of Lecture 5)

Lecture 6: How to Calculate the Number of Words

"Knowing how, but not knowing why" is a common saying that accurately points out that relying solely on experience is insufficient in everything. Taking the drafting of telegrams as an example, due to my professional duties, I sometimes need to review old telegrams and have found that senders who frequently send telegrams usually know how to write the draft simply and concisely. However, in our professional opinion, not only is the saying "fewer words, lower cost" not an absolute rule, even if the original telegram draft is written as is, there is no more economical way to write it. As long as readers are familiar with telegraph regulations and use them flexibly at any time, they can certainly achieve the ultimate goal of "obtaining the greatest effect at the smallest cost."

On a telegram form, the addressee's name and address and the telegram text are the two main parts that occupy the most words. Except for a few special exceptions, the latter generally contains more words than the former. Various methods of saving words in the addressee's name and address, such as using telegraphic registered addresses, telephone numbers, and PO box numbers as mentioned earlier to replace the addressee's name and address, are simple procedures, but require the cooperation of the addressee to achieve. In other words, if the addressee does not apply for registration at the local telegraph office, or does not have a telephone installed, or does not rent a PO box, then the sender's wish to reduce the number of words in the addressee's name and address cannot be realized. Therefore, we can also say that the sender can only take the initiative to save on the number of words in the telegram text. What follows is an introduction to various methods of calculating the number of words in telegrams. Precisely because examples of saving words in telegrams can be found everywhere in the draft, I do not intend to passively search for examples in the draft, but rather to actively introduce the basic methods used by telegraph offices to calculate the number of words in telegrams in a comprehensive way. Only in this way can I help all of you thoroughly understand.

### Time Differences Across the Country

The time in various parts of the world is not consistent due to differences in the angle of sunlight. Time is an extremely important factor in telecommunications transmission. Sometimes, due to the difference in time between the sending and receiving locations, the recipient may have doubts about the time required for the telegram's transmission, believing that the telegraph office made a mistake in the telegram's transmission. In fact, it is entirely due to the time difference. I would now like to list the time differences in various parts of our country as follows:

Region Including Provinces Time Difference

1 Central Plains Region

Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, 12:00 noon
Jiangxi, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, Shandong,
Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Xing'an,

### The National Bank Decides to Massively Sell Off Supplies The Market Saw a Slight Decline Yesterday The Authorities Tighten Credit, and Banks Have Huge Clearing Deficits

[Our Reporter] In order to completely suppress prices, the Central Bank has decided to massively sell off supplies. Yesterday, it specially allocated 16,100 bolts of fine cloth bills of lading from Qingfeng and Huayang Factories and requested the Yarn Control Commission to quickly forward them to the Textile Construction Company for sale as much as possible. The rice market in the city was stable yesterday, and prices slightly declined, which is closely related to the authorities' policy of inspecting warehouses and selling off supplies.

According to business circles, in the Legislative Yuan meeting, in addition to firmly opposing the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, when examining the budget, it was decided to balance national fiscal revenue and expenditure by selling US aid materials. All of this has a positive impact on market sentiment. However, due to the concentration of speculative capital in Shanghai, credit remains loose. Unless the selling policy can be implemented persistently, the price situation is still difficult to be optimistic about.

Furthermore, it is reported that the President is particularly concerned that the storm of prices in Shanghai has not disappeared. He has telegraphed Liu Gongyun of the National Bank in recent afternoons to inquire about everything and provide instructions. It is heard that the authorities have decided to start from the root to stabilize prices by massively selling off supplies and tightening credit. The huge clearing deficits of banks and financial institutions yesterday mark the beginning of tightening credit.

Furthermore, it is reported that the money market in the city was loose first and then tight yesterday. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had an unprecedented clearing deficit of 328.73 billion due to the sale of cotton yarn to settle payments yesterday. Among them, the Bank of China had the largest clearing deficit of 117.01 billion, followed by the Central Bank with 110.45 billion, the Bank of Communications with 45.67 billion, the Farmers Bank with 19.49 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau with 20.87 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury with 15.66 billion, and the China Trust Bureau with 42 billion. Large commercial banks and financial institutions had a clearing deficit of 172.11 billion, and small clearing deficits of 276.9 billion. Foreign banks also set an unprecedented record with a total clearing deficit of 120.28 billion.

According to estimates from the Central Bank, due to the lack of cash recently, most commercial banks and financial institutions have been using cashier's checks to meet customer withdrawals. Therefore, it is predicted that some banks and financial institutions will have more difficulty coping after this tightening. The bank estimates that the money market will become tighter again today.

### The National Bank Resumes Cotton Selling Work And Moves Out a Large Amount of Cloth for Sale by China Textile

The long-suspended cotton selling work started again yesterday. China Textile listed prices yesterday, selling cotton on behalf of the Central Bank, and stipulated eight measures: (1) Purchase requests for cotton are temporarily limited to member factories of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association that urgently need to replenish raw materials. (2) Purchasers should fill out the purchase request form themselves, stating the quantity they wish to purchase (unit: city dan) and the unit price per dan, and affix the seal of the yarn factory and the person in charge before dropping it into the box. (3) Purchase requests will be accepted until 11:00 AM. (4) Loans must be paid off today (checks can be paid before 11:00 AM, cashier's checks before 12:00 PM, and cash must be delivered after 12:00 PM). (5) The goods are stored in the Bank of Communications warehouse. (6) The minimum bid price is 230 million. (7) The sale of cotton is ex-warehouse, and the seed impurity and moisture content are in accordance with the regulations. (8) The cotton sold today is Shaanxi cotton.

A total of 300 dan of cotton were sold yesterday, recovering 69 billion national currency. Sales will continue as usual today. In addition, in order to completely suppress prices, the Central Bank has decided to massively sell off supplies. Yesterday, it specially allocated 16,100 bolts of fine cloth bills of lading from Qingfeng and Huayang Factories and requested the Yarn Control Commission to quickly forward them to China Textile for sale as much as possible.

The Yarn Market is Strengthening

The cotton yarn market yesterday rose strongly because the sharp decline the day before aroused the customer gang and reproduction factories to absorb at low prices, and prices were very firm. The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 1.55 billion, up 100 million. The price of 42-count Bao Guang for delivery tomorrow was 1.4 billion, and 32-count Silver Moon initially quoted 1.25 billion for delivery the day before. Later, because the price allocated by the Yarn Control Commission was lower, the final price for same-day delivery was 1.2 billion. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 1.1 billion. Later, due to the tight credit situation of the industry, many sellers sold at high prices, and the price dropped to the 1 billion mark, resulting in a transaction at 1.007 billion. The price for delivery tomorrow was 1.1 billion. The prices of other grades of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 50 million to 70 million or 80 million, with a total of 64 contracts and 237 transactions.

Cotton Cloth is Firm

The cotton cloth market yesterday started firm due to absorption by counter gangs, and the market gradually showed strength. Later, due to the bidding by the Textile Construction Company, dyeing factories were short of funds and sold gray cloth, and cloth merchants also sold to make profits, so the price fell. By the time of closing, the floating space to make up positions turned firm again. The initial price of Longtou fine cloth outside the market was 39.5 million, which once rose to 42 million. Later, due to profit-taking sales, the final transaction price was 37.5 million, and the market closed at 36.5 million, up 1.5 million yuan. Other fine cloths, such as drill, bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth, were also consistently in short supply.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Textile Construction Company's bid price for Caiqiu fine cloth was 33 million to 3.5 million, the price of Sunshine fine cloth was 33.4 million, and the price of Jinlian Miaowu Yuan drill was 35.5 million to 6.5 million.

Furthermore, it is reported that China Textile continued to sell cloth, selling a total of 17,450 bolts yesterday, 520 bed sheets, with a total amount of 572.19 billion yuan. It also sold 880 bolts on behalf of the Yarn Control Commission, with an amount of 29.168 billion yuan. The sale of yarn remained the same, with a total of 288 pieces, with an amount of 29.168 billion yuan.

### Silk is Weakening

The artificial silk market was stable in the morning yesterday but plummeted in the afternoon. The opening price of 120-count Jin San Ma bright silk in the morning was 1.85 billion, which once fell to 1.78 billion. The closing price in the afternoon rose again to 1.83 billion for spot price, and the price for delivery the day before was quoted at 1.92 billion. The opening price in the afternoon rose to as high as 1.98 billion. Suddenly, news of huge clearing deficits of banks and financial institutions caused people's hearts to become weak, and the market plummeted, closing as low as 1.76 billion. Finally, the price outside the market fell further to 1.7 billion yuan.

The factory warp market started firm but then weakened yesterday, with the quoted prices of each grade decreasing by about 150 million yuan compared to the previous day. The high scattered price of 1.95 billion had a few transactions in the morning, and the selling price fell to 1.85 billion in the afternoon, but there were no transactions. The high scattered price of dry warp had a transaction at 1.55 billion in the morning, and the final quoted price also decreased by about 100 million yuan.

The silk fabric market fell yesterday. The spot price of pure silk quilt cover had a maximum transaction of 1.003 billion in the morning, and the closing price fell to 980 million. The price for delivery the day before was 1.002 billion, and the price outside the market in the afternoon fell to around 960 million. The quoted price of checkered crepe de Chine in the morning was 3.4 million, which decreased by about 100,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no transactions.

### New Qihong Tea Will Arrive Soon

[Our Reporter] The new Qimen black tea of this year has not yet been officially launched on the market. It is learned that some of it has been completed and will soon arrive in Shanghai to present new tea. It is also heard that tea merchants there have sent samples to the Anhui Tea Company in the city. It is said that the goods are still not bad, but the asking price is surprisingly high, reaching as high as 100 million yuan per dan. The reason is that the price of tea in our country is roughly based on the price of rice. Now, every 100 jin of tea is worth about two shi of white rice, and the cost of processing and all payments is extremely large, so the seller cannot bear to part with it easily.

Furthermore, it is reported that the tea market, which has been rising for many days, has been slightly dampened by the tight credit situation of buyers. The process finally felt weak and unable to rise. As a result of the closing, the market showed a hovering state, and some varieties were still slightly firm due to the scarcity of supply and demand.

### Wool Textile Industry Asks for Permission to Offset Unexpired Foreign Currency Deposit Slips

[Our Reporter] Representatives of the wool textile industry in the city, Cheng Nianpeng, Tang Hua Ru, Yang Li Ren, etc., visited President Yu of the Central Bank yesterday morning regarding the industry's special foreign currency deposit slips. The industry's foreign currency deposit slips total 3 million US dollars. The representatives requested that those before May 30 be used to offset the import quotas for the fourth and fifth periods, and those after May 30 be settled according to the Central Bank's exchange rate. Mr. Yu's reply at the time was that although this matter was raised by the wool textile industry, it is related to other industries and needs to be studied and investigated before a decision can be made. Representatives of the wool textile industry plan to go to the Central Bank again in one or two days to petition.

Furthermore, it is reported that the import and export industry has repeatedly negotiated with President Yu of the Central Bank on the technical issue of issuing foreign exchange deposit slips for goods arriving at the port without a license. This batch of foreign currency deposit slips is extremely large. In the past, the Central Bank sacrificed selling forward foreign exchange for temporary expediency, but today it has clearly encountered major difficulties because the current shortage of foreign currency holdings of the Central Bank makes payment a major problem. In the past, there was talk of paying at the exchange rate, but the importers firmly opposed it, demanding that the Central Bank fulfill the contract, resulting in a stalemate. It is now learned that the matter is still under detailed study by the financial authorities, and a concrete decision is expected in the coming days.

### Whether the Transport Management Committee Will Be Abolished A Decision Can Be Made in a Short Time

[Our Reporter] It is learned that during the current Legislative Yuan meeting, many legislators advocate abolishing the Transport Management Committee, believing that the committee's functions actually belong to the Central Bank and the Customs. After the division, due to the lack of specialization of functions, many delays are caused. Therefore, they advocate abolishing the committee or moving it to South China. A decision on this matter can be made in a short time.

### Rice Prices Rise Sharply and Then Retreat Slightly Yesterday's Rice Prices Dropped by 500,000 to 1 Million

The rice market has stopped rising and is weakening. Due to the tightening of credit, various non-industry commodities have seen a decline, and people's hearts have turned weak. Although the cargo owners are still trying to raise prices, they already feel weak. Only early rice and indica rice are on the market, and the price is about 1 million lower. White japonica rice outside the market has retreated to within 30 million, at 29.5 million. Thin rice is still standing at the 30 million mark due to its scarcity. Early rice is traded at the limit price, and medium and lower indica rice are mostly within the limit price. All rice has dropped by 500,000 to 1 million, with 3,052 shi arriving yesterday.

Flour is rising. Wheat is scarce and the price is high, so factories sell very little. In addition, the price was lower the previous day, and the cargo owners have the intention to hold up the price, so the market is firm. The early opening price of Lao Che flour once reached 9.4 million, but later retreated to 9.2 million, up 300,000. Bingchuan flour closed at 9.05 million, up 250,000. Red Bee and other miscellaneous brands are unanimously firm by 200,000 to 300,000. Bran is flat, and wheat has not been traded.

Miscellaneous grains have unanimously turned flat. The rise the previous day was too high, and people's hearts are themselves weak. In addition, the tightening of credit has stopped the rising trend. Hankou Zhazadou opened at 14.9 million, but high-quality goods were traded at 15.5 million. Corn is scarce, rising by 1 million. Red sorghum has fallen back by 1 million. Green beans are flat and weak. Sesame supply is comparable, and the market is flat. Raw peanuts are slightly weak, falling by 1 million across the board.

Edible oil saw a small retreat yesterday. Because the price is at a high peak, people's hearts are cold. Moreover, all grains are showing weakness, and credit is tight, so the market is hovering and weak. Soybean oil still struggled at 66 million at the early opening, but finally retreated to 65 million at the close due to more sales. Rapeseed oil was 63 million, down 1 million each. Raw oil and small cart sesame oil were flat. The former was 78 million for pure raw oil, and the latter was 74 million for Jitung small cart oil. Soybean cake is cautious at high levels, and the drop is the largest, falling by 700,000 to 800,000. Raw Renji fell to the 7 million mark.

Furthermore, it is reported that due to the scarcity of rice sources in the city in recent days, the price has been rising. In Wuxi and other areas, a large amount of rice hoarding has been discovered, which has aroused close attention from the central authorities. The Ministry of Food has sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to investigate.

### Market Conditions in Various Places

Zhenjiang [Our Reporter in Zhenjiang, 13th] Rice prices have risen again. The black market price of rice is now 32 million. The Provincial Department of Land and Food has received confidential reports that the Soviet rice plate is now avoiding inspections on the banks of the Yangtze River and is mostly exported from the Jinshan River area. The numbers are very large, and there are suspicions of aiding bandits. The Provincial Security Command has been telegraphed to instruct its subordinates to pay attention.

Suzhou [Our Reporter in Suzhou, 13th] Credit in Suzhou is extremely tight today, and prices of all commodities have been forced to fall back. Only rice prices are still rising. The price of early polished japonica rice is 26 million, the price of secondary white rice is 29 million, and the negotiated price for door sales is 29.9 million, which is an increase of 2.5 million compared to the previous day.

### Zhejiang Tea Exports are Weak and are Eagerly Awaiting Loans for Relief

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 13th] Zhejiang Province's tea exports are weak. The total amount of tea exported from the province in three years is only over 60,000 dan, which is only one-third of the pre-war level. Among them, about 30,000 dan were transported to North Africa, about 12,000 dan were transported to the United States, and about 19,000 dan were transported to England and various places in Europe and Southeast Asia.

The reason is that manufacturers have weak capital, so many abandon picking. This year's tea is approaching its peak season, and the price of raw tea in the producing areas has increased by 20 times compared to last year. Manufacturers are unable to reach it, so manufacturers are eagerly awaiting improvements in the tea loan policy so that the loan method can be adapted to the actual cost of the producing areas.

[Our Dispatch] The allocation of rice for teachers in private primary and secondary schools in this city for August should be distributed by the Civil Food Allocation Committee after each school compiles a roster certified by the Bureau of Education, according to the special rice allocation implementation rules.

### A Demonstration of Teacher-Student Collaboration: Natural Science Exhibition; Radio-Controlled Airplane; Gezhi Products Receive Praise

The Municipal Bureau of Education is holding a large-scale natural science achievement exhibition for middle schools. The writer visited the exhibition on schedule and spent the whole day there, finding it endlessly fascinating.

Firstly, science is often considered dry and uninteresting, making it difficult to arouse public interest. However, the various schools at this exhibition have managed to put on lively performances, which is quite unexpected. In particular, the Gezhi exhibition hall in the first venue had many more animated displays, such as test flights of model airplanes, eruptions of large mountain models, operation of electric train models, color changes in variable color advertising screens, operation of various miniature motors, practical use of molecular models, lantern slide shows, and radio-controlled model airplanes. These were all designed by teachers and made by students. They were demonstrated on the spot during the opening ceremony, earning praise from all sides. Director Li of the Bureau of Education also highly encouraged Lin Hewu, the student who made the self-made control machine, and promised to find a way to donate his personal shortwave radio equipment to him as encouragement. As a result, the Gezhi exhibition hall was truly crowded with people. In addition, the Dade Obstetrics School produced a self-made fertilization model, explaining the principles of fertilization. Furthermore, the Jigui Middle School installed a radio, which was open all day, providing pleasant music, adding much color to the venue. In the second venue, the French Middle School exhibition hall had a larger scale of radio products, with models of the history of radio development, drawn into simple diagrams, and the teacher demonstrated the mechanism, which triggered sound, light and electricity in succession, which was dazzling, it can be called spectacular. Also, the St. Francis Elementary School students made a flat-pack seven-tube radio, the circuit is clear, the manufacturing is exquisite, it is also a rare thing.

Secondly, the models made by the schools are not available from instrument companies, but they do have a great contribution to teaching. In the second venue, the Qingxin Girls' Middle School molecular structure crystal model and price model made it easy for students to understand the original structure of molecules, which greatly helped the teaching function. The complete set of three-dimensional geometry models from China Middle School, with more than a hundred kinds, can be called perfect. The steps of various chemical manufactures in the First Girls' Middle School, with sophisticated structures and clear explanations, are also very valuable products.

Overall, the parts performed by teachers and students in various schools are extremely vivid, and the design part is especially rich in teaching value. At a time when society is extremely unstable and life is difficult to maintain, the principals, teachers, and students of various schools are working tirelessly and burying themselves in hard work, which is truly the glory of the future of the scientific community.

### A Little Dream Talk

— Xuanxuan

At the end of August in the 34th year of the Republic of China, victory had just arrived, and Huang Xiangmao soap was sold everywhere. 50 Legal Tender could buy two blocks (four bars). Today, I went to the cigarette paper store to buy two bars of soap, also Huang Xiangmao, totaling 1,080,000 Legal Tender. Today is July 10th, less than three years from the day of victory, and the price of soap has risen more than 20,000 times. At that time, a news reporter made 50,000 Legal Tender per month, but today they make less than 50 million Legal Tender per month, an increase of less than 1,000 times. In other words, twenty or so people now are only equivalent to one person at that time.

In the summer of the 35th year of the Republic of China, Sunkist oranges flew all over the streets, and 1,000 Legal Tender could buy four to five oranges. National industrialists were worried, thinking that foreign goods should not be allowed to flood the market. Now they really don't flood the market anymore. A month ago, a Sunkist orange was sold for 600,000 Legal Tender, and the national industry is still declining. Those of us who ate Sunkist oranges at that time can't even afford domestic oranges now.

In the spring of the same year, the author bought a bottle of newly arrived Parker ink by the roadside, costing 800 Legal Tender. Later, it became as cheap as 600 Legal Tender. At that time, I was paid 4,000 Legal Tender per thousand words for writing articles, which could buy five bottles of ink, but it was still far less than the pre-war minimum of 2 Legal Tender per thousand words. The other day I bought a bottle of Parker ink, costing 1.2 million Legal Tender. I don't know how many Legal Tender per thousand words I can get for writing with this ink? And when I receive the fee for these thousand words, how much will a bottle of ink be worth?

In this chaotic world, the rich become richer, becoming wealthy and quasi-wealthy families, and the poor become poorer, rolling around in ditches. It is difficult to say that we share the same interests and feel the same pain! When everyone wants to be Yang Mei, they will naturally discover Yang Mei. Yang Mei has not eaten for nine years, and her name is uniquely highlighted after nine years. Where is a certain reason? You can think about more than half of it.

### 高橋 Seaside

— Qi Feng

Before the war, on clear summer days, the Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort was an extremely enticing place to escape the summer heat. In that "paradise" that blended natural and man-made beauty and enjoyment, it had caused many people to linger and be reluctant to leave; amidst the fragrant clothes and elegant hairstyles, it had also created countless stories of joy and sorrow… As time passed in the flames of war and turmoil, surviving the aftermath, I couldn't help but think of it again on this bank of the Huangpu River.

One early summer day, intermittent light rain couldn't stop our longing for Takahashi Seaside. A group of three of us excitedly stepped onto the deck of the city ferry. Leaning on the railing and gazing into the distance, the river breeze brushed our faces, and memories of the past flooded our minds.

When we arrived at Takahashi, it drizzled again. The public bus only went to the town. Fortunately, we had brought bicycles. Seeing that the sun was still faintly hidden in the clouds, and because we were so eager to see the seaside, we ignored the raindrops and rode forward. The road to the seaside was a fairly flat cinder path, with green fields on both sides. Cowherds lazily sat on the backs of cattle, and small bridges spanned flowing streams, all exuding a rural charm. Twenty-five minutes later, we arrived at the seaside.

Everything had changed!

The seaside hotel was reduced to a dilapidated gate, standing lonely in the wind and rain. Entering the gate, there was a large pool of water, surrounded by weeds. The lower floor of the building behind it was still in good condition, perhaps someone lived there, but looking up, the upper floor was empty and dilapidated.

The gate of the seaside bathing resort seemed intact from the outside. Stepping up dozens of stone steps, we could still see the black characters "Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort," but when we got to the top, we couldn't help but gasp. The front and back walls were gone, and the windows were gone. Only a dozen workers were there, sheltering from the rain, staring at us with curious eyes.

We saw the sea – a vast expanse of yellow seawater. A few sparse trees remained along the coast, swaying in the gentle breeze and drizzle. However, what lay before us was still a large, uneven expanse of muddy ground, filled with puddles and overgrown with weeds. Its slope was very steep, and with the mud made slippery by the rain, I tried several times to cross it, but was too afraid of slipping. Finally, I chose a small path paved with pebbles and detoured to the seaside.

The rain gradually stopped, and soon the sun was shining on us, but we felt an unspeakable disappointment and melancholy in our hearts. The seawall had collapsed. Except for a section along the coast that still existed in its original form, the rest of the large stones were piled up in a mess below, and the wooden stakes had sunk into the water, only exposing a row of heads above the surface. A turbid sea stretched out to the boundless horizon, with no beach and no markers.

Surrounding us was unparalleled tranquility, with only the sound of the tide lapping against the shore, emitting a rhythmic, monotonous sound. In the distance, the sea and sky were connected, with sails dotting the horizon. A passenger ship slowly sailed by, and a wisp of light smoke faintly cut through the clear sky.

We looked around and saw no one. The entire seaside only had the three of us as tourists. Recalling how many beautiful and happy souls had once been intoxicated here, how many laughs and cheerful voices had echoed, who would have thought that it would now be so lonely and desolate!

To commemorate our visit, we still took some photos with the sea as the background. Like a sea change, a sense of loss filled our hearts.

Returning in the twilight, it was as if we had lost something, and we only felt empty. The past was just a dream. What else could this trip be considered besides a memorial service!

### The American Book Market

— Ji Mo

In the American book market, there are often entire sets of private collections for sale, among which there are many valuable old books, and the prices are quite expensive. In recent years, due to sluggish sales, the market has been depressed. For example, a copy of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" from 1865, inscribed by the author and gifted to Thomas Penny, was sold for as high as US$15,300 in 1940, but its current market price is US$3,400. Another example is Charles Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" from 1843, with Dickens' inscription, which sold for $450 in 1941, but now sells for $200. The original manuscript of Charles Lamb's play "John Woodvil" sold for $3,600 in 1941, but now sells for $1,400. Washington's 1797 diary sold for $10,000 in 1941, but now sells for $5,200.

The bleak situation in the American book market is due to the scarcity of both buying and selling. People in the book industry, seeing a dark future, are hesitant to move forward. The lack of support for book prices is causing them to decline further. Originally, for the past 75 years, many first editions of British literary works in the New York book market have been more expensive than in London, but now they are cheaper than in London. Commentators say that this may be a temporary phenomenon under Britain's strict foreign exchange control. Once normality is restored, the pricing of the American and British book markets should tend to converge.

### Four Kinds of People

— Zhou Chao

There are four kinds of people:

He who knows not, and knows not he knows not: he is a fool – shun him.

He who knows not, and knows he knows not: he is simple – teach him.

He who knows, and knows not he knows: he is asleep – wake him.

He who knows, and knows he knows: he is wise – follow him. (Borden)

### The Xu Kuo Garden

— Qian Dacheng

The Xu Kuo Garden, commonly known as the Zeng Garden, is where Mr. Zeng Mengpu spent his later years in retirement. The garden is located in the west of Changshu, facing the city wall. It covers dozens of acres, with winding artificial mountains and tens of thousands of lotus flowers in the pond. It was formerly my family's "Little Wangchuan" of Imperial Censor Gong (諱岱), for which Tu Long wrote a record. Later, it was abandoned for nearly three hundred years. It was not until Mr. Tui An, the grandfather of Mengpu, (named Xiwen, a juren in the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang gengchen, selected for educational theory.) because of the loss of his second son, Rizhang (字闇谷), that he greatly expanded the construction, building gardens to dispel his sorrow. He had already built the Mingse Villa to the west of his house on the bank of the Xishan Tangjing, for which Li Yueman wrote a record. He then built gardens in Jiuwan Xu, named "Xu Kuo Village Residence", and first completed the "Returning to Farming and Reading Cottage", with the water pavilion to the north called "Idle Talk of Water and Sky".

After the death of Mr. Tui An, his third son, Mr. Junbiao (Mengpu's father, named Zhizuan, a juren in the Guangxu Yi Hai Enke, an official in the Ministry of Justice, with extremely rich writings.) inherited his father's will and announced its completion. For a time, famous scholars flocked to it like startled geese, and people like Li Yueman, Wu Qingqing, and Zhao Huifu all stayed there as guests. The Lu Garden mentioned in Mr. Mengpu's book "A Rude Man" refers to this garden. With its beautiful scenery and flourishing plants and trees, the elders of Yushan can all tell stories of its glory. Later, Mr. Mengpu lived here with his mother, and further added a Western-style building. He also set up tea seats in the summer, inviting tourists, and famous people gave poems as gifts every day. Mr. Mengpu died in this garden. After his death, literary figures from all over the country gathered at "Xiaoyao You" to hold a memorial meeting, and discussed opening a room in this garden for commemoration, and also wanted to carve a bronze statue. Unfortunately, the Japanese invasion soon began, Changshu fell, and this garden was destroyed and never repaired. The collection of books was completely dispersed. The books translated and written by the gentleman, such as "Complete Works of Xiao E, Legend of Yi Xue Tan Dream", "Textual Research on the Art and Literature Records of the Later Han Dynasty", etc., were even sold by the pound; the first edition of the French book "La Dame aux Camélias", known as the only copy in the world, is also unknown. The garden is full of filth and dirt, with everything imaginable. The trees were all cut down, and half of the windows and doors were used as firewood, and half of the roof tiles were also removed, all done by a nephew of Mr. Mengpu. Yang Wuyang, who had returned from the lakes and seas, settled here and planted weeping willows, and wrote a poem: "Ping Zhong's tower sang and the craftsman were expected, the pavilions and corridors were few and far between. The sheep's nephew begged for a villa to reduce the shade, and the willow planter came to add a branch". Mr. Mengpu's virtuous sons, Mr. Xubai and others, have been working hard for the country and have been away from home for a long time, respecting family ties and not bearing to inquire about this. However, those who visit this garden find that the scenery is very different, and everything they see is different, so there is no lack of feelings about the past and the present! The famous gardens of Yushan, such as "Yan Gu", "Hu Yin", "Jing Pu", and "Zhi Yuan", have all been destroyed and blocked since the Japanese invasion, and there is no hope of restoration. The rise and fall of a garden is related to the prosperity and decline of a country. My grandmother was a younger cousin of Mr. Mengpu. When she was young, she spent her days in this garden, witnessing its glory. Every summer and autumn, she would pick lotus flowers and return home. Now that my grandmother has been dead for eleven years, I still visited this garden with my friend, Qi Junshi, and talked about poetry with Mr. Wuyang in "Idle Talk of Water and Sky". Mr. Wuyang gave a poem saying: "The stream bridge is full of Qi Qian, and they go to the water and sky every day". Lingering over the country and the family, I am saddened and difficult to express, and it is not just for the sake of this garden that I feel sad.

### Also Talking About Quitting Smoking

— Wang Wo

After reading Mr. Dacheng's article on the difficulty of quitting smoking on the 11th, I have the same feeling, so I also come to talk about it.

Generally speaking, many literati quit smoking due to economic pressure. The so-called unstable foundation and shaky life mean that they cannot increase income and can only reduce expenses. It is also very sad to be at the end of the road.

I have been smoking for seventeen years. At first, because of social interactions, I couldn't live without it for a day, especially when it came to reciprocity. Gradually, it became a habit, and I found many reasons for myself, such as a cigarette after a meal makes you feel like an immortal, it's a prevention against epidemics in the carriage, and it's a pleasure to read the newspaper while smoking... There are many reasons, too many to list. Later, whether it was grading papers, attending meetings, writing drafts, or drawing comics, it was always appropriate and necessary. If I was empty-handed, my heart would shake, and even going out to buy cigarettes in the middle of the night could not be said to be making a mountain out of a molehill.

Recently, my income has been limited and my expenses have been endless, so I decided to quit. It has been seven days. At first, I gritted my teeth and it wasn't a problem. When people came to offer me cigarettes, I refused them all, even when an apprentice from the barber shop handed me one, I smiled and declined. I didn't destroy the ashtray and cigarette case (the reason is that I have quit many times in my life, and I have often lost some things in vain, and it doesn't take long to start again). However, I face them morning and night, and I am touched by the scene. My heart itched after three days, and after five days, I accepted two cigarettes at a banquet. Now it has been seven days! At this time, coming out of a hospital after visiting a patient, the cigarette stand seemed to be deliberately provoking me. I finally succumbed, and my "determination" vanished before my eyes. I hurriedly struck a match, looked up at the sky, took a long puff, and suddenly felt that the world had returned to beauty, and was no longer so lazy and lacking in energy. Strange! The feeling of drowsiness that I had felt for the past few days almost disappeared immediately; the cigarette prices that I had been afraid to see but wanted to see for the past few days were as familiar as if I had memorized Tang poems.

When I got to my wife, I heard these words again: "I told you not to quit. Wouldn't it be okay to smoke less? You are really something!"

So I lit a second cigarette and smoked it boldly, but smiled cowardly. She couldn't help but get a very pitiful and shameful impression of me, but what method did I have to eliminate this impression invisibly?

The economic foundation is still not solid, and the problem is still the problem. After considering the fifth cigarette, I decided (it's coming again!) to "stop" at this limit every day. What a ridiculous limit!

### Lin's Translation

— Gongsun Wu

In Lin Yutang's book "Moment in Peking", many Chinese words are transliterated. "Lao ye" and "Xiao jie", like the English words "amah" and "taren", are not surprising. "Jie jie" and "Yi ma" have no other way to be translated besides transliteration. As for "Zong zi" and "Zan men", both nouns and pronouns can be transliterated. As for "Tong jia peng you", "Tian sheng you wu", "peng you" and "tian sheng" are in English, and "tong jia" and "you wu" are in Chinese. However, "帮" in "Qing bang" is written as "Gangs", which I am afraid the people in that gang would not want to accept. This word has two meanings, one is "a group of workers or slaves or prisoners", and the other is "a combination of like-minded people, especially those who engage in illegal activities". Lin likes the Oxford Dictionary, so he cites it as above. If we look at the first meaning of this word in the American Webster's Dictionary, it is still good, only saying that it is "a group of people" combined for a special purpose, and Lin must have taken this meaning. Also, "Wang ba", "Wang guo nu", and "Yi liao bu de" are all in Chinese. It is truly new and strange to have these words in an English book. English already has "Kowtow", and now it has "Ding hao". I wonder when the English and Americans will start to adopt Lin's words into their dictionaries.

### Fighting

— Ruyi

The famous historian Lorid Lewis took his nine-year-old daughter Nancy to see military exercises.

The child asked, "Father, why are those people walking around together?"

"They are training, preparing to go to war when they are well trained," Lewis said.

The child didn't understand. She said, "Fighting? Father, what is 'fighting'?"

Lewis said: "This matter is not easy to explain. Many people put on uniforms, like these soldiers; in another country, many people also put on uniforms. Everyone takes guns and cannons to a certain place and kills each other, which is called fighting."

Nancy was silent for a while. She said, "Father, do you know what? One day something will happen."

Lewis asked, "What will happen?"

Nancy said, "Well, let me tell you. One day, even if some people want to fight, no one will be willing to fight." (Translated from the Christian Proverb Newspaper)

### Miscellaneous Notes from the Pavilion with Rats

— Yu Shou

Thinking of Chengdu in the Summer (Part 1)

In the summer, those who have surplus in life often move their families to a cool place, called "avoiding the summer heat", and they especially praise Guling and Moqian. In fact, places deep in the mountains and forests, based on natural conditions, must have low temperatures. Which mountain is not like that? Why must it be Guling and Moqian?

Avoiding the summer heat by staying far from the city is no different from disconnecting from real life, which I suspect is not the best method. Therefore, I think of Chengdu.

In Chengdu in the summer, the highest Fahrenheit reading is over ninety degrees. I have lived there for two summers, and I still think about it endlessly. Speakers often say that the summer scenery in Chengdu is most similar to that in Beijing, but that is not entirely true. Beijing has high skies and no clouds. At noon, the sun scorches people like roasting, and the rainfall is sparse. If there are several consecutive days of clear and dry weather, the Fahrenheit reading will exceed one hundred degrees. Chengdu, on the other hand, has an average temperature without great extremes, low evaporation, and frequent rain. After the rain, it is easy to wear autumn clothes and walk along the riverbank. Its charm is hardly less than "the dusk of the Hanpo Estuary."

Beijing has a population of as many as 1.8 million, while Chengdu is only about four-tenths of that. Also, because of the different economic systems, Chengdu is a self-sufficient agricultural city, and the "percentage" of the poor is relatively small; Beijing is neither an industrial city nor an agricultural city, nor is it a political city. The vast majority of residents need to run around and gasp for breath, fighting for the daily necessities of life in the market. Therefore, the folk customs of the two places are one restless and one tranquil, and what is manifested in the summer is particularly profound. In the market of Beijing, the hotter the weather, the more the cries of the ice cream vendors feel sad; this is something that Chengdu does not have. I once spent half a summer in Chengdu Jing'an Villa. Outside the door was the bustling market, but it was like living in a monk's room in Wenshu Monastery, with a quiet and peaceful feeling.
