To date, the areas south of Zhuolu in Southern Chahar, west of Huaian and Wanquan, have completed the task. Shangyi, Shangdu, and other places in Northern Chahar are also in the process of implementation. Zeng continued, "Under the call of Commander-in-Chief Fu, the people of this province have long understood the meaning of 'people suppressing bandits' and 'suppressing bandits is more important than defending against bandits.' Now, local armed security police teams and others throughout the province have been established and have considerable strength. In addition to defending strongholds, they can also conduct guerrilla warfare, allowing the National Army stationed in various strongholds to be deployed freely and flexibly, which is tantamount to increasing unlimited strength." Finally, Zeng solemnly stated, "The security of this province is guaranteed, please wait patiently for the good news in the near future."

He then described the general situation of bandit suppression in the Yu area in the past two years and the current military situation in Central China, and called for US military aid to China, saying that the current situation in the Northeast is serious because the equipment of the Chinese Communist Party is all new weapons and there is a backstage boss supplying them.

### Northern Figures Emphasize the Vice President's Native Place

Ding Weifen Does Not Participate in the Election

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Northern figures emphasize the issue of the Vice President's native place and will recommend Mo Dehui, Yu Youren, and Ding Weifen to participate in the first Vice Presidential election. The Northern 29 Provinces and Municipalities Reconstruction Association has been meeting for days to discuss and has made this decision. On the 24th, they also sent Du Guangdi and others to visit the three individuals to urge them to participate in the election. Mo Dehui did not reject this urging. Mo said in an exclusive interview with this reporter on the 24th that he had not made any preparations for participating in the election. However, Mo admitted that Du Guangdi and other representatives had urged him. Mo avoided answering questions about how to nominate and campaign. The reporter then asked how the new government should handle national affairs after the first National Assembly completes the election work. Mo said: "I believe that local autonomy should be the top priority. According to the Draft Provincial and County Autonomy Regulations passed by the State Affairs Council, the county council has a two-year term before the popular election of provincial and county heads. Popular elections must be held only after the term of the councilors has expired, which means that popular elections for provincial and county heads can only be held after two years at the earliest. However, this draft still needs to be passed by the popularly elected Legislative Yuan and may be revised. When expressing the above opinions, Mo strongly advocated the early implementation of local autonomy. The work of suppressing the rebellion should be the work that the new government continues to complete. He made no other comments. Ding Weifen has decided not to participate in the Vice Presidential election. When representatives of the Northern Reconstruction Association visited Ding on the 24th to urge him, Ding said that he was old and sick and had no intention of participating in actual politics. Ding expressed his gratitude for the enthusiasm of the Northern people.

### Spokesperson of Ministry of National Defense Elaborates on New Measures in the Central China Pacification Zone: Shorten the Rebellion Suppression Time Targeting the Communist Bandits' Three-Seeking Tactics

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] In order to defeat the Communist bandits' three-seeking tactics and their plan to cross the river in May, the Central China Pacification Conference decided last week on new measures, including implementing a general war in Central China, solving the land problem, and giving preferential treatment to military personnel by granting land to soldiers, etc. This will enable the National Army to win quickly, shorten the time for suppressing the rebellion, and reduce the people's panic and suffering. These new measures will be implemented gradually. The spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense explained this when announcing this matter at a press conference on the 24th, stating:

General War Tactics

Liu bandit Bocheng's and Chen bandit Yi's "three-seeking policy" is to replenish troops locally, replenish food locally, and replenish weapons and ammunition on the battlefield front lines. The purpose of the National Army implementing a general war is to integrate military, political, and economic aspects in the pacification zone, increase the authority and responsibility of the pacification zone commander, expand local armed forces, mobilize the people to protect their homes and defend themselves, and cut off the bandit's troop and food supplies. If the National Army combines suppression, pursuit, and local interception and clearing, the situation on the Central China battlefield will be rapidly changed, and it will be difficult for the Liu bandits to gain a foothold and will be forced to flee back to the north of the Yellow River.

Land Problem

The purpose of solving the land problem is to require that those who till the land own the land. The government uses methods to regulate the maximum amount of land ownership and issue land bonds to enable farmers to acquire land, while reducing land taxes and implementing a 3-1 rent reduction. The apportionment of food is changed to fair assessment by the council and is not allowed to be directly handled by military and political agencies and troops to avoid abuses.

Land Grant to Soldiers

The purpose of giving preferential treatment to soldiers and granting land to soldiers is to reward the people for joining the army. Active military personnel can get three to five mu of land per person to boost morale. At the same time, people across the country comfort the soldiers and give preferential treatment to the soldiers' families. When morale is strong, the war will be easier to win.

### Sun Ke Decides to Participate in Vice Presidential Election; Will Hold Press Conference Tomorrow to Explain

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] Vice Chairman Sun Ke (pictured) has decided to participate in the vice presidential election. He is scheduled to hold a press conference on the 26th to explain the matter. Our reporter visited Mr. Sun at his official residence on the 24th and inquired about his vice-presidential candidacy and whether the first National Assembly should amend the constitution. Mr. Sun stated: "Since my time in the Legislative Yuan, presiding over the state's legislative authority, my greatest goal has been to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of China. After more than ten years of effort, it has finally come to fruition. Now that the constitution has begun to be implemented, it requires even more time and effort from more colleagues. The significance of my running for vice president lies in this, hoping to establish a better foundation for democratic politics in the next two or three decades and reap the great fruits of constitutional governance." Regarding the rumor that if the vice president also concurrently serves as the president of the Legislative Yuan, their authority would be higher than that of the president, therefore, the vice president should not concurrently serve as the president of the Legislative Yuan. When asked if Mr. Sun would need to resign from his position in the Legislative Yuan if elected, Mr. Sun replied: "The vice president has no authority in themselves, and the Legislative Yuan is the most democratic institution in the government. Any decision must be made by voting, so the power lies with the legislators, not the president." The reporter then asked if Mr. Sun would continue in his position as president. Mr. Sun only responded indirectly, saying that the president of the Legislative Yuan is elected by the legislators. Regarding how he would assist the president in promoting government affairs if elected, Mr. Sun believes that the constitution should be effectively implemented. As for fundamental national policies, they require long-term effort. The current important tasks are to complete the suppression of the rebellion and to complete democratic politics. If the constitution cannot effectively implement democratic politics, it is just empty talk. What we need is truly modern democratic politics to promote the Three Principles of the People, improve people's lives, enable people to live in peace and prosperity, and promote production and construction so that the country can progress." Regarding whether the constitution should be amended in this session of the National Assembly, Mr. Sun stated that it is not easy to formulate a constitution. If the current constitution is amended at the beginning of its implementation, it would harm the dignity of the constitution, destabilize the constitution, and may even lead to a new draft. This would be detrimental to the country. However, the constitution is not unamendable. The United States Constitution has been amended several times. However, amendments are made out of factual experience. If we were to amend it now, it would be based on subjective theory without factual basis. Therefore, I believe it should not be amended in this short period. If there are amendments in the future, they must be based on experience and must be carefully and thoroughly considered beforehand. We must not act rashly."

[Our Chengdu Office, 24th] The Rong Newspaper Association, the Reporters Association, the Sichuan Education Association, and the Political Science Association, a total of 28 organizations, telegraphed the entire country on the 24th, supporting Chairman Chiang as president and Yu Youren running for vice president, and publicly banqueted the National Assembly representatives from Sichuan, Kang, and Chongqing, requesting unanimous support.

The Four Banks Joint Office Loan Review Committee has approved the loan amount in stages according to the guidelines for lending to public utilities. Once approved by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office on the 25th, it can be decided. The industrial and mining loan plans for this year proposed by various associations and the coal mining production increase loan plan proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are still awaiting further discussion, so it is unlikely that any decisions will be made on the 25th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] The special review committee of the Four Banks Joint Office (formerly known as the Loan Review Committee) held a meeting on the afternoon of the 24th to review the cases received in the past two weeks. The meeting was presided over by Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan, with the attendance of more than ten people, including Central Bank representatives Diao Peiran, Wang Zishuang, Bank of China Cai Gongquan, Bank of Communications Zhu Tongjiu, Agricultural Bank Zhou Mengsheng, Central Cooperative Treasury Shou Miancheng, Postal Remittances Bureau Gu Chunfan, and China Development Bank Huang Yinpu. The cases under review were divided into three types: (1) cases assigned by the chairman and vice chairman, (2) cases requested by various parties from the Four Banks Joint Office, and (3) cases forwarded by various banks for the Four Banks Joint Office to review. All of these are loans related to national policy, with loans for transportation projects being the most important, which will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion on the 25th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] After the measures for transferring deposits from various bank branches and military and government agencies to the Central Bank were approved by the Four Banks Joint Office, the technical problems of the transfer have been discussed by Deputy Director Yu Zhuangdong of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and the heads of various bank branches for several days, and preliminary results have been achieved. It has been decided to implement the principles determined by the Four Banks Joint Office. The military and government deposits of bank branches across the country will be transferred to the Central Bank in three phases. The National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank is scheduled to convene a small group meeting of the heads of various bank branches in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss the technical problems of implementation. The director of the bureau, Xia Jinneng, will come to Nanjing from Shanghai to preside over the meeting.

### The Future of Chinese Academic Research – Opening Address to the Second Council of the Academia Sinica

The Academia Sinica is holding its second council meeting in Nanjing today. The main task is to formally elect "Academicians" and to discuss other fundamental issues related to academic research. At a time when the country is facing many difficulties, gathering famous scholars from all over the country in the capital to engage in the establishment of a national research system and the discussion of promoting academic research is particularly worthy of cherishing by people across the country. Although the education and academic circles are now generally suffering from poverty and academic research is facing many obstacles, the grand plan of nation-building and the way scholars serve the country should be far-sighted. Here, we welcome the birth of the first Academicians who represent the authority of our country's academic community, and we wish the meeting success in advance.

The Academia Sinica can be said to be our country's national academy. Its ideal position should be the same as the Royal Society of the United Kingdom and the Academy of Sciences of France. However, since its establishment 20 years ago, because the conditions for scientific research in our country have not been sound, and then it was affected by the Anti-Japanese War, it has not completed the system of its basic components for a long time, so it has not yet reached the equivalent of the so-called national academy in Europe and the United States. The establishment of Academicians is to establish its foundation and complete the organization of our national academic community. This matter was brewing quite early. It was not until the annual meeting of the council in October of the 35th year of the Republic that the principle was passed. In March of last year, the organizational law of the Academy was amended and promulgated, and since then the preparatory work for the election has been carried out. First, universities, colleges, academic societies, and research institutions nominated candidates, and a preliminary list of 402 people was drawn up. Then, at the fourth council meeting in October of last year, the candidates were reviewed in groups, and the general meeting passed the list of 150 "Academicians Candidates" (49 in the mathematics and physics group, 46 in the biology group, and 55 in the humanities group). This general meeting will be held four months after the names of the candidates are announced, and 100 people (originally set from 80 to 100 people) will be selected from these 150 people as Academicians, and it is stipulated that at least four-fifths of the votes must be obtained to be elected. Its solemnity can be seen.

"Academician" is a new name in our country's academic community, and it cannot be said to be a new system. According to the organizational law, Academicians are qualified by "those who have special works, inventions or contributions to the academic field they specialize in" and "those who have led and presided over the organs of the academic field they specialize in for more than five years with outstanding achievements." That is, those who have made special contributions to specialized academic fields directly or indirectly can be elected. In addition to the future addition of Academicians and the election of council members, their main authority is to "deliberate on the direction of national academic research." We hope that the position of Chinese Academicians will become a symbol of the highest honor in the Chinese academic community, respected by the state and society, and an ideal goal for those engaged in academic research. In today's declining academic atmosphere, establishing such a supra-realistic standard for judging people will surely be a spiritual force for promoting the atmosphere of academic research.

Our country has always respected academic research, and scholars and hermits often abandoned fame and position and were admired by the government and the public. Unfortunately, the extreme abuses of the imperial examination system and the influence of politics gradually destroyed the development of pure science in China, and even ruined the general tradition of respecting teachers and valuing learning. The promotion of education since the late Qing Dynasty and the promotion of science after the May Fourth Movement only gained the superficial aspects of others, and there was almost the accusation of returning the pearls after obtaining the sandalwood box. The eight-year Anti-Japanese War was a cruel test; and the unprecedentedly fierce international war made us realize a bloody lesson, that is, modern warfare is a highly scientific war; and the profound application of national defense science must be based on the long-term "doing nothing for the sake of doing" specialized research by countless specialized scholars. In a broader sense, the strength of modern countries must be based on highly academic leadership, organized application, and cannot be achieved by narrow utilitarianism and the short-term efforts of a few people. This is true for modern national construction. For the sake of peaceful nation-building and for the ability to defend ourselves to ensure peace, China's efforts in specialized academic research should truly catch up quickly.

The emergence of Academicians of the Research Institute this time will surely create a new atmosphere in this sense and provide a strong encouragement to specialized research. However, this is just a good start, and more factors need to be developed for its future. We believe that to promote Chinese academic research, the government, society, and the academic community itself must jointly conduct a thorough review and make practical efforts in many aspects.

The first is the government's practical encouragement. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government spared no effort to maintain education at all levels, but we deeply feel that the government seems to be too biased towards quantitative expansion in maintaining higher education, and not enough attention is paid to the qualitative aspect. The number of units above specialized colleges has greatly increased, but the libraries and instruments of first-class universities have not seen much enrichment. Some universities have added research institutes, as if they have moved towards the direction of national academic independence, but some of them are actually unworthy of the name. In short, the regular school funding borne by our national finances in the past ten years is large, while the actual amount used to encourage advanced academic research is too small. In the future, the national education and cultural expenditure budget should not only increase the amount allocated to the units of the Central Research Institute and all research institutions; the treatment of research staff should be specially improved so that they can stay in their positions for a long time; and scientific groups and institutions with history and achievements should be treated equally and provided with assistance. The gentlemen of the Academia Sinica, based on the spirit of cooperation and seeking friends, will naturally be happy to support it.

Speaking of treatment, we believe that we can no longer say abstract things like "a gentleman worries about the way, not about poverty," because the current economic changes are too real and too serious. When Mr. Hu Shih came to Shanghai from the south to attend a meeting and answered questions from our reporter, he said at the beginning that the professors of Peking University are "so poor that they are about to die." Scholars and experts must be willing to be "indifferent," but the country must also enable them to be comfortable in "loneliness" so that they can have cumulative achievements through professionalism and perseverance. We hope that in addition to the government's overall and effective remedies for professors and education service personnel, researchers at all levels in research institutions must be given a standard of living that is no lower than that of professors, such as raising base salaries, planning for welfare, and allocating goods in kind, which must be taken care of in the same way as university professors. Those who bury themselves in laboratories and libraries to study diligently and strive for academic equality for the country deserve the most preferential treatment from the country.

### Estimated Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Ownership

Valuation of China Textile Company Completed

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] The person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently talked about the handling of the sale of state-owned production enterprises in accordance with the "Measures for the Discretionary Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Ownership," stating that: (1) The valuation of China Textile Company has been completed, and various lists of goods have been reviewed and transferred to the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Production Enterprises for review. The estimated base price of the machines is based on the estimate of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). How to increase the value is being carefully researched by the committee to determine a reasonable standard for calculating the value increase. Once determined, a real transfer price will be obtained in a short period of time. (2) China Silk Company plans to issue shares for 50% of its total assets. The factories that can be used to issue shares include three silk factories and one spun silk factory. The total value of its assets is 6.34 billion yuan, which are all valuations at the time of takeover. The company has been ordered to re-estimate the value based on the base price at the end of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), create a list and submit it to the ministry for review and approval. It is currently being urged. (3) The valuation list of China Tobacco Company has been submitted to the ministry and reviewed and transferred to the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises for approval. However, the valuation of other finished products, semi-finished products, raw materials, and other means of production must also be estimated and submitted. It has been transferred and ordered to comply and is being urged to proceed.

### Principles and Methods for Provinces and Cities to Apply for Allocation of Reparations Goods Determined

[This newspaper's news] Regarding the methods for allocating and purchasing Japanese reparations materials, the central government invited relevant ministries and commissions to discuss them in detail. As a result, it was believed that provinces and cities applying for the allocation of Japanese reparations materials could be handled in accordance with the following items: (1) Principles: The central and local finances were divided in the 35th year of the Republic (1946). The budgets of the provinces and cities are not within the central budget. If provinces and cities receive Japanese reparations materials, they should apply for price purchase in cash. (2) Methods: If the business units affiliated to the provincial and municipal governments have practical plans and appropriate [blank] and foundation, they should be allowed to apply for the purchase of Japanese reparations materials, but the application should be based on the business unit as the main body. The competent ministries and commissions should review its plan, source of funds, and business foundation. After considering it appropriate, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will apply for allocation and sale on its behalf. The purchase methods shall be handled in accordance with the methods for private enterprises to apply for price allocation of Japanese reparations materials. (3) Scope: The first batch of 480,000 tons of Japanese reparations materials has been approved by the Executive Yuan for the allocation principle (one-fourth is allocated for private sale, and the remaining three-fourths are allocated according to the original application quantity ratio of each ministry and commission). When the second batch of Japanese reparations materials is allocated, it will be allocated and sold to public business units in provinces and cities. However, if the ministries and commissions that receive the first batch of Japanese reparations materials agree to allocate the materials for purchase by public business units in provinces and cities, they can be handled in accordance with the previous methods.

### 3,000 Tons of Japanese Reparations to Be Shipped from Nagoya

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Yongxing Wheel will recently arrive in Nagoya, and the Liming Wheel is currently unloading soybeans, peanuts, and yellow beans transported from Hankou in Nagoya. The two wheels will load about 3,000 tons of reparations goods from Nagoya on the return trip, and the machinery of the arsenal will return to the country. By the middle of next month, the first batch of the advance allocation of 30% of the reparations goods (a total of about 7,850 machines) will be transported back to the country. Wu Bannong, the head of our reparations return delegation, said: The delegation is currently formulating a form specifying the types of ships suitable for each port for the reference of the domestic reparations transportation authorities. Wu is also making various efforts to ensure that each ship arrives strictly according to the schedule. Wu said: The delays of our country's ships have greatly affected the entire reparations transportation plan. Wu cited that on several occasions when ships arrived, they needed repairs, or lacked fuel and other food, which caused unnecessary delays in the transportation of reparations goods. Wu said: Any necessary repairs should be completed before leaving the country, and adequate food and fuel supplies should be provided.

### Tin Prices Weak First, Then Firm

[Our Wuxi Office, 24th] Today's prices were weak first and then firm. White japonica rice opened at 3.674 million, white yuan rice at 3.544 million, sheep indica rice at 3.524 million, bu indica rice at 3.45 million, foreign jiang indica rice at 3.524 million, xinghua indica rice at 3.444 million, japonica rice at 1.657 million, wheat at 3.72 million, white wheat at 3.83 million, flour at 1.425 million, soybean oil at 7.45 million, and cotton yarn at 110 million.

[Our Zhenjiang Office, 24th] Zhenjiang's prices continued to weaken today. The opening price of upper rice was 3.7 million per stone, and the Five Oceans brand of cotton cloth also declined across the board. However, due to the increase in meat prices and the [blank] of refugees, the prices of meals and snacks in restaurants and teahouses have increased slightly. In addition, the Zhenjiang Price Evaluation Council adjusted the price of economy dishes today, with the price of a first-class meal being 2 million yuan.

[Our Hefei Office, 24th] The prices of Five Oceans brand cotton cloth and cigarettes here are 20-30% higher than those in Nanjing and Shanghai. Upper cooked rice is 3.4 million, and pork is 55,000.

[Our Hangzhou Office, 24th] The Hangzhou rice market was still weak today, and transactions were sluggish. White tip rice fell by 140,000, and ordinary edible rice also generally fell by more than 100,000. The Xiashi production area is still trending lower, and the silk market is also weak.

### The Ministry of Food Formulates and Promulgates the Main Points of Food Market Management

[Our Nanjing Office, 24th] At the beginning of this month, food prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places rose. In order to maintain people's livelihood and rationalize food prices, the Ministry of Food sent personnel to Wuxi to investigate the reasons for the price increase and ordered the Wuxi County Government to strictly suppress prices in accordance with the main points of food market management formulated and promulgated by the ministry. Now food prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places have become stable. The main points of the ministry's food market management are as follows: (1) Food transactions are limited to food markets. When necessary, the local government may supervise the food merchants to publicly agree on a reasonable price for the day. Once agreed, it shall not be changed on the same day. All food merchants in the city must abide by this agreed price before negotiating prices the next day. Violators will have their licenses revoked and be ordered to suspend business. (2) Strictly ban non-food merchants and unlicensed food merchants from engaging in the food business. If formal food merchants negotiate to purchase food that has been purchased and hoarded locally, they shall not refuse to sell it, but formal food merchants shall not trade it around. Violators will also have their business licenses revoked. (3) The local government shall investigate and register the food merchants' inventory and the daily sales volume of food in the city to understand the local inventory of food for reference in overall regulation. (4) Strengthen the management and price control of food merchants, strictly hold food merchant registration, and submit it to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of business licenses. Afterwards, they must operate legally in accordance with the food merchant registration rules of the Ministry of Food. Those with insufficient funds and those who violate the regulations shall be corrected at any time or ordered to suspend business. (5) When local food prices fluctuate sharply, in order to avoid panic buying and raise food prices, except for food merchants in Nanjing and Shanghai and those approved by the Ministry of Food to go to purchase, food merchants in other places may be stopped or temporarily suspended from purchasing food in Wuxi.

### Hangzhou Stops Food Leakage Overseas

[Our Hangzhou Office, 24th] In recent days, there has been a lot of food leakage overseas, which has greatly affected the food supply for the people of Hangzhou. The city council has questioned this [blank], and the city government has also paid close attention to it. The city's economic police held a meeting today to discuss control measures and have decided to strictly stop it.

### Jiangxi Opens Production and Sales Loans

[Our Nanchang Office, 24th] The Jiangxi Central Bank was ordered to open loans for production and sales businesses, specifying the targets as daily necessities for people's livelihood, industrial and mining businesses, and export trade.

### War Situation Announced by the Ministry of National Defense

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense announced on the 24th the war situation for the week of March 17th to 23rd. The full text is as follows:

During this week, after suffering significant casualties in the Northeast battlefield following the capture of Siping, the bandit army, with its main force now scattered in areas such as Changnan, Yitong, and Shuangyang, creating a threatening posture towards Changchun, is in reality, deeply wounded and intensifying replenishment efforts. On one hand, due to the National Army's proactive withdrawal from Yongji, which surprised the bandits, the defenses of Changchun have been strengthened. Although the bandits have the intention of making trouble, they are temporarily unable to do so. Therefore, the entire Liaobei area is relatively calm. As for southern Liaoning, since the National Army recaptured Liaozhong on the 15th and continued to advance southwest, progress has been rapid, and the highway from Jinzhou to Shenyang should be passable soon.

In the North China battlefield, after the failure of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops to stir up trouble in the outskirts of Baoding, they were unable to continue their activities in this area. They personally led their First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, a total of five columns, along with a large number of civilian laborers and stretchers, to invade the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, attempting to destroy the Ping-Sui Railway and isolate Datong. The bandits quickly invaded Yuxian, using the strength of two columns, hoping to use a "big fish eats small fish" strategy to capture Yuxian, but Yuxian remained steadfast. At the same time, they also used a large force to invade Taohuabao (south of Zhuolu), but were also repelled by the National Army. Currently, the National Army in that area is cooperating with the armed forces of the people to prepare to give the bandits a head-on blow.

In central Shandong, Chen Yi's bandit troops, consisting of the Seventh, Ninth, Thirteenth, New Eighth, and Four Columns, as well as four guard regiments, totaling approximately 40,000 bandits, vainly attempted to advance along the Jiaoji Railway, feigning a threat to Jinan. In reality, they were attempting to retreat back to their old nest in the Yimeng Mountain area. Currently, our powerful troops advancing eastward from Jinan have already approached the Zhoucun and Wangcun lines. Developments in the war in this area are expected soon.

In addition, in northern Jiangsu, Chen Yi's bandit troops, the Eleventh and Twelfth Columns, after their defeat at Dongtai, the Eleventh Column has been forced to the coast by the National Army, and the remnants of the Twelfth Column have been forced to flee north, attempting to join forces with the Second Column near Lianshui. They are currently being intercepted by the National Army in the Yilin area. There have been no major battles in this area recently.

In the Dabie Mountains, Liu's bandit troops, the Third and Sixth Columns, are still wandering in the mountainous areas. There have been no major changes this week. A part of the Second Column went to the Fangji area east of Xixian. On the 21st, the National Army completely wiped out one of their regiments. Most of them were captured. The main force of the Second Column and the First Column were in the areas north of Xincai and near Linquan, attempting to transport new recruits and supplies sent by Chen Yi's Tenth and Eleventh Columns, but so far, even the two columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops have been separated by our powerful troops from three sides to the southwest of Taihe and near Huaiyuan.

In Jin-Shaanxi, the bandits, with a force five times greater than that of the National Army, have been besieging Linfen in southern Shanxi and Luochuan in northern Shaanxi for more than half a month. The bandits have suffered heavy casualties and are stuck under the cities. Both cities are still in the hands of the National Army. When Peng's bandit troops in northern Shaanxi failed to capture Luochuan, they sent the Second and Fourth Columns, and even attempted to send small groups everywhere to disrupt the rear of the National Army, but ultimately, due to the close cooperation between the National Army and the people, the bandits' dreams were shattered.

In summary, during the week's war situation, the bandits have implemented a strategy of "three parts military, seven parts propaganda." This is true in the Northeast, and it is also true in North China. We believe that the National Army will definitely respond to the bandits' propaganda with action, and the justice of the Chinese nation will ultimately prevail.

Deng Wenyi

### Exposing the Bandit Propaganda Offensive

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] Deng Wenyi, Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense, stated on the 24th: Rumors that the communist bandits in the Northeast plan to blockade Changchun and Shenyang with a certain amount of troops, and then send a large force into the pass, are actually still part of the communist bandits' propaganda offensive. The communist bandits have long advocated entering the pass from outside the pass, crossing the Yellow River from inside the pass, and crossing the Yangtze River south of the Yellow River, but it has been difficult to realize. Regarding the outbreak of the war on the Ping-Sui Railway, Deng also denied that it was related to the communist bandits entering the pass from the Northeast. Deng said: The bandits who attacked the Ping-Sui Railway are all bandit troops from the Ji-Cha-Sui Border Region.

### Underground Banks Sealed Off in Hankou; Manager of Xiechang Bank Arrested

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 24th] Today, the Hankou Municipal Bureau of Financial Affairs sealed off another underground bank named Xiechang Bank. The manager, Dai Shisheng, has been arrested and handed over to the court for investigation.

### Several Chinese and Foreign Factories to be Established in Kaohsiung

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 24th] Kaohsiung is an industrial city in Taiwan Province, with numerous factories. Recently, Chinese and foreign industrialists came here for investigation. It is reported that the following new factories will appear: (1) Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, plans to establish a chlorate factory in Kaohsiung, selecting the original land of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation in Qianzhen as the factory site, and has already signed a contract in Shanghai for a term of three years. The nitrogen required by the factory has been agreed to be supplied by the preparatory office of the Fourth Factory of the Taiwan Alkali Corporation. The price of chlorine is calculated according to one-sixteenth of the bottom price of potassium chlorate in Shanghai, converted to legal tender. (2) The DDT manufacturing plant planned to be established by the United Nations World Health Organization has recently sent another letter for more specific negotiations. The capital of the factory has been set at US$3 million, and it will be managed by an American named Randall. The factory will be built on the vacant land of the preparatory office of the Fourth Factory of Taiwan Alkali Corporation. All the required machinery has been shipped from the United States to Shanghai. Except for benzene, which will be supplied by the United States, the raw materials required will include alcohol from the sugar company, chlorine, and steam for power, all of which will be supplied by the Fourth Factory of Taiwan Alkali Corporation. The chlorine demand has also been specified as six tons per day. (3) Sichuan Jia Paper Company plans to establish a paper mill in Kaohsiung and has sent Cai Zhenying to investigate. It is reported that the factory will also be located in Qianzhen. (4) The penicillin manufacturing plant planned to be established by the United Nations World Health Organization in Taiwan is also said to have selected Qianzhen in Kaohsiung as the site for its construction, and will send personnel to survey the site soon.

### Preliminary Survey of the Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant in Guangdong Completed

Drilling Operations Underway at the Site

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the National Resources Commission: The Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant, jointly operated by the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Commission, is located near Huanggang in northern Guangdong. The plan is to first build an arched run-of-river dam. The first phase of the project will generate 40,000 kilowatts. The second phase of the project plans to expand another 40,000 kilowatts, for a total capacity of 80,000 kilowatts. The generated electricity will be transmitted to Guangzhou and connected to the existing thermal power plant in Guangzhou for joint operation, supplying electricity to Guangzhou and the mechanical equipment along the transmission lines. The preliminary survey has been completed by the Wengjiang Survey Team of the National Hydroelectric Power Engineering Administration of the Commission. Currently, an American expert named Olson has been hired to assist in drilling operations at the site. The actual construction work in the future will require some foreign investment assistance.

### Horiuchi Continues Inspection in Hainan

[Our Correspondent in Haikou, 24th] On the 23rd, Horiuchi Kanjo continued to inspect paper mills, match factories, weaving factories, the Hainan Enterprise Company, and the farm of Qionghai Middle School. According to related sources, the authorities hired Horiuchi because he is familiar with Japan's plan to develop Hainan, and after studying this plan, the authorities and foreign experts agreed that it is the most practical. If implemented, they will make every effort to exploit iron ore.

### Widespread Tungsten Ore Smuggling in Guangdong

[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 24th] Tungsten ore smuggling in South China has recently become rampant again. Smugglers use Dapeng Island, which belongs to Yangjiang County and is the richest in tungsten production, as a base to smuggle tungsten to Vietnam, selling it to an agent stationed there by a certain country. The authorities are currently taking strict measures to prevent it.

### Shanxi Party, Government, Military, and Civilians Organize Self-Defense Force

Appealing to the Government to Provide Weapons

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 24th] More than 100,000 people from Shanxi Province, who have fled to Henan and Shaanxi due to the devastation of the communist bandits, have now risen up to prepare weapons and return to their hometowns. Recently, the Joint Working Committee of Shanxi Party, Government, Military, and Civilians was established, appealing to the government to provide weapons and equipment. They also sincerely request officials, dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and magnates from southern Shanxi residing in various places to think of their ancestral graves and provide support. The committee adopts a committee system and is jointly organized by representatives from the Party, government, military, and civilians of Gu County to form a self-defense force of the people. The expenses and supplies required are all raised locally. The chairman of the committee is Ye Zichu, an old member of the Tongmenghui, who is nearly seventy years old. To save his homeland, Ye has been traveling between Henan and Shaanxi for the past month, contacting various parties. He received the press here at noon on the 23rd to report on the communist bandits' disaster in Shanxi and the tragic situation. When he described the various atrocities of the communist bandits' liquidation, struggle, and massacre, as well as the plight of the people and young students in southern Shanxi who were displaced, without clothing or food, the old man's tears flowed freely, and he couldn't stop crying.

### Civil Air Transport Team Will Continue Flights to Linfen to Rescue Staff

[Our Report] Schellin (an American), the Chief of the Flight Section of Chennault's Civil Air Transport Team, announced yesterday: As soon as the surface of the airport in Linfen City is expanded, and one of their L-5 two-seater aircraft is repaired, he will fly to the city (currently surrounded by the communist army) to rescue three Chinese employees of the Civil Air Transport Team.

Schellin served in the Flying Tigers during the war and participated in combat. On the 18th of this month, he took the risk of flying through Linfen for the first time to rescue Stewart, an American employee of the Civil Air Transport Team. Recently, he returned to Shanghai and described the trip to Linfen as very dangerous, because the communist army set up obstacles and guns at both ends of the airport.

The city only has an airport, which is about 4,000 meters long, but because there is a large tower at one end and buildings at the other end, only a few hundred feet of land can be used. When Schellin rescued Stewart, his skills were extremely agile. He flew straight into the airport in a sharp manner, and then immediately took off, which only took a few minutes. Currently, workers there are trying to remove one end of the airport wall to provide ample runway for the plane to land. If his rescue is successful this time, he will escort the three employees to Peiping.

### Philippine Foreigner Statistics

Chinese Most Numerous, Americans Second, Japanese Only 73 Remaining

[United Press, Manila, 24th] The Immigration Bureau supplied the United Press with statistics today, stating that the foreigners residing in the Philippines are still the Chinese, which has been the case for hundreds of years. The second most numerous were originally the Japanese, but now only 35 families remain. According to the population census, there were a total of 100,971 registered Chinese at the end of 1947, and 117,487 in 1939. In addition, there are at least 20,000 Chinese who entered the country illegally, and there must be tens of thousands who have assimilated with the locals over the centuries. In 1939, the number of Japanese in the Philippines reached 29,057. As a result of being sent back to their country after the war, only 73 remain at present. Those who have stayed all have special reasons, such as having Filipino blood or being old. According to immigration officials, "Seventy-three is enough, we don't want to add any more."

Sends Personnel to Beijing to Request Assistance

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 24th] In order to stabilize the locality, comfort and assist refugees, promote farming, increase production, and obtain active relief, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has formulated four relief measures: (1) Request the Central Government to quickly allocate 30 billion yuan in emergency relief to handle emergency relief for war-torn refugees to settle the refugees.

McKnight recently returned from Shanghai and said: "Faced with the terrible lack and suffering, local workers have to choose the poorest people to provide relief. Fortunately, the charitable organizations with which the United Aid to China has maintained contact for many years enable us to work smoothly in areas where Chinese refugees gather."

### Shaanxi Broadcasting Station to Begin Broadcasting Next Month

[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 24th] The "Ether Wave War," which is invisible to the naked eye, is about to begin here.

The call sign is "XKPA," the frequency is 1440 kilocycles, and the power is 500 watts. In clear weather, it can be received within a radius of 1,000 kilometers. However, due to topographic factors, the radio waves to the southeast are weaker, because the Qinling Mountains block it. After completion, not only will the famous Qin Opera be able to travel all over the country without moving its feet, but it will also add a fresh force to the "radio war" against the bandits in the Northwest.

### Chennault Gives a Speech in the United States, Emphasizing Effective Assistance to Our War Effort; The Soviet Union Supplies the Chinese Communists with Enough Military Supplies for One Million Troops

[United Press Washington, 23rd] General Chennault believes that the Chinese Civil War is actually the beginning of World War III. He strongly urged the United States to have a military advisory group of 20,000 people to assist the Chinese government army at all levels, directly participating in combat. He strongly stated that unless there is immediate military, financial and economic assistance from the United States, as well as technical advisors on the battlefield, the Communist Party will seize the entire Northeast within three months.

During a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Writers Club, he strongly stated that the fall of the Northeast would soon lead to the redification of the rest of China, possibly Vietnam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, and India, all being redified. If the Soviet Union feels that its eastern flank is completely safe, it can go straight to the English Channel in three months. In this situation, it is foolish for the United States to only provide economic assistance to Europe; however, when a free and independent China exists, the Soviet Union cannot consider its eastern flank completely safe.

Chennault also stated that the United States must provide China with sufficient military assistance to offset what the Soviet Union provides to the Chinese Communists. He estimated that the Japanese weapons provided by the Soviet Union to the Communist army are enough to supply one million soldiers for ten years of combat. The United States must enable the Chinese National Army to have sufficient military strength to maintain Lanzhou and Xi'an in the Northwest because there are still usable air bases there, which the United States can use to bomb Soviet industrial centers when necessary. If the National Army can hold this area, it may be able to prevent the Soviet Union from taking direct military action in Europe. He generally said that if the United States wants to protect its economic investments in Europe, it must first strengthen the Soviet Union's eastern flank, and when the United States can use bases in China, the Soviet Union will definitely not attack in the West. On the contrary, if the Communist Party controls all of China, the Soviet Union will have no worries and will go straight to the English Channel.

Chennault said that although U.S. advisors should not directly command the Chinese National Army in combat, there must be U.S. advisors in the Chinese army at all lowest levels. He pointed out that the statement that the U.S. equipment for the National Army all fell into the hands of the Communist army is nonsense. He also recalled his command of the "Flying Tigers" and the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force in China, saying that during the period from 1940 to 1941, he found that the U.S. military almost completely ignored the Far East battlefield. The U.S. Army and Air Force simply did not have a strong and accurate Asian map. At that time, the only officials in Washington who recognized the importance of the Far East were Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. He said that at that time, Secretary of War Stimson and officials of the Air Force Department opposed him recruiting pilots for the Flying Tigers. Later, through the persuasion of the late President Roosevelt, he was able to gather 250 pilots and mechanics, launch 100 P-40 aircraft, and finally destroy 299 Japanese aircraft. The current arrogance of the Chinese Communist army is actually due to Marshall's major mistake. Marshall's attempt to mediate the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party gave the Communist army the opportunity to strengthen its position in the Northeast. Chennault did not mention the amount of aid the United States should give to China, but previously, when presenting his opinions in Congress, he first said that if there could be 1.5 billion to 2 billion within two years, it could meet all military, economic, and financial aid to China.

### Administration of the German Occupation Zone Still Under the Rule of the U.S. Army; General Clay to Remain in His Current Position Indefinitely; The Soviet Union Resists the Allied Control Council in Berlin, the Three Powers Take Countermeasures

[Reuters Washington, 23rd] The White House announced today that it has abandoned the plan for the State Department to take over the administration of the U.S. zone in Germany this summer. The U.S. zone government will continue to be responsible indefinitely by the U.S. Army. The White House document stated, "It has been determined that the agreement announced by the Army Department on January 27, in which the State Department takes over the responsibility for the non-military part of occupied Germany, with the planned takeover date around July 1, 1948, is not advisable after a thorough review of the recent situation. This new decision will not have any adverse impact on the progress of developing German responsibility for self-government. General Clay will continue to be the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in Europe and the head of the U.S. military government in Germany."

[Associated Press Washington, 23rd] The White House announced today that President Truman has abandoned the plan to transfer the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to civilian rule. This is a measure agreed upon by the President in consultation with diplomatic and military advisors as another measure to prevent communism. According to some officials, Germany is the hub of the East-West conflict, and any changes in the competent authorities will inevitably weaken the position of the United States in Europe. Claylu expressed his intention to resign within the year a few months ago, but in view of today's announcement, it can be seen that he may remain in office indefinitely.

[Associated Press Berlin, 24th] U.S. military government governor Clay宜 said that military and political personnel intend to gradually change to civilian positions, and it has now been decided to implement it slowly. As for the U.S. garrison in Europe, a total of 100,000 people in Germany, Austria, and Trieste, the number is very small, but its symbolic value of not retreating is quite valuable psychologically. According to U.S. diplomats privately, this guarantee for Western Europe is even better than a formal alliance treaty in many ways.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The British, American, and French military government chiefs met today at their headquarters in Berlin with representatives from the five countries of the Western European Union, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Security was tight outside the headquarters, and the content of the meeting was also kept strictly confidential. Since representatives from the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and senior allied economic, political, and financial advisors participated in the meeting, it can be seen that the West German tripartite merger negotiations launched in London have continued in Berlin.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] British military government chief Lieutenant General Robertson announced today that until the Four-Power Allied Control Council reconvenes, the British side will refuse to participate in any affiliated institutions of the Control Council. Although Robertson denied the earlier rumors that the chiefs of the British, American, and French military governments had notified the Soviet side, demanding an immediate explanation of the meaning of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Control Council, the British boycott of the affiliated institutions of the Control Council is tantamount to forcing the Soviet side to publicly explain its recent actions and intentions. According to the Allied Control Council, the four-power leadership department includes the four-power government in Berlin, totaling fourteen units, which are now chaired by the Soviet Union on a rotational basis. Although the Soviet authorities have announced that the Allied Control Council has no longer exercised its functions and announced the indefinite postponement of the Four-Power Liaison Committee, which is second only to the Allied Control Council, they still issued a notice today that some groups under the 13 leadership departments will meet tomorrow.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The United States and France have also followed Britain's lead in declaring that they will refuse to participate in the affiliated institutions of the Control Council until the Control Council reconvenes.

### White House Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss New Expansion Plan; New Defense Budget Submitted to Congress Today

[This newspaper] New York 24th Broadcast: Washington News, it is reported that U.S. military leaders will attend Congress tomorrow and request that the defense budget be increased to 21 billion U.S. dollars. The defense budget for the fiscal year 1949 submitted to Congress by President Truman in January of this year was 11 billion U.S. dollars. Most of the proposed increase in the defense budget will be used in the air force, and great attention will be paid to the increase in aircraft production.

[Associated Press Washington, 23rd] President Truman held a secret meeting today with the nation's highest-ranking military leaders. Attendees included the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Admiral Leahy, and Director of the Budget Bureau Webb. According to the Department of Defense, the meeting discussed plans to rebuild the Army and Navy with tens of billions of dollars and to have an air force with more than 20,000 aircraft. All attendees refused to disclose the news, only Webb said, "The President's position is firm, and his decisions must be beneficial to the country." However, he did not reveal what the so-called decision refers to.

According to sources in the Department of Defense, Truman has so used the nation's military strength to support the government's position against the continued expansion of the Soviet Union. It is said that the chiefs of staff of each department have several plans, with different funding levels, ranging from 10 billion to 10 billion.

The Senate Military Affairs Committee is currently discussing the universal military training bill. Forrestal is scheduled to submit a detailed plan for the proposal to the committee on the 25th. After Truman issued a call for military training and conscription, it was rumored here that he would ask Congress to increase military spending. According to his previous request, the military budget for 1949 was 11 billion yuan. When reporters asked when the president would submit the new budget to Congress, Webb replied that he did not know. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the President told him, "The meeting only involved the budget issues of the military and did not involve anything else."

According to sources in the Department of Defense, the meeting suggested increasing the current 1,392,000 active military personnel to 1,963,000, which would increase the Army from the current 550,000 to 900,000, the Navy from the current 483,000 to 662,000, and the Air Force from the current 359,000 in 55 teams to 401,000 in 70 teams. The air force plan with 20,541 aircraft will include 6,869 first-line aircraft (including bombers, fighters, and transport aircraft, etc.), 27 teams of national defense air force totaling 3,222 aircraft, 34 reserve teams totaling 2,360 aircraft, and 8,100 reserve aircraft to replenish losses.

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The Senate Military Affairs Committee today heard testimony from former Undersecretary of State and Ambassador to Japan Grew, who supported President Truman's limited conscription and universal military training bill.

Grew said that at present, adopting universal military training and conscription can not only serve as a warning to countries with aggressive intentions such as the Soviet Union, but also encourage countries with peaceful intentions such as Greece, Finland, Turkey, and Italy to resist.

### Three-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting Possible

[Reuters Washington, 23rd] A State Department spokesman commented on reports that the British, American, and French foreign ministers will hold a meeting, saying that although there are no plans to hold this meeting at present, it is hoped that the three governments will maintain the closest contact on relevant matters. As for whether to hold it in the form of a foreign ministers meeting or in other ways, it cannot be decided at present.

### Finnish Prime Minister Arrives in Moscow Despite Illness

The other six representatives of the Finnish delegation arrived here on Monday. At that time, he could not travel with them due to illness. Now, with the permission of the doctor, he rushed to Moscow.

[Associated Press Finnish Capital, 24th] The Finnish Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union was at the call of the Kremlin. Among the six members of the Finnish delegation, those who opposed and supported the conclusion of a military treaty with the Soviet Union were equally divided. Bei is a member of the Democratic League Party and is controlled by the Communist Party, so it is expected that he will cast the decisive vote to support the conclusion of a treaty with the Soviet Union.

### The U.S. House of Representatives is Expected to Pass the Unified Aid to Europe and China Bill; The Senate Approves the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill

[Central News Agency Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives today began a scheduled 15-hour debate on the $6.205 billion "Unified" Foreign Aid Bill. The House leaders who advocate this measure most strongly urged the passage of the bill as a tool to prevent the spread of communism. When House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eden presided over the debate on the bill providing $420 million in economic aid and $150 million in military aid to China, he accused Soviet communism of "using betrayal and infiltration when possible, and using force when necessary" in an attempt to conquer the world. Eden also said: The question is whether freedom under the leadership of the United States or slavery under the protection of the Soviet Union. The Foreign Aid Bill is the path of choice declared by the United States.

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives is expected to take action on the $6.205 billion Foreign Aid Unified Bill on November 31. After that, the House and Senate will hold a joint conference to find a solution to the inconsistencies in the Foreign Aid legislation passed by the two houses. It is expected that Congress will take final action around April 10. Congressman Zhou Yide (Republican Congressman from Minnesota) gave a speech, warning the House of Representatives that it is also necessary to keep Asia free, "otherwise we will fail in Europe." Zhou said that the aid plan is a "sound investment" and that its purpose is to help democratic countries remain strong and free, "waiting for the world to be freed from its chains." He believes that the future trend of the 1 billion people in Asia is "the most profound question of the 20th century." After Zhou's speech, the audience applauded for nearly a minute.

[Associated Press Washington, 24th] The House of Representatives today urgently wanted to pass the $4.8 billion tax reduction bill and submit it to President Truman for signature and implementation before nightfall, so it temporarily shelved the $6.205 billion Aid to Europe and China General Bill. Secretary of State Marshall attended a secret Senate meeting today to report on the international situation. Those who had previously requested to cut foreign aid funds have agreed to pass the House bill in full.

[Associated Press Washington, 23rd] The Senate today passed the $275 million military aid to Greece and Turkey Anti-Communist Bill by voice vote.

### Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Su Pan, Calls for Peaceful Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union; Compulsory Military Training Canceled in Soviet Universities

[Associated Press New York, 23rd] At a banquet held by the American-Soviet Friendship Association to honor Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin, he gave a speech stating that the recent Communist coup in Czechoslovakia was a "domestic issue" of the Czech people. He called for peaceful cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Pan Youxin denied that the coup in Czechoslovakia was due to the so-called "aggression" of the Soviet Union, and that the reactionaries were using the situation in Czechoslovakia to sow the "seeds of hostility" between the United States and the Soviet Union. Wallace, the vice-presidential candidate of the Third Party, also gave a speech at the banquet. Pan Youxin denounced the current world crisis as being provoked by "certain aspects" within the United States. He said that these "people from international reactionary concentration camps" put down an "iron curtain" around the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, making it impossible for the world to know the truth about the region. He said that the United States' views on the Soviet Union are mostly "distorted information and rumors." Pan Youxin said that the Soviet Union's support for banning war propaganda, reducing armaments, and banning the use of atomic bombs can be clear evidence of the Soviet Union's desire for peace.

[French News Agency Moscow, 24th] According to TASS, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Kaftanov has issued an order that all compulsory military training in Soviet universities will be canceled from April 1.

### Freedom of Information Conference Again Rejects Soviet Amendment to the Agenda; Three Items Still Included in the Agenda

[This newspaper] London 24th Broadcast: Geneva News, today the steering committee of the United Nations Freedom of Information Conference, led by Romulo, held a meeting. Soviet representative Bogomolov attempted to obstruct the discussion of the International Freedom of Information Charter, but was unsuccessful. Bogomolov believed that there were three items on the agenda that "harmed national sovereignty" and advocated that they should not be discussed, but the result was a vote of nine to two against (the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia voted against), so they were still kept on the agenda. The three points that the Soviet Union opposed discussing are as follows: (1) Consider drafting a charter on the transmission of news, stipulating its rights and obligations; (2) Consider establishing a permanent international organization to promote the free exchange of accurate information between countries and stipulate the method of issuing journalist cards; (3) Consider establishing government news agencies in various countries so that their news can be obtained abroad, and if necessary, agreements can be established to give various conveniences to this work.

The Steering Committee discussed the Soviet proposal for two hours. The result was that those who opposed the proposal believed that if the Soviet proposal was accepted, the purpose of the meeting would be completely lost. U.S. representative Boughton believed that the issue of establishing a permanent organization must not be canceled and insisted that all three points opposed by the Soviet Union be included in the agenda.

[Associated Press Geneva, 23rd] The United Nations Freedom of Information Conference opened today. The Soviet Union proposed giving non-UN member states the right to vote and inviting Outer Mongolia to participate, but was absolutely rejected. During the meeting, the Greek representative accused Albania and Bulgaria of undeclared war, and Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun accused Outer Mongolia of being an aggressor and engaging in military activities in Chinese territory.

[Reuters Geneva, 23rd] At the International Freedom of Information Conference attended by more than 500 representatives from 53 countries, China suggested that Romulo be the chairman of the General Assembly Legal Committee, which was unanimously passed. Dutch representative Gotteha was elected as the chairman of the drafting committee on the proposal of Norway, with the support of China, India, Belgium, the United States, France, and Greece, to draft a declaration on the basic tasks of newspapers and other news industries and the basic principles of freedom of information.

[French News Agency Geneva, 23rd] When the Freedom of Information Conference opened today, it elected the chairmen of four committees. The tasks of the four committees are to review the basic responsibilities of newspapers, sources of news, transmission of news, free release of news, and legal issues.

### Luminous Flying Saucers Appear in Swiss Sky

[Reuters Geneva, 23rd] Swiss News Agency: Yesterday afternoon, a giant ball of light was discovered in the sky over the village of Weinfelden in northeastern Switzerland, flying rapidly southward. Later, a luminous flying saucer with a long tail was seen in Switzerland's central Xuza and flew straight west.

They flew from the Adriatic Sea, and at the same time, there was thunder, and they flew rapidly southwest. A reporter from this agency took a train from Turin to Rome and also saw star-shaped objects flying in the sky. Although the train was roaring, the huge sound of the object flying could still be heard.

### Communist Party Activities in Various Parts of Southeast Asia

[Central News Agency New York, 23rd] According to a New York Times report from New Delhi, the activities of the Asian Communist Party are linked to Moscow through agents stationed in several major cities in Asia by Moscow. Among the major cities, Bangkok and Hong Kong are the most important. The relevant countries that closely monitor the activities of well-known Communist leaders have discovered the methods of Communist intrusion in Asia by their reconnaissance personnel. According to investigations of wireless communications and the activities of some travelers, the Communist Party seems to have established a strong line of defense in various Asian countries. It is rumored that the working route of the Asian Communist Party, led by the Eastern Political Department of Moscow, is Wang Ming, who used to be the Communist leader in North China. It is heard that more internal organizations are set up in Harbin and Vladivostok. The headquarters in China used to be in Yan'an, and is currently not located with the headquarters of the Communist Army. According to well-informed sources, the Communist Party's agents and agitators (mostly Chinese) are sent to Hong Kong via Soviet ships sailing between Vladivostok, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, and then sneak into various parts of Southeast Asia. Other ships that frequently change crews in Hong Kong can also be used to carry Communist Party intruders. Informed sources in New Delhi believe that Moscow attempts to use international organizations such as the Trade Union Federation, the World Democratic Youth, and the Student Organization Alliance to influence the masses in Asia. Since the end of the war, representatives of the Communist Party in various Asian countries have held several meetings in Dalian, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Vladivostok. The meeting held in Bangkok last September established the Southeast Asia Alliance and promoted Southeast Asian independence, promoted world peace, and promoted the Southeast Asia Alliance. Its actions are to sue for nationalism, and this nationalism is quite similar to the racialism of the "Asia for Asians" and other propaganda used by Japan before the war.

### Marshall Advocates Strengthening the State Department

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 23rd] The House Appropriations Committee had previously cut nearly $16 million from the State Department's budget proposal. Secretary of State Marshall requested the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee today to restore it. He declared that the fiscal year 1949 would undoubtedly be an "emergency" year in world affairs. Marshall told the Senate subcommittee that the budget estimates submitted to the House of Representatives did not include some fund requests, which could be deleted and "would not actually hinder the conduct of diplomatic relations." He pointed out that the world situation concerned by the State Department has not improved in recent weeks, but has become more and more worsened. He said, "The problems of countries such as Germany, Japan, and Korea have not been resolved. The more such problems there are, the more attention and support for the United Nations will be needed."

### New Status Agreement for the Four Powers in the Trieste Free Territory; Italy Prepares to Join Negotiations; Tensions Rise Along the Trieste Border

[Our Dispatch] London, 24th (Broadcast): Milan dispatch states the situation in Trieste is tense. British and American authorities have ordered 7,000 police officers to be on standby due to planned demonstrations by the Communist Party without authorization. Furthermore, following the Anglo-American-French proposal to return Trieste to Italy, South Slav troops have advanced several hundred yards, prompting the British and American sides to reinforce their troop presence.

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 23rd]: Italy has informed the United States of its readiness to participate in drafting a proposal to return Trieste to Italy, as suggested in the joint US-UK-France statement, for consideration by the United Nations Security Council. The State Department announced today that it had received the Italian notification, as well as a memorandum from Yugoslavia opposing the return of Trieste to Italy. The original proposal to return Trieste to Italy was submitted to Italy and the Soviet Union, with copies submitted to the Yugoslav representative here and by the US representative Austin to the Security Council. Although there is no official announcement, it is understood that US officials believe that Yugoslavia has no say in deciding the future of Trieste, as it is solely a matter for the Four Powers. They point out that the establishment of the Free Territory was due to the Four Powers approving the treaty, which can be changed with the consent of those countries and Italy.

### Yugoslavia Denies Demanding Gorizia from Italy; Communist Activities in Northern Italy

Meanwhile, in Milan, the Communist Party clashed with pro-government factions again last night, with police using tear gas to disperse them. The conflict is now in its third day. A mass rally held in Piazza Bitta today saw some people shouting "Long live war!" Several people were injured. Tens of thousands of people also demonstrated in Piazza del Duomo, and the nearby police station became like a wartime scene, with iron barbed wire barriers erected on all major traffic routes.

### United States Plans to Adopt a Lenient Policy Towards Japanese Industry

Clapp Meets with Ashida

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th]: Sources close to the Clapp Mission told United Press on the 24th that the final US policy on handling Japanese industry may combine the "Strack Report and the most lenient proposals of Allied officials in Tokyo." They stated that if MacArthur's views on industry are generous, they may be adopted. If MacArthur's recommendations are less generous than the Strack Report, the latter is likely to be followed. However, the Japanese must first demonstrate their willingness to reform themselves and provide concrete evidence of reform before the United States can provide assistance. American investors planning to invest in Japan have expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's current economic situation and are hesitant due to Japan's current tax laws, and believe that Japan has not fully encouraged foreign investment.

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th]: Well-informed sources told United Press that Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida assured the special investigation mission on the 24th that the United States plans to build Japan into a bulwark against communism in the Far East, and Japan will "do its utmost" to cooperate. The sources added that Ashida met with US Undersecretary of the Army Clapp for one hour and ten minutes at Clapp's invitation. Clapp made several direct requests to Ashida, such as requiring Ashida to concentrate his efforts on restoring Japan's economy as quickly as possible. It is reported that Clapp specifically requested an increase in coal production. United Press understands that the Japanese government will request the Clapp Mission to recommend allowing Japan to borrow surplus US ships. It is understood that Clapp will meet with Takeo Kurusu, Director of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, on the 25th.

### Far Eastern Commission Issues Policy on Japan; Thorough Disarmament of Japan; Regulations Instruct MacArthur to Implement

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 23rd]: The Far Eastern Commission today issued a policy decision finalized on February 12th, aimed at preventing the revival of Japanese militarism in the future. The Commission stated that an instruction based on this policy has been sent to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo. This policy decision only concerns the prohibition of Japanese military activities and the disposal of Japanese military equipment, and is the product of the basic policy towards Japan after its surrender, which was passed by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19th last year.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd]: The eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission today announced Decision No. 47, stipulating: (1) Japan must disarm completely and may only retain rifles, pistols, shotguns, and other small arms used by the police; (2) Japan may not manufacture any aircraft of any kind during the Allied occupation period; (3) Japan may not build any warships or auxiliary ships, nor may it convert other ships for military use; (4) All Japanese military demobilization rosters should be destroyed; (5) Any military organizations, such as former officers' associations, must not be restored, and all kinds of military training should be prohibited; (6) All Japanese officers of all ranks who participated in World War II are not allowed to be employed, except those who opposed Japanese aggression, who may be designated by MacArthur as exceptions; (7) All military equipment confiscated in World War II must be destroyed, except those designated for use by the occupying forces and Japanese police, or those designated for reparations. This decision has been instructed to be implemented by MacArthur, and all actions taken by MacArthur based on the temporary instructions of the US Department of the Army must be re-specified when the peace treaty is signed to restore its pre-war sovereignty. Soviet representative Pan Youxin opposed allowing the Japanese police to use other small arms in the Commission's closed-door meeting, arguing that such regulations could be interpreted in various ways, leading to abuses.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd]: Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Pan Youxin, insisted that it would be best to stipulate a time limit for the destruction of such records, and requested the insertion of a clause stating that "the destruction must be completed within one to six months." The Far Eastern Commission ultimately did not approve this clause, but the Soviet representative also did not use his veto power. The Soviet representative also argued that all Japanese military equipment should be destroyed within six months, but this was also not accepted by the Far Eastern Commission.

International Court of Justice in Session (1) President Guerrero (2) British Judge McNair (3) Chinese Judge Hsu Mo (4) Albanian Ad Hoc Judge

### Observing the Corfu Channel Case

— (Our Special Correspondent in Europe, Zhongxi)

The Establishment of the International Court of Justice

After the end of World War II, the United Nations organization was declared established. According to Article 92 of the United Nations Charter, the International Court of Justice is the main or highest judicial organ of the United Nations. Its organization is not significantly different from the Permanent Court of International Justice established under Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations in 1922, and The Hague remains the seat of the International Court of Justice.

Looking back almost three years since the end of the war, international disputes and cases have emerged one after another. However, the International Court of Justice, which has been established for more than two years, has always been deserted. Of the fifteen judges who enjoy world renown, only President Guerrero, the judge from El Salvador, Chinese judge Hsu Mo, and a Norwegian judge and a Polish judge are permanently stationed in The Hague. The remaining eleven mostly reside in their respective countries, doing their own work. On the surface, the International Court of Justice having no cases indicates peace and tranquility, but if we pay close attention to events in international politics, we can feel that many countries after the war only know how to engage in political tactics and are unwilling to resolve issues through law. Therefore, there are many events that should have been peacefully resolved through the International Court of Justice, but now many want to evade the International Court of Justice and act expediently, so the International Court of Justice has become almost a mere formality.

The Origin of the Anglo-Albanian Dispute

On October 22, 1946, when a British destroyer fleet was passing through the Corfu Channel of Albania, two of them, the "Volage" and the "Saumarez", were successively damaged by mines, resulting in the deaths of 44 British sailors and injuries to 22 (five months earlier in the same year, a British cruiser was bombarded by the Albanian coastal artillery when passing through the above-mentioned channel). Afterwards, the British government found twelve other unexploded mines in the channel, and discovered that they were all newly laid, believing that this act was not unrelated to the Albanian government. Therefore, in January 1947, it requested the Security Council to handle the matter. The United Kingdom requested the Security Council to condemn the Albanian side, but this was vetoed by the Soviet Union. On April 9 of the same year, the Security Council resolved that "regarding the dispute between the United Kingdom and Albania caused by the mine explosion encountered by two British ships passing through the Corfu Channel on October 22, 1946, resulting in the death and injury of several British sailors, the Security Council, after considering the opinions put forward by both parties, hereby recommends that the parties concerned should submit this dispute to the International Court of Justice for legal processing."

Subsequently, on May 22, the British government applied to the International Court of Justice to file a lawsuit against Albania, believing that the Corfu Channel should be open to free passage for ships of all countries, and the Albanian government should be responsible for the discovery of mines in the channel. The Albanian government claimed that it did not know about the mine laying, and at the same time submitted a plea to the International Court of Justice, believing that although the Albanian government accepted the Security Council's recommendation, the British government applied to the International Court of Justice unilaterally without consulting with the Albanian government, and the procedure was actually incorrect, and the International Court of Justice should reject it.

After receiving the British government's application and the Albanian government's plea, the International Court of Justice scheduled a hearing for February 26 of this year to determine whether the International Court of Justice actually had jurisdiction over this case and whether it could accept it.

The Peace Palace Becomes Lively

The time for the opening of the International Court of Justice was decided by the President of the Court to be 4:00 PM on February 26. Because it was the first trial of a case after the war, the Peace Palace in The Hague, which had been deserted for nearly ten years, suddenly became lively. Cars loaded with judges, diplomats, representatives of the governments of the parties concerned, and lawyers. Journalists from various countries and ladies who came to attend the hearing and watch the excitement arrived one after another.

The courtroom for the trial of the International Court of Justice is in the right corner of the Peace Palace. By half-past three, the seats in the visitor's gallery were already full. Six large crystal lamps hung high in the hall, plus large electric lights for photography, illuminating the entire court as bright as day. The judges sit facing east, with the stenographer's seat in front to the right, the translator's seat in front to the left, and the press seat next to it. The podium for the plaintiff and defendant is in the center, with the representatives and lawyers of the British government on the right side of the podium, and the representatives and lawyers of the Albanian side on the left side of the podium. The audience seats face the judges. At four o'clock, the British representatives and lawyers, a total of eight people, entered the court first, wearing gray-white wigs and black long robes, which attracted the attention of the audience. The Albanian representatives and lawyers, a total of only three people, wore striped trousers and black tops, which were common daytime formal attire for Europeans, and were also very neat.

At exactly four o'clock, the court clerk shouted "Court is in session! Court is in session!" Sixteen judges, led by the Registrar, entered the court one after another, and all the people in the court stood up to pay their respects. The last one was the ad hoc judge from Czechoslovakia invited by Albania. According to the regulations of the International Court of Justice, if there is no judge of the nationality of the party concerned among the judges, the party concerned can select one of its own judges to jointly hear the case with the original fifteen judges of the International Court of Justice. It is said that Albania invited the president of the Slovak National Court to serve as its judge because there were no judges in Albania who were proficient in English or French. As soon as the judges were seated, journalists carrying cameras scrambled to take pictures of the judges, British and Albanian representatives, lawyers, and the visitor's gallery. (To be continued)

### Soviet Union Behind the Scenes of the Czech Coup; United States Urges Collective Action; Security Council Scheduled to Reconvene Next Thursday

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd]: The United States on the 23rd demanded that the United Nations thoroughly investigate the behind-the-scenes events of the Communist Party's seizure of power in Czechoslovakia. US representative Austin said that if the Security Council can prove that the Soviet Union instigated the recent Czech coup, the Security Council should take "collective action" to save other people who have suffered the same fate. Austin asked the Security Council to hear all possible evidence about the Czech coup. If the condemnation of the Soviet Union is specific, then this condemnation will constitute an event of indirect aggression by the Soviet Union.

However, US officials are well aware that the Security Council will not go beyond the stage of empty talk, because the Soviet Union has the veto power of the five permanent members. The "collective action" mentioned by Austin refers to the measures taken by the United Nations. According to the United Nations Charter, political and military actions are allowed for "self-defense" to prevent aggression.

Austin's request for Security Council action was in response to the 26-page speech by Soviet representative Gromyko, who said that the Czech events were caused by the "warmongers" of Britain and the United States wanting to control Europe and expanding their military. Gromyko condemned the United States for interfering in France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. However, Austin immediately replied that in addition to stating that this condemnation was incorrect, it could not liberate the Czech people from slavery. After Austin requested that the facts of the Czech coup be presented, the Security Council adjourned. The debate on the Czech events was adjourned until April 1, and was prepared to consider the US proposal to abandon the Palestinian partition plan in favor of a temporary trusteeship system on the 24th.

### British and American Figures Criticize the Korean Commission

Believing That the Commission Is Handling Matters Improperly

[Reuters, Tokyo, 24th]: British and American figures who have just arrived in Japan from Korea told this agency that the situation in Korea is deteriorating rapidly, even more than outsiders imagine. The rumors about the Korean People's Army are true. If North Korea takes action, it can capture Seoul in one fell swoop. South Korea has almost no strength to stop it except for the police force. An American expert on Korean issues said that the United Nations Korean Commission has made the situation more chaotic. When South Korea holds elections in five days, it is feared that only Syngman Rhee's faction will participate. When the United Nations Commission first arrived in Korea, it had a very high reputation, but the Korean people lost faith in it because the commission quickly interfered in politics. The expert specifically criticized Jackson, the Australian representative on the United Nations Commission, and Patterson, the Canadian representative. Jackson immediately denounced South Korea as an American police state, and the United Nations Commission had not announced the name of any of the political prisoners arrested in South Korea three months after arriving in Korea.

### List of Draft-Age Men Drawn and Their Numbers Published in Huangpu District Yesterday; Difficult to Decide Order of Conscription at This Time

[Our Dispatch] This city will conscript 6,000 soldiers this year. After the indirect lottery was held the day before yesterday, the numbers were opened and matched yesterday. However, the district heads of various districts are deeply concerned that there will be desertions of conscripts after the list is announced, and they all expressed dissent. The standing committee members of the Military Service Association convened a meeting to discuss and decided to first announce the list of conscripts drawn in Huangpu District to see the reaction.

The wooden cabinet containing the registers of conscripts from Huangpu District and other ten districts, which were sealed and preserved the day before yesterday, was personally unsealed by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, at 3:15 PM yesterday. Jiang Zhaohu, Chairman of the District People's Congress of Huangpu District, Cheng Jingyuan, the District Head, and others were present to witness. After the registers were unsealed, the staff carefully checked them in order of the drawn numbers. By about 5:00 PM, the names of all the conscripts born in 1927 in that district had been matched. The names of the first drawn conscripts and their drawn numbers in each Bao (group of households) in that district are listed as follows:

Bao Number Conscript Name Drawn Number

1 Xu Depei 9

2 Le Junpeng 9

3 Wei Shuchun 125

4 Xu Zhiyao 9

5 Fan Bingquan 9

6 Wang Keyou 76

7 Zhang Genyuan 100

8 Yu Kang 5

9 Lou Chenzhang 9

10 Xu Yinkang 9

11 Chen Yunlai 9

12 Liu Genfa 9

13 Wang Defu 9

14 Lu Yaowen 9

15 Zhang Dade 9

16 Lu Yun 9

17 Fang Kechang 76

18 Ma Shixuan 76

Bao Number Conscript Name Drawn Number

19 Zhang Zhehua 76

20 Shi Jialu 9

21 Qian Xiangyuan 100

22 Qian Jie 76

23 Wang Yunhua 9

24 Wu Xinzhang 9

25 Zhao Rucheng 9

26 Yan Jihuai 9

27 Chen Jingcheng 9

28 He Datou 5

29 Fan Shufa 9

30 Wu Changsheng 9

31 He Hesheng 9

32 Liu Genfa 5

33 Han Longbao 5

34 (No Conscripts Born in 1927)

35 Gong Xiangxing 5

It is noted that there are a total of thirty-five Bao in this district, with more than 9,200 draft-age men, and an allotment of 267 people. However, because the allotment figures for each Bao have not yet been submitted, it is difficult to decide at this time who will be conscripted this year, even though the names of the conscripts have been drawn.

### Conscription in Order of Three Birth Years

According to Yao, the section chief of the military affairs section of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the conscription quota is based on the Bao as a unit. Once the detailed quota for each Bao is submitted, a list of all conscripted men will be announced in batches. Men born in 1927 will be the first to be conscripted. However, if there are no men born in 1927 in that Bao, or if there are not enough men to meet the quota, the conscription year will still be extended, with men born in 1926 and 1925 being used to fill the gaps. As for the quota for each Bao, it is distributed based on the proportion of the number of draft-age men (excluding those deferred and exempted from service). Therefore, the first person drawn does not necessarily mean that they will be a conscript. Taking the first drawn conscripts in the thirty-five Bao of Huangpu District listed above as an example, because the number of people in each Bao is not large, all of the first name drawn “183” number of conscripts born in 1927 is completely empty. Only one person from the third Bao was drawn in the second number drawn "125". The largest number of people was the thirteenth number drawn "9", with as many as twenty-one out of thirty-five people drawn. Also, when checking the registers yesterday, citizens came to the City Council or inquired about the names of the drawn conscripts by telephone from morning to night, one after another, and their expressions were quite nervous.

### Collecting Subsidies for New Recruits' Family Support Rice by Dividing into Five Grades

[Our Dispatch] The Military Service Association discussed the issue of raising funds for new recruits' family support fees at its sixth standing committee meeting the night before last. It was decided that the conscripts drawn from the three birth years of 1925, 1926 and 1927 will pay a rice substitute fee according to their household survey status, divided into five grades: the first grade is ten dan (unit of dry measure for grain), the second grade is six dan, the third grade is three dan, the fourth grade is one dan, and the fifth grade is five dou (smaller unit). The Bao of each district will be responsible for collecting and submitting the money to the association for unified distribution based on the rationing price of rice at the time of payment.

### Assigning Duties for Military Appreciation Fundraising

### Power Plants Raising Electricity Prices Arbitrarily; Residents of Dachang District Appeal

[Our Dispatch] Shen Mingpan, the head of Dachang District in this city, Li Yangao, the chairman of the district people's congress, Chen Youxian, the principal of the national school, Zhu Wenbin, the senator, and Gu Jichang, Wang Bingxun and other residents' representatives of the district, jointly invited the press yesterday to appeal on four points regarding the arbitrary increase in electricity prices by the Da Yao Electric Plant in the district, which affects the lives of residents: (1) The plant has no power generation equipment and should have its regional operating rights revoked. (2) Before the operating rights are revoked, the electricity prices should be handled in the same way as in Jiangwan, Wusong, Baoshan, Yanghang and other districts. (3) The plant should be ordered not to arbitrarily use threats such as power outages in the front line. (4) Since the plant collects additional donations for public utilities, street lights should be installed. All the representatives also stated that they hope that the government can expedite the purchase of the land in front of the Dachang Airport, which was forcibly occupied by enemy troops, so as to avoid displacement of the residents. They also hope that the authorities will properly supervise the troops stationed in the district by military organs, so as to strengthen the exchange of feelings between the military and the people.

### New Information on the Gold Rush Case: Re-trial Possible for Defendants Yang and Zhan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Lin Fengbao, former Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, accused of collusion and fraud, previously resulted in the District Court sentencing Yang Anren to seven years in prison and Zhan Liansheng to four years in prison, while Lin Fengbao was found not guilty. Yang and Zhan, dissatisfied with the judgment, applied to the High Court for a review. As a result, the High Court upheld the original judgment and sent Yang and Zhan to Shanghai Prison for execution. Subsequently, Yang and Zhan, claiming to have discovered new evidence, applied to the District Court for a retrial, which was again rejected.

Therefore, a retrial may be possible for this nationally sensational Gold Rush case.

### Large Burglary at Xicheng Foreign Firm; Loot Fills Three Vehicles, Valued at 8-9 Billion

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Xicheng Foreign Firm at No. 11, Lane 340, Sichuan Middle Road and Nanjing Road, is owned by the Russian Kepusiding and deals in wool textiles and various valuable furs. Between 1:00 AM and 4:00 AM on the 23rd, the firm's door lock was broken by burglars. The watchman at the time heard the noise and went to investigate, but was tied up with ropes and confined to an inner room, guarded by one person. The remaining burglars then took eleven bundles of wool fabrics, six circles of colored silk materials, six dozen lipsticks, twenty women's raincoats, twenty silver fox neckpieces, fifty-eight black fox neckpieces, seven white gray squirrel short coats, fifty-eight sea horse velvets, nineteen women's leather coats, five short women's coats, and ten wool vests. They hired four pedicabs, loaded them full, and fled.

The total loss is estimated at 8-9 billion yuan. It was not until after 7:00 AM the next morning that the owner discovered the burglary and personally reported it to the Huangpu Police Branch for investigation. Director Feng Wenyao, after receiving the report, ordered the Judicial Section to investigate. Section Chief Li Yinmin personally led employees Xia Zhemin, officers Li Wenqing, Cai Weiqing, Zhang Yaoji, Pan Xiang, Li Jiapu, Wu Xueming, Gu Yongchang, Zhao Jiren, and others to investigate separately. They finally obtained clues at around 5:00 PM that day, learning that the perpetrators were hiding in a shack at No. 46, Xianyuan Lane, Songhu Road, Zhabei. Employee Xia and others went to the address without alarming the suspects. They found the ringleader and accomplices living together in one room, discussing how to dispose of the stolen goods. They were able to arrest the ringleader Wu Tonghai (25 years old, from Wuxi, also known as "Rotten Foot"), Xu Shousong (34 years old, from Jiangbei, also known as "Blind"), and accomplices Ge Yufa (39 years old, from Zhenjiang, also known as "Little Zhenjiang") and Han Shengrong (39 years old, from Ningbo, also known as "Long Foot"). All the stolen goods were confiscated and taken to the bureau along with the suspects. All confessed to the burglary. They have now applied for detention and investigation to determine if there are other cases involved, so that they can be handled together.

After questioning, he was identified as Chen Guansheng, a 50-year-old laborer from Wangdian Chehuabang. He had no family. According to his own statement, he intended to commit suicide because he felt life was uninteresting. The man has now been temporarily handed over to the Jiaxing Station Police Section for custody, in order to investigate whether there are other reasons.

### Mysterious Young Woman Swallows Phosphorus and is Rescued; Love Letters and Cards Found in Her Bag; Hidden Secret; Temporarily Detained Pending Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Tieping, a young woman from Hunan, alias Chen Ping, 21 years old, previously studied law at National Central University in Nanjing. She came to Shanghai about a month ago, and has been living without a fixed address. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 PM yesterday, she went alone to the Qiujiang Road Fuxing Inn, rented a room, and attempted suicide by swallowing black-headed matches. Fortunately, the attendant discovered her and reported it to the North Station Police Bureau, which sent officers to the scene and took her to the bureau for questioning. A business card was found in her red coat pocket, belonging to Wang Hanxun, Chairman of the Shanghai Refugee Students Association. A love letter was also found, which read: "Ming: I am sorry for everything. I regret it, but it is too late. Although I can no longer be with you, I hope you can forgive me. Ming: Don't hate me! I will die in peace. Sincerely, Ping, written an hour ago." It was not until midnight that Wang Kaiming, a railway traffic police officer, arrived at the North Station Police Bureau. He stated that he did not know Zhou at all. Recently, a former colleague surnamed Ma (currently working in Nanjing) gave Zhou a letter of introduction, asking Zhou to find him to help her find a house after arriving in Shanghai. That is how they met, but it was only for a week, and they had only met three times. She had borrowed more than one million yuan from him. According to the Police Bureau's investigation, Zhou Tieping had borrowed money from a Mr. Zhou at a certain agency, with whom she did not have a close relationship. After close investigation by Section Chief Wang, fearing that the young woman had other circumstances, she was temporarily detained pending further investigation.

### Trial Opens in Murder of Director of EWO Brewery; Two Perpetrators Confess to Acting as Lookouts, Deny Participating in Tying Up and Beating

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of German director Lunner of the EWO Brewery at No. 350, Dihai Road, Yangshupu, who was robbed and beaten to death on the evening of February 24th, and robbed of US dollars, gold, and other items, has been investigated by the police, revealing five robbers. The main perpetrators are Wang Keming (also known as Wang Kemou) and Sun Xianglin (nicknamed "White Eyes"). The remaining three perpetrators, Chen Linfu, Wang Dongyuan, and Zhang Yongxing, are at large. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wang Jiazhuo of the District Court. Wang and Sun were brought from the detention center. The victim's wife, Anna, was not present due to heart disease and was being treated in the hospital. According to Wang Keming's confession: Wang Dongyuan originally asked him to go to the EWO factory to transport beer. When they arrived, Wang told him he was going to rob something. He did not go in when they went inside, but acted as a lookout outside. He denied participating in the tying up and beating of Lunner. Afterwards, they sold two gold bars and divided 120 million yuan to him. He admitted that the silver dollars and gold ornaments that were found were from the robbery. Sun Xianglin confessed: Wang Dongyuan asked me to go to the EWO factory to fight, and later told me that he was going to rob Lunner's gold coins. The three of them entered through a bamboo fence. I was looking out at first, but later went in and saw Lunner handcuffed with one hand and tied up with the other, his face covered with clothes. I don't know who beat him to death. At this point, because three main perpetrators have not been caught, Judge Wang ordered that the hearing be adjourned and the defendants returned to custody. The court also found that Sun Xianglin had committed theft last year and was sentenced to five months in prison, and was released last October.

### Trial Opens in Embezzlement Case Involving Shortages of Materials in Enemy Warehouses

It was discovered that many of the materials were missing. Sun Zhuting and two others filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. The prosecutor investigated Qian Zongqi, deputy tax commissioner of the Customs, and staff members He Hengshan, Huang Guojie, and Lin Xuequ, suspecting them of embezzlement, and filed a public prosecution. The District Court held its first public hearing yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Xiangzu. Qian went to the United States and He went to Xiamen, and neither was present. Huang and Lin were brought in under detention. According to their confessions: there were more than 2,000 tons of pig iron and more than 20,000 water pipes when they were received. The auction was held three months after the receipt. There may have been mismanagement or theft, resulting in the shortage. However, they denied embezzlement. Because two important defendants were not present, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned and the defendants returned to custody.

### Security Authorities Crack Down on Communist Bandit Secret Organization, Detain Dozens of People with Conclusive Evidence; Mayor and Commander Jointly Host Reporters to Report Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday at 5:30 PM, Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan jointly hosted reporters in the City Hall conference room to report on the cracking down of a Communist bandit secret organization in Shanghai and the arrest of dozens of Communist Party's lurking members the week before. Mayor Wu first reported, saying that recently, a Communist bandit lurking in the city surrendered himself to the security authorities. Based on the information he provided, the Communist bandit's secret organization in the city was cracked down on, and a large amount of evidence of the Communist bandit's conspiracy activities was seized, including work reports, secret codes, plans to sabotage public utilities, and rosters. The municipal government and the garrison headquarters have arrested fifty-eight people according to the roster. After the investigation and trial are concluded, all the criminal acts and evidence will be announced together. Tomorrow (the 25th), representatives from the City Council, Local Association, City Federation of Trade Unions, Human Rights Protection Committee, City Education Association, City Chamber of Commerce, Local Security Promotion Association, and various circles' anti-communist and suppressing rebellion movement committees will be invited to view the conclusive evidence of the arrested criminals participating in Communist bandit activities, in order to show the government's emphasis on the people's personal freedom. If there is no reliable evidence, arrests will not be made casually. At the same time, it is hoped that all good citizens of the city will not easily believe rumors. The government will provide definite protection to people from all walks of life and law-abiding workers.

Infiltrating Activities, Conspiring Sabotage

Commander Xuan continued by reporting that the garrison headquarters had repeatedly received information that the Communist bandits planned to cause major disturbances during the National Assembly, and the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu also planned to cross the Yangtze River in large numbers during this period to enter the Nanjing and Shanghai areas to carry out activities. The city's security authorities have paid special attention to this. Until last week, a Communist bandit came to surrender and provided the address of the secret organization in Shanghai, thus leading to a smooth crackdown. The roster of the Communist bandit's lurking members in the city was seized. The list only contained numbers, not surnames or names. Based on this clue, the security authorities have arrested fifty people, most of whom are workers. There are people from the factory areas in southern Shanghai, western Shanghai, and eastern Shanghai. In addition, there are dozens of others who need to be arrested continuously. However, the remaining Communist bandits may take this opportunity to incite and create disturbances. The authorities have already taken precautions.

Good Citizens Will Be Guaranteed Protection

In order to demonstrate the government's respect for human rights, representatives from various people's organizations are especially invited tomorrow (the 25th) to view the conclusive evidence of the arrested criminals, in order to clarify that the government will never arbitrarily infringe upon the personal freedom of law-abiding workers and citizens, and that the meaning of arresting Communist bandit elements is to protect the good people. The arrested criminals will be interrogated according to the law and dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances. This arrest of a large number of Communist bandits is different from before, because this step is to crack down on the organization first and then arrest according to the roster, so the arrest is absolutely certain. At the same time, a large amount of evidence was also seized, including the Communist bandit's plan to sabotage public utilities and the work reports of last year's labor unrest and student unrest, so there is absolutely no wrongful arrest. He continued by saying that after this crackdown, the remaining forces of the Communist bandits lurking in the city have been greatly weakened, and their plan to launch a conspiracy in April and May is impossible to realize. Five million citizens can live and work in peace. Recent rumors that Communist bandits have crossed the Yangtze River in some places are all untrue. The Jiangnan garrison forces are strong, the navy patrols the Yangtze River, and the Songhu area is closely guarded, so there is nothing to fear and no worries.

Strictly Punish According to Law, Never Condone

Finally, Mayor Wu added that the Communist Party may also use the arrested criminals' family members crying and making trouble to launch a bitter trick. However, the government will strictly handle the case according to the law and will not condone it in the slightest. As for the fugitives, it is hoped that they will come forward to surrender, and they will be given lenient treatment. Whether the arrested criminals will be transferred to a special court or other judicial organs in the future has not yet been decided, but according to their crimes, they will be dealt with in accordance with the recently promulgated "Regulations on Harming the Republic of China during the Suppression of Rebellion." Commander Xuan also added that surrender can be dealt with by reducing the sentence. In a short time, the detailed situation of the whole case can be announced.

### Military Vehicle Maintenance System

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Fourteenth Dispatch] This March, military vehicles implemented a five-level maintenance system. The Automotive Repair General Factory of the Ministry of Military Administration, merged with the Yangon Body Factory, Chongqing Automotive Repair Factory, and Special Vehicle Repair and Manufacturing Factory, was reorganized into today's largest fourth-level sixth repair factory in the West China region.

As early as 1938, the American automotive engineering magazine had already denied repairs, emphasizing the importance of prevention and replacement. However, after visiting the automobile factory, one would know that although the General Logistics Headquarters has implemented a maintenance system of factories at all levels in various places, military vehicles are only repaired when they are damaged. If there is a problem, they must be sent to the fourth-level repair factory. Therefore, the phenomenon reflected in the repair factories at all levels across the country is: second- and third-level factories have few cars to repair, but the fourth-level factories can never finish repairing cars.

According to American standards: first-level maintenance is for each car driver to prepare a set of on-board tools for self-maintenance. The second level is responsible for inspecting the repairs of each fleet and adjusting the lubrication of each part. The third level is regular maintenance above 1,000 kilometers, replacing steel plates, carburetors, platinum, generators, etc. The fourth level is to set up factories in fixed areas, responsible for the complete repair of vehicles, engine, differential box and other replacements. The fifth level is the manufacturing plant, using waste car materials to manufacture parts and new cars. There are now two automobile manufacturing plants in China, one each in Qijiang and Shanghai, both of which are subordinate units of the Logistics Headquarters.

The car is driven by us, and often we can't even talk about first-level maintenance. Either the brake oil or lubricating oil is lacking, or there are not enough parts, so first- and second-level maintenance cannot complete the task. And various precision tools and instruments such as steam cleaning machines, generator core testers, brake lining grinders, are especially not fully equipped by the first-level repair factories. Director Zhu Heqin said it well: "The fourth-level repair factory is like an omnipotent doctor. It is necessary to apply mercurochrome to the patient, and the surgery of laparotomy is even more inevitable."

As far as the reporter knows, most of the transportation units in the Chongqing area are stationed in the mountains. The sixth factory in Shantongzi is forty kilometers away from Tuqiao. To save gasoline, the transportation units disassemble and collect broken car parts into one car and send it to the factory for repair. So repairing one car is more difficult than repairing ten cars. It is reported that there are currently about 3,750 vehicles driving in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, all of which rely on the two fourth-level factories in Yu and Zhu to be responsible for maintenance. The work is indeed arduous.

Director Zhu Heqin graduated from the first class of Jiaotong University and participated in the transportation service in 1929. He is an experienced engineer. His slogan is: "Work is happiness, laziness is a sin." He claims to be a streetcar, and all actions follow the track, so all 300 machinists in the factory respect and fear him. Few people go out at night, and they all drink tea (100 yuan a cup) in the club, read newspapers, play chess, and listen to broadcasts. Director Zhu once frankly told the reporter: If the Sixth Factory has any achievements, it is due to the leadership of Yu Sheng, the former director of the US Transportation Office, and Qiu, the director of the Eastern Sichuan Supply Bureau.

However, despite this, if we do not find ways to enrich and strengthen the automobile maintenance institutions in the West China region, simply imitating the American system will still have limited results. During the war, the total number of vehicles used by the US military in China was more than 18,000, traveling on the Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xianggui highway lines. Although it was only equipped with two special-level factories (abbreviated as URP Unit Recor,itioning Plant, specializing in repairing waste cars and parts) three fourth-level factories, and seven third-level factories, because they were well-equipped and met the conditions for a graded maintenance system, they achieved twice the result with half the effort.

### Inspecting Xuchang [The Poor Turn Over]

[Our Newspaper Zhengzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] On some walls in Xuchang City, you can still vaguely see the slogan "Open granaries to relieve the poor." We know that the Communist bandits use fighting the rich and helping the poor as their slogan, so let's see how the Communist bandits do this work? Indeed, the Communist bandits' first contact is with the poor. At first, they said that they wanted to help the poor, but they didn't know who the poor were, so they wanted all the poor to come out. Then, on each street, they established a poor people's association, elected a poor people's leader, and divided the poor into: first-class poor, second-class poor, and third-class poor. So they inquired about some poor people, who was rich on your street, who was the richest. That night, the richest and relatively rich people became "national special agents." They arrested the rich people and asked them to hand over things. The next day, the Communist bandits led the poor people's association to fight. Some of the things that were picked up were distributed to the poor. Once, each person was given a measure of rice. After that, the poor turned over like a railroad, becoming useless. They couldn't get relief grain, and they couldn't find work to do. Finally, they followed the Communist bandits to rob a few mills. After more than 1,000 rickshaw workers were organized, they lost their jobs. People from the Hebei Xuchang Compatriots Association said: "Originally, we only had 80 unemployed people. When the Communist bandits arrived, there were 280 unemployed people, which is equal to three-tenths of the state's people unemployed." Who is to blame for this? At this time, the Communist bandits didn't care anymore. There is also a miracle of the Communist bandits, which is to ban prostitutes. However, no one could answer what work the prostitutes found.

In the Communist bandit newspapers collected in Xuchang, I only saw one that cared about a poor person. It was a poor person who sold fried dough sticks, and he brought a sleeper to fry dough sticks. The Communist bandit's newspaper gave him a big fanfare.

The poor who relied on the railroad to eat are finished, the poor who relied on pulling carts are finished, the poor who relied on washing and mending clothes are finished, and the poor who relied on selling their bodies as prostitutes are also finished. What kind of poor people are doing well? Yes, some poor people who do petty begging are doing well. Those poor people who do petty begging have to ask for 2,000 or 3,000 from this family, and they have to ask for 4,000 or 5,000 from that family. They used the money they asked for to buy firecrackers and throw them at some women, laughing and laughing for a while, which was very much favored by the Communist bandits. These petty beggars came with the Communist bandits and left with the Communist bandits, seemingly forever cared for by the Communist bandits, living a happy life. Before the Communist bandits arrived, it only cost 30,000 yuan for a dou of grain. Later, it rose to 80,000 or 100,000. The grain was taken away by the Communist bandits day by day, and the price increase was like this. If the Communist bandits were not driven away, 19 out of 10 people in Xuchang would be starving. The old people said: "If the National Army had come a few days later, we don't know how many people would have run away to wasteland." Some old people had no choice but to sell some things because the Communist bandits insisted on using the fake currency of the Jinnan Bank at 25 to 1, so selling and buying was out of the question. During the New Year, few old people went to buy meat to eat, first because they didn't have much money, and second because they were afraid of struggle. The Communist bandits were very angry and said: "We are here, and you don't celebrate the New Year?"

### Land Reform and Joining the Army

On the propaganda materials of the Communist bandits, the words "land reform" and "joining the army" are everywhere. The work of "land reform" has also been done in the countryside of Xuchang, but it has not yet reached the stage of "joining the army." Everyone is clear that "land reform" is a means for the bandits to lure the old people to "join the army." The Communist bandits' Hebei-Lu-Yu Daily on November 2nd in Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Hebei-Lu-Yu successively launched a message of joining the army craze, which itself stated: "The children of the peasants who have turned over have poured into the Liberation Army, reaching tens of thousands of people or more." In another message on the same day about women's work, there is the phrase "to mobilize poor women to participate in land reform work." Then isn't it clearly stated that after the men go to "join the army," the women will cultivate the land? Although the Communist bandits' propaganda is full of talk about the "joining the army" craze, some places can't cover up the old people's unwillingness to "join the army." On that day's newspaper, there was the saying "Although women say they don't pull their legs in words, they are still passive and have not developed to the point of sending their husbands and sons to 'join the army,'" and there is the following record: "At the beginning, the new soldiers couldn't understand what the cadres in yellow military uniforms said, so they muttered, 'This is probably leading our new recruits. I don't know where they will take us?' Some individual soldiers said, 'No, just watch the expressions and act accordingly.' (meaning to desert)" "This place is not good, we can take the opportunity to run?" Regarding the real situation of "joining the army," every prisoner tells you the same thing: "You have to join." The fathers couldn't do anything, and the mothers couldn't do anything, so there were 5,000 here and 10,000 there who "joined the army."

Because of the "joining the army" of a large number of personnel, the "land reform" movement became a failure. What relying on "hiring poor peasants as the backbone to thoroughly complete land reform," "hiring poor peasants to personally do it," are all empty slogans. The so-called "eight prohibitions and ten requirements" within, such as prohibiting eating and drinking, prohibiting killing and injuring ploughing cattle, destroying agricultural tools, and eating bran and vegetables to save food, urging every household to plant spring vegetables to replace grain, preventing famine, loving Mao elm, willow, poplar trees and locust trees, and planting more spring wheat, etc., have also become empty words. The fact is that in the Communist bandits' Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Administrative Office's instructions on the current financial work (issued on January 28, 1948), the commissioners and county heads clearly stated: "The financial and economic situation in the border area is currently facing difficulties! The main manifestation is in the old liberated area counties. In terms of finances and grain, the wheat roots are generally exhausted, and there is not much cash grain in autumn grain. In terms of regions, income and expenditure are very unbalanced, so that some regions have the phenomenon of borrowing grain from the people in terms of wheat and autumn. Also, because the war situation and war service work have not been adjusted and redeemed in time, the guarantee of financial and grain income and expenditure to the higher level is not enough. Individual units have even paid deposits, which has affected the income and expenditure of funds. Military expenditure is also greatly constrained due to overdrafts. In terms of price changes, there are contradictions between decentralized collection and centralized income and expenditure in the region, and it is slow to solve the urgent need in terms of time, and it suffers from rising prices. In terms of economy, the currency is greatly affected by the war. On the one hand, the market is shrinking and the legal currency is active. On the other hand, prices are generally soaring and the currency value is declining. The imbalance between the edge and the central area, and the area far and near the battlefield in the central area, the imbalance between prices and currency value is more disparate than before. Some cities have refused to accept the currency or have spontaneous strikes, and the phenomenon of outflow of materials and intrusion of legal currency in the edge area is still very serious. Comparing everything, it is enough to explain the difficulties, but it is only the beginning of the difficulties. The war is still going on, and a part of the enemy's main force is still entrenched in our central area and has not withdrawn, and there are still five full months before the wheat harvest (whether the harvest is good or bad is still unknown)! Therefore, this instruction requires "mastering the current situation is the most basic link in financial work." The method is to levy and borrow. "The old areas are too frequent for military use and war service, and the existing grain reserves are not enough to cover income and expenditure. We must levy and borrow." After the Communist bandits' "land reform," a serious famine occurred, which is a great irony of the "land reform" movement. Because the "land reform" movement entered the "joining the army" movement, since the "land reform" movement collapsed, the "joining the army" movement must also reach the point of collapse. This is a big contradiction that the Communist bandits have no way to eliminate. (Reporter Fan Shidong of this newspaper)

### Risking Death to Eat Pufferfish, Two Men in Wuxi Die of Poisoning

[Our Newspaper Wuxi Twenty-third Dispatch] Every year in February and March, a large number of "pufferfish" appear in the river between Jiangyin and Zhenjiang. Each fish weighs about one to four catties, with a small head and a large belly, and swells up like a drum. Residents along the river often catch, wash, and cook it with pork, with the reputation of "eating pufferfish and all other tastes are gone." However, the fish contains a large amount of toxins. Its eyeballs, ovaries, and blood must be specially removed and discarded, and then the fish body must be turned over and washed with clear water. When cooking, the pot should be covered with reed mats to prevent dust from floating in. If one is not careful, it will inevitably lead to disaster. Therefore, non-residents along the river dare not try it lightly without absolute certainty. Yesterday morning, Li Zhenbang, a coolie from northern Jiangsu (67 years old), and Chen Yiqing (40 years old), two men next to Huinong Bridge in this county, picked up some pufferfish intestines on the garbage dump while scavenging. Li, not knowing that this thing contained toxins, thought it was a gift from heaven, and cooked it after returning home. After eating, the toxicity broke out, vomiting non-stop, with strange pain in his stomach. After a few minutes, he fell to the ground and died. Later, the local gang leader reported to the District Prosecutor's Office to send someone to examine the body, confirming that he died from pufferfish poisoning. Because no family members claimed the body, the gang leader was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.

### There is Actually the Smell of Gunpowder in the Buddhist Temple, Ammunition and Other Military Supplies Were Found

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou Twenty-first Telegram] It was recently reported that Linsen County's Beiling Linyang Temple in Fujian Province is suspected of privately storing military supplies. The county police station was ordered to search the temple and found two boxes of hand grenades, containing 40 rounds of ammunition, and the offending monk Xinjing and others were detained in Fuzhou. However, it has been claimed in recent days that the bullets were actually left behind by the 80th Division of the National Army when they retreated from Jinzhou during the Anti-Japanese War in 1941 and have nothing to do with the monks in the temple. The authorities believe that since the suburbs of Fuzhou are close to Linshi and have been repeatedly unsettled recently, the hiding of this ammunition in the temple is highly suspicious. In order to thoroughly understand the situation, the case will be carefully investigated.

### 詩人黃仲則故里　白雲古渡植柳

Planting Willows at Baiyun Ancient Ferry, the Hometown of Poet Huang Zhongze

[Special Dispatch from Wujin, March 23rd] The area around Shifeng Bridge and Runzhi Bridge in the east of the city has flowing streams and clear waves, and is known as Baiyun Creek. Before Runzhi Bridge was built, boats ferried passengers on both sides, so it was also called Baiyun Ancient Ferry. The houses on both banks are close to the water, with staggered buildings, all residential areas. With spring flowers, autumn moon, and shimmering water, the scenery is pleasant and has always been a place favored by the spirits of the region. Famous Qing Dynasty poets Huang Zhongze, Hong Liangji, and Zhao Oubei all lived on both banks, making it a veritable hometown of poets. The lingering legacy of their style continues to this day. The Changnian Pharmacy there, with its three open rooms, is a place for local virtuous elders to relax. Literati such as Wu Shanxiu and Gao Jingxuan, and painters such as Deng Chunshu and Xu Jing'an, spend their days chatting there, deeply enjoying the leisurely atmosphere.

### 中國學術研究的前程　（上文接第二版社論）

The Future of Chinese Academic Research (Continued from the Editorial on Page 2)

Second, is the sympathy and financial support of society. The traditional academic style that emphasizes "practical application to the world" seems to be both the cause and the result of our general social atmosphere of "seeking quick success and instant benefits." Therefore, the purely academic research that does not seek immediate results and fame has been despised and treated coldly by society for a long time, and this is especially true today. In today's era of drastic economic changes after the war, "strong winds" have almost bent even the "strong grasses," and it seems difficult for us to quickly reverse the declining trend. To make avaricious merchants respect scholars and donate funds to research endeavors may be too idealistic. However, things depend on human effort, and changing customs is a gradual process. We cannot but expect that the government's "respect for the virtuous and promotion of learning" and the self-respect of academic workers will gradually increase society's widespread sympathy for intellectuals. Recently, as new entrepreneurs have increased and come into contact with foreign entrepreneurs, leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors will gradually realize that supporting specialized research is beneficial to the success of their enterprises. We can also use this to encourage those with accumulated wealth and knowledge to gradually become involved in academic endeavors. Isn't it worth our best efforts to promote and try to imitate the fact that British and American capitalists use huge inheritances to support research endeavors, and that some large enterprise foundations contribute to scientific progress?

Third, is the self-respect of the academic community itself. If scientists in Europe and America deserve the respect of the world, I believe that scholars in China today, enduring the hardships of life, the relocation of their families, and the coldness of society, while still burying themselves in research and preserving their original selves, are truly admirable. We believe that most of the hundred academicians who are about to be born are those who have been tempered by being content with a simple life and solitude, and who still devote their remaining energy to their solitary work. The future progress of Chinese academia depends on the model set by this generation of academicians, which will create a positive atmosphere. And for those who are engaged in research work in general, including professors who are reluctant to give up research work, we earnestly hope that they will cherish themselves even more and leave more seeds for Chinese academia and plant more good causes to create a brilliant future for culture. Stabilizing their lives is a common responsibility of the government and society. The academic community "does its best" and must maintain a general sense of clarity and ease, not shifting its ambitions due to dissatisfaction with life, and not undermining its achievements due to worldly fame and fortune. In our ancient civilization, there are too few scholars who are truly accomplished and full of hope. We cannot but base ourselves on the principle of reproaching the worthy and expect them to be more modest and single-minded, cooperating with each other, and contributing their utmost to Chinese academia with a spirit of "doing nothing for oneself" and perseverance.

Fourth, the assistance of international academic cooperation. The progress of academic research in China today has shown more performance, which is of course an important factor in completing China's academic independence. Here, we only need to briefly mention past examples and current good trends, and there is reason to be optimistic. For example, the brilliant achievements of Chinese geology, which have been obtained through the cooperation of foreign scholars and its own efforts, have given significant encouragement to scientists and scientific organizations in various departments; and the good results obtained by Chinese scientists under difficult conditions during the war have also been well received by scholars from various countries. Dr. Joseph Needham (originally translated as Nidehan) in England, who spoke for China after returning to England, is a notable example. In the past two years, China has responded to many international scientific conferences by sending or is about to send experts to attend; this is as encouraging as the general trend of educational cooperation in the United Nations. In the future, we should not only be good at using the existing special funds for culture and accepting international spiritual and material assistance, and also plan to extend foreign experts to China to teach or assist in work, but more importantly, we should actively strengthen our own efforts by means of international sympathy and cooperation.

Fifth, the stability of the academic research environment. In China today, specialized research institutions are very rare, and most of the work of various specialized academic research is still carried out in ordinary universities or colleges. Most researchers can be said to be inseparable from professors in first-class universities. They engage in research with their remaining energy amidst the hardships of life and the arduousness of teaching. How can they be expected to have good results if their environment is not peaceful? However, in the past two years, university unrest has arisen one after another, strikes have been heard from time to time, and a single call has drawn a hundred responses, discarding coursework like worn-out shoes, which has become a strong satire and threat to the status and work of professors and scholars. We often see military police carrying out arrests, which sometimes involve university students and cause disturbances, or presidents dismissing some professors and causing disputes. We cannot but implore the government authorities to grant the greatest tolerance to the words of teachers and students, except for those who are indeed engaged in political conspiracies that endanger public security, under the major principle of respecting academic and freedom of thought. However, the propagation of dogma and the pursuit of truth can never coexist, and violence or the suspension of classes is certainly the enemy of science and culture. All activities that undermine stability and academic progress should be forbidden by pure scholars. Then, should the stability of the research environment in academic institutions be subject to academic public opinion sanctions, or is it merely regarded as a matter of educational administration?

In short, the ideal goal of Chinese academic research is of course to complete China's academic independence and to stand on an equal footing with all countries in the world academically. Although it is still far from the goal of academic independence—such as Mr. Hu Shih's advocacy of "establishing the foundation of academic independence in ten years"—but with the achievements already made and the current trend, we have indeed seen a bright future in the dawn. The birth of the "academicians" of this research institute will certainly encourage the efforts of our experts and scholars, arouse good impressions in the international academic community, and enable us to embark on a solemn journey and complete the mission of academic independence, national construction, and success in China. (End)

### 上海教育界無危機可言　教局發表書面談話　駁斥搶救教育聯會

No Crisis in Shanghai's Education Circles; Education Bureau Issues Written Statement Refuting the Education Rescue Federation

[Dahua News Agency] Yesterday's news reported on an advertisement from the so-called "Shanghai All Circles Education Crisis Rescue Federation," which defended itself against the Education Bureau's decision to deem it an illegal organization and ban it. The person in charge of the Education Bureau issued the following written statement in response: "There is currently no crisis in Shanghai's education circles at all. The bureau approves all requests for free education from needy students. Although teachers' lives are still difficult, the bureau is gradually implementing benefits. As for the parents' side, students have not dropped out of school due to tuition fees, so the burden problem does not exist. The allocation of teachers' training funds was jointly decided by representatives of schools in the city and suburban districts, and there were no objections from any party, and all funds have been distributed. All of this proves that there is no crisis in the city's education, so the so-called "rescue" is purely a baseless claim. Its intention is to create a crisis and attempt to create unrest in the education circles. In short, "The bureau is responsible for stabilizing Shanghai's education, and will, as always, strictly ban illegal organizations that are actually creating a crisis."

### Private Schools Overcharging Tuition; Li Ximou Personally Conducts Spot Checks

[Our Newspaper] It has been over a month since the start of the semester for private primary and secondary schools in this city, and the Bureau of Education has received many reports from parents of students regarding schools overcharging tuition. Acting Director Li Ximou attaches great importance to this and personally went to various schools yesterday morning to conduct spot checks on the fees charged. Four schools were inspected yesterday, and he will continue to conduct spot checks at various schools in the coming days when he has time. According to Acting Director Li, he told reporters: The points of inspection at each school are: (1) Is the finances open? Is the tuition used for teacher welfare? (2) Is the free quota in line with standards or expanded as much as possible? (3) Is the number of students overcrowded? If the overcharged fees are used for public purposes and to benefit teachers, then it can be excused. Some schools issued six months' salary to teachers and staff at the beginning of the semester, and the Bureau of Education will encourage this point. Schools with particularly outstanding performance in this spot check will be rewarded. Those with poor management will also be punished, and the list of rewarded and punished schools will be made public.

### World Games Football Preliminary Round Full of Twists and Turns; The Problem Centers on the Xingdao Team; Rong Qizhao Consults Wang Zhengting

[Our Newspaper] The preliminary selection of our country's football team for the World Games has been full of twists and turns and has reached a stalemate, which has not yet been resolved. Initially, there were rumors that the Xingdao team would not participate in the World Games preliminary selection and would be led by Hu Hao to South America, but the news later subsided. The Shanghai Interport team went to Hong Kong, originally intended to serve as the World Games preliminary selection, but returned north in a hurry. Dr. Rong Qizhao, chairman of the selection committee, flew between Hong Kong and Shanghai, but failed to resolve the personnel issues. When the Javanese Overseas Chinese football team arrived in Hong Kong to participate in the preliminary selection, Dong Shouyi flew to Hong Kong to participate in negotiations, and his remarks upon returning to Shanghai seemed to indicate an improvement in the situation. However, this newspaper received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the Malayan Overseas Chinese telegraphed Hong Kong to express their opposition to selection behind closed doors, insisting on participating in the preliminary selection. There were also proposals in Hong Kong to re-conduct regional selections and reorganize the selection committee. Suddenly, there was news that the Xingdao team would join the Guangzhou Police Team to attend the National Games and not participate in the World Games preliminary selection, and so on. The matter started again with twists and turns. Yesterday, a telegram from the United Press in Hong Kong explicitly stated that Hu Hao recommended the Xingdao team representatives to attend the World Games, so the twists and turns and the truth were revealed, and it seemed that the center of all the problems was the Xingdao team. Dr. Rong Qizhao, chairman of the football selection committee, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. This newspaper's reporter visited him yesterday. According to him, the Malayan telegram of opposition was indeed the case. The Ministry of Education had instructed overseas embassies to inform overseas Chinese to participate in the National Games, but it did not explain that the basketball, track and field, and swimming events in the World Games preliminary selection would be selected in the National Games, while football would be held separately in Hong Kong. Therefore, a misunderstanding occurred, thinking that they only needed to participate in the National Games and did not need to go to Hong Kong. The Javanese team also took a long time to understand clearly when they left Batavia. Since Malaya requested to participate, they should be given the opportunity. However, due to the proximity of the departure date, they were limited to arriving in Hong Kong before the end of April, otherwise, due to time constraints, it could only be regarded as a waiver. The selection committee will also not be reorganized, but only a few more people will be hired. As for all other issues, as well as the selection of the representative team, etc., a final decision will be made after consulting Dr. Wang Zhengting.

### Hu Shi Passes Through Shanghai to Nanjing to Attend the Academia Sinica Academician Council Meeting

[Our Newspaper] Dr. Hu Shi came south from the northern plateau with a healthy spring spirit. After presiding over the board of directors of Peking Union Medical College yesterday, he took a train to Nanjing that night to attend the Academia Sinica Academician Council meeting held in Nanjing today. The doctor's trip is burdened with three important tasks, and it can be said that it is not in vain.

From several visits to the doctor, I gained a valuable experience: the doctor is most afraid of unconditionally meeting reporters and asking him to express the views of a philosopher and historian on current events. Yesterday was a big exception and it was also lucky. The old man, in his busy schedule, chatted with several reporters who visited him for more than an hour on the thirteenth floor of the International Hotel, a skyscraper. He revealed all the major decisions of the Peking Union Medical College Board of Directors. The reporters wrote down notes like they were listening to a class in a professor's home. This, to the doctor, was like a small bridge and flowing water, pouring straight down without hesitation.

Most of the National Medical Talents are Products of Peking Union Medical College

Starting from the budget of more than 680,000 US dollars for Peking Union Medical College, converted into the prevailing black market value, he used a pen to combine the two numbers into one number, which surprised him, and he repeatedly called it "envy." He said, "I am afraid that the sum of the current national university education funds is not as much as the budget of this one Peking Union Medical College." The topic naturally turned to his ten-year academic independence plan that he released to reporters last year. Although he waved his hand and did not want to read it, he could not help but use "Peking Union Medical College" as a metaphor.

The doctor believes that spending more than 680,000 US dollars from the Rockefeller Foundation every year to concentrate on training a Peking Union Medical College seems like a lot of money on the surface, but in fact, almost all of the medical and nursing talents with achievements in various parts of the country today are "products" of "Peking Union Medical College," thereby teaching and raising more talents. This kind of intangible gain is worth a good calculation. Therefore, he advocates that the government should concentrate its efforts to run ten good universities in a short period of time under the principle of focusing on quality rather than quantity. The Rockefeller Foundation can do "one ability," and the country should do "ten abilities." Although his plan has been published, the reactions from various parties have been different. From the perspective of the entire country, he still insists that it is necessary. Now that the country's financial resources are insufficient, this plan is just a plan.

I Hope the Soviet Union Today Will Not Repeat the Mistakes of History

From another corner, the topic was led to the edge of history. The doctor believes that in the past 20 years, two major tragedies have occurred in the world. One is the two defeats of Germany, and the other is the defeat of Japan. The two countries have worked hard for decades, accumulated a lot of effort, and established themselves as major powers. However, they were destroyed in one fell swoop due to a difference in thought. He seemed to have endless emotion in his words. He said that when Japan invaded China, I repeatedly warned Japan not to destroy the efforts they had painstakingly accumulated for decades, but the result is what it is today. With the same feeling, he also hopes that the Soviet Union today will be passively harmless to people and actively beneficial to people, and become a major power in the world, and be admired by all countries, and not repeat the mistakes of history and destroy itself. He said that in the "Hu Shi Wen Cun," "Hu Shi's Diary in the United States," and his correspondence with Xu Zhimo in the Soviet Union, he retained this kind of yearning for the Soviet Union.

Despises Isolationism and Despises Wallace

Talking about domestic affairs, the doctor reiterated his view that "peace is more difficult than war," and since peace is impossible, it is better not to talk about "peace." He is never willing to "tell fortunes" and say who will win or lose in the future. The reporter brought the question to the US election. He said that he can't see it now. According to custom, the Republican Party will hold a meeting in June and the Democratic Party will hold a meeting in July to nominate candidates before we can see the clues. He believes that Wallace, of the US Third Party, represents the revival of American isolationism. Wallace was born in Iowa, which is the agricultural society of the central United States. It is unfavorable to the world, especially to China, for an isolationist to hold office. He believes that Wallace will never be elected this year. Personally speaking, he does not want Wallace to be elected. He despises Wallace and despises the reappearance of isolationism in today's world.

Before he could finish speaking, a guest came to visit. Colleagues resigned and asked him, "Who will you vote for when you attend the National Congress this time?" He smiled and said, "I can't tell you. You should respect the opinions of our voters." The reporter then shook hands and said goodbye. (Its Rong)

(3) It is rumored that in a month, Japanese yarn and cloth will be dumped in large quantities to Southeast Asia. Because its cost is lower, the committee will try to strengthen the export of cotton yarn in the future in order to win foreign markets and at the same time can use it to purchase raw cotton. Regarding the rumors that the committee will open up the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south, Chairman Yuan said that this is not the case. Regarding the rumors that more than a dozen Shanghai yarn factories will move to Hong Kong to set up factories, Chairman Yuan believes that although Hong Kong is a port for the import and export of goods in South China, the supply of raw materials is more convenient. However, Hong Kong's climate is not suitable for textiles, and transportation is difficult. The saying that factories will move is, in fact, still difficult and not easy to realize.

### Yarn Exchange for Printed Cotton: Export Association Actively Exports to China

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the yarn exchange for printed cotton, the original exchange rate has been decided by the 12th Committee Meeting of the Export Association. Committee members Si Lu, Rong Yixin, Deputy Director Yuan Zhongkui, Chief Secretary Liu Jianhua, and Deputy Chief Secretary Song Lifeng are responsible for handling it. In order to ensure equal opportunities for all factories, it is specifically stipulated that factories that meet the export product standards should increase their exchange volume by one-third. The resulting cotton will be distributed to factories whose products do not meet export requirements, to demonstrate mutual cooperation. Secondly, each factory will exchange 10% of its total production volume with the Export Association for cotton. Because the existing cotton is not sufficient for the total exchange, it has been decided that exchanges of 500 bales or less will be honored in full, while exchanges of more than 500 bales will be allocated proportionally. In addition, the China Cotton Textile Joint Venture Company plans to exchange foreign exchange earned from exports with the Export Association for cotton yarn, and voluntarily relinquish the right to use 40% of the foreign exchange required by the Export Administration Committee to purchase raw materials. The Export Association has agreed, but the exchanged cotton yarn must be used for reproduction and limited to the equivalent raw materials required for exported finished products.

### Tight Credit, Stagnant Sales: Cotton Yarn Prices Steadily Decline, Fabric Sales Vigorous but Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw the release of yarn by the Textile Construction Company, leading to a significant increase in allocation. Credit became even tighter in the industry, and sales in the market were stagnant. Local transactions were also scarce, and market prices steadily declined.

The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately fell below the 200 million yuan mark, to 196 million yuan. Subsequently, the reproduction industry made up for the losses, and local entities also came to pull up the price, bringing it back to the 200 million yuan mark. However, it was only a fleeting moment, and the price fell again, closing at 176 million yuan, a drastic drop of 28 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The arbitrage trading of 21-count Double Horse yarn remained active, closing at 103 million yuan. However, actual sales of Double Horse yarn remained limited, with closing prices as low as 100.6 million yuan, a decrease of 9 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, 20-count yarns of various grades continued to fall by more than 10%, with most falling below the 100 million yuan mark. Coarse yarns such as 16-count and 10-count broke below the 90 million yuan mark, a drastic drop of about 12%.

Yesterday's cotton fabric market was affected by tight credit and lower prices in other regions, creating a price inversion. Customers frequently offered to sell, and although northern merchants were interested in purchasing, the exchange of foreign currency was slow, and remittance was difficult for financial institutions. As a result, there was a lack of momentum. Retailers and fabric merchants widely believed negative news, and competed to sell. The market was filled with selling pressure.

The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately fell by 60,000 yuan, to 3.9 million yuan. Subsequently, sporadic demand improved slightly, and the market showed signs of recovery. However, the Shanxi merchants suddenly released a large amount of fabric, and merchants also sold off their holdings. Fabric stores cut prices significantly, and a selling frenzy erupted, causing the market price to fall again. Dragon Head fine cloth fell all the way to 3.83 million yuan. Around noon, northern merchants saw the low price and slightly increased their purchases, pushing the price back up to 3.95 million yuan. Later, news of the weak yarn market led to a small decline, closing at 3.89 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but 190,000 yuan lower than the price outside the market.

The prices of other grades of fine cloth also declined by 20,000 to 100,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen tribute cloth and serge were sold off in large quantities, falling by about 200,000 yuan. In addition, the prices of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth all fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

In addition, it was reported that Double Flying Dragon fine cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company the day before was sold at a loss of 140,000 yuan, with a transaction price of 3.48 million yuan. The price temporarily recovered to break even, but ultimately still required a loss of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to attract buyers. It is said that most of the buyers were arbitrageurs.

Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company sold 10 types of cotton yarn as usual, with a total of 239 applications for 670 pieces, equivalent to 953.5 pieces of 20-count yarn.

The opening prices of each yarn were as follows: 20-count Heavenly Maiden 92 million yuan, 6-count Sub-Sunlight 53 million yuan, 8-count Sunlight 55 million yuan, 10-count Yang Crane 57 million yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach 125 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 142 million yuan, 40-count Tk Color Ball 183 million yuan, 42-count Double Strand Precious Light 166 million yuan, 60-count Sunlight 222 million yuan, 60-count Double Strand Singed 320 million yuan.

### Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Promotes the Electrochemical Industry in this City

The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday released an overview of China's electrochemical industry and future promotion methods as follows:

(1) Importance of the Electrochemical Industry: The most important and largest electrochemical industry is the electrolysis of edible salt, the products of which include caustic soda, bleaching powder, liquid gas, hydrochloric acid, potassium chlorate, metallic sodium and other products. These products are closely related to industry.

(2) Current Status of China's Electrochemical Industry: The electrochemical factories in China that are currently in operation include Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, Taiwan Alkali Industry Company, Shanghai Dazhong Electrochemical Factory, Jiangnan Electrochemical Factory, Zhongguang Electrochemical Factory, Liuhe Electrochemical Factory, Huachang Electrochemical Factory, Tianjin Chemical Industry Factory, Shenyang Northeast Chemical Factory, and Qingdao Zhongfang Chemical Factory, among others. The maximum production capacity can reach 915 tons per month, and the current monthly production is about 650 tons. The alkaline water produced by the alkalization of soda ash is not included.

(3) Current Difficulties: (1) The electrochemical factories in Shanghai developed significantly during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, due to the influx of imported goods, most of them switched to other industries, and it is difficult to recover in the short term. (2) Shanghai lacks sufficient electricity, and electrodes are not easy to purchase, so it is difficult to set up electrochemical factories.

(4) Promotion Methods: (1) Stipulate incentives for establishing electrochemical factories in Taiwan, and allow the import of new electrochemical machinery. (2) Provide convenience for electrochemical factories in Shanghai that are preparing to resume production to connect to electricity.

(5) Expected Results: (1) Establish an electrochemical factory in Taiwan that can produce 2,000 tons of caustic soda per month within three years. (2) The electrochemical factories in Shanghai that have not resumed production, such as Tiantai Chemical Factory, etc., can continuously produce within one year.

### Approved Import Permits Announced but Goods Not Yet Picked Up After Arrival

Import and Export Association Requests Early Resolution

[Reported by this newspaper] The goods of various importers in this city, which arrived with import permits issued before the announcement, have not been picked up to this day due to problems with letters of credit and foreign exchange. The goods arrived before the end of last year, and are all domestic materials and industrial raw materials that are lacking, and already have legal pre-announcement permits. The Import and Export Association of this city believes that the importers are suffering great losses due to the long-term suspension, and has sent a telegram to the Central Bank requesting that for letters of credit with pre-announcement import permits opened by importers, the foreign exchange that has already been used should be compensated to the designated bank in legal tender at the current listed exchange rate, with the difference between the exchange rate at the time of opening the letter of credit and the exchange rate at the time the letter of credit was used, which would then be transferred to the national bank as compensation, so that they could be notified by the Alkali Administration Committee to endorse the pickup of the goods, so that the pending case could be resolved as soon as possible.

China Trust Business Meeting Concludes

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held a business meeting from the 19th of this month, and completed the review of proposals from various groups yesterday (the 24th) morning. At 3 p.m., Director Wu Rencang presided over the general meeting, and announced the adjournment after the proposals were passed.

### This Year's Agricultural Loan Quota for Zhejiang Province is 1 Trillion

Guan Longsun, manager of the Zhejiang branch of the Farmers Bank, recently went to Beijing to attend a bank affairs meeting. After the meeting, he came to Shanghai and said that the agricultural loan quota for the region is 1.005 trillion yuan. The Cooperative Treasury accounts for more than 340 billion yuan, and our bank accounts for more than 650 billion yuan. Loans of 69 billion yuan were issued in March, focusing on increasing grain and cotton production. The next priorities are tea, silk, fisheries, and land finance. According to the actual needs of this region, at least 3 trillion yuan are needed this year. The current figure is only more than 600 billion yuan, which is a large discrepancy from the original plan. However, we will still do our best to implement national policies. The organizational foundation of farmers in this region is relatively solid, and there are no major difficulties in the agricultural work.

### Tea Market Remains Firm

The tea market, which had just stabilized, once again saw a strong surge in prices yesterday. The reason for this is that after foreign tea was favored by French Belgian, the purchasing enthusiasm of exporters was strong, and they competed to purchase it. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, various parts of the country are also inquiring about them, but the market inventory has not increased, and there is still some time before the new season. Therefore, the sellers are determined to hold on to their stock and are unwilling to part with it. This creates a situation where demand exceeds supply. Although transactions are mediocre, the market sentiment is gradually improving, and the foundation is very solid.

### Taiwan Sugar Allocation Price Increased: Generally Increased by 550,000 per Dan

[Reported by this newspaper] The sugar subgroup of the Price Evaluation Council of this city held its 24th evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. Because Taiwan Sugar's costs have increased, the exchange rate of legal tender is frequently adjusted, and because the difference between the Taiwan Sugar allocation price and the market price is too large, merchants are competing to obtain it, resulting in fraudulent activities. Therefore, it was decided to increase the allocation price to bring it closer to the market price, so that such corrupt practices would not occur.

The meeting decided to increase the allocation price of Taiwan Sugar Company's 13th phase, as follows, with a general increase of 550,000 yuan per dan compared to the previous phase.

The allocation price per dan is: Special Grade Granulated White, 4.25 million yuan, Grade 1 Granulated White, 4.1 million yuan, Grade 2 Granulated White, 3.95 million yuan, Grade 3 Granulated White, 3.65 million yuan, Brown Sugar, 3.8 million yuan, Taiwan Green Sugar, 3.5 million yuan, Special Grade Cotton White, 4.35 million yuan, Grade 1 Cotton White, 4.2 million yuan, Grade 2 Cotton White, 4.05 million yuan, Rock Sugar, 5.8 million yuan.

The evaluation council also decided that the evaluation council will be changed to meet once a week in the future (previously once every two weeks), and the payment deadline for sugar allocation will also be shortened.

Marked Down

Yesterday, the sugar market saw the price fixed by the Taiwan company, and they decided to adjust it. Green, red, and white sugar increased by 550,000 yuan, and rock sugar increased by 700,000 yuan. However, because the money supply was incredibly tight, and the actual sales didn't improve, the association's allocation was reduced instead of increased. For example, the current price for the 24th raw white was between 4.7 million and 4.68 million yuan, decreased by 150,000 to 160,000. The price for half white was even, the bag packaging was 5.1 million yuan, and the grass packaging was 4.9 million. The price for 20 medium granulated white was also reduced by 100,000 yuan, to between 4.17 million and 4.2 million. The direct delivery of Taiwan red was only 4 million yuan. In the afternoon, the trading price on the order form dropped by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.

The volume of native sugar transactions was very low, and the price fell again. The price for Shantou green was between 2.98 million yuan and 2.96 million yuan, a small decrease of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price for Xinghua white was 4.45 million yuan, and the price for Xinghua red was 3 million yuan, decreased by 50,000 each. The price for Diao green was 2.7 million yuan, a small decrease of 100,000 yuan. The price for Hainan red was 2.2 million yuan, a small decrease of 80,000 yuan.

### National Bank to Provide Overdrafts for Agricultural Loans This Month: One-Month Term, 4% Interest

This year's agricultural loan is 15 trillion yuan, and it is decided to be issued in installments. The total amount of loans in March, excluding Taiwan, is 14.75 trillion yuan. Li Shuming, general manager of the Agricultural Bank, came to Shanghai yesterday to discuss the matter of re-mortgage with the Central Bank. It is reported that as a result of the consultation with Deputy Governor Liu, in order to save time, it was decided to allocate funds by overdraft first, and then handle the re-mortgage next month. The overdraft term is limited to one month, and the monthly interest rate is 4%. The amount allocated to each district and branch will be notified by the Central Bank to each branch for local allocation. The overdraft will be paid in full, and the re-mortgage will be processed at 90% of the value.

### People's Livelihood Adjustment Council Sells Rice, Applications are Scarce: Actual Rice Sales Remain Stagnant, White Japonica Rice Slightly Rises by Several Tens of Thousands of Yuan in North and South Markets Yesterday

The rice market rose slightly after falling. After falling for two consecutive days, the price was already very low, and there was a price inversion with the production area. The owners were unwilling to sell at low prices due to cost considerations, so they started to hold up the prices. However, sales were still not active, so although it was said to have risen, the actual increase was very small.

At the beginning of the market, the owners wanted to reverse the decline and raised the price by 100,000 yuan. However, because actual sales remained stagnant, the price fell back, and the result was only an increase of 50,000 yuan. The closing price of white japonica rice in the northern market was 3.8 million yuan, and the closing price of special high japonica rice was 3.95 million yuan. The price of Bo Dao rice rose more. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Council opened the sale of early rice at 3.4 million yuan, but there were not many buyers.

The price of flour fell first and then rose back, and the result was a slight increase. The market continued to decline at the beginning, following the previous decline. The opening price of Lao Che flour was only 1.45 million yuan. The low price attracted purchases, and sales had been on the sidelines for many days. The closing price rose back to 1.475 million yuan, the same as the previous day. The closing price of Bingchuan was 1.165 million yuan. Hongfeng Jiancheng, under the competition of retail investors, was even higher than the previous day by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. The price of bran rose back to 800,500 yuan.

For miscellaneous grains, due to the continuing tight money supply, owners were eager to sell. Actual sales and customers rarely inquired. The initial price of Hankou Zha beans was 1.8 million yuan. The closing price of slightly inferior beans was 1.75 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. The sale of corn was stagnant, and the price of high-quality goods was weak by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The price of green beans continued to fall by 50,000 yuan. Customers did not inquire about red sorghum, and the price fell back by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price of sesame fell by 100,000 yuan. Guangdong merchants did not purchase raw peanuts, and the price also fell by 100,000 yuan.

Due to the increasing tight money supply, owners of edible oil were eager to sell, and oil mills also opened sales. The opening price of soybean oil from the Dayou factory was 7.47 million yuan, and the price of recycled oil was as low as 7.45 million yuan. The prices of other soybean oils were as low as 7.4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan each. The arrival of raw oil increased slightly, and there were many sellers. The price of Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil fell below 9 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan. The price of raw rapeseed oil fell by more than 100,000 yuan. The price of Xiaoche sesame oil initially fell slightly and then rose, and the result was an increase of 100,000 yuan. Under the excessive supply of soybean cake, the price fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The Zhongzhi factory opened many ZZZ brand cakes.

### England Plans to Increase Purchases of Tung Oil, Silk, Sesame and Eggs in China

The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently approved a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the British Consulate in London had received a letter from Mr. Gilbert, an official of the British Ministry of Commerce: In order to balance Sino-British trade, the United Kingdom plans to increase its purchases of several commodities in China, such as eggs, oilseeds, tung oil, vegetable oil, raw silk, super waste silk, dry cocoons, and ramie. If our country can increase the export volume of the above-mentioned commodities to the United Kingdom, it will be beneficial to the development of trade between the two countries. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Economic Affairs immediately sent telegrams to the relevant competent authorities to investigate the possible increase in the export volume of commodities to the United Kingdom, so as to verify the reply.

Soap Prices Decline

In the daily necessities soap market, the prices opened higher in the morning, with strong purchasing interest from fellow merchants and vigorous efforts to raise prices. However, because cigarette prices fell back, floating investors sold off to take profits. As a result, Guben soap had ample supply due to distribution arrangements, and fell all the way to a low price of 5.75 million yuan at the close, a drastic drop of 130,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day. Arrow brand soap also fell by 70,000 yuan, to 5.45 million yuan. The prices of other soaps, such as Guanghua, Meili, and Xiangmao, also fell back by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan respectively.

In the match market, Meili old brand matches were more actively sold and rose by 200,000 yuan. There were different opinions on new brand matches, and the prices fluctuated.

In the kerosene market, under the control of tight credit, wholesale transactions among fellow merchants were very limited. Those with tight funds even sold off their holdings, and the price fell again. The price of Gao Du barreled kerosene fell to 18.5 million yuan, a decrease of 500,000 yuan. Mobil canned oil was traded at around 2 million yuan, and the retail price was 45,000 to 46,000 yuan per can. The price limit was still 33,000 yuan per catty. Candles were stable, and the price did not rise or fall.

Cigarette Prices Weaken

Yesterday's cigarette market initially saw some purchases from retailers who saw low prices. The price of Ten Branches Great Britain rose to 98 million yuan, and Old Knife rose above 80 million yuan, to 80.5 million yuan. Later, it was heard that the prices of non-industry goods were still weak, and the industry's money supply was becoming increasingly tight due to the continuous distribution of goods by manufacturers. A large number of goods were sold off at high prices.

In the afternoon, goods from fellow merchants in other regions were continuously dumped, and the market became even weaker. At the end, the price of Ten Branches Great Britain fell back to 94 million yuan at the close, a decrease of 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife closed at a low price of 76 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan.

The sales of other Chinese merchant cigarettes were stagnant, and the prices also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. However, brands such as "Brandy Shipowner Crusader" still felt resilient. In addition, the American goods strip cigarettes and fifty-branch cigarettes also weakened.

### Chinese Stocks Weaken in the Morning Session, Slight Turnaround in the Afternoon

Chinese stocks were forced to fall yesterday morning due to the expiration of contracts, the decline in non-industry prices due to excess inventory, and the rise in Hong Kong electricity. The afternoon saw a strong rebound, and prices suddenly rose near the close.

The market opened weakly due to the continued impact of the US loan. Yongsheng opened at 1,790 yuan and 1,760 yuan. It then fell to 1,750 yuan and 1,775 yuan, and then rose to 1,760 yuan and 1,795 yuan. At this point, there were more supplies for sale, and the price moved downward again. Before filling empty positions, it rebounded to 1,745 yuan and 1,775 yuan. Many sold at high prices. Liquidity remained tight. Non-industry materials fell. Excess holdings crashed. Xinyi was forced to stop trading. Yongsheng fell to the low prices of 1,650 yuan and 1,685 yuan. The closing price of immediate delivery shares was 1,652 yuan, and Xinyi also recovered a bit.

### Authorities Strictly Prohibit Silver from Flowing into Communist Areas

The Ministry of National Defense, in view of the large-scale looting of gold and silver dollars by the Communist bandits in Henan, requires all local people who have been kidnapped to be redeemed with gold and silver dollars. A month ago, each silver dollar sold for as much as 300,000 yuan in Xincai County, and the price in Xinyang, Hankou, and other places was as high as 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. Therefore, the free areas often discover smugglers transporting gold and silver dollars to the bandit areas. The ministry yesterday specifically notified the police bureau of this city to reiterate the ban (i.e., the measures for traffic and economic blockade against the bandit areas promulgated on January 9, 1947, and the measures for prohibiting the transportation of goods to the bandit areas promulgated on March 12, 1947) to strictly restrict the inflow of gold and silver into the bandit areas, and ordered that all provinces, counties, cities, townships, and towns connected to the bandit areas be prohibited from using silver dollars. Those who violate the order will be confiscated and confiscated. It is learned that the police bureau will strengthen the inspection of illegal shops selling gold and silver starting from today.

### Silkworm Seed Pricing and Loans: Silk Association Proposes Measures to the Ministry

The Silk Association held a meeting on the 22nd to discuss the regulations for silkworm seed prices and the approval of loan methods. It was resolved to submit the following key points to the Ministry for approval and implementation:

(1) The amount of the loan will be approved based on the equipment of various farms and the quality of the seeds. The grading will be detailed based on the silkworm farmers' breeding performance, and will be divided into four levels. The first level of loan will be approved at 80% of the production cost. The second level will be 70%, the third level will be 60%, and the fourth level will be 50%.

(2) The price of seeds will be determined according to the actual production cost required at the time of pricing, excluding the increase in prices and differences obtained through loans, plus interest and profits. However, the production cost of silkworm seeds will be calculated according to the first level. The calculation of interest will be based on the actual interest rate of the loan bank for the loan portion. The working capital portion of various farms will be calculated at 15%. The profit is set at 20% of the production cost.

(3) The government has the right to purchase or not. The government may purchase according to the stipulated price, or not purchase. However, when purchasing, the proportion of the actual loan amount to the production cost shall not exceed the first level.

(4) The purchase and distribution of silkworm seeds shall be handled by the China Silkworm Company in conjunction with the China Agricultural Bank, and may entrust local governments or silkworm improvement institutions and organizations to directly distribute silkworm seeds.

(5) The evaluation of silkworm seeds, the investigation and calculation of silkworm seed production costs, the evaluation of the equipment of various farms, the quality of silkworm seeds, and the breeding of silkworm seeds, etc., shall be discussed by the Silk Association by inviting relevant agencies and hiring experts to form a subcommittee, and then submitted to the association for decision.

### Approved Import of Japanese Repatriated Goods Exempt from All Taxes and Duties

The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office recently received a letter from the Japanese Reparations Committee stating that the committee had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to exempt all customs duties and local taxes on the import of Japanese reparations. Because Japanese repatriated goods are now being returned by ships carrying reparations, and the repatriated goods are also different from ordinary imported goods because they were robbed by Japan during the war, the committee intends to request that all taxes and duties be exempted in accordance with the import regulations for reparations, and that the general import permits for reparations be used to facilitate transportation. It is learned that the case has also been approved by the Executive Yuan and has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Export Administration Committee for compliance.

### A Brief Discussion of Evaluating Ancient Sounds

— Yu Min

Authored by Lu Zhiwei, published in October of the 36th year by Harvard-Yenching Institute

After a field of study has reached a considerable level of development, further progress often depends on two forces: first, the discovery of new materials; second, even if the materials are the same old things, there is a new perspective or viewpoint on them. Since Bernhard Karlgren led the study of Chinese phonology, there have been criticisms and corrections of his work, but most of them are minor modifications. In terms of viewpoints, even the most absurd ones, I haven't seen anyone who doesn't follow him. For example, Lu Fayan divided many rhymes very finely and said, "Yin, Jia is the same as Zi, Yi is the same as Chou, but now they are all different." His intention was simply to divide them into three categories, allowing Jia to rhyme Zi and Yin together, and Yi to rhyme Chou and Yin together, so that anyone could use his book. This does not represent Jia's language, nor does it represent Yi's language. Although Jia and Yi's languages are different, they both have two categories. This is not difficult to understand, but I have never seen anyone challenge Karlgren's "Chang'an Mandarin of about 600 years"! The author of this book has several different viewpoints from Karlgren, so the results are not within Karlgren's scope. These points are where the author excels, and it is where he pushes phonology forward from Jiang Youhao and Bernhard Karlgren. For example, based on the Qieyun fragments where Han, Huan, Ge, and Ge do not rhyme, canceling Karlgren's distinction between the two closed-mouth rhymes is not the author's forte.

In Chen Feng's Qieyun Examination, in the throat, teeth, and lip sounds of the rhymes Zhi, Zhi, Ji, Zhen, Xian, Xiao, Geng, Qing, Qin, and Yan, there are repeated small rhymes, and the Rhyme Mirror and Seven Sound Chart also list them separately. However, Karlgren and Bai Dizhou, who boasted of "statistics," all dismissed this phenomenon with a single stroke. The author does not do that: he establishes his set of pure sounds and a set of labialized throat and teeth sounds based on this! (See page 10 of the original book). This not only explains the mysterious Four Tones, Five Sounds, and Nine Melodies of the anti-clockwise diagram of the "He Wo..." as throat sounds and "Geng Ying..." as teeth sounds very well, but also helps the author to derive several important results. First, from the transformation of "Xu Ju Zang" to "Xiang Chuang Zhuang" and "Yu Wu Fu" to "Wang Wang Fang," it seems like the Yu rhyme opens and closes. The author used this sharp tool to prove it (pages 59, 158). Second, he clarified the conditions for the occurrence of light lip sounds in modern dialects (page 62). Third, he explained the origins of the You rhyme, the Wu third grade, and the Dong third grade in the Zhi and Zheng divisions, which Li Fangui and Bernhard Karlgren had been arguing about, very clearly (pages 110 and following): this is the author's greatest contribution. Speaking of the author's strengths, it is simply not ignoring the phenomenon of repeated throat and teeth sounds. Previous people, except for Mr. Zhang Taiyan, who discussed it slightly from the perspective of etymology in the Theory of Sound, have all ignored it.

The preface to the Qieyun says, "Xian, Xian, You, and Hou are all discussed with the same cut." People have always thought that he was talking about rhymes. Zeng Yungan only began to believe that he was referring to the sound nodes. The author used statistical methods to separate the broad and narrow sounds of Qing from Xin (some exceptions are due to the characters Zi and Qi being too easy to write and having nothing to do with the sounds). Therefore, he smoothly canceled the -i- medial sound that Karlgren added to the pure fourth-grade rhyme, disregarding Japanese transliterations (page 6). He also used this method to determine the articulation position of Zhuang, Chu, Chuang, and Shan to be the same as Zhao, Chuan, Shen, and Shen, but added labialization, so he explained very clearly how the second-grade Yang rhyme changes from open to closed mouth in modern dialects (page 17).

The preface to the Qieyun also has the sentence "In Qin and Long, the departing tone is used for people." The author uses it to explain why Ji, Tai, and Fei do not combine with Zhi, Dai, and Shi: it is simply to allow the people of Qin and Long to still rhyme with Fang and Mo Wu! Turning magic into rottenness is quite straightforward! (Page 196)

The qualitative analysis of the Qieyun itself and the relationship between rhyme categories have never been thoroughly organized. The author uses qualitative research to find out that the vowels of Qin and Zheng are the same as Zhen and Yuan (page 56), and that the ancient vowels of the Xian rhyme cannot be X (page 221), which are all good examples, and future researchers can make more use of them.

According to the reviewer's personal opinion, there are still several areas in the author's opinions that need further discussion. First: the people of the late Zhou dynasty may have already dropped -d-g in their dialects. If this view is accepted, the discussions on pages 102, 151, and 245 of the original book can save a lot of effort.

Second, the author believes that the entering tones of ancient times and the Six Dynasties were all stopped without breaking the sound (page 133), but the entering tones of the Zhou and Qin people transformed with the rising tones, while the rising tones of the Six Dynasties people did not rhyme. The author did not explain this phenomenon.

Third, the author believes that there was a fifth tone in ancient times, which is generally credible. However, believing that the relationship between the fifth tone with tongue-end sounds and the level, rising, and departing tones is different from the relationship between the fifth tone with tongue-root sounds and the level, rising, and departing tones is purely a matter of tone shape (page 200), which is a bit dangerous. Because in that case, the level, rising, and departing tones themselves must seem very similar, so they can be separated from the fifth tone and the entering tone, but at the same time, they are clearly divided into three categories and do not mix, which is really too difficult to confirm, and it seems that we still need to consider it carefully. Any one of these points is a good topic for future discussion.

Finally, the author's assignment of no sounds to the repeated second-grade rhymes Shan, Shan, Xian, and Xian is determined by the proximity of harmonics. Xian and Shan are a because they are close to Tan and Han (pages 36, 40). However, compared to the Geng and Geng rhymes, Geng is still closer to Tang, but it is ordered as Geng a and Geng a (page 45), which seems inconsistent. The author also did not explain.

The author's corrections to Karlgren are indeed much more progressive. In particular, the absence of five types of og in ancient sounds makes people feel relieved. However, looking at the ancient sounds of the two families, they are still unlike the sound system of any living language today.

However, this is all limited by the materials. The vowels determined by the author, the w of the You division and the A of the Xiao division, are all limited by the surrounding divisions. The so-called "its holding is justified, its words are reasoned" is also true. Generally speaking, the materials in the books can be said to have been completely utilized by the author. The materials in the books can be used to find "categories," but it is difficult to use them to find "values." For example, in the English Vowel Shift, the categories are completely unchanged, and none of the values are unchanged. Therefore, the ancient sounds of the author and Karlgren are similar to the Qieyun sounds, which is exactly the reason. In the future, people who want to make further progress should find a way out in dialects and Tibetan-Tai languages.

To read this book, it is best to first compare the Qieyun Examination, Rhyme Mirror, and Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of Karlgren's book, then read Volume 3 of Karlgren's book, then read Jiang Yougao's book, then read the introduction to the categories of Chinese words, and then read this book, which can save a lot of effort, and it can be completed in just one or two months. There is nothing mysterious in it. It is simply that some people ignore this preparatory work and say that this book is difficult to understand.

### English Prose Since 1939

— Shao Xunmei

Prose Literature Since 1939. By

John Hayward.

The British Council. 1947. 53. pp

New Writing, No. 29. Edited by

John Lehmann.

Penguin Books Ltd. 186 pp.

The characteristics of the British are thoroughness, composure, planning, perseverance, love of tradition, and the ability to cope with difficult environments. In World War II, they showed this significantly; strong evidence can also be found in their wartime literary scene.

The "British Council" sponsors many publications. The "Oxford World Affairs Pamphlets" are praised for helping their own people understand the situation of related countries; the "Britain in Pictures" series helps foreigners understand Britain; and the "British Art and Artists" series is entirely about literature and art.

About ten books in the last series have already been published. It divides various arts into categories and is written by famous authors or experts in each field. Except for "Scottish Art," "The Voice of Wales," and "British Architecture," the titles of several other types, such as dance, poetry, fiction, film, painting, music, and drama, all begin with the words "Since 1939." Therefore, the scope of the content is limited to the facts and circumstances of the five or six years from the outbreak of the war to the end of the war.

Recently, we read "Prose Since 1939." The author, John Hayward, is a famous literary critic. During the war, he was in charge of introducing new books at the British Information Service. Of course, he was more familiar with the literary scene at that time than others; therefore, it was indeed very suitable for him to write this book. The content of this book includes biographies, reviews, research, and documentary essays. The scope of novels is too broad and the number is too large, so Henry Reed wrote "Fiction Since 1939" separately and published it separately, so it is rare to mention it in this book.

The book has seven chapters. The first chapter is the preface. In just nine pages of text, it describes the general situation of writers and publishers during the war very clearly. Even the ideological changes at the time and possible future trends are analyzed considerably. I have said before that thoroughness, composure, planning, and the ability to cope with the environment are also characteristics of the British; therefore, when the war began, the whole country mobilized, and famous writers and scholars were conscripted. Everyone felt that this war was the final decision between justice and power, humanity and ambition—a confirmation of concepts: therefore, propaganda offensive and defensive were equally important. Some of these writers and scholars served in the Information Service or public cultural organizations, directly using the tools they were familiar with. Some also participated in the defense work in the rear. In fact, very few were on the front line.

However, this does not mean that they can have enough time and leisure to engage in their original writing. On the one hand, they all have designated official duties; on the other hand, it is very difficult to collect materials, and it is even more difficult to organize thoughts. Therefore, unless they have made considerable preparations in advance, they can only write some short things, occasional inspirations, or fragments of thoughts, and submit them to magazines and newspapers for publication. Pure literary magazines such as "Horizon" and "New Writing" are the two most valued publications. They maintain intellectual contact with the continent. The former tries to introduce French works as much as possible, and the latter focuses more on the translation of new works in Central Europe and the Balkan countries. British literature and art have always relied on the source of the continent for cultivation, constantly receiving the infusion of new life. They shouldered this traditional responsibility. The latest issue received is the 29th issue, which translates poems and essays from France, Poland, and the Czech Republic. There is also a comparative study of English and French painters. The most important is the analysis of T.S. Eliot's new poem "Four Quartets," which is a great help for domestic and foreign readers to understand Eliot's poems. From this, we can see how indispensable it was as a cultural medium during the war.

Another thing that affected the writing community was the restriction and rationing of paper. Especially publishers who were already established before the war were subject to stricter restrictions. With less paper supply, they had to consider the Zhengjun's opinions before publishing books. There must be a proper distribution of reprints of classic works and publications of modern famous writers. However, the number of readers is increasing day by day. They have more time at home; there are fewer places for entertainment outside; the satisfaction gained from movies and radio broadcasts is not as profound as that of books; therefore, the demand for books far exceeds the quantity that the publishing industry can supply. In this difficult environment, there are still some new writers who meet the world, and we have to admire the ability and hard work of the publishers.

Chapters 2 to 6 evaluate prose by category according to its nature. Of course, this book should focus on literature, art, and academics; however, history, politics, religion, philosophy, and science, all works that can influence the formation of thought, have accurate judgments and concise introductions.

Among prose works, biographies and autobiographies are the most popular. Analyzed, it is nothing more than the manifestation of their love of traditional characteristics; and most readers can temporarily escape from the iron fist of war and steal some leisure. They can long for the happy and magnificent world of the past. If it is a history of poverty and terror, then they can also use it to comfort themselves, saying that this world is inherently painful; and encourage themselves to endure and fight with courage and perseverance like our ancestors.

The invention of science and the application of atomic bombs have certainly affected people's religious beliefs. However, there are also many facts that cannot be explained by materialistic theories. There is indeed a superhuman will in the universe. Philosophers and writers continue to seek truth in religion. The poet Eliot, relying on the most orthodox Catholicism, pointed out common mistakes and regarded religion as a request for the extension of physical welfare in the spiritual world. The novelist Huxley, hiding in the suburbs of Hollywood, went to study esoteric teachings and even preached on the small mountain, advocating the so-called new Brahmanism.

The last chapter is the conclusion, pointing out the crisis in the literary and artistic circles. Because the economic power of movies and radio broadcasts will encourage popular and low-level works; profound academic pursuits will decrease with general needs, or retreat into a narrow circle. This is originally a global cultural crisis, and we can also use it as a warning.

### Writing Before the Publication of the [Art Yearbook]

— Jiang Xiyi

Edited and printed by the Shanghai Art Tea Party, published in mid-April

China has been in a time of trouble for the past fifty years. Art is a reflection of the nation's culture and the vitality of its life, and its importance cannot be ignored. The government has always been busy saving the country, maintaining law and order, and improving people's livelihoods. Fortunately, art is not a top priority, and it seems to be irrelevant to welfare. It has always been left to its own devices, and it can be dispensable. Most people in society are immersed in wealth and profit, and they have their own views on spiritual issues. In the eyes of the general public, art is just a decoration, or even a luxury. The fate of Chinese art, which has a history of thousands of years, is almost unimaginable. I remember that Mr. Cai Yuanpei first advocated aesthetic education. After the first National Art Exhibition was held in the Republic of China in 1929, the Nanjing National Art Museum was established in 1937, and the Theater and Conservatory of Music were completed in sequence. The Ministry of Education then held the Second National Art Exhibition and published a special collection. Until now, no one has ever mentioned the Art Yearbook. A friend told me that Mr. Huang Binhong had the motivation to compile the Art Yearbook very early, but it was never realized. Someone said that it is a shame that the Chinese art world does not have an Art Yearbook! And it is also a shame for the country! If this is really the case, it is really not easy to run an Art Yearbook. If it is not compiled well, wouldn't it be adding shame to shame and humiliation to humiliation? However, it seems that knowing the difficulty and not retreating is the attitude that one should have when doing something. Otherwise, no one will ever do what is difficult, and wouldn't there be a day when there would be no success? It seems that shame and humiliation should be another matter.

Looking at the spirit of valuing art in countries such as ancient Greece, India, Europe, America, and Japan, and the fact that all of them have yearbooks and the like that are published regularly, their role and value in communicating culture, promoting national essence, and international cultural exchanges are undeniable. The fact that China lacks this kind of thing is also a fact. The thirty years of the Republic of China is a short process in history. We cannot have excessive expectations for art in this extremely short process, but the achievements of art works in the past thirty years are also not to be underestimated. Shanghai is the center of the country's economy and culture, and it is a gathering place for human resources. In terms of art groups alone, there are several, such as the Chinese Painting Society, the Calligraphers Association, the Women's Painting and Calligraphy Society, the Art Tea Party, and the Art Association founded by the Central Cultural Movement Committee. Among them, the Art Tea Party was established the shortest time, but it has the largest number of members, about 2,000. Although not all of them are artists, it is a fact that they are art lovers. In addition, the recent rapid development of the art world and the enthusiastic situation are unprecedented. Various art exhibitions are held continuously. If there is no systematic record, not only will they be lost without trace after a long time, but also those at home and abroad who want to understand the situation of Chinese art will not be able to obtain it. The compilation of the Art Yearbook is indeed necessary!

Why didn't anyone do this before? I will not elaborate on that. Under the current unstable, difficult living, and declining livelihood situation, the Art Tea Party can resolutely do this, which not only makes the art world feel great excitement, but also makes the national cultural circles cast a surprised glance. The constraints of economic and material conditions, as well as the occurrence of expected or unexpected difficulties, make people know that this is indeed a difficult job. Fortunately, on the one hand, the promotion and encouragement of Mr. Zhang Daofan, Pan Gongzhan, and Yu Wen, and on the other hand, the general director of the Art Tea Party, Wang Jingchang, can uphold his spirit of ignoring everything, working hard, and burying himself in work, day and night. From preparation to the present, in just three or four months, he has been able to get the unanimous response from more than 20 art groups across the country, and even those far away in the Philippines have come to participate. It can be seen from this whether the work is hard or not. The content of the compilation includes:

Precious historical materials on the rise and fall of art groups in the past fifty years.

Records of art movements in various places in 1947.

Activities of art groups in various places.

Art movements in art schools in various places.

Records of painting exhibitions in various places in 1947.

Activities of artists in various places. Introduction of works by artists from all over the country, divided into: epigraphy, calligraphy, Chinese painting, Western painting, sculpture, woodcut, photography, and graphic design. Among them, there are about 800 biographies of artists, 1,000 hundreds of copper plates, and more than 30 essays, with hundreds of thousands of words, which is a grand sight. I think the essence of the compilation will be commented on by experts after publication (the book will be published before about April 25, and pre-orders are now being taken). As for the quantity, it is also considerable under this environment. Because the 1947 Art Yearbook is the first Art Yearbook in our country, I am happy to introduce it. Its profound significance in helping art education and the country's literature is self-evident.

Today happens to be Art Festival. This journal specially selects Jiang Xiyi's article introducing the Art Yearbook recently compiled by the Shanghai Art Tea Party and Wen Zhaotong's article introducing the Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties, to express our humble meaning of commemorating this year's Art Festival. — Editor

### Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties

— Wen Zhaotong

Compiled by Shen Zicheng, printed by World Book Company

Our country's painting theories are as vast as the sea. The "Art Book Series" compiled by the Shenzhou Guoguang Society has a wealth of content. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a friend passed on Mr. Fu Baoshi's "Chinese Painting Theory," which listed chapters such as artistic conception, charm, trees and rocks, and wrinkle methods... It was excerpted from the painting theories of various schools from Zhuang Zhou to the late Qing Dynasty, with several entries excerpted according to the chapters, annotated with sources, and occasionally added notes. It was published by the Commercial Press. However, the former is lengthy and difficult to purchase and read, while the latter, although every word is essence, readers cannot see the whole picture of famous theories.

The book "Compilation of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties" has overcome this difficulty, allowing every reader to see many important painting theories since Gu Kaizhi of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Although there are a few famous artists, such as Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty and Yun Ge of the Qing Dynasty, whose works are only recorded as those that have a special relationship with calligraphy, such as Li Sizhen's "Supplement to the Painting Records," Monk Yanzong's "Later Painting Records," and Sheng Dashi's "Records of Lying and Traveling in Streams and Mountains" of the Qing Dynasty, have not been excerpted, but reading this book can already obtain the entire concept of Chinese painting theory.

This book contains famous painting theories of past dynasties, with a total of 75 famous artists and 334 volumes of painting theories, which are recorded in chronological order:

(1) Jin Gu Kaizhi: "Painting Criticism," "Wei and Jin Dynasties Famous Calligraphy Praise," "Records of Painting Yuntai Mountain."

(2) Northern and Southern Dynasties, Zong Bing: "Preface to Painting Landscapes," Wang Wei: "Introduction to Painting," Xie He: "Ancient Painting Records," Emperor Liang Yuan: "Landscape Pine and Stone Style," Yao Zui: "Continuation of Ancient Painting Records."

(3) Tang, Wang Wei: "Landscape Tips," "Water and Mountain Theory," Zhang Yanyuan: "On Painting."

(4) Five Dynasties, Jing Hao: "Book Saying," "Brushwork Records," "Landscape Tips."

(5) Song, Li Cheng: "Landscape Tips," Dong Yu: "Dragon Painting Compilation," Guo Xi: "Lin Quan Gao Zhi," Guo Si: "Painting Theory," Su Shi: "Dongpo Collection," Mi Fu: "Painting History," Luo Dajing: "Painting Saying," Hua Guang: "Hua Guang Plum Blossom Manual," Deng Chun: "Painting Succession," "On Boundary Calligraphy Measurement and Bending Ruler," Han Zhuo: "Complete Collection of Landscapes," Dong Zhen: "Guangchuan Painting Postscript."

(6) Yuan, Li Xian: "Xi Zhai Bamboo Manual," Guan Daosheng: "Ink Bamboo Manual," Huang Gongwang: "On Landscape Trees and Stones," Li Chengsou: "Painting Saying," Tao Zongyi: "Zhuo Geng Lu," etc.

(7) Ming, Mo Shilong: "Painting Saying," Mao Yixiang: "Painting Wonderful," Tang Zhiqie: "Zhiqie on Painting," Tang Yin: "On Painting with Brush and Ink," Tu Long: "Tu Long on Painting," etc.

(8) Qing, Wang Shimin: "Xilu Painting Postscript," Wang Jian: "Dyeing Fragrance Convent Painting Postscript," etc.

At the beginning of each era, the editor writes an overview of the painting of the era, so that readers can first understand the painting style of the era. Before each famous artist, there is also a short biography detailing their surname, narrating their titles, examining their teachers, and describing their influence. This can make readers have a clear understanding of each school. Dong Qichang said: "Reading ten thousand books and traveling ten thousand miles, the turbidity in the chest will naturally disappear, and the hill will be built in the inner camp, and Yinyue will be established immediately. Whatever you write will be a landscape that conveys the spirit." This is the golden rule followed by our country's painters. Although this book is not "ten thousand volumes," it can also be worth one in ten thousand. I hope that painters or art researchers will all read it.

### After Reading "The Death of a Painter"

— Ji Ping

Truly humorous works are indeed those that make people smile through tears, a smile that is desolate and a smile that is sorrowful.

Mark Twain writes in "The Death of a Painter":

"There's a story in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, which I can hardly remember. I only vaguely remember that there was a child who fed a little bird. Although the child loved this bird very much, sometimes he would forget to take care of it. The little bird did not receive his praise or his care, and sang as much as it could every day. But gradually, driven by hunger and thirst, its singing became like sobbing, and finally it stopped—it turned out that the little bird had died. This time the child ran to see and regretted it too late. So he gathered his friends, and in grief, they wholeheartedly and sincerely buried the bird. In fact, starving the poet to death and then using the money that could have made him happy for a lifetime to bury him and erect a monument is a contradiction that is not limited to children. No one has ever noticed..."

His novella "The Death of a Painter" vividly and profoundly reveals the situation faced by all geniuses, all genius artists in this world. It is almost their destined fate. Poverty, famine, yet still dedicated to art, continuing to create in poverty, and maintaining spiritual joy. Gradually, they feel an overwhelming sense of urgency. After all, spirit cannot fill the stomach, and their carefully crafted works of art, because they are not yet famous, are not wanted even when sold at extremely low prices. Ordinary people, those who consider themselves art connoisseurs, are often idol worshippers. They do not praise or criticize a work of art because they truly understand its true value. They often ignore, despise, and even trample on artistic talents who are not yet famous but are truly dedicated to creation. Mark Twain himself was a genius artist, and he deeply understood the sorrow of an artist. Therefore, with a humorous tone, he vividly wrote about the sorrow of thousands of art practitioners through the story of a French painter. Naturally, he further exposed the vanity and foolishness of this society. Everyone is an idol worshipper. That is truly a story that makes those who are clear-headed laugh and cry:

One spring, the author stayed briefly in the Mendela region and met a Mr. Smith, a "rich man" who behaved differently from others. He had been a painter engaged in artistic work. According to him, in his youth, he had two good friends, also painters, one named Fred and the other named Branjie. They painted together in the French countryside. Although they had their strengths in painting, they were both unknown and no one looked up to their works. As time went on, they could not even afford the cheapest vegetables. When they felt that they could no longer bear the hardship, a savior came, Miller. He was also a painter who had not yet enjoyed great fame, so his power was limited. After a few days, the four of them were overwhelmed by hunger.

Except for starving to death, they could hardly find a second way out. Even if they took a painting to exchange for a cabbage, no one would want it. Mark Twain here exhaustively writes about the tragic encounters of all the artists in the world.

Living is a requirement for everyone, and it is also the most basic requirement. When suffering arrives, the method of survival is forced out: that is, Branjie proposed: the four of them draw lots together, whoever is chosen dies, because the paintings after death will immediately be worth ten thousand times more. Naturally, beforehand, they must be heavily promoted, so that the friend who is chosen works hard to create, even if it is only a few strokes, the main thing is to have his signature, and the signature must be very special, so that people can know his handwriting at a glance.

At first, everyone was stunned, thinking he was crazy. After hearing that the chosen person would pretend to be dead, but only live in seclusion and not really die, they were overjoyed.

As a result, Miller was chosen. He was responsible for creating the works, and the other three went out to promote them, saying: The great painter Miller is seriously ill, and may not live long. And they tried to get newspapers to publish Miller's condition. This went on for several weeks, and it was very effective. The works of Miller they carried with them were all sold out; and the price increased each time.

Finally, the news of the great painter Miller's death spread, and the whole world was in mourning. The funeral was naturally grand. In order to avoid suspicion from outsiders, because the coffin contained a wax figure, it also expressed their respect. The coffin was carried by four people, naturally including Miller. In this way, a generation of great painters was mourned by millions of people in the suburbs. From then on, Miller's works became treasures, and many rich people scrambled to buy them. Therefore, the four of them, the real painters who had been forced to the brink of despair by life, not only avoided starvation, but also owned huge fortunes and became rich.

Yes——

"Are you surprised!" Mark Twain said at the end: "No wonder, only this time, the world does not starve the genius to death, but gives the rewards he deserves to others. Only this little bird does not suffer that kind of cruel treatment—singing as much as it can without any applause while alive, and receiving a grand burial after death."

"Because we did our 'best' to prevent him from suffering like that."

How much deep sadness is hidden here! The author uses a clear and humorous tone to sketch out the true state of society for us.

Today, in the 1950s of the 20th century, this situation still exists.

The living suffer hardships; the dead enjoy love and respect.

That day may come when artists no longer need to seek "life" through "death"; all artists who work hard in art will no longer be treated cruelly like little birds.

Free Talk

### I Also Talk About Eating

— Chen Yixian

Recently, I saw an article about eating in "Free Talk," which was very interesting, so I came to supplement it with this one.

First of all, I think that paying attention to eating is not trivial; this matter is actually related to national health, and is not to be excessively criticized. Mencius said: "Food and sex are human nature." It can be seen that food is the first thing in life. Regardless of whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, all revolutions and changes of dynasties have arisen because of the people's eating problems.

The Chinese pay attention to taste, while Westerners only talk about nutrition. In Mr. Bai Yong's article "Eating" in "Free Talk," he mentions that in the past, officials in charge of river works ate goose webs, which required the burning to death of many geese. To eat monkey brains, they would put a yoke on the neck of a live monkey, send it to the table, and break open the skull for the guests to eat with spoons. This method is too cruel and has no great nutritional value. I think what we need to study now is to combine the two issues of taste and nutrition into one, and it should not cost too much money. People who know a little about nutrition know that food contains vitamins A, B, C, etc. What they don't know is that there is also a most important element in food called Tryptophan, which is found in legumes such as cowpeas and peas, and in green leafy vegetables such as amaranth, while expensive dishes such as shark fin and abalone do not have it.

Every nation has its national habits, which should not and cannot be changed casually, and eating is one of them. I have a student who went to study in the United States last year, and wrote in a letter: "The food on the ship is rich and good, but after eating it for a week, I feel disgusted and very much want to eat porridge and salted vegetables." The physique of the Chinese is not as strong as that of Westerners. People often complain that eating rice is not as nourishing as bread, but Mr. Guoping's article "Rice Can Cure Disease" in "Free Talk" says: Dr. Kepner of the United States once stated in a newspaper that "rice, the food of the Chinese for thousands of years, can indeed cure high blood pressure. If you have a bowl of rice in your body, rather than a cup of milk or a steak, then you can avoid high blood pressure and increase life. Meat or fatty foods are likely to cause high blood pressure if eaten too much, while rice is a food with less protein and salt." From this, it can be seen that rice has been the food of the Chinese for thousands of years and is indeed very useful, while milk does not suit the national habits of most people. It is not necessarily a good thing for a group of people to imitate foreigners and eat Western food.

Western grand banquets have various kinds of wine. There is aperitif before meals, digestive wine after meals, soup wine for soup, fish wine for fish, steak wine for steak, and chicken wine for chicken, each different, it is really a grand sight. However, although foreign wines are good, the dishes are really not very good, so even with good wine, it is less appealing. Although there are not many types of wine in a Chinese meal, the best yellow wine is no less than champagne, and Moutai is as fragrant as brandy. As for the dishes, Chinese eating has dishes for drinking wine, dishes for eating rice, and dishes for eating porridge, which are really incomparable to Western food. Now I will quote two passages from "Dream of the Red Chamber" to illustrate.

Bao Yu and Dai Yu arrived at Aunt Xue's place. "Bao Yu praised the goose webs and duck tongues from Sister-in-law Zhen's place the other day. Aunt Xue hurriedly brought out her own pickled ones for him to enjoy. Bao Yu laughed and said, 'This is only good with wine.'" This is wine dishes. "Grandmother Jia ate wild pheasant soup and said, 'If there are any more raw ones, fry two more pieces, salty and savory, it will taste good with porridge. Although the soup is good, it is not right for porridge.'" This is the difference between porridge dishes and rice dishes.

Now rice is as expensive as pearls, and life is not easy. Of course, we cannot study eating to the point of eating wild pheasant soup or pickled goose webs and duck tongues. However, for those who are not in very difficult financial circumstances, it is not very expensive to pay a little attention to the taste, and it is also a kind of enjoyment in life. Apart from banquets, I think there should be five words as the standard for home-cooked meals, namely soup, braised, stir-fried, green, and pickled. Everyone knows about soup and stir-fried. Braised dishes are red-cooked dishes, such as red-cooked fish and red-braised pork. The dishes have braised sauce, which can be used to mix with rice. Green dishes refer to green vegetables, all kinds of green leafy vegetables, melons, beans, and root vegetables. Pickled dishes refer to winter pickled vegetables, fermented bean curd, and pickles. With these five or six dishes, the cost is not much, and there are dishes for wine, dishes for rice, and dishes for porridge.

There is a small restaurant in the old capital called Enchengju, in Shaanxi Lane. There are only two small private rooms, and not many scattered seats outside. It is full, but it can only accommodate twenty or thirty people. But there is a famous dish, which is also a very common dish—onion beef shreds. Cars often stop at the door, and many rich people come to eat it. The beef shreds are made with tenderloin, cut horizontally, fried in heavy oil over high heat, and then onion seasoning is added. There is also a shop in the old capital that sells mutton pies, in Meishi Street. Because the pies are good, the owner's surname is Zhou, and he is known as "Pie Zhou." Beef and mutton are both common foods, and a good cook can combine the two issues of taste and nutrition into one. All of this does not seem to be found in formal history, and is only used as conversation after tea and wine. At the same time, our country also shared the glory of the victorious countries, and Chinese banknotes were very popular in Germany, so it also raised our national status. Therefore, we find it particularly easy to remember those jokes built on the pain of others. The famous French journalist Cao Luo seems to have said in his book "The Fall of Paris" that after 1917, the morality of the German people deteriorated. For a small account of one US dollar, they could lose the face of the "German nation." It can be seen that the so-called integrity and shame are based on banknotes and food. Although Germany is a defeated country this time, the mark has not collapsed as it did last time. Our eastern neighbor is laughing at this victor with the arrogance of the defeated. We are reviewing "The Fate of Germany" and we really can't bear to say it!

### Idioms Have Origins

— Jin Yuan

The idioms popular in today's society seem very common, but a closer examination reveals that they all have classical origins. For example, "keqi" (polite) comes from Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ding, year eight; "huangtang" (absurd) comes from Zhuangzi; "duoxie" (many thanks) comes from Biography of Li Guang in Han Shu; "dasuan" (plan) comes from Biography of Liu Bingzhong in Yuan Shi; "buzhongyong" (useless) comes from Shi Ji; "zhuoli" (exert effort) comes from Nan Qi Shu; "wurenzhen" (don't take it seriously) comes from Biography of Wang Kejing in Yuan Shi; "qiyoucili" (unreasonable) is a saying of Sima Guang; "chazui" (interrupt) comes from Wu Deng Hui Yuan; "hehe daxiao" (laughing loudly) and "yaotoubǎiwěi" (wagging head and tail) are both found in Chuan Deng Lu; "caoza" (noisy) comes from Bao Puzi; "tanherongyi" (how easy is it) comes from Biography of Dongfang Shuo in Han Shu; "benqian" (capital) comes from Food and Goods Records in Han Shu; "bunainaifan" (impatient) comes from Biography of Yu Dengzhi in Zhu Shu; "qidianbadao" (stumbling) comes from Zhu Zi Yu Lei; "sanfansifu" (repeatedly) is a saying of an old monk in Song Zhen Kong Temple; "yidaban" (dressed up) comes from Huang Gongshao's poem; "baxiu" (give up) comes from Shi Ji; "cuoda" (ignorant scholar) comes from "Quan Tang Shi Hua"; "jiaose" (role) comes from Chao Ye Lei Yao; "maobing" (problem) comes from Shan Gu Ji; "liushen" (be careful) comes from Biography of Dongfang Shuo; "zhuangju" (blindly recommend) comes from Bai Xiangshan's poem; "pianyi" (advantage) comes from Gu Xianzhi's memorial in Nan Qi Shu; "duishou" (opponent) comes from Jiu Tang Shu; "chaoliwurenmozubing" (don't be a guest if you have no one in court) is seen in Yuan people's reclusive words. Although they are words from the streets and alleys, it can also be known that no word is without an origin.

### A Small Record of Measuring Pearls

— Ji Yong

First, I will copy a passage from the book: Ming Dynasty, Yu, "Record of Wet Clothes Around the City of Bian" in the third siege, below the item "A Horse Worth a Thousand Gold," it says: "Grain and grass had been cut off for a long time, and war horses were useless. The armies were short of food, and the military commissioner ordered the officers to slaughter horses to fill the coffers. Soldiers slaughtered a horse and mixed it with human flesh, selling each catty for several taels of silver. A horse could be worth a thousand gold. The ancient saying goes, 'Selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head,' and now we see selling human flesh while hanging up a horse's head! The people had only a grain of rice like a pearl, while the officers and soldiers still had surplus grain, which they collected from large households. Country squires and wealthy families sought to buy it, only caring about getting grain and not caring about the price, selling a liter of grain for ten thousand coins. There were pearl merchants who carried pearls to exchange for rice, but the small pearls were thrown away on the ground without being looked at, and if a grain of rice fell, they carefully picked it up. Rice was more valuable than pearls, which was indeed seen. On the day the grain ran out, every household closed its doors, resigned to waiting for death. There were no pedestrians on the streets, and if there were any lone travelers in secluded alleys, they were often dragged in and killed by the strong men at home, and the meat was divided and eaten, and no one would investigate. If anyone reported it to the officials, they would not have time to deal with it. Although proclamations were issued to prohibit and arrest, they could not stop it. There were even cases of people breaking into houses at night, secretly killing the people, and stealing the meat to take home. Residents, fearing for their own safety, first killed and ate their maids and servants. What was even more unbearable to hear was that fathers ate their children, a tragic injustice to heaven and earth, and the sun and moon were dark! When the grain ran out, the strong soldiers only ate by killing people, and the people in the secluded streets and alleys all gathered in the large markets to live together, protecting each other. They not only carved out corpses to cook, but also broke down houses to burn, and painted beams and carved rafters were turned into broken walls. The families were without smoke and cold stoves, and the birds flew far away and disappeared. In the past, Suiyang still had sparrows to catch and rats to dig up, but now there were no sparrows or rats, which had never been seen in past history. Because the officers and soldiers ran out of grain, they pretended to run the camp and defected to the rebels; there were also those who killed the refugees who were picking vegetables because it was difficult, and cut off their heads to report the merit and reward. Fearing that their families would recognize their faces, they cut several knives on their faces to change their shape. They carried the heads into the city in the morning to present the merit, and there were often hundreds of people rushing to buy them, with the price reaching several taels. Soldiers tolerated the injustice of the people, which was rarely seen in ancient and modern times!..."

This is a page of blood and tears in the history of the people of the Central Plains in the late Ming Dynasty, which is no less than the "Shu Bi" recording Zhang Xianzhong. I often wonder how much rationality humans actually have, and to what extent it goes. Now it is very simply proven, that is, until they have nothing to eat and their stomachs are hungry. We see in the city of Kaifeng three hundred years ago, wealthy people measuring pearls to buy rice. At that time, there was not necessarily inflation as there is today, and the people did not trust money. If money loses its value as a means of exchange, it has no use value at all! I don't know if this can move the gentlemen who are now speculating in gold and stocks. The Chinese people seem to have always only had the qualification to be eaten by others, from paying taxes to being beheaded by soldiers and selling the meat for silver, it is all the same. Zhao Ou Bei's "Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories" also says: "During the Zhenguan era, a dou of rice was three coins. In the year when Emperor Xuanzong sacrificed to Mount Tai, a dou of rice in Dongjun was ten coins, and a dou of rice in Qingqi was five coins. Since the An-Shi Rebellion, there has been no end to military service, the fields have been barren, and there has also been the abuse of spreading households... Within ten households, five have fled, and even the five who have not fled are equally burdened with taxes. It is like throwing a stone into a well, and it will not stop until it reaches the bottom. Therefore, the more people who flee, the less land is cultivated. In the first year of Yongtai during the reign of Emperor Daizong, a dou of rice in the capital was 1,400 coins, and the suburbs supplied the imperial kitchen with rice based on the ears. When the wheat ripened, there were drunkards in the market, already praising it as an auspicious sign. Compared with the Zhenguan and Kaiyuan eras, it was almost tens or hundreds of times more. Readers of history can see the changes in the world from this. As for places of attack and war, when the city is besieged and the grain is cut off, there are even more things that cannot be explained by common sense. When Lu Ling defended Nanyang, the rebel generals Wu Lingxun and Tian Chengsi attacked it for months, and a dou of rice cost forty or fifty thousand, with a price but no rice, and a rat was worth four hundred coins. When An Qingxu was besieged in Xiangzhou, a dou of rice cost seventy thousand coins. When Huang Chao occupied Chang'an, the people fled into the mountain fortresses, and for years they abandoned farming. The rebels sat and guarded the empty city, and the price of grain soared, with a dou of rice costing thirty thousand coins. The government soldiers all arrested the mountain fortress people and sold them to the rebels for food, and one person was worth hundreds of thousands. When Yang Xingmi besieged Yangzhou, the grass roots, tree fruits, leather bags, and leather belts in the city were all gone. The foreign troops plundered people to sell, and a person cost fifty thousand coins. Zhang Xiong had military rations and agreed to trade, one catty of gold and one belt could get five sheng of rice."

The people's bad luck, isn't it exactly the same as in the Ming Dynasty? Both the officers and soldiers and the rebels wanted to eat the people, and they cooperated very well. I don't know what the meaning of this war is! In the past, when I read Du Fu's poem "Qiang Village," which said, "Don't refuse the wine's thin taste, the millet land has no one to cultivate, the war is not yet over, and the children have all gone to the east," I already felt it was full of sadness, but compared to this, it is still heaven. When I was young, I read Zuo Zhuan, the story of Hua Yuan and Zi Fan, and I still didn't believe it. What about exchanging children for food and breaking bones to cook? Although the state of Zheng was a small country, how could it be so bad! How would I know that there is a limit to exaggeration in writing, but this kind of talk is not nonsense. For example, at this moment, the price of rice is so outrageous that even people living here and now find it hard to believe. How can historians write in such a way that people in the future will not think it is nonsense? I really can't think of it. After the First European War, we laughed at the old story of the German mark, and a friend of mine who was traveling in Europe at that time said that when eating in restaurants, it was usually calculated in eggs, because calculating in marks was really too troublesome. For example, the price of the second cup of beer may be different from the first. An old lady sold her house and got tens of billions of marks, and was quite happy, but unexpectedly, a week later, her money could only buy one egg.

### Owl

— He Dao

There is a saying in our country that Gongye Chang understood the language of birds, but I did not expect that in ancient Western times, there were also people who specialized in predicting good and bad luck from the actions and calls of birds. Westerners call this "knowledge" "Ornithomancy," which is exactly opposite to "alchemy," and it can be said that there is no coincidence. But we have always considered hearing the owl's cry as ominous, while in the West it is not always the case.

For example, the ancient Greeks showed great respect for owls. In the Battle of Salamis, an owl suddenly came to the mast of the flagship of the Greek naval commander, and the morale of the army was greatly boosted, thinking that victory was within reach. As a result, they won a great victory. Modern ornithologists believe that owls are actually very clumsy birds, but the Greek philosophers of two thousand years ago regarded owls as symbols of wisdom.

The Romans, however, thought differently. They said that owls were specialized in sucking the blood of children. As long as an owl came to the roof, someone in this family was bound to die. One day, an owl was found on the roof of the Temple of Jupiter, which the Romans most believed in, and all the priests, diviners, etc. in the city were shocked. They quickly caught the owl, burned it alive, and scattered the ashes in the Tiber River. The priests chanted scriptures while quickly perfuming the entire city, considering it a way to resolve the disaster.

Of course, from the perspective of modern people, this kind of behavior is simply ignorant and ridiculous. Ornithologists regard owls as ordinary birds, and in various European and American countries, there are already many people who specifically raise many owls as a pastime, just as many people like to raise dogs and cats. According to scientists, there are more than 300 species of owls, and there are traces of owls in the icy and snowy Arctic and in the dense forests of the tropics. Why do scientists think owls are clumsy? It is because their eyes can only look straight ahead and cannot move freely. If they want to see things on the left and right, they must twist their heads as much as possible to the left and right. However, they also have a unique skill, which is that when they are clearly standing forward, if someone sneaks up from behind, they will suddenly twist their two toes without moving their body, and aim their sharp claws at the person or other animal behind them and stab them in.

Owls are quite amazing at eating. Their food includes rabbits, turtles, mice, small birds, frogs, fish, crabs, clams, various insects, and sometimes they also eat lizards and snakes. They sometimes peck off some feathers that are not easy to swallow, and then tear the food into large pieces and swallow it. Things that are easy to digest go to the stomach and intestines, while things that are not easy to eat, such as scales, fur, and feathers, they will keep in their mouths, roll them together, and spit them out in one gulp, like a round ball.

However, in the eyes of many people who love owls, owls are not annoying at all. After being raised for a long time, they will also fly around when their owners tell them to. People have gradually stopped regarding them as unlucky birds, because the "knowledge" of "Ornithomancy" has long become a historical term along with the Roman Empire.

### The Story of Michelangelo

— Leng Leng

One day, the famous Italian art sculptor Michelangelo was sculpting a marble statue, and a relative and friend visited him. Seeing Michelangelo concentrating on his work without leaving the statue, he expected that it would be completed in a few days. To avoid disturbing his work, he hurriedly said goodbye.

Several months later, he visited Michelangelo again. Seeing the same statue as before, he ridiculed Michelangelo in surprise:

"Brother, I visited you several months ago, and you were working hard. I guessed that it would be completed in a few days, but isn't the statue that I see now standing there unchanged as before?"

Michelangelo replied:

"Not at all, I haven't been lazy. In the past few months, I have been modifying this place and polishing that place, making the face here softer and the muscles there stronger. Look, the lips here now have a slight expression, and strength has been added to the feet." He explained in such detail.

After hearing this, he couldn't help laughing coldly:

"Indeed, those are good, but brother, isn't that too subtle? It takes so much effort for such a small thing, how can a great work be produced?"

So Michelangelo replied with an extremely solemn attitude:

"Perhaps a great work cannot be produced as you said, but you must know that all perfect works are made up of many small attentions and small works. Therefore, those who accomplish great things are careful in their attention and effort."

Michelangelo's success in art was really due to this.

### Good Name

— Donghua

Most celebrities in the world love fame and self-respect, even Washington could not avoid this. He once hoped that people would unanimously praise his great name and compliment him as the most powerful great man in the world.

After Columbus discovered the New World, he was already widely praised, but he still asked the Spanish government to grant him the titles of "Grand Admiral of the Sea" and "Prime Minister of India."

Empress Catherine of Russia would discard any letter that did not address her as "Your Majesty" without reading it.

Mrs. Lincoln, Mary Todd, sat proudly in the White House, looking around with self-importance. Once, Mrs. General Grant came to visit, and she sat down without being offered a seat. Mrs. Lincoln became furious and reprimanded her in person.

The American explorer Peary, who had explored the South Pole and other places, was sponsored by many wealthy people. The wealthy people wanted to use their own names as place names for all the places he explored.

The French [author] relied on Russian literature for his fame and reputation in the art world. He even hoped to change the French capital "Paris" to "嚣俄."

Shakespeare also hoped that the British government would grant him special titles that would be passed down through the ages.

### Idle Talk About Names

— Chen Zuogao

The distinction of names was already discussed as far back as the Spring and Autumn period. The Tan Gong chapter of the Book of Rites says, "Infant name, adulthood title." The commentary further explains its meaning, saying: "A name is given three months after birth, hence it is called the infant name. At the age of twenty, one has the way of being a father; friends and the like cannot call one by their name again, so one is capped and given a title." It can be seen that a person's name has always preceded the title since ancient times. The time difference is also more than ten years. As for the relationship between the name and the title, only Feng Junmu (and) his father-in-law mentioned it. Even someone as erudite as Zhang Taiyan did not add a definitive conclusion to this, only saying, "The name and the title are different designations; one cannot have two names, and the most numerous offspring are called titles." (See Guogu Lunheng)

According to Father-in-law, [He] was a famous Confucian scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, with unrestrained talent. [He] wrote "Wen of Huifeng Hall," meticulously crafting sentences and writing like the Wei and Jin dynasties. What he said about the difference between names and titles is even more insightful. According to him, "A person's title is always closely related to his name; the pseudonym can be used as one pleases and can be increased to an endless number." This is indeed true when examining examples. For example, Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty, who wrote "Zhuo Geng Lu," had the title "Jiucheng"; this was based on the sentence "Xiao Shao nine-ch'eng, phoenixes come to dance" in the Book of Yu. Also, Wang Mingsheng, who wrote "Seventeen Histories Shangque," had the title "Fenghua," which is also related to his name and has a clear meaning. The pseudonym is different. For example, Shi Daoji had more than twenty pseudonyms; the most famous ones are Xia Zunzhe, Kugua Heshang, and Shishou. Also, Shen Zipei, in addition to the commonly used pseudonym Yi'an Meisou, also had dozens of pseudonyms, scattered in various ink works. Even his son, Mr. Ci Hu, could not examine them in detail.

Ancient Confucians often liked to pick and use the characters "Bo," "Zhong," "Shu," "Ji," "Kong," "Meng," "Gong," and "Zi" when naming. Looking at historical figures, such as Long Bogao, Kong Zhongni, Yang Shuzi, Wu Jizha, Zhuge Kongming, Chen Menggong, and Shen Mengyuan (named Yuan, a poet of the Ming Dynasty), all have these characters embedded in their names. Secondly, those whose names after the surname resemble An (Chen Kuilong, pseudonym Yong'an) or Qi (Duanfang, pseudonym Taoqi) are generally pseudonyms rather than titles.

Chinese literati often like to change their names in middle age. This is also true in recent times. Among the advanced members of the Party-State, such as Hu Hanmin's name being Fabian, Yu Youren's name being Boxun, Shao Lizi's name being Wentai, Wu Zhihui's name being Tiao, Zhang Taiyan's name being Jiang, Pan Gongzhan's name being Youyou, Chen Bulei's name being Xun'en, Shao Yuanchong's name being Jiru, Zeng Yangfu's name being Xianhao, Yu Jingtang's name being Yu, Cheng Tianfang's name being Xueyu, and Liu Luyin's name being Shende, all were used in their early years and are now abandoned. In addition, there are many similar cases among calligraphers and painters, as far as I know, such as Zhang Daqian's name being Zhengquan, Feng Chaoran's name being Jiong, Wu Hufan's name being Yanyi, Chen Julai's name being Tui, Zhao Shuru's name being Shigang, and Wang Fuchang's name being Shouqi.

### Before Success

— Mao Yi

If you have confidence in yourself and your potential abilities, then you should exercise yourself and cultivate your potential, and you must not abandon yourself because of failure, nor be discouraged by the cold ridicule of others. Many successful people are ridiculed or despised before they become prominent, but because they have confidence, they finally answered the ridicule and contempt with success. Please look at the following examples:

Louisa May Alcott, the author of "Little Women," was a mischievous girl who could not tell beans from wheat and was ignorant in the eyes of her fellow villagers. Once, a publisher even "advised" her to give up writing.

Before she became famous, the American short story writer Jenny Gray wanted to sell one of his manuscripts to a publisher, who said that he had no ability to write novels, which made Gray very embarrassed.

When George Gershwin, the author of "Rhapsody in Blue," first appeared on stage to play the piano, he was laughed off the stage. Those who laughed at him were not only the actors on the same stage, but also the audience off stage.

The American "Five and Ten Cent Store" is now thriving and has many branches. Its founder, Woolworth, was once employed by a retail store. The boss of the store believed that Woolworth did not even have the business sense to greet customers, so he assigned him the humble position of guarding the door, with a salary of fifty cents a day.

Let's take a look at those great scientists before they succeeded:

When Marconi, the "father of wireless radio," first started researching wireless radio, he was first ridiculed by his father, who said that Marconi was wasting his time.

Einstein was regarded as a fool by his teachers during his school days, and even his parents believed that their child was not promising.

And Edison, he always ranked at the bottom in school exams. Teachers called him a "stupid fellow," and doctors said there was something wrong with his brain!

### Random Thoughts

— Gong Hua

God does not easily judge people's good and evil, and must wait until the Last Judgment to make a judgment; why should we humans judge people's right and wrong based on temporary impatience? (Johnson)

What distinguishes man from beasts is that he has the ability to initiate self-reflection as an important human artifice. (Dewey)

Only a contemptible man who is conceited makes the gods weep and sigh. (Shakespeare)

Many people cannot become thinkers because their memory is too good. (Natchiga)

### Between Good and Evil

— Zhongming

Sometimes we simply cannot distinguish between a person's good and evil and the good and bad of a thing. We often hear disputes where A thinks that person C is very good, while B thinks that A's view is completely wrong, and debates between A and B about the "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil" caused by the same event. The reason for such disputes and debates is nothing more than the fact that the boundaries between "good" and "evil" have not been clearly defined, and when the problem of survival has become a universal threat today, everyone is pursuing "profit" under the sole condition of survival in order to sustain life. The "good" and "evil" problems that arise in this are often even more confusing.

However, if we think about it carefully, the good and bad of a thing can certainly be judged, and a good person and a bad person can still be distinguished after all. For example, if a poor person commits a theft because his life is on the verge of desperation, in principle, the sympathy we feel should be greater than the blame; conversely, if a rich person earns profits with his own capital, but if the means he uses are harmful to the public, then we still dislike him. Furthermore, the ordinary people who are determined to maintain the value of money and have to buy some daily necessities in the face of a straight-line rise in prices should certainly not be labeled with the many bad words "hoarding" and "exploitation." We praise a farmer or worker who exchanges labor for food, and we should at least not praise a tenant farmer who idles around and makes the fields barren or a landlord who only maintains a false life of enjoyment with the labor of others. As for those who have already eaten their fill and are instigating strikes for no reason, they should naturally be spurned by us. Speaking of students, a patriotic student is lovable, but those who only shout patriotic slogans, are unwilling to study hard, and some who are just living in a muddle-headed way, only hoping to get a diploma, should not be praised by us. Speaking of war, then the "good" and "evil" distinction between the resistance generated for the sake of righteous defense and the other side's deliberate ambition to invade is even more obvious.

People tend towards the "good" side. Generally speaking, people will only choose the evil side unless they have to. However, judging from the current situation, there are many who are not out of "necessity" but often go down the path of evil; and there are many who are facing "necessity" but are not willing to fall into the abyss of evil and darkness and are still struggling desperately; from this point of view, we cannot help but particularly regret the former's fall into evil and praise the latter's approach to the light.

### Pre-congratulatory Opening of the National Assembly

— Zhang Yiqu

The National Assembly is scheduled to open on Youth Day this year, and the closing date is expected to be after Children's Day. Spring returns to the earth, coinciding with a glimmer of life. Human determination will conquer nature, do not say that there are many difficulties in all directions. What is hoped for is that all reforms will start anew with the people. Therefore, I have composed a poem to announce to the people of the country.

I worry day and night about the white grass and yellow clouds,
I make plans according to the Three Laws.
I still hope that Liao Yang will send a campaign uniform,
And that Northern Jiangsu will fully change flags.
Settling the country and settling the border is not a bad plan,
Unifying the people and unifying things is a new path.
After Youth Day is Children's Day,
And life will remain in the mountains and rivers.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13: Attempting to Remedy (108)

Zhu Qi was stunned when he heard her words, knowing that there must be something behind them, and he did not want to pursue the matter further. He said dejectedly, "Will you allow me to come again in the future?" Yun Qing shook her head and said, "It's best not to meet." Zhu Qi stretched out his hand and said, "Will you allow me to shake your hand?" Yun Qing stretched out her hand and grasped Zhu Qi's hand. Zhu Qi felt that her hand was cold and trembling. He knew that she was greatly stimulated in her heart. Saying goodbye, he turned and went downstairs. Walking on the street, he felt extremely sad. He felt that if he broke off relations with a close friend of more than twenty years, would he be sorry to her or would she be sorry to him? This mystery must be broken so that he could feel relieved. She has already gone to ask Uncle Xiao Bai, so now he can only go to his house to ask so that he knows. However, Uncle Xiao Bai has a very bad temper. How can he ask him? Does he already know about himself and Qi Wan? He never meddles in other people's affairs. Even if he knows, I don't think he would stir up trouble. While thinking, he walked until he reached Dong Dan Pailou, and then he remembered to hire a car and came to the Fei residence. Uncle Xiao Bai was at home, lying in bed resting. When he saw Zhu Qi come in, he nodded, greeted him to sit on the couch, and asked, "You haven't been here for a long time. I heard that Qi Wan left?" Zhu Qi's face turned red when he saw that he asked about Qi Wan as soon as he met him. Before he could answer, he heard Uncle Xiao Bai continue, "I have been very worried since she left. I recently received good news, and I feel relieved. I heard that Xiao He recently received a telegram from her mother, Liu Ru, telling him to send Qi Wan's luggage to Shanghai. From this, it seems that Qi Wan has the ambition to revive her career in the pear garden. Mr. Mei is still in Shanghai now. Qi Wan has always been known for those few Mei-style operas. Now that Mr. Mei is in Shanghai to guide her in person, I think she will be very successful on stage. She is very smart and willing to work hard, so she will definitely be very successful. It can be said that I initiated her departure this time. I don't need to say the reason. Maybe you will understand in your heart. I was afraid that she would be stimulated and go astray. Now that she has returned to the pear garden world, I can rest assured. As for you, you almost went astray too. I didn't point it out to you in person at the time. I secretly separated the two of you. If I had told you at the time, you would have hated me to death—but today, your parents and couples are still without any complaints, and the family is very happy, which cannot but be said to be my credit. You should work hard in the future!"

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Living Together for Fourteen Years Without Knowing Her Lover Was a Thief Woman Fears Being Implicated and Appeals for Relief

Zhang Zhen asks: My girlfriend, Miss So-and-so, lived with a man named A for fourteen years and had a son and a daughter. At that time, she only knew that he was doing business outside. It was not until last year that she learned that A had committed theft outside and had been in prison once. Recently, he has committed many crimes, and the woman fears being implicated and intends to break away from him. There are the following questions, and I would like to ask your column to answer: (1) Miss So-and-so now wants to break away from the cohabitation relationship with A. I don't know what legal problems there are and what procedures are required? (2) Can Miss So-and-so take away the children she gave birth to? (3) Miss So-and-so is going to the police station to report him, but she is afraid that he will harm her in the future. If she does not report him, will Miss So-and-so be considered to have committed a crime? (4) If the woman leaves in private, can A interfere with her actions?

[Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi Answers] (1) Cohabitation, even if it lasts for a long time, such as the fourteen years mentioned in the question, cannot obtain the status of husband and wife due to the length of time. In other words, cohabitation is still cohabitation, and its relationship does not differ depending on the length of time. If you ask about the legal relationship of cohabitation, it means that if you are compatible, you stay, and if you are not compatible, you leave. As for the separation procedures, Shanghai often publishes announcements in the newspaper. In fact, publishing in the newspaper is just a form of expression. As for the battle for custody of children, unless there is another agreement, it should originally be the responsibility of the man. The legislation protects children because modern male society has more abundant abilities (see the Divorce Example of the Civil Code). However, the court may determine the guardian for the benefit of the children. For example, if the man is a thief, for the sake of the children and for the sake of society, the official will give the woman custody. (3) Husband and wife may protect each other from committing crimes, which is human nature. However, cohabitation has the suspicion of partnership, and reporting is not abnormal. Breaking away from cohabitation can avoid being implicated, but you must not take away the stolen goods. (4) Breaking away from cohabitation can also be done unilaterally; in legal theory, cohabitation cannot be forced.
