37th Year Production Business Loan Policy

According to the National Bank of China, all kinds of loans were temporarily suspended at the end of November last year, and three months have passed since then. The situation of various parties requesting the handling of purchasing manufacturers' finished products has been disclosed one after another. In February of this year, the office received an order from the Chairman to draft a loan method for the 37th year of production undertakings and report it for approval. The office transferred it to various banks for comments and drafted five loan policies, which were submitted to the Council for approval and then signed and approved by the Chairman. It was also instructed that the Central Bank must still handle the rediscounting and re-mortgaging of general business loans of various banks carefully and must not be lax. The original policies are recorded as follows: (1) The 37th year production business loan policy and the National Bank of China should adopt the following methods: 1. Order loans or purchase finished products, 2. Entrust production, 3. Short-term capital turnover including packing loans, etc., 4.

Funds of state-owned enterprises may be collected and stored by various banks separately in accordance with their professional nature. (5) The examination and investigation of loans and re-pledges shall be handled in accordance with the following items: 1. Various order loans, purchase of finished products, entrusted production, and other loans that cooperate with national policies shall be handled in accordance with past practice after being approved by the Council, or after approving the plan and methods, the Central Bank shall supervise various banks to handle them separately. 2.

### The Full Economic Council Discusses Prices and Adopts Stringent Measures to Suppress Inflation; Chen Qitian and Others Are Tasked to Draft Concrete Suggestions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Full Economic Council held its 36th regular meeting on the 11th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. First, Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuchun reported and gave a detailed analysis of the price increase situation from January to the present. Gu said: Prices were relatively stable in January, but began to rise in the second week of February, and became more intense in the fourth week, led by rice and cotton yarn. The rising pattern has lost its normal state. The rising trend became more severe from March 3rd and is still continuing. After Gu's report, the committee members exchanged views on the price issue widely and discussed it enthusiastically. They generally believed that there were many reasons for the recent surge in prices, such as rumors and a large influx of funds from the Northeast, which were sufficient to stimulate prices, but the speculative manipulation of illegal merchants was also one of the biggest reasons. Most advocated taking strict measures to suppress the rising trend. It was generally determined that Chen Qitian, He Haoruo, Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuanbin, Deng Feihuang, and Bingwen, etc., should study methods and put forward concrete suggestions for discussion at the next meeting. Afterwards, the meeting discussed the Ministry of Agriculture's proposed plans for increasing the production of tung oil, silk, wool, and tea, four export materials, and decided to approve them in accordance with the review opinions. The original plan aimed at three years: (1) Tung oil: increase production to 60,000 tons in the first year, 80,000 tons in the second year, and 100,000 tons in the third year. (2) Silk: it is estimated to produce 65,000 dans of raw silk within three years, and 8 million yards of export silk. (3) Tea: it is planned to produce 1.2 million dans within three years. (4) Wool: it is hoped to produce 220 million pounds of coarse wool and 480 million pounds of fine wool annually. The review opinions were (1) the issue of establishing new institutions should be decided by the Executive Yuan. (2) The required funds should be coordinated with agricultural loans. (3) The establishment of factories should be negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) The quality of agricultural products should be strictly examined. B. The Transportation Control Committee presented a case to the Full Economic Council for the China Trust Bureau to act as an agent for the government to purchase tung oil and pig bristles for export materials, and then collect a 1% handling fee for foreign exchange settlement and remittance to the national treasury. After discussion, the case was rejected for the following reasons: (1) The past regulations only had handling fees for agency services, and there was no distinction between agency sales and purchase handling fees. (2) All export expenses are reported and reimbursed as they are. The agency handling fee, according to past regulations, for tung oil and pig bristles alone, is 1.8 billion yuan. If the purchase handling fee is added, it will increase to 6 billion yuan. (3) In addition to tung oil and pig bristles, there are other export materials. If all of them require export handling fees, it will increase the treasury's expenses.

Our reply stated: "The garrison in the Xinjiang Province of China has not crossed the border between China and Outer Mongolia at any time or at any place in the past." All the locations of the alleged invasion listed in the letter from the Government of Outer Mongolia are clearly within the territory of the Xinjiang Province of China. This is also what the Chinese government cannot but solemnly point out.

The reply continued: "Since June 6, 1947, when Mongolian troops invaded the northern foothills of Beitashan in Xinjiang Province, China, although the Chinese government has repeatedly protested and demanded that the Government of Outer Mongolia immediately withdraw the troops to Outer Mongolia, the Government of Outer Mongolia has not complied. Since the Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang Province, China, they have not only caused heavy losses to the Chinese garrison in the Beitashan area, but also repeatedly carried out harassment and looting against the Chinese people residing in the counties of Yiwu, Zhenxi, and Dihua in the Hami area of Xinjiang Province, China, as well as Qhe, Fuyuan, Benleihe, and Fukang in the Dihua area." After listing the facts of the Mongolian troops' repeated harassment and looting, the note also stated: "The Chinese government must again lodge a serious protest against the continued occupation of the northern foothills of Beitashan in Xinjiang Province by Mongolian troops, and again demand that the Government of Outer Mongolia order the Mongolian troops to immediately withdraw to the territory of Outer Mongolia." Finally, our reply stated: "We demand the prompt return of livestock and other property looted from the Chinese people by the Mongolian troops from June 6 of last year to January 20 of this year, the prompt release of the Chinese people who were abducted, and compensation and condolences for the Chinese people killed by the foreign army."

Our country's land sovereignty and the survival of the people have been infringed upon, and world peace has been destroyed, which is almost all caused by this.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The issue of the timing of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was discussed at the Standing Committee meeting on the 11th.

### Marshall Announces to Readers That U.S. Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged 500 Million Worth of Supplies Can Be Fully Shipped to China by June

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall stated in response to inquiries on the 10th that the U.S. policy towards China remains to seek a government with a broader foundation. Marshall said that President Truman had stated this point on December 18, 1945. According to this statement, all parties should work together to resolve their differences. Since that time, the U.S. has not issued any further policy statements on China. However, Marshall added that since the Communists have now openly rebelled against the government, the U.S. is not in a position to specify conditions, and the Chinese government should handle it. Marshall's remarks on China policy today were prompted by an inquiry from a reporter. According to the reporter, Congressman Fulton had said that the U.S. had never denied its original China policy, which was to promote a coalition government between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Marshall said that there had been a partial agreement in September 1945, but it was never implemented.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Marshall stated at a press conference that the U.S. should adopt two different approaches to dealing with the challenges posed by the Communists in Europe and the Far East, but one point in common is that, whether in China or Europe, the U.S. is actively assisting governments fighting against the Communists.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall recently stated at a press conference that by June 30th of this year, surplus supplies valued at an estimated $500 million can be fully transferred to China from the Pacific islands.

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] Officials say that the biggest difficulty in shipping goods to China is the slow pace of transportation within China. They pointed out that the freight for shipping surplus supplies from New Guinea to Wusongkou in Shanghai is 17 yuan per ton, but the cost of transporting it from Wusongkou to Shanghai is as high as 18 yuan per ton. They said that for this reason, the UN stopped shipping goods to China in 1946. However, it is generally believed that shipping difficulties have been reduced in recent months, so there is reason to believe that the Chinese government may be able to complete the transportation before the contract expires.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 10th] Approximately 16,200 long tons of rice and wheat will be shipped to China from the west coast and southern ports of the United States before the end of March, and cargo space has already been reserved on four ships. In addition, cargo space has also been reserved on the "Java" mail ship to transport approximately 500 long tons of grain seeds to China. The ship is scheduled to load cargo in Seattle on March 26th. This assistance is being handled by the China Aid Mission.

Editorial

### Starting from the Suicide of the Czech Foreign Minister

Less than half a month after the establishment of a communist regime through the coup in Czechoslovakia, Czech founding father Jan Masaryk, the foreign minister, tragically committed suicide by jumping from a building. The shocking news reverberated around the world, with universal mourning for Masaryk's death for freedom and democracy. The tragic end of a liberal who followed a center-left path is not only a great tragedy for Czechoslovakia, but also a major blow to the future of world peace and democracy!

In fact, after the formation of the Czech communist regime, we pointed out that the new Czech government was nothing more than a disguised one-party dictatorship, and we also anticipated that Czech tragedies would continue to emerge. The facts of the past ten days have proven the correctness of our views. First, there were rumors of President Beneš being forced to resign, and then there were the sweeping "purges" carried out by the Czech communists in the country, leaving the general public unable to breathe a breath of freedom. This time, Masaryk's suicide, sacrificing himself for the freedom and democracy of Czechoslovakia, not only exposed the disguise of the Czech communists' seizure of power, but also made us even more convinced that communism and democracy are two absolutely incompatible concepts. The expansion of communist forces in Eastern Europe and the rampant activities of the Chinese communist bandits in our country have made the freedom and democracy cherished by the world feel a very serious threat. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall also called the Czech coup a "reign of terror" and warned the world that the overall world situation has reached a critical stage.

Of course, we also believe that the U.S. authorities have long been alerted to the threat of communist forces to world peace and democracy. The advocacy of the Truman Doctrine and the implementation of the Marshall Plan are sufficient to illustrate that the U.S. executive branch has long been planning to prevent problems before they arise. What is regrettable is the lack of thoroughness in advocacy and the lack of speed in action! As far as the Truman Doctrine is concerned, it has not yet been fully implemented in Europe, and there is no trace of it in Asia. Speaking of the Marshall Plan, it is still in the stage of congressional debate, and the total amount and the time of implementation are still unknown. But when we look at the current Europe, the division of the world is becoming increasingly clear. Although the London Conference has decided to merge the occupation zones of the three Western powers in Germany, and the representatives of the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have drafted the Treaty of the Western European Union, these diplomatic activities, whether from a political, economic, military, or diplomatic point of view, are far less than the amazing developments within the red iron curtain. The Soviet-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed on February 5th, followed by the signing of the Soviet-Hungarian Mutual Assistance Treaty on February 18th. After this coup in Czechoslovakia, the Czech communists took control of the government and completely threw themselves into the arms of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia is the heart of Europe: "Whoever controls Czechoslovakia controls the European continent." Recently, the Soviet Union forced Finland to conclude a military alliance treaty with it. Although it is still in the negotiation stage, Finland, in this situation, has no way to call for help, and probably has no other option but to accept the Soviet demands!

But the so-called Western European alliance is not a novel idea, but an old tune. At the beginning of the Second World War, the world was dreaming of the beautiful vision of "One World." Churchill delivered a speech in Fulton, USA, advocating the theory of the United States of Europe. At that time, the public opinion generally believed that Churchill's advocacy of this old-fashioned proposal seemed too backward and out of touch with the times. Even the U.S. diplomatic authorities held this seemingly "progressive" view. But when we think back to today, we can't help but admire Churchill's foresight. Although the Western European alliance has now become a reality, after two years of wasted time, its significance and role have also been lost by more than half. The U.S. authorities, who claim to lead the world's democratic forces, should reflect on themselves and quickly seek remedies!

From Europe, we return to Asia and observe the current policies of the United States. Whether it is towards Japan, Korea, or China, they have all made great historical mistakes. Especially Secretary of State Marshall's view of Chinese politics is not only a big mistake, but also a big failure! Marshall came to China to mediate the KMT-CPC negotiations, and he always believed that the CPC was an ordinary political party, and firmly advocated that our government should expand its foundation to include the CPC. Later, the negotiations failed, and Marshall left China unhappily. Now, after seeing the Czech coup and recalling the past negotiations, we can advise Marshall not to be unhappy anymore. Because even if the "coalition government" that Marshall advocated at that time was successful, who could guarantee that the CPC would not take similar measures as the Czech communists and stage a shocking "coup" to establish a totalitarian communist government to dominate China? If so, then Marshall would not only let down China, but also the United States, and all the people in the world who love democracy and freedom, and would have regrets for the rest of his life. However, according to the Associated Press, Marshall has not been enlightened by the Czech coup, and still advocates expanding the basis of the Chinese government, which makes us really do not understand where Marshall's brilliance lies. Although we do not want to say today that Marshall's mediation in China has indeed given the CPC the opportunity to expand its power, we cannot but point out that the U.S.'s lack of active support for China, especially the bias of the U.S. State Department's career diplomats towards the CPC, is one of the factors that have contributed to the expansion of the CPC's power.

Now, under the direction of Moscow, communist forces are invading both Europe and Asia. If the United States does not unite all democratic countries to stop them at the same time, the disaster will be unimaginable. Some people in the United States may still believe that the crisis in Europe is more serious than that in Asia, so they still advocate "Europe first, Asia second." In fact, this is also a view that only knows one thing but not the other. It must be known that if the United States cannot stop the expansion of communist forces in Asia, no matter how "all-out" it provides assistance in Europe, it will be difficult to reverse the situation. General Claire Chennault, the Flying Tiger, testified before the House of Representatives yesterday, stating his personal views on the issue of aid to China, and strongly emphasized the importance of military aid to China, saying that this move would help prevent Soviet aggression in Europe, otherwise a third world war would be inevitable. He also stated clearly: "I believe that the Soviet Union will not take any action in the West until China is completely red and can rest easy in the East. Therefore, once China is completely red, we will face an urgent problem and have to choose between participating in a third world war or retreating to the American continent. In my opinion, China is the cornerstone of world peace. If we concentrate all our energy and resources in Europe to prepare for the worst, we will make a big mistake." These words are full of true knowledge and insight, and we hope that the American government and public will take the Czech coup as a warning and think carefully!

### Reform of Northeast Currency Petition Group Puts Forward Opinions

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Regarding the currency issue, the Northeast Petition Group originally scheduled to meet with Zhang Jia'ao on the evening of the 11th. However, because Zhang was summoned by the chairman at the last minute, they were unable to discuss it. They scheduled a meeting again for the morning of the 12th. It is reported that the opinions put forward by the petition group are roughly divided into three items: (A) Remittances, (B) Stipulating the exchange rate with the legal currency, (C) Circulation and use of the legal currency inside and outside the customs. Among them, regarding the issue of remittances, after the group raised it when meeting with Chairman Chiang, the chairman attached great importance to it and immediately approved the opening of remittances. The remaining two items still need to be confirmed, especially the determination of the exchange rate, which is extremely important. Because the army accounts for 70% of the holders and users of the currency, workers account for more than 20%, and local administrative personnel account for 10%, if the exchange rate is not fixed, it will have a great impact on military morale and industry in the future. Therefore, the petition group specifically raised these three points of opinion, which will ask Zhang Jiaji to pay attention to.

### Ministry of Finance Clarifies Matters Concerning the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The newspaper reports regarding the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement are not entirely consistent with the facts. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance makes the following clarifications: There are two agreements negotiated between China and Hong Kong: one is the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement, and the other is the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement. Except for the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement, which is being negotiated by the Central Bank and in which the method of using original certificates for several kinds of goods exported through Hong Kong has been implemented since January 5th, the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement was signed on January 12th and went into effect on January 20th. It is being gradually implemented in accordance with the agreement. Once the Hong Kong government completes the necessary legislation for Article 4 of the agreement, which stipulates that Chinese customs will perform duties in Hong Kong territorial waters, and the matters stipulated in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9, the entire agreement can be implemented.

If the area after verifying the deed is less than 80% of the investigated area, in addition to selecting various types of land and spot-measuring the four corners and the center of each section, the names of the owners who have not paid for the review should also be investigated in detail. If there is a failure to review within the time limit, or concealment, omission, or short reporting, once verified, in addition to being fined two to five times the tax amount according to Article 21 of the Wartime Requisition of Goods Ordinance, it shall also be handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Owners Who Limit Reporting, Short Reporting, or False Reporting of Land in the Land Registry.

(4) Public Announcement: After the field tax cleanup in the entire township (town) is completed, the registration and investigation team leader should, together with the baojia leader, convene a bao people's assembly in each bao to publicly announce the compiled results. After the public announcement of each bao is completed, the registration and investigation team leader should, together with the township (town) office, list and publicly announce it for one month. During the announcement period, if there are land disputes, the township (town) baojia leader should mediate with the registration and investigation team leader. If mediation fails, the parties should be instructed to file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities for legal handling.

(5) Re-investigation and Correction: During the public announcement period, if people believe that there are errors, omissions, or omissions, they may apply for re-investigation and correction. If necessary, staff may be dispatched to conduct on-site measurement. After correction, the private seals of the owner, bao leader, and the person in charge must be affixed to the correction area of the land register to show caution. If an error or omission in the compilation is discovered after the completion of the county-wide field tax cleanup work, the application for re-investigation and correction shall still be approved, and the correction method shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations on the Land Reporting Re-investigation and Correction.

(6) Compilation of Registers: After each field tax cleanup work is completed, the land registers shall be bound into volumes according to sections (land living registers), and then classified by household according to township (town), filling in the household registers (household plot registers), and filling in the grain levy roster based on this. In addition, three copies of the white deed and no-deed land registration registers shall be made, with one copy stored in the county (city) government, one copy submitted to the provincial government, and one copy submitted to the central government.

(7) Revision of Tax Rates: After the completion of the county-wide field tax cleanup work, the field tax rates should be revised according to the land category, land fertility, and output yield per mu. The maximum should not exceed nine rates, and the revision standard should be based on one-tenth of the income per mu of land.

Article 6: Ownerless land shall be reported by the township (town) office, and the income from the land shall be used for education and construction in the township (town) office, but the assessed tax amount shall also be paid by the township (town) office. If no one claims it after two years, it may be regarded as public property and recovered by the county (city) government. Article 7: After the county (city) revises the tax rates, if new land is discovered, causing the total tax amount of the entire county (city) to exceed the original tax amount, the various tax rates may be appropriately reduced, but not less than the original total tax amount. Article 8: The revised tax rates shall be jointly drafted by the county (city) government and the county (city) field grain agency, submitted to the county (city) council for discussion, and then submitted to the provincial government for review and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Food, and Ministry of Land Administration for approval, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for filing.

### US Advocates Limiting Great Power Veto Power in the Security Council, Formally Proposes Recommendation to "Small Assembly"

[Our Newspaper News] New York 11th Broadcast: Lake Success News. The US delegation formally recommended to the "Small Assembly" today that the veto power of major powers in the Security Council should be limited. In September last year, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the United States would limit the use of the veto power to the most important issues, such as economic sanctions and the use of force, while the veto power may not need to apply to other secondary issues such as procedural issues. The recommendation made by the United States today is the solidification of this proposition. However, a spokesman for the US delegation admitted that the Soviet Union has not shown any signs of agreeing to this method. Furthermore, due to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the "Small Assembly," even if it is desired to raise this issue for discussion, it must be raised in the UN General Assembly, and then the Security Council must pass it, so there are many obstacles ahead. But the United States believes that this method is of such great significance that even if the attempt fails, it is worth trying. If the US recommendation is adopted, all the issues on which the Soviet Union has used its veto power in the past two years will be excluded from the scope of the veto power.

[United Press Philadelphia, 10th Dispatch] Philippine Ambassador Romulo spoke here tonight, opposing the establishment of a Supreme Security Council outside the UN organization. It is said that this group is a major threat to the UN, proving the inability to trust the organization to resolve disputes, and the international rift will expand, leaving no room for persuasion and compromise. Such claims should be completely dispelled, and the following measures should be taken to strengthen the powers of the UN organization: (1) Revise the UN Charter to make it a limited world government. (2) The UN General Assembly can currently only make recommendations to member states, but in the future, it should be reorganized into a true parliament with legislative power to prevent war. (3) The Security Council should become the executive body of the General Assembly, so that it is not bound by the veto power.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall, in a reception for reporters today, stated that the global situation is "extremely serious," referring to the expansion of communist forces in Europe, the coup in Czechoslovakia, and the resulting agitation in the United States due to the various developments in Europe. Marshall also said, "The death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is clear evidence that the communist rule in that country has created a world of terror. Whether Masaryk's death was a suicide, as the Czech government claims, is still unknown." Other U.S. officials believe it is likely that Masaryk was murdered. Reporters asked for an assessment of the overall situation, given the upcoming Italian parliamentary elections on April 18, where the Communist Party also has a chance to seize power, causing panic among various parties who fear the worst, with some even discussing the possibility of imminent war. Marshall replied, "There is indeed great anxiety about the development of the situation, and great agitation in the United States. The situation is extremely serious, and such emotional agitation is regrettable."

[Reuters, London, 10th] Prime Minister Attlee, in a personal statement, expressed his shock at the death of Masaryk. He said that Masaryk was a devotee of liberalism, and that his suicide shows his unwillingness to continue living in the suffocating atmosphere of a totalitarian regime. His name will forever be revered by those who believe in freedom. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons that the names of Foreign Minister Masaryk and his father will forever remain in the cherished memories of the British people. Churchill, after recalling the shared hardships in London during the war, added that Masaryk's death is a great loss, but his glorious name will continue to be a guiding light for the Czech people.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Political figures believe that Masaryk's death is proof of the final collapse of freedom in Czechoslovakia, indicating an increasing need for Western countries to strengthen their unity.

### Britain Unwilling to Protest Soviet Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs

Bevin Does Not Intend to Invoke the Anglo-Soviet Treaty

[Reuters, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in the House of Commons, rejected the suggestion from Conservative MP Strauss that he invoke Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which states that "the contracting parties shall strictly adhere to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states," to protest recent Soviet actions. Bevin pointed out that he had already criticized Soviet arbitrary actions in a speech in January, and did not wish to add any further comments.

### Czech Diplomats Resign En Masse

[Reuters, Sydney, 10th] The Czech Consul-General in Sydney, Tokoly, announced his resignation this afternoon. He said that Masaryk's death was not a suicide but a murder.

[Reuters, Oslo, 10th] The Czech Minister to Norway, Walter, announced his resignation tonight.

[United Press, Mexico City, 10th] The Foreign Ministry here announced that due to recent political developments in Czechoslovakia, the government has recalled its minister to Czechoslovakia for "consultations."

### Czech Representative Appeals, United Nations Refuses to Consider

[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The Czech representative to the United Nations, Papanek, yesterday sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting that the Security Council investigate the situation in Czechoslovakia and that UN member states should decide whether to recognize the new Czech government. He accused Soviet officials of directly participating in the actions of the Czech Communist Party and accused Stalin of violating the Soviet-Czech Friendship Treaty. He further stated that since the coup, President Beneš has been unable to make public statements or appear in public places and has lost his freedom. The Communist Party is doing its best to destroy the democratic system in Czechoslovakia. Papanek also told reporters that he refused to recognize the new Czech regime, but did not wish to resign, as he considered himself still a public servant of the Czechoslovak Republic before February 20.

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Lie, after consulting with legal advisors and Security Council President Tsiang Tingfu today, decided to ignore the Czech representative's letter. It is said that this letter was not a formal appeal from the government, and could not be considered according to the rules of procedure of the Security Council.

### Significance of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty Lies in Closing the Door to Northern Europe

[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The Soviet semi-official publication "Soviet Literature Magazine" published an editorial stating that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance will quickly close the door on Sweden, a partner of Wall Street, preventing their friends from across the Atlantic from entering the Soviet border. The enemies of the world are stirring up opposition to the Soviet-Finnish treaty in Northern Europe and making Stockholm the center of anti-Soviet activities. The Finnish people deeply know that the Soviet-Finnish treaty is a guarantee of independence and freedom, and a new investment in strengthening peace in Northern Europe and the world.

[United Press, Helsinki, 11th] President Paasikivi yesterday met with a seven-member delegation to discuss negotiating the Soviet-Finnish treaty in Moscow, with many experts on Soviet affairs, including Army Commander-in-Chief Svólu, also in attendance. Before the meeting, some members of the delegation reportedly asked the president to withdraw the appointment, but Paasikivi replied, "Whether you are willing or not, this is a forced job."

### US Senate Accelerates Discussion of European Aid Bill; Three Amendments Passed; Taylor's Motion Overruled by Majority Vote

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] The US Senate has now passed three amendments related to the Marshall Plan for European aid and rejected an amendment to have the Marshall Plan administered by the United Nations. It has also scheduled two meetings for the night of the 13th, one of which is an emergency meeting, in order to make a decision on the Marshall Plan. Therefore, action on the plan should be completed within this week. The amendments passed by the Senate are (1) an amendment to cancel the provision to lease 300 postwar Liberty ships to 16 European countries; (2) an amendment to stipulate that the implementation of the plan should make as much use of private trade channels as possible; (3) an amendment to obtain assistance from Western countries in the European relief program. The amendment rejected by the Senate was proposed by Taylor, who was Wallace's running mate for Vice President. Republican presidential candidate Taft supports reducing the funding for the European Recovery Program from $5.3 billion to $4 billion, while Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg calls for maintaining the original amount. The House of Representatives has abandoned the comprehensive foreign aid bill, including aid to Greece, China, and Turkey, and will instead discuss the European Recovery Program separately.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The Senate yesterday voted 73 to 3 against a proposal by Third Party vice-presidential candidate Senator Taylor to have a United Nations agency manage foreign aid.

### Clementis Succeeds as Czech Foreign Minister; State Funeral for Deceased Foreign Minister Tomorrow; Gottwald States that Foreign Interference in Czech Internal Affairs Will Not Be Tolerated

[United Press, Prague, 11th] Parliament today unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the cabinet led by Communist Prime Minister Gottwald.

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] The Czech Parliament held its first meeting since the coup today. Prime Minister Gottwald attended and delivered a speech lasting 55 minutes, strongly emphasizing that Czechoslovakia will not tolerate foreign interference in its internal affairs. He said that Czechoslovakia will continue to be a loyal and reliable member of the Slavic bloc and considers itself an ally of other countries that have already established people's democracy. However, Czechoslovakia will still strive to maintain good relations with all other countries on a reciprocal basis. Gottwald also announced that the new Czech constitution, which had not been drafted at the time of the coup, will be redrafted from scratch. The original plan was for the new constitution to be drafted before the general election in May.

[United Press, Prague, 10th] After Masaryk's suicide by jumping out of a window, Communist Clementis succeeded him as Foreign Minister on the 10th.

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] The state funeral for Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk is scheduled for Saturday of this week, with military honors. The funeral procession will pass through the city of Prague and go directly to Lány, where the tomb of the elder Masaryk is located. Lány will be renamed Masaryk Lány from that day on, in memory of these two great men. The Czech Parliament held its first meeting today since the establishment of the Communist-controlled government. Masaryk's seat was piled with red and white flowers. Interior Minister Nosek announced that Masaryk jumped from the window of his official residence at approximately 6:00 AM on the 10th, and his body was discovered half an hour later. Nosek also said that before committing suicide, Masaryk had read letters and telegrams from Western Europe and the United States, many of which approved of Masaryk's participation in the new government.

President Beneš is still at his villa in Ústí and has not returned. The news of Masaryk's tragic death was reported to the president by Interior Minister Nosek and Deputy Foreign Minister Clementis. Beneš's grief was, as expected, profound. Masaryk was not only his closest cabinet colleague but also the only remaining representative of Western thought in the country, a man he could rely on to restrain the policies of the new national front. Beneš's wife subsequently traveled by car to Prague to console Masaryk's sister, Alice. Prime Minister Gottwald also sent a special telegram of condolence to Alice. On Sunday, the 98th anniversary of his father's birth, Masaryk went to Lány, stood alone by his father's tomb, and meditated for a long time. On the 9th, he went to Ústí to see President Beneš, who was also a close friend and student of his father. At 6:00 PM, he received the Counselor of the Czech Embassy in London, Pless, at his official residence, and they talked for about an hour. Before parting, Masaryk instructed Pless to come again the next morning, as he had some letters to entrust to him to take to London. The last person to meet with Masaryk was his servant, at 8:30 PM on the 9th. On the morning of the 10th, Masaryk's guards found him lying stiff on the stone steps, having jumped from the bathroom window. His head was not injured, and his eyes were tightly closed, as if he were sleeping soundly. Masaryk lived frugally, and although his residence had five rooms, he only used two, one as a bedroom and sitting room, and one as a bathroom. The furniture in the sitting room was simple, like a student dormitory, not at all like the official residence of a foreign minister.

It is expected that the foreign ministers of the five countries will sign the treaty in Brussels next Wednesday or Thursday.

[Reuters, Brussels, 10th] According to reliable sources, the military part of the five-nation West European Alliance treaty will only apply to Europe, while the economic part will be extended to the overseas territories of all participating countries. Earlier reports that the alliance treaty would include provisions for extending mutual assistance to overseas territories have been denied today by the chief Belgian representative, Langehove. Langehove announced after this morning's meeting that the participating countries had reached a complete agreement in principle on all outstanding points of the alliance treaty. A British official spokesman also said that every key point in the treaty had been agreed upon, and that the remaining minor issues should not pose any difficulties. Before the start of this morning's five-nation conference, it was announced that the drafting committee had completed the final draft of the alliance treaty, but according to reliable sources, four articles were still missing from the full text of the treaty. However, Langehove said that this was only a matter of wording and could be completed in the plenary sessions today and tomorrow.

Representatives from the Philippines and France stated that since the Commission requested the opinion of the Small Assembly, it should accept its opinion without question. Philippine representative Arellano told United Press reporters that even after the establishment of the South Korean government, US troops should remain in South Korea, at least temporarily.

### Municipal Government Consults on Improving Employee Benefits

To improve employee benefits, the Municipal Government, led by Secretary-General Shen Zonglian, convened an ad hoc meeting yesterday morning in the conference room, attended by bureau directors and heads of affiliated agencies. Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, also participated. After the meeting, Secretary-General Shen informed reporters that the bureau heads agreed that it was indeed difficult for civil servants to maintain their livelihoods under the current high prices, and that they should petition the central government to restore the in-kind allocation of eight dou of rice. They also proposed a reasonable adjustment to the salaries of public educators starting in April. Furthermore, after the rice allocation was reduced to three dou in March, the Civil Food Allocation Committee planned to allocate additional rice at a subsidized price. The committee noted that the Municipal Government had more than 30,000 employees in total, a very large number, making the allocation extremely large and difficult to supply. However, for workers in the Public Works Bureau and sanitation workers and garbage truck drivers in the Health Bureau, who originally received four dou of rice but had it reduced to two dou, consideration could be given to allocating the two dou that were reduced at a subsidized price. Shen also stated that if each civil servant's family was counted as five people, one dan of rice would be needed per month, but only three dou were currently allocated, leaving a shortfall of seven dou. At market prices, this would cost 2.8 million yuan, but civil servants' average monthly income was only around 3 million yuan, making it practically impossible to maintain their livelihoods.

In order to thank the rescuers, the Bureau specially made a silver shield and a consolation payment, and presented them to Battalion Commander Leng, but Battalion Commander Leng repeatedly declined it, saying that it was the duty of soldiers to protect the country and the people. The Bureau deeply felt that the Brigade had strict discipline and was a model for soldiers. This time, the ship carried dozens of people and goods worth hundreds of millions of yuan, all of which were saved from loss thanks to the rescue by the Youth Army.

### Carrying Guns, Impersonating Military Police, Forcing Silver Shops to Exchange Jewelry; Extortion Scheme Leads to Arrest; Two of the Five Arrested Were Found to Have Committed Robberies

[Our Newspaper] Ge Liangchen, a porter merchant residing at No. 3, Lane 166, Jiangning Road, specializes in traveling between Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Shanghai. Recently, in order to prepare goods to go to Taiwan, he was short of capital and borrowed a gold bracelet (weighing 9 qian 7 fen) and two gold rings (weighing 3 qian 4 fen) from his relative Le Xiangyun, the owner of the Xiangyun Silver Shop on Tiantong Road.

The next day, while Ge was planning to exchange the jewelry, an armed man named Zhang Zhipeng suddenly arrived, accompanied by three others, two in military uniforms and one in a Western suit, claiming to be police officers and wanting to detain Ge for the crime of privately operating gold jewelry. Ge was afraid and followed them to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, the New Great Cafe, and other places for negotiations. As a result, he reluctantly handed over the gold bracelet to Zhang and others. In the evening, they had a simple meal in a small restaurant at the intersection of Sanma Road and Yunnan Road. During the meal, Zhang and others suddenly took out guns and forced Ge to go to the Tianbao Silver Shop in Laoximen the next morning to exchange the jewelry. The group was preparing to defraud the silver shop at that time. Ge was forced to stay with them in Room 24 of the Pacific Hotel on Shaanxi North Road and could not return home. The next afternoon, Zhang escorted Ge to a teahouse at the predetermined location in Laoximen to meet with his three accomplices. Zhang immediately returned Ge's gold bracelet, and Ge exchanged it for 17.9 million yuan in legal tender at the Tianbao Silver Shop. Just as the transaction was taking place, two accomplices entered the shop impersonating economic police, insisting that they take Ge and the stolen goods to the police station together. After the silver shop staff gave them four gold rings, the group pretended to take Ge to the police station and left, getting into a car that had been waiting in front of the door. They drove to the side of the Ximen Memorial Tower, divided the loot, and scattered. After escaping, Ge reported the incident to the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau. Yesterday, the section received a tip-off and arrested the gang of imposters, Zhang Zhipeng, Zhan Xueqin, Yang Guichu, Li Fuyuan, and Zhang Xuyuehua, at the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Hankou Road.

### Organized Draft-Dodging Ring Broken Up; Eight Workers from the Clothing Factory Enticed to Ningbo to Substitute for Military Service; Undercover Investigation Leads to Arrest of Five Suspects in a Small Hotel

[Our Newspaper's Report] Eight workers from the Shanghai Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters recently went missing. After a secret investigation by the factory authorities, it was discovered that they had been enticed and sold by an organized draft-dodging ring. They then collaborated with the Huangpu Police Precinct to continue the investigation, and finally arrested the ringleader, Xu Xiaomao, and four others. They confessed that the eight workers from the Clothing Factory had been sold to a certain place in Ningbo to substitute for military service. The factory has dispatched personnel to Ningbo to investigate, and has also reported the matter to the Joint Logistics Headquarters for record. According to Zhou Jiwen, the factory director, it is still under investigation whether this case is merely a simple matter of enticing and selling draftees or whether there is a larger conspiracy involved.

The Clothing Factory has more than six thousand male and female workers. Although the factory has been making every effort to improve worker welfare facilities, wages are lower than those of general factories due to headquarters regulations. Therefore, unscrupulous elements often exploit this weakness to instigate workers to leave the factory. After discovering the disappearance of eight workers a few days ago, the factory paid close attention to the matter. Director Zhou instructed the factory's inspection office to conduct an investigation. Yang Zhaoping, the deputy head of the investigation team,

disguised as workers, has been searching for clues in public places for several days. The afternoon before yesterday, at the Changle Teahouse on Fuzhou Road, they encountered a middle-aged man with a Ningbo accent who identified himself as Xu Xiaomao. He approached them and inquired about the factory's treatment of workers. Yang and others intentionally engaged with him and hinted that they were willing to be draftees. Xu then invited them to Rongfa Hotel, No. 11 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao, to negotiate, stating that each person could receive a settlement fee of 16 million yuan, with an initial payment of 2 million yuan per person. They agreed to meet at the Qichang Hotel on Hankou Road at 9:00 a.m. the next morning. After Yang and others returned to the factory to report, Director Zhou specially dispatched plainclothes personnel

with guns to go with them the next day and contacted the Huangpu Police Precinct in charge. Yang and others went to the meeting in disguise and found that Xu was already waiting at the hotel with two assistants. They seemed to be wary of Yang and others. When Yang and others urged him to pay, he repeatedly made excuses and attempted to escape. Fearing that they would escape, Yang and others immediately arrested them. At that time, another accomplice came to deliver the money and was also arrested. Later, another accomplice was arrested. After interrogation by the Huangpu Police Bureau, they confessed to selling draftees. They also said that the eight missing workers had been sent to Ningbo. The Clothing Factory has reported the details of the incident to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and has requested the Municipal Police Bureau to severely punish the suspects.

(2) The quota for the first phase of conscription this year is based on the current allotment of 6,000 men, which will be allocated to each district based on the proportion of eligible men in active service, and then further allocated to each ward (the quota table will be issued separately). (3) The first phase of conscription this year will be based on formal conscription. If there are eligible men in active service in each district and ward who volunteer to enlist, they should submit a written application for voluntary service in accordance with the volunteer conscription measures for 1947, and obtain a guarantor. The conditions are as follows: (1) Must have a household registration in this city. (?) Must be between 20 and 25 years old. (3) Must have pure ideology and a physique that meets the prescribed standards. Refugees returning from bandit areas may be exempted from conscription before formal registration.

Conscription to Start from Age 20 (4) The first phase of conscription this year will start with one year group of men who are 20 years old (born in 1927), and will be conscripted sequentially. If the quota is not met, the age groups will be gradually extended until the quota is met, but it must not exceed three year groups (i.e., those born in 1925, 1926, and 1927). (5) The first phase of conscription in this city will begin on April 1st. The Civil Affairs Bureau will fill out the conscription notices based on the lottery numbers and notify the district chiefs, who also serve as conscription officers, to send personnel to collect and distribute them. If eligible men in active service who have been drawn fail to report on time, the district chiefs, who also serve as conscription officers, may report to the municipal government for compulsory enforcement. The quotas for each district in this city must be fully met by the end of June. (6) The procedures for conscripting and sending eligible men in active service (volunteers) in each district and ward will still be carried out in accordance with the volunteer conscription and sending procedures for 1947.

Elimination of Those Who Fail to Meet the Requirements (7) In addition to the physical examination committee organized by the Conscription Association, personnel from the Shanghai Garrison District Command will also be invited to participate in the examination of conscripted eligible men in active service. Those who fail the examination will be eliminated, and replacements will be made in the order of lottery numbers. (8) When conscripted eligible men in active service (volunteers) from each district and ward in this city are transferred to the new recruits' brigade, a handover supervision committee will be organized by the Conscription Association to supervise the handover. (9) The settlement subsidies and慰勞物品 for conscripted eligible men in active service (volunteers) when they are transferred to the National Defense Forces will be handled by the Conscription Association in a unified manner, and the specific measures will be determined separately. (10) If there are any omissions, missed lottery draws, or evasion of military service among eligible men in active service in each district and ward, they will be allowed to be conscripted and sent first. (11) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they will be handled by separate orders. (12) These measures will be implemented after being passed and promulgated by the municipal government in conjunction with the Conscription Association, and will be sent to the Ministry of National Defense and the Shanghai Garrison District Command for record.

### Lottery Committee to be Established the Day After Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper's Report] The lottery committee under the Conscription Association, which was originally scheduled to be established on the afternoon of the 15th, has been advanced to 10:00 a.m. on the 14th at the association due to the urgent need to start the lottery work. This change of date notice was issued last night. All committee members, district chiefs, and district representatives will participate at that time.

### Insufficient Rice in Warehouses Affecting People's Food Supply; People's Livelihood Investigation Committee Orders Rice Merchants to Transport 40,000 石 of Rice Daily; Police to Supervise Rice Distribution at Warehouses

Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, convened a meeting of 268 rice merchants in the city at Nanshi Market last night, strictly ordering the rice merchants to transport 40,000 石 of allocated rice daily to the rice shops in each district, so that the 1,935 rice shops, social service branches, and cooperative societies in each district can universally sell the allocated rice. The rice merchants reported that the only difficulty was that the rice distribution warehouses, such as the Taikoo Warehouse, open at 9:00 a.m. and close at 11:30 a.m., reopen at 2:00 p.m. and stop at 4:30 p.m., only working five hours a day and closed on Sundays. The China Trust Bureau warehouse supervisors only allow two weighing scales to be opened each day, and only over 7,000 bags of rice were distributed yesterday. Especially since the Taikoo Warehouse must be supervised by customs officers, even if the Taikoo Warehouse and China Trust Bureau warehouse supervisors are willing to extend their working hours, the customs officers must leave work at the designated time. Therefore, Chairman Ren decided to notify the Police Bureau Director to send police to supervise the warehouses this afternoon and to prevent them from stopping work at 11:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. They should take shifts, and those who violate this will be sent to the Huangpu Branch Bureau for legal action. In addition, the First Warehouse, East Warehouse, Guanlu Warehouse, Public Welfare Warehouse, and the number of coolies in the Xiaogong Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau all have vacancies. Chairman Ren promised to thoroughly investigate this and promised to open the Wing On Warehouse. The originally scheduled suspension of rice distribution at the First Warehouse has also been decided to be stopped, and it must continue to distribute rice. As for the Grain General Warehouse, in addition to the 88,000 石 already distributed, another 82,000 石 can also be quickly distributed. The meeting did not end until late at night. Chairman Ren told a Central News Agency reporter that if the warehouses, such as the Taikoo Warehouse, delay the distribution of rice again, they will be sent to the Special Criminal Court and punished for disrupting the economy.

### The Prodigy Calligrapher and Painter, Liu Boshu

[Special Dispatch from Nanchang, Ninth of the Month, by Air] A thirteen-year-old child who has just completed elementary school and entered the first grade of junior high school can paint large, free-spirited horses and roosters. He is a rare "prodigy" in Jiangxi, and perhaps can be called a young painter in the current Chinese art scene. This child's name is Liu Boshu, a native of Yongxin, Jiangxi. He is a top student at the Jiangxi Provincial Experimental Primary School. His father, Liu Zhongmou, teaches at the "Experimental Primary School." His mother is a genuine Yongxin country girl, hardworking and thrifty, assisting his father in managing the household. The family of eight relies entirely on Liu Zhongmou's teaching income to support their lives and raise five children. Boshu and his older brother are in middle school, and two younger brothers are studying at the "Experimental Primary School." The youngest, a little sister of only one year old, is held in his mother's arms day and night.

The First Signs of Genius

The young painter Liu Boshu can not only paint but also boldly paint spirited, high-headed horses on five-foot rice paper. Whether he is a genius or simply able to concentrate on practicing sketching is debatable. It turns out that when he was six years old and not yet in school, he lived with his parents at the school. Seeing the children attending classes, reading, and living their school lives, he was already immersed in education. So, in his childhood, he liked to use tiles and chalk to scribble on the ground or walls. Sometimes he would draw a vase with flowers, or chicks flying and jumping, and horses running. During the war, he and his father returned to Yongxin from Anfu Junma, which gave him more opportunities to understand the posture of horses and increase his wisdom in painting horses.

Painting Competition His debut work – a horse – was first valued and appreciated by outsiders when he was ten years old. At that time, he was studying at the Attached Primary School of the Yongxin Women's Normal School and participated in the Attached Primary School art exhibition, where he "became an instant success," winning first place among all the exhibits. After the victory and repatriation two years ago, he returned to the "Experimental Primary School" in Nanchang with his parents and participated in the Nanchang student painting competition, winning first place in the primary school group. The reputation of "young painter" was established in these two art exhibitions, and at the same time, it was no less than an invigorating stimulant to encourage him to improve.

Seeking Advice from the Master

He once sent four horses in different poses to Professor Xu Beihong, the master painter of horses in China, who was hosting the China Academy of Art in Beiping, to seek his advice.

Spiritual Disciple

The master painter Xu Beihong was overjoyed to receive such a talented student from afar. He immediately wrote back, saying: "The best way to learn painting is to 'take nature as your teacher.' When painting horses, you must take horses as your teacher, and when painting chickens, you must take chickens as your teacher. Carefully observe their appearance, movements, and expressions, and strive to grasp the essentials, without dwelling on trivial details." Xu taught him: To paint horses, you must also be familiar with the horse's skeleton, muscles, and tissues, and even learn horse anatomy. He hoped that the young painter would be determined to become a world-class artist and not be complacent with minor successes. Now, Liu Boshu is already Master Xu's "spiritual disciple."

Selling Paintings to Buy Books

Last May, he saw two painting albums by Master Xu at the Nanchang Zhonghua Bookstore but did not have the money to buy them. Later, he discussed it with the manager of the bookstore, who agreed to put several of his works on sale in the bookstore to use the proceeds to pay for the albums. The young painter's family economics can be seen from this. After getting Xu's albums, he worked harder to copy them, and added a "Learning from Beihong" seal under his signature. According to friends in the art world, his recent works since consulting the painting albums have indeed made great progress, especially after Master Xu gave him guidance and instruction in a letter, he can better control the paper and ink and write more wonderful works.

Holding an Exhibition

Recently, he held a solo exhibition in Nanchang, which caused a sensation in Hongdu. Within three days, more than twenty of his works were sold, earning nearly ten million in painting fees. On the last day, several foreign friends saw him painting in public and praised him greatly. Even two non-sale items displayed at the art exhibition were purchased.

Liu Boshu's achievements today are due to his talent, but also to the guidance and equipment of the school. It is necessary to introduce the Jiangxi Provincial Experimental Primary School, where the young painter was born and studied.

Overview of the Alma Mater

The "Experimental Primary School" was founded more than forty years ago and is now headed by Principal Liu Weiyou. Although it has been relocated several times during the war, it has never interrupted students' classes. There are now 1,200 winter students gathered in an old-style folk house building to study and play together. No fewer than 50,000 students have graduated from the "Experimental Primary School" and gone on to study in higher education or abroad. Dr. Mei Ru'ao, who is sitting on the judicial throne at the Far East Court, trying Japanese war criminals, completed his primary school education at the "Experimental Primary School" when he was a child.

The school not only has a library but also a well-equipped art classroom. When the children are taking art classes, they can freely draw and paint. Everyone hangs their works on the walls for a competition. Now, another child's sketch painting has also achieved considerable results. More than a thousand children in the school are all happy to study, seeing the young painter's achievements today.

White-Haired Teacher

Han Zude, an old teacher at the "Experimental Primary School," has worked at the school for forty years and is now sixty-eight years old. His hair is already white. Two years ago, he won a first-class certificate from the Ministry of Education. Now his spirit is very strong, like a young man. This old teacher repeatedly praised the young painter's past achievements at the "Experimental Primary School." He said: The child has excellent character and academic performance in school. He always gets excellent grades in exams and has the virtues of loving quiet and enjoying research. (Our Reporter Liu Zao)

### Bandits in Huangyan Take Advantage of the Situation to Riot and Loot Guns from the Town Office

[Special Dispatch from Huangyan, Seventh of the Month] Since the conscription of men in Yangfu Temple in the county on the 25th of last month, the people have been in turmoil, and bandits in various villages have taken the opportunity to riot. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, five or sixty bandits suddenly appeared in Shiqu Street, Luqiao, Hu Zhen, Southeast Township, Huangyan County. They were all in plainclothes and mixed into the Shiqu Street market. They looted more than a dozen guns from the town office and wounded two members of the town security team. They then attacked Luqiao, but because Luqiao was already on alert, they fled towards Shijia'ao and went to Huangmao Mountain.

### All Counties in Jiangsu Province Required to Complete Conscription of 60,000 Men by the End of This Month

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Eleventh of the Month] The Jiangsu Garrison Command recently telegraphed all county and municipal governments, ordering them to instruct their subordinates to share the difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and complete the conscription of all 60,000 men for this year by the end of this month to enrich the source of soldiers.

### The Artery of the Country; Guangzhou-Hankou Railway; Equipment is Actively Improved; American Loans Accelerate Transportation Construction

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, Eighth of the Month, by Air] With the flames of war spreading across North China and calls for construction in South China growing louder, the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, which undoubtedly connects the north-south transportation arteries, is most worthy of attention. Especially since the United States announced that it would allocate 60 million US dollars in loans specifically for improving the equipment of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, its importance has become even more prominent. The Guangzhou-Hankou Railway is 1,106 kilometers long. After the victory, the central government ordered that the entire line be reopened to traffic within eight months. Although it was able to be completed on schedule, it was still crude due to limited equipment and funding. Therefore, for more than two years after the victory, the number of accidents has made travelers wary. In particular, the horrific train overturning accident at the Yingde Bridge on July 10 last year, in which floating corpses filled the river, still makes people "change color at the mention of trains." Recently, bandits have emerged along the line to harass, attack trains, and destroy tracks, so the efficiency of trains has been greatly reduced. In order to ensure the transportation between Central China and South China, the authorities had already decided to overhaul it, and the arrival of American loans is like injecting a cardiotonic drug into the anemic Guangzhou-Hankou Railway.

According to the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway authorities, the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway must undergo major reforms within this year. At present, the railway only has more than 160 locomotives, of which only 100 are usable, more than 1,400 freight cars, and more than 300 passenger cars. However, the entire line (including the branch lines Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangzhou-Sanshui) operates more than 30 trains every day. Combined with management and technical problems, there is a great shortage of carriages. It is common for passengers to wait five to seven days to buy tickets. Since the restoration, no new carriages have been purchased, and the existing carriages are uneven, with hooks of different heights, which has caused the main cause of accidents. After Director Song Ziwen took office, he deeply felt that the smooth flow of traffic on the railway had a great impact, so the first step was to immediately ask the Ministry of Communications to allocate 100 freight cars from the Jiaoji Railway that were out of service and transport them by waterway. They will arrive soon. At the same time, 20 Australian locomotives allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are expected to arrive and be used within this year, so the transportation volume can be greatly increased. Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway Bureau, also said: Since many vehicles in the north have been suspended from use, while the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway urgently needs vehicles, if 100 passenger cars and 200 covered wagons can be allocated to the south, the railway's transportation can be guaranteed to reach the ideal target.

As for the problem of improving the bridges along the entire line, according to Director Du, the railway is

### Wuxi Launches Spring剿 Suppression Campaign and Offers Rewards for the Arrest of Bandit Leaders Zhang Zhuoru, etc.

[Report from our Wuxi Office on the 10th] The County Government, due to the frequent presence of remnant bandits in northern Wuxi, has specially arranged a spring suppression plan, aiming to eradicate them completely. It also ordered the traitorous bandits to surrender, promising them protection. The main points of the announcement are as follows: (1) Rewards are offered for the arrest of bandit leaders Zhang Zhuoru, Xue Yonghui, Jiang Hua, Miao Nansheng, Lu Daonan, and twenty others. (2) Communist bandits and accomplices within the county are granted an extended period to surrender until the 20th of this month. Those who fail to surrender by the deadline will be arrested and severely punished according to the law. (3) Residents within the county who have relatives, friends, or teacher-student relationships with the aforementioned wanted bandit leaders are required to register with their respective township offices before the 20th of this month. The government will provide them with protection. The County Government also convened a suppression meeting, deciding to launch a comprehensive spring suppression campaign to maintain social order.

Bridge Improvement

To prevent the recurrence of tragedies, maximum effort has been expended to purchase a large quantity of steel beams from the United States, Britain, and Canada, with the intention of replacing all wooden bridges by the end of October this year. The replacement on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway has already been completed. Approximately one million railway sleepers are needed. Apart from purchasing 200,000 from within the country, the remainder will be imported from Siam. However, the major task of railway improvement – the replacement of rails – will have to await American aid.

Although the allocation of American loans is still in the "staircase" stage, the transportation authorities are already planning with an open mind on how to truly improve the Yuehan Railway. According to Deputy Director of the Aolu Railway, Lin Shibo, at least US$40 million is needed to restore the Yuehan Railway to its pre-war condition. Therefore, the successful securing of a US$60 million loan will essentially solve the "only lacking the east wind" problem for the Yuehan Railway. While the authorities have not yet formally announced how they intend to utilize this batch of loans, from the snippets released by the authorities and Director Du Zhenyuan's statements, it can be inferred that, aside from some technical details, the main focus will be on the following:

Developing New Lines

The coal transport line from Zhuzhou, Hunan to Xinghua and Gouyadong in northern Guangdong is the fuel source for the Yuehan Railway. According to unofficial estimates, the coal reserves in Gouyadong alone are sufficient to supply the entire railway for over forty years. However, limited transportation has prevented mining and transport. To solve the entire railway's power needs, the construction of this line is naturally a priority. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications is actively planning its construction, using the old rails after new rails are installed on the Yuehan Railway. It is expected to be completed next year. The next priority is the construction of the Shaoguan branch line (from Shaoguan through Shixing, Nanji, Ganxian, Taihe, Ji'an to Qingjiang), which will connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. With a total length of 260 kilometers, once completed, the entire southeast region, and even the southwest border areas, will be connected, greatly facilitating the exchange of materials and military transportation. Its importance is self-evident. Therefore, Chairman Soong Tzu-wen, after returning to Guangzhou from his work report in Nanjing, specifically emphasized that the construction of the Shaoguan-Ganxian line must be expedited. Once American aid arrives, it can likely be implemented immediately. Other lines include the Shantou-Xiamen line (via Xingning) of about 600 kilometers, and the Guangzhou-Macau branch line, which will also depend on American aid for construction. (It is learned that a Belgian company, which previously invested in the construction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways, sent personnel to negotiate the construction of the Shantou-Xiamen line, but negotiations failed due to technical issues and the project was shelved.) With the completion of these four branch lines, the South China railway network will be almost complete, and the importance of the Yuehan Railway will continue to increase.

Laying New Rails

Due to the destruction of the war and the desire for post-war reconstruction, the equipment of the Yuehan Railway is simply below standard. In particular, the rails, pieced together and dilapidated, have been deemed unusable by American engineers for 547 kilometers. Moreover, there are more than twenty types of steel rails, creating disparities that are enough to hinder operations. Therefore, the Railway Bureau has decided to replace the rails with new ones as soon as the loan arrives. Regarding steel beams, the entire line originally had over 500 steel beam spans. The existing steel beams have been pieced together to form beams, and over 300 spans have already been replaced. It is expected that all can be replaced by the end of May. For the construction of the future Shaoguan-Ganxian branch line, it has been decided to purchase new-style steel beams and equipment with American loan funds. It is likely to be much better than the current facilities.

Establishing

Subsidiary Factories

Almost all the equipment for the Yuehan Railway is purchased from abroad, resulting in significant annual losses. To remedy this, the authorities have long planned to establish large-scale machinery factories in Guangzhou and Hengyang to specialize in producing and repairing equipment needed for the entire railway. However, these plans were delayed due to funding problems. (Although there were several negotiations for foreign loans and attempts by foreigners to invest, none materialized.) It is now reported that US$4 million from the loan will be used to construct a large-scale machinery factory in Xicun, Guangzhou, and the Ministry of Communications will allocate some mechanical equipment. In addition, a large locomotive factory will be built in Hengyang, preparing to manufacture locomotives and all accessories. Furthermore, it will cooperate with the Resources Committee to operate the Gouyadong and Zhuzhou coal mines to solve the fuel problem.

The specific decisions for the entire plan are still pending Director Du Zhenyuan's discussions with the transportation authorities in Nanjing. However, everyone seems to have the confidence that "Even if American aid does not come, in order to ensure the smooth operation of this major artery of China, although it will be more difficult, we will still have a plan and do it better!" (Reported by our correspondent Liang Xiaozhong)

It was later learned that it was a misunderstanding, but it had already caused a scare.

### Sufficient Troops and Food to Strengthen the Suppression of the Rebellion: Fujian Organizes Team Police to Cultivate Land

[Airmail report from our Fuzhou office on the 9th] The Fujian Provincial Security Authorities recently decided to implement a security team police land cultivation system to cooperate with the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and establish a foundation of sufficient food and troops. Currently, each county and city government is investigating the following three types of land within its jurisdiction: (1) Local public property that has been cleared and lacks tenants; (2) Public wasteland that has not been claimed; (3) Private wasteland whose owners have lost contact, resulting in no one cultivating or being able to cultivate it. The county and city governments will then coordinate with the local team police and landowners or their agents to sign lease agreements and cultivate the land. However, this work should not interfere with the original duties of the team police. It is planned that each company or platoon will be a production unit, with each team police officer occupying five fen of farmland in principle. All income will be used exclusively for the welfare of officers and soldiers of each unit. It is believed that after this work is completed, not only will the funding for the security teams in each county be supplemented, but also military discipline and border security can be improved.

[Report from our Zhenjiang office on the 9th] The Jiangsu Construction Bureau convened the heads of construction from Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, and representatives from various industries on the 26th of last month in Zhenjiang to discuss the dredging of the Jiangnan Canal. It was decided to establish the Jiangnan Canal Dredging Engineering Committee to be responsible for design and implementation. It has now been decided to hold the first Engineering Committee meeting in Zhenjiang on the 13th to discuss the engineering implementation plan. The Construction Bureau has separately notified the representatives of the four counties to go to Zhenjiang.

### Soldiers Intercept Firewood Boats to Longtoushui Without Reaching Changzhou

[Report from our Wujin office on the 9th] Firewood is scarce in this county recently. Mountain firewood costs 200,000 yuan per load and is still difficult to purchase. The reason is that firewood carriers or boats from rural areas are intercepted by soldiers in the suburbs, who forcibly buy the firewood at low prices. The firewood sellers suffer greatly. Over time, the firewood sellers all hide their goods, and the firewood supply in the city is cut off. Residents are very alarmed. The city defense meeting on the 9th specifically discussed this issue seriously. The firewood industry also issued an appeal, asking the government for assistance. The opinions of all parties advocate severely cracking down on wandering soldiers who intercept, purchase, and resell firewood. The amount of firewood needed by the troops should be supplied by the government in accordance with the evaluation of non-staple food, to avoid disturbances. However, the necessary funding is quite large, and the county government is currently struggling with this.

### Old Oxford University Installs New Atomic Fission Machine

[British News Agency, London, 11th] A new atomic fission machine for research purposes was installed yesterday at Oxford University. The machine, which is quite different from the ordinary type, is named "Betatron" and was donated to the university by the British Samson Horton Company. Its method of generating electrons and its power are far stronger than the machines currently available at Oxford University. It is said that this high-efficiency power will have great value in the treatment of diseases. The extra power is obtained by accelerating the flow of electrons in a ring-shaped hollow tube, which is under vacuum and only one inch in diameter, smaller than the usual type. The miniaturization is a great technical achievement, as the electricity circulates in this small tube one million times without touching the edges. The electron journey is equivalent to traveling 10,000 miles. The machine was completed in May of last year and has since been used by a team of experts from Oxford University assisted by the designers. The research is led by scientist Duke, who spent two and a half years working on the secret atomic bomb experiments at Los Alamos during the war.

### Renyu Beats Chenyou with Rebounding Power

Qingbai Loses to Encas

[Report from this newspaper] In the Basketball Group A League, Donghua defeated Yizhong 36-32 in Group A2B last night, securing the championship. In Group A1, Renyu defeated Chenyou 52-49, and in a Group A1 makeup game, Encas defeated Qingbai 46-41. After the game, several spectators in the stadium approached the referee, accused him, and assaulted him. The Basketball Association is currently investigating. Details of yesterday's games are as follows:

Donghua Beats Yizhong

Donghua of Group A2B is invincible, and last night they defeated Yizhong 36-32. In the first half, both sides focused on defense, 15-8. In the second half, 21-24, Yizhong's strength can also be seen. Now Donghua only has one game left against Central Aviation, and the Group A2B championship is no longer in question.

Renyu Beats Chenyou

The first game in Group A1, Renyu vs. Chenyou, was evenly matched. In the first half, 28-26, Chenyou was only behind by two points. The game was fiercely contested throughout, with Renyu having a slight advantage.

The situation remained the same in the second half, and both sides were quite confident in their shooting skills. If the two teams could combine their organizations, it would not be difficult to form a good team. In terms of technology and age, there is hope, but unfortunately, it is feared that the two sides will not be able to cooperate successfully in terms of spirit.

In the last three minutes, two of Chenyou's main players had already fouled out five times and left the court, but their combat effectiveness did not diminish at all. As a result, Renyu won by a narrow margin of 52-49.

Encas Beats Qingbai

The second game in Group A1 last night was Qingbai vs. Encas. The previous game ended at 7:45 PM, and this game did not start until 7:55 PM due to disputes over the referee. Cai Yanxiong's free throw and Chen Xianglong's shot easily scored five points. Through the efforts of Encas's Bao Lai'ao and Chai Liao, they gradually closed in. Zhou Dayun also scored from a distance, and Qingbai took an 11-8 lead within ten minutes. Suddenly, the score was tied 11-11, and the game became even more intense. However, after the score was tied at 18-18, the foreign team stood out, and Encas led 24-20 in the first half.

In the second half, Qingbai replaced Chen Xianglong with Zhang Shaoqing, and Encas also made changes. When Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Yaoyun scored consecutively, the other side was quite flustered. Soon, the foreign team was successful again, and both armies moved fiercely. As a result, Encas defeated Qingbai 46-41. As soon as the game ended, some spectators in the stadium accused and attacked the referee, Yang Liecheng. The authorities are investigating. The atmosphere in the stadium has recently seemed better than in the past, but it is a pity that this incident occurred.

### Tricky Problems in School Administration: Student Guidance in Today's Universities

— Sun Daoyuan

Among the most difficult and tricky problems in today's university administration, none is perhaps more so than guiding a group of uninhibited university students to behave properly. This guidance work cannot be done well by abstract theorists. Only those who are excellent in both knowledge, experience, and character can be competent and happy. The author has been engaged in university student guidance for many years and now specifically reveals some opinions on the current situation of student guidance in universities, seeking advice from experts.

(1) What is Student Guidance?

Anyone who is practically engaged in or studies university student guidance understands that human education is a continuous development process, with no absolute boundaries between large and small or high and low. However, in order to make the opening of education suitable for the differences in human physiological development from small to large; psychological development from subtle to obvious; and intellectual improvement from low to high, the entire course of education is divided into three levels, large, medium, and small, for teaching.

The three-level education process can be said to be a routine in China and abroad, and consistent throughout ancient and modern times. It is indeed in full harmony with the three movements of life from childhood to adulthood, and from adulthood to old age. Therefore, regardless of whether it is primary, secondary, or university, each has its own distinct timeliness, making people know at a glance: This is the towering highest institution of learning, and that is the children's paradise. This unique school spirit cultivation is the goal of our implementation of "guidance." Although all levels of schools uniformly adopt class teaching, the implementation of "guidance" has different characteristics.

Each Has a Different Internal Quality

From the surface, the implementation of guidance in primary, secondary, and universities is largely the same, with no obvious differences. But from its essence, each has a different internal quality. If we talk about the role of "guidance": primary school is biased towards "nurturing," secondary school is biased towards "managing," and university is biased towards "guiding"; if we talk about the spirit of "guidance": primary school focuses on "love," secondary school focuses on "strictness," and university focuses on "virtue"; in other words, primary school is benevolent "education," secondary school is hegemonic "training," and university is kingly "guidance." Furthermore, in terms of the purpose of implementing guidance: "nurturing" is to help growth, "managing" is to standardize, and "guiding" is to promote self-government. Therefore, the forms of guidance at all levels are different, primary school is "nurturing," secondary school is "hard management," and university is "demonstration."

From the previous analysis, we can know that primary school education is a teacher's problem. With a good teacher, you can nurture good students; secondary school is a problem for both teachers and students. Not only must there be good teachers, but also good students, so that "guidance" can achieve satisfactory results. But university is different. All the achievements of "guidance" depend entirely on the quality of the students. If the students are of good quality, everyone can consciously be a person, automatically learn, and autonomously manage. In this way, why worry about not being able to cultivate a beautiful school spirit and achieve the ideal realm of university guidance? Therefore, the success or failure of university guidance depends entirely on whether students can be conscious, automatic, and autonomous; conversely, the goal of university guidance is to promote and guide students to be conscious, automatic, and autonomous.

Let Him Develop Freely

However, why should different guidance methods be adopted? The reason is that the objects of guidance at all levels are different. For example, primary school students who are growing up are just stepping onto the starting point of the road to adulthood. Not only are they not sound themselves, but everything outside themselves is very vague. They must be nurtured as "adults" at all times, so that they can grow naturally and healthily. However, secondary school students who have undergone six years of primary school education can speak and act freely. Not only can they know everything about people outside of themselves, but they also have a curious mind and the courage to experiment. Therefore, a young person in secondary school is at an age of divergent thoughts and unrestrained behavior; it can also be said that he is at the crossroads of life, which is dangerous and the most hopeful time. Once he goes astray, it will be irreparable. At this most critical juncture in life, only strict discipline can make him conform to the norm. Once a university student has undergone six years of basic secondary school education, the foundation for being a person has been largely established. Only a little guidance from the side is needed, and he can be conscious and self-motivated. Therefore, university students can be allowed to develop and enrich themselves freely in order to complete themselves. Therefore, perfect university education is developed on the basis of sound secondary school education.

(2) How to Implement University Student Guidance?

We understand that the focus of university student guidance is to influence people with virtue and to promote student self-government. It is neither as loving as to primary school students nor as strict as to secondary school students.

Rely on Cooperation

However, how do we implement university student guidance? This is a difficult question to answer. But I think that anyone who is currently engaged in university student guidance work will feel that the success or failure of today's university student guidance is not simply a matter of a university's entire student guidance office setting up various groups for life management, extracurricular activities, sports and hygiene, and its own organization. Because the entire student guidance office of a university is just an organizational structure for handling daily student guidance administrative affairs; in other words, it can only do the passive work of student guidance. As for the active student guidance, it is necessary for all the professors who stand in front of the students every day to cooperate, so that it can be effective. (To be continued)

It is learned that the committee has decided that from March 12 of this year, in all areas where the committee has offices, all cotton transportation and transit must be transferred in accordance with the committee's cotton transportation certificate in accordance with regulations. The committee issued instructions to its Nantong, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, Yin County, Jiangyin, and Wu County offices and also sent letters to the Inspectorate General of Customs, Jinling Customs, Guangdong and Zhejiang Maritime Customs, the General Bureau of Highways of the Ministry of Communications, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, and the Yuehan Railway Administration to assist in handling the matter.

[Also reported] In order to implement cotton grading and inspection, the Yarn Management Committee specially organized a cotton grading and inspection committee. After active preparations, most of the candidates for the committee have been determined. Ye Yuanding, consultant of the committee, also serves as the director of the committee. Di Fuyu, a specialist of the Textile Construction Company, serves as the deputy director of the committee. Pan Jianliang, director of the Procurement and Transportation Department, Liu Wenteng, director of the Manufacturing Department, and Tang Yushu, deputy director of the Technology Department, serve as committee members. Most of the staff are transferred from various departments of the Yarn Management Committee. It is said that the office location is temporarily borrowed from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau.

### Although Prices Briefly Decreased During the Day, Yarn Prices Rose Again Upon Closing; Demand for Cotton Cloth Is Strong and High-End Goods Are Fluctuating

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was led by customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions buying in succession, and off-market absorption was also strong, so the market was quite firm. However, due to tight credit, some traders who were short of funds sold slightly at high prices, and prices briefly decreased during the day. Afterwards, strong players saw low prices and took in goods, and arbitrage transactions between spot and futures markets were active, taking the opportunity to move, and the price increase trend in the market re-ignited.

In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose another 12 million compared to the previous day, closing at a new high price of 180 million. Bao Guang and Jincheng yarn also rose by 10 million to 12 million, and various other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 4-5 million to 6-7 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened in the morning with various goods fluctuating at high levels. After 10:00 AM, news spread that the Textile Construction Company was supplying and selling Longtou fine cloth, and it was also heard that yarn prices had fallen, so owners successively sold off goods, and bids slightly decreased. Around 11:00 AM, favorable buying news spread frequently, and with the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the black market for gold and cash jumping, off-market speculative funds arrived in abundance, and buyers came to absorb them, so the market suddenly saw a surge, and new high prices emerged endlessly.

In the end, 12-pound Longtou Caiqiu and other fine cloths rose another 270,000 to 350,000, and Longtou was bid up to 3.82 million, but there were few sales. In addition, wool serge, tribute drill, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Yuanbu shilin cloth all rose sharply.

Also reported: The Textile Construction Company supplied and sold 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, quoted at 3.62 million, and there were buyers absorbing at a premium of 120,000 to 130,000 in the off-market. Four Gentlemen Wool Serge was 3.165 million, and there were also people buying in at a premium of 50,000 to 80,000, and there were many applicants.

### Influx of Speculative Capital Drives Hua Stock Prices Higher: Another New High Yesterday

Yesterday, Hua stocks experienced a surge in activity, with an influx of speculative capital leading to eleven stocks hitting their daily limit. New high prices were frequently recorded, creating a heated and excited atmosphere. However, Yong Yarn's initial surge was followed by some wavering, and a trend of shifting profits into miscellaneous stocks is emerging, with the expectation that this trend will intensify. The market opened high in the morning due to news of the establishment of the Central Counter and the temporary shelving of the American loan proposal.

Guangdong merchants and foreign businesses were actively buying, while only securities firms and retail investors were selling. Compared to the previous closing price, rubber stocks, steel, and paper stocks each rose by 20%, while the remaining stocks also rose by 10% to 15%.

### India Suspends Temporary Ban on Importing Raw Silk for Processing and Export

Last year, in order to earn foreign exchange, the Central Bank led the China Trust Bureau, China Silk Corporation, silk weaving industry, and other relevant units to organize a silk weaving production and sales coordination association. The government purchased raw silk for processing and export, weaving 100,000 bolts of silk fabrics for sale to India. This year, the plan was to process 250,000 bolts for sale to India. Tang Xixiang, Deputy General Manager of China Silk Corporation, traveled to Beijing some days ago to consult with the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It has been learned that the government has recently decided to temporarily suspend processing and export to India due to special domestic and international prices and India's import ban. The 420 bales recently transacted by the China Trust Bureau have had their import deadline extended to the 15th of this month.

### Tight Credit Market, Slow Retail Sales; Rice Prices Rise Sharply, Then Retreat Slightly; Limited Supply of Edible Oil, Prices Increase Gradually

After a sharp rise in rice prices, there was a slight retreat yesterday. The closing price on the previous day already showed signs of fatigue, so the market opened lower yesterday. This was because the price of tin ingots had been set, the credit market was very tight, and retail sales at rice stores were slow due to the widespread distribution of household rice. With sluggish store sales, traders were even less willing to add inventory. Those who needed cash frequently sold their holdings.

Except for the special grade white粳 rice in the North City market, which remained firm at 30,000 yuan, all other rice prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. In the South City market, white粳 rice was priced at 3.65 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Early and thin rice varieties each decreased by 50,000 yuan, and except for the high-priced Gaoyang秈 rice, other 秈 rice varieties also decreased by 50,000 yuan. White元 rice retreated to 3.8 million yuan, while the special high-grade粳 rice in the North City market remained at the original price of 3.85 million yuan. As the market neared closing, the weather turned rainy, strengthening market sentiment slightly and stabilizing prices.

Flour

Fluctuations were narrow, resulting in a slightly lower price compared to the previous day. The decline in rice prices had some impact on market sentiment, coupled with the tight credit market and ample supplies from the factories.

Lao Che flour opened at 1.48 million yuan, later retreating to 1.475 million yuan. The delivered price was 1.48 million yuan. Bing Chuan flour opened at 1.47 million yuan, closing at 1.46 million yuan, with warehouse receipts lower by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Red Bee and Jian Cheng were slightly weaker by about 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jian Cheng reached a high of 1.46 million yuan, closing at 1.445 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour still had considerable retail sales. Peacock's delivered price was 1.465 million yuan. Bran was weak and unable to recover, with large bags closing 10,000 yuan lower than the previous day.

Grains

Prices were flat initially, then strengthened. Due to the decline in rice prices, market sentiment was initially very weak, resulting in a flat opening. Soybean prices were not low in the producing areas, so owners were reluctant to sell, resulting in prices barely holding at the mouse price at the opening. Later, it was heard that oil cakes had risen in price, so oil mills came to buy them. Hankou乍豆 opened at 1.8 million yuan, with the final transaction price at 1.88 million yuan (purchased by Tong Shen Tai Oil Mill), an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Che Dou opened at 2 million yuan, but later purchases were not possible. Pinghu特粗 saw a new high price of 2.38 million yuan.

Corn was initially weak, but later Qingdao traders came to buy, raising prices by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Green beans were purchased by indigenous traders, with limited inventory, rising by over 100,000 yuan. Picked green was flat and weak. Sesame Tianjin traders did not purchase, with only yellow vine and milk hemp rising by 50,000 yuan, while white hemp remained flat. Although Guangdong traders purchased peanuts, the quantity was not large, and prices also rose by about 200,000 yuan, with high-quality peanuts rising by 300,000 yuan. Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, and the market is closed for one day.

Edible Oil

Prices rose sharply at the opening, due to a decrease in supply and high production costs. Furthermore, due to the sharp rise in prices of other goods outside the industry, holders were generally reluctant to sell at lower prices. Also, due to the market being closed today, many retailers pre-stocked, so sales were still active.

Previously closed positions were opened first. Da You soybean oil rose from 7.05 million yuan, increasing step by step, reaching a high of 7.25 million yuan, and closing at 7.2 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, factories such as Da Tong and Chang De opened at 7.2 million yuan, with Ji Tong raw oil opening at a high of 8 million yuan. Qingdao Ji Tong raw oil opened at 8.2 million yuan, and Jiangbei Ji Tong raw oil opened at 8.2 million yuan, each rising by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Raw and cooked vegetable oils each rose by about 200,000 yuan. Ji Tong small-wheeled sesame oil opened at 7.7 million yuan, immediately reaching the 8 million yuan mark, an increase of 400,000 yuan. Shantou traders purchased bean cakes, raising prices by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] The Isthmian Steamship Company's Steamer Eads arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with over 11,000 bags of rice and over 1,060 large barrels of tobacco leaves from San Francisco. It is currently berthed at the Gong He Xiang Wharf for unloading.

### Tea Merchants Discuss Loan Issues: This Year's Exported Tea May Reach 360,000 Dan

The China Tea Association, recognizing the importance of this year's tea loan issues, specially convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday, gathering the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association, the Shanghai Tea Trade Commercial Association, the first and second district Tea Manufacturing Industry Association, and representatives from producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, at the Bank Club in the city. The meeting discussed in detail the number of tea loans applied for by each tea merchant, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of (A) production loans, (B) sight loans, and (C) order loans. The meeting was chaired by the association's chairman, Shou Jingwei. Nine individuals, including Shou Jingwei, Sun Xiaocun, Zhu Huiqing, Zeng Yuchen, Tang Jisan, Song Qifan, Fang Junqiang, Wu Juenong, and Huang Yantang, were selected to devise practical measures and negotiate with those in charge of export trade and tea loan financing. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

[Further Report] According to knowledgeable sources in the tea industry, this year's exported tea may reach 360,000 dan, including 90,000 dan of black tea, 150,000 dan of green tea, and 120,000 dan of Taiwanese tea. Based on the current foreign exchange market price, total exports could generate over 20 million US dollars.

[Further Report] According to the China Tea Association's estimate, this year's tea production in each region is as follows: Pingshui green tea 70,000 dan, Qimen black tea 10,000 dan, Wenzhou black tea 7,000 dan, Hekou black tea 3,000 dan, Tunxi green tea 30,000 dan, Fujian green tea 25,000 dan, Fujian black tea 25,000 dan, and 10,000 dan from other producing areas, totaling 241,000 dan. If the purchase price is calculated at 5 shi of rice per dan, and 3 million yuan per dan of rice, the total capital required is over 360 billion yuan.

### Cigarette Prices Soar Wildly

Yesterday's cigarette market saw chaotic price quotations, with the market experiencing a shortage of supply. Various cigarettes reached new highs. Ten-packs of British cigarettes broke through the 90 million yuan barrier, soaring to 95.5 million yuan at closing, a staggering increase of 11.2 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes broke through the 80 million yuan barrier, reaching a high of 84 million yuan, also an increase of 11.15 million yuan. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by about 5% to 20%.

### Paper Industry Not Worried About Shortages, Self-Sufficiency to Be Achieved This Year

The monthly consumption of cigarette paper in this city was previously surveyed to be about 120,000 reams. The cigarette paper produced by the Minfeng Paper Factory in Jiaxing, which is affiliated with the Minfeng Paper Company in this city, is the only high-quality domestic product, with a monthly output of 30,000 reams, far short of market demand. The Export Control Commission had no choice but to approve the import of American cigarette paper to make up for the shortfall. Knowing the country's foreign exchange difficulties, the Minfeng Factory has been repeatedly urged by the government to do everything possible. A machine that was previously stored in Hong Kong was shipped to Hebei. The trial production results were excellent, and manufacturing has now begun. It is estimated that the monthly output can be increased by 30,000 reams, bringing the total monthly output to 60,000 reams. However, this is still insufficient to meet the actual needs, and the Minfeng Factory's power equipment is limited, making it impossible to add more paper machines in the short term. It has recently been learned that the company has opened up new avenues for increased production. Two cigarette paper machines will be installed in its sister factory, the Huafeng Paper Factory in Hangzhou. One of these machines is expected to be in production in June or July. The other machine will be put into production within the year after the construction of the new factory building is completed. These two machines can also produce 60,000 reams per month. In total, the two factories can produce 120,000 reams per month, which is sufficient to meet the actual needs of the market. Before the Huafeng Paper Factory in Hangzhou can produce cigarette paper, the total number of paper reams imported in the fourth quarter, as reported by the Tobacco Industry Daily, is over 210,000, with an average of 70,000 reams per month. Adding the 60,000 reams produced by Minfeng each month, the number is already sufficient to meet the needs of various factories in this city, and there is absolutely no fear of shortage at present. Furthermore, as a result of the efforts of Minfeng and Huafeng factories, self-sufficiency can be achieved within the year. Under the national policy of conserving foreign exchange and advocating the use of domestic goods, this is indeed good news for the economic and industrial sectors.

### Cement Industry Needs Paper Bags, Please Specify the Amount of US Dollars

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the economic reform plan, the National Cement Association plans to request the authorities to specify the amount of US dollars allowed for importing paper bags each month based on the actual output of cement factories nationwide, so as to increase production and facilitate exports. The association has recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, National Economic Council, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Central Bank, and Export Control Commission. The original submission stated: It is expected that by the end of June this year, the total national cement production can be drastically increased to 195,850 metric tons per month. The monthly need for paper bags will reach a staggering 3,917,000 pieces. However, the current price for paper bags ordered from the United States is approximately US$0.15 per piece. According to the total national cement production at the end of June this year, the monthly foreign exchange required is no more than US$587,000. If the overseas market can be opened up as desired, assuming that 1 million bags of cement are shipped out each month, calculated at US$1.50 per bag F.O.B., the foreign exchange income would be three times that amount. Therefore, it is hoped that the amount of US dollars allowed for import each month will be specified to facilitate production.

### Sino-Australian Trade Agreement to Be Officially Announced Tomorrow

[Reported by this newspaper] The Sino-Australian trade agreement has been signed some days ago and will be officially announced tomorrow. It is understood that the agreement stipulates that goods worth up to A$100 can be freely exported. Goods exceeding that value will require an export permit issued by the Export Control Commission before being cleared. It is hoped that smuggling between Australia and Hong Kong will be eliminated after the agreement is implemented.

### Commercial Briefs

The Gold Control Bureau has notified various commercial firms and banks that overdrafts for their clients must not be easily accommodated. Once it is discovered that any firm or bank is not complying with the regulations and is casually providing overdrafts to illegitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, severe penalties will be imposed.

The textile machinery production and manufacturing conference is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the 12th) at 9:00 AM at No. 27 Dihua Road. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian has decided to personally attend the conference in Shanghai, and up to forty experts will be in attendance.

In order to crack down on privately established radio stations and encourage whistleblowing, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau previously stipulated that a reward of 20 million yuan should be given for cases cracked by military and police agencies. In cases where there is an informant, half of the amount, 10 million yuan, will be paid to the informant. It is learned that the Financial Management Bureaus in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou have found that this measure to encourage whistleblowing has been quite effective and have also implemented it as an example.

Regarding the measures to crack down on hoarding newspapers, the City Chamber of Commerce previously requested an extension of the implementation period. It is learned that the city government has explicitly rejected the request. After receiving the order, the Chamber of Commerce has informed its members to comply.

Huaxin Woolen Company, a giant in the woolen industry, is currently holding a major sale from the 10th of this month to thank new and old customers. It is heard that the sale will only last for a few more days.

### Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit: Importers and Exporters Request Combining Use in the Next Quarter

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association stated that the original plan for the special foreign currency certificates of deposit was to start being used in the fourth quarter. Due to procedural reasons, they have not yet been issued. It is stipulated that after the issuance, the amount that could have been offset starting from the fourth quarter can be used together in the next quarter. A telegram was sent to the Central Bank and the Import and Export Management Committee, with the following original text: "We have reviewed the Import and Export Management Committee's Announcement No. 7, Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for Handling Unlicensed Foreign Exchange Arrivals and Cargo Shipments, Article 5: 'Registered qualified importers, starting from November of this year, may use the aforementioned special foreign currency certificates of deposit to borrow one-sixth of the face value of foreign exchange from the Central Bank each quarter to pay for import goods within their quota.' We believe that 'starting from November,' as referred to in this article, actually includes starting from the fourth quarter quota, a fact that your representatives and others mutually agreed upon during previous consultations with you. However, since the beginning of purchasing and distribution of these foreign exchange arrival goods, due to the various procedural relationships involved in reviewing, approving, purchasing, distributing, and submitting various procedures, not a single one of these special foreign currency certificates of deposit has been issued to this day. And the fourth quarter quota has long been completed; bills of exchange have also been issued one after another, and no importer has been able to use these certificates of deposit to offset the fourth quarter quota of foreign exchange. This association has repeatedly received requests from its members to respectfully request that you understand the difficulties of the business community and consider the facts, and formally stipulate that these special foreign currency certificates of deposit can be used to offset and borrow from the fourth quarter onwards. If there are situations where the certificates of deposit are not received before the fourth and fifth quarters due to purchasing and distribution procedures, making it impossible to offset them, then in the next quarter's quota, the amount that could have been used and borrowed in previous quarters can be used together to offset and borrow, so as to comply with the law and avoid disputes. This request, although inherently justified, requires an explicit order for its implementation. Therefore, we specially telegraph the facts and respectfully request your approval for public announcement and implementation to benefit the business community."

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Returning from the National Medical Association Conference

— Liang Junqing

I, along with several senior doctors from Shanghai, attended the Second National Physicians' Association Joint Conference in Nanjing for three days. I saw and heard many things and had many feelings, and I wanted to write them down. However, because it concerns the conference and is not related to this publication, I will temporarily keep it to myself and wait for another opportunity. Alas, yellow bells and clay pots are all over the world, so why should I, as a simple individual, offer my shallow opinions and seek approval from others? Therefore, I will take a different approach and gather what is related to medicine and pharmaceuticals, hoping that it will also be appreciated by the readers.

(1) Minister Zhou's Cautionary Words: At the beginning of the conference, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Health gave an opening speech with cautionary words: "The most successful countries in the world in terms of healthcare are the Nordic countries, where the average lifespan is around 65 years. In our country, due to poor sanitation facilities and high infant mortality rates, the average lifespan has been reduced to around 30 years. In fact, a person's career begins around the age of 40. If the average lifespan of our people is so short, how can we compete with European and American countries? This requires the assistance of the national medical and pharmaceutical community." These words are truly to the point and full of earnestness. Not only must all of us in the medical community work together to assist the health authorities, but also the general public must be vigilant, take good care of themselves, and not bring shame upon the name of "Sick Man of East Asia."

(2) Lamentations of Domestic Western Medicine Manufacturers: I am very grateful for the lavish hospitality of the domestic Western medicine manufacturers at this conference. However, Dr. Yang, director of the Yang Chemical Research Institute, gave a sorrowful speech: "Most of the Western medicines used in our country are imported. Although some Chinese people have established pharmaceutical factories to produce Western medicines themselves, due to the deep-rooted habit of Chinese people to worship Western medicines, they only know how to purchase imported products and do not promote domestic Western medicines. This has led to the inability of domestic Western medicines to develop, which is truly regrettable." In fact, domestic Western medicines are not inferior to imported ones. It is the slavish mentality of worshiping imported goods that has led to the rejection of good domestic Western medicines, which is truly heartbreaking. Nowadays, the country is facing difficulties, and foreign exchange is often unavailable for purchase. Moreover, the world is currently in a precarious state. If there is another World War III, then all imported Western medicines will certainly be unavailable for purchase, wouldn't that leave the sick to die? Therefore, as a precaution, we must do our best to support the development of domestic Western medicines within the scope of possibility. In the future, with continuous improvement and soaring development, who knows if they will not surpass imported products? I sincerely hope for the awakening of the medical and pharmaceutical community and the national people of our country.

(3) The Benefits of Travel: I have been living in Shanghai, a city surrounded by an environment of chaos and danger. Not only am I getting gray hair easily and aging quickly, but I am also exhausted mentally and physically, making it difficult to achieve longevity. I stayed in Nanjing for only three days, but due to the change of environment, my spirit was revitalized and my appetite was enhanced. I used to have trouble sleeping and would wake up easily, but now I fall asleep as soon as I go to bed and sleep soundly until dawn, which is completely different from before. This is truly a gift from travel. I sincerely hope that people in Shanghai will take short trips during the pleasant days of spring and autumn, and their gains will definitely outweigh their losses.

(4) The Harms of Travel: Although travel has many benefits for our bodies, it also has its harms. When we live in one place for a long time, we become accustomed to the climate changes there and are not affected by them. However, once we travel, it is difficult to adapt to the climate of a different place. As a result, we may catch a disease. However, the most harmful thing to our bodies is sunlight. According to recent medical reports, the substances in the human body can have different tolerance levels and therefore react differently to sunlight. Some people die of heatstroke after traveling in the sun for one or two hours. Others develop dermatitis or herpes after being exposed to the sun for one or two hours (Dr. Wu Tianmin's skin became inflamed immediately after being exposed to the sun, and I personally witnessed his inflammation after being exposed to the sun during this trip to Nanjing). Still others, who usually have fair complexions, immediately turn black after being exposed to the sun. All of these are related to sunlight. If we are not adequately prepared beforehand, then traveling in the sun will not only fail to benefit us but will actually harm us, which is truly not worth it.

According to reports from Mr. Mauderli and Mr. Magg of Switzerland, during the course of pulmonary tuberculosis, patients often experience fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, insomnia, and palpitations. Many people believe this is due to the patient's physical weakness and prescribe various tonics, but the results are not only ineffective but even worsen the underlying condition. In fact, the aforementioned symptoms of night sweats and insomnia are due to autonomic nervous dysfunction. The use of medications that regulate the autonomic nervous system (such as Bellergal from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals) can be very effective.

(2) The Danger of Children Swallowing Objects While Playing

According to a report in the Hungarian Pediatrics Journal of February last year, a six-year-old child suddenly cried inconsolably while playing. When his parents asked why, he said he had swallowed a nail. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. However, repeated X-ray examinations in the hospital failed to find any foreign object in his abdomen. It was thought that the child might be lying, so he was sent home. However, shortly after returning home, the child suddenly developed a high fever and gradually showed symptoms of pneumonia and pleurisy, which lasted for a long time without recovery. He was then sent to Hungary's largest pediatric hospital for treatment. As a result, an X-ray revealed a piece of glass, about 33 millimeters long, lodged in the bifurcation of his left bronchus. However, because the foreign object had been inhaled into the trachea for four months, granulation tissue had grown around it, making it difficult to remove. Only specialized instruments could be used to extract it. The child's trachea had developed severe chronic inflammation due to the long-term presence of the foreign object. Fortunately, large doses of penicillin were able to cure him.

(3) The Establishment of a Corneal Bank in New York

According to the Vienna Medical Weekly published in August of last year, a corneal bank has been established in New York City to meet the needs of those suffering from corneal opacity. It is reported that recently, five thousand blind patients have regained their sight after corneal transplantation.

(4) The Filterable Virus of Infantile Paralysis (Poliomyelitis)

According to a report from Stanford University in California, it is now possible to completely analyze the filterable virus of infantile paralysis using ultramicroscopic examination methods. It is said that this filterable virus is a protein-like substance with a diameter of approximately 25 microns (one micron equals one-thousandth of a millimeter). Based on this discovery, it will be possible to develop a preventative vaccine in the future. It is noted that this disease has recently been discovered in Shanghai. It initially presents with high fever, vomiting, coma, convulsions, and excessive sweating. If death does not occur within two or three days, the patient gradually recovers but develops paralysis, such as the inability to move one hand or arm, or one foot or leg. This condition is very difficult to treat, and even with treatment, it takes a long time to recover. Its contagiousness is also very high. If a preventative vaccine can be injected, it would be of great benefit to the citizens of Shanghai.

(5) International Conference on Rheumatism in September Last Year

In September of last year, an international conference on rheumatism was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The content included detailed reviews of "The cause and development of infectious rheumatic arthritis," "Treatment issues for infectious rheumatic arthritis," "The significance of rheumatism's threat to humanity," and "Climatic factors in rheumatism." I will write about the details when I have time.

### Sending Off Dr. Wang Juerong Abroad

— Ma Dian

Dr. Wang Juerong is a medical doctor from Aurora University. He has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years, but I had no opportunity to meet him, until about a year ago, when he began serving in our Medical Association. In the past eleven months, we have had many opportunities to talk, and I deeply admire not only his outstanding knowledge and quick wit, but also his spirit of service, which is unmatched by ordinary people. Dr. Wang is inherently hardworking. He runs a clinic, manages a pharmacy, heads a hospital, and directs a pharmaceutical factory. He usually navigates between different social classes, and he already spends his time busily. Yet, he still serves the city of Shanghai: organizing the affairs of the Medical Association, establishing a location for the Medical News Agency, and, when medical disputes arise, he always takes the lead, personally participating in forensic examinations and public notarization, even neglecting sleep and forgetting to eat, showing such courage and righteousness. Moreover, Dr. Wang is hardworking, uncomplaining, and doesn't take credit for his success. His sincerity in sacrificing for the public is enough to inspire the world and reform bad customs. It is not only the medical community that is moved by this. Last fall, Dr. Wang was selected by the Ministry of Education of our friendly country, France, and will soon be going abroad for further study. Of course, his existing domestic businesses must be temporarily entrusted to others. However, his enthusiasm for handling multiple responsibilities will be difficult for anyone to replicate! Therefore, Dr. Wang's departure is something to celebrate privately, but there is also a sense of regret publicly! Now that the day of departure is approaching, I would like to follow the ancient custom of expressing feelings on paper and use a corner of this publication to offer a farewell. The disorder of medical affairs and hygiene in China today cannot be denied. There are many reasons for this, but the lack of a proper medical administration is a serious problem. In recent decades, the country has not cultivated genuine medical administration talents who are willing to sacrifice for the public good. The difficulty of putting medical administration on the right track should not be blamed! Therefore, I hope that Dr. Wang, in addition to studying new medical knowledge to further develop his existing businesses, will also devote some time to studying medical administration abroad, learn from their successes and failures, and contribute his findings to the country. I predict that he, who has previously served the entire Shanghai community, will serve the entire national community in the future, and benefiting the entire Chinese nation will not be difficult! Farewell, Dr. Wang, take care, take care!

### A Brief Discussion on Infantile Hematemesis and Melena

— Wu Manqing

Infantile hematemesis and melena is a rare disease, the cause of which has not yet been fully understood. I still remember that Walter Nischer (a famous German pathologist, who was the director of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Rostock in Germany before the war and once served as a professor of pathology at Tongji University Medical School. His superb knowledge and great personality are still praised by early Tongji graduates) once advocated, "If we encounter such patients in the future, we must conduct a detailed examination to thoroughly understand the cause." This aroused my interest, and I will now describe the recent research findings as follows:

Regarding the origin of the name Infantile Hematemesis and Melena (Melaena Neonatorum), we can trace it back to the writings of the Western philosopher Hippocrates, who wrote about this disease as early as 400 years BC (see De Marbis H, 73) and called it Marfus niger Hippokrates. According to Kleler's later interpretation, infantile hematemesis and melena is a disease of the gastrointestinal tract in children that causes a lot of bleeding. It occurs mostly in the first few days or weeks of a child's life. The symptoms are severe vomiting and diarrhea, with the vomited or diarrheal matter being blood, blood clots, or black, lumpy substances (blood turns black when it comes into contact with stomach acid). The bleeding usually occurs within the first one or two days of a child's life, and the latest it can occur is the eighteenth day after birth.

The most severe bleeding often leads to death within 48 hours due to excessive blood loss. However, according to Nleischmano's report, there have also been cases of children suffering from this disease and dying as late as seventeen days later. Anders traced the medical literature back to 1885 and found only 48 cases of this disease. According to Hecker's report, about one in five hundred newborns may suffer from it. However, according to Gennrich's statistics, about one in one thousand deliveries in the obstetrics hospitals of Berlin, Germany, encounters this disease.

Regarding the cause of this disease, opinions vary. Ruge believed that there are two causes: one is a systemic disease, such as syphilis, bacterial infection, or acute fatty degeneration. The other is a local cause, such as circulatory disorders in the local area or ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract. However, clinical reports show that the so-called ulcers can also occur in surviving newborns. According to Prof. DR. Entz's report, about 100% of ulcerative patients he investigated and statistically analyzed had ulcers in the duodenum, and they were all very weak children with malnutrition. Based on the opinions of the above-mentioned gentlemen, a conclusion can be drawn: "Infantile hematemesis and melena is mostly caused by ulcers in the stomach, intestines, lower esophagus, and upper part of the pylorus. The direct cause of the ulcer, as well as the location and time of occurrence, are not yet fully understood."

Spiegelberg believed that the ulcer occurred as early as in the womb. Landau did not agree, and he strongly argued that the occurrence of this disease is due to "the fact that the respiratory function of the child is not completely normal after birth, because the air in the lungs has not yet expanded, and the Ductus Botalli and umbilical vein, which originally connected the pulmonary artery and the aorta, develop thrombosis. The thrombus then migrates into the arteries, and finally, this migrating thrombus tightly blocks the arteries between the pancreas and the duodenum, thus causing ulcers." V. Frauque believed that the above-mentioned theory of regressive thrombosis is quite reasonable. The effect of thrombosis can cause spastic obstruction of blood vessels (Embelisce Gefanversperrumg), and the obstruction of blood vessels can promote ulcers and bleeding in the ulcerated area. At the same time, due to the obstruction, there is stagnation of blood flow, fatigue of the heart, fragility of the blood vessel wall, and abnormal permeability of the blood vessel wall, which can cause a large amount of bleeding and become hematemesis and melena. I once saw a case with very obvious symptoms, which I specially noted here for readers' reference:

"A child was born in the 'second cephalic position'. He had no breathing at birth, and he only breathed after one hour of various artificial respiration resuscitation techniques. However, his face was always blue and purple, and his breathing was very rapid. On the second day, his face became even more blue and purple, his pupils dilated, and his eyes stared like a fighting cock's eyes. The patient fainted several times. Later, the patient had bloody stools, his breathing slowed down, and his temperature rose to 38.3 degrees Celsius. Then, the bloody stools did not stop, and he had a high fever (39.4 degrees Celsius). Finally, he died on the fourth day.

This child weighed 3 kilograms and 20 grams, was 49cm long, had a head circumference of 34cm, and a shoulder width of 35cm. His skin was very pale. The umbilical cord was normal, but there was a segment of about 8cm of umbilical cord protruding, surrounded by yellow-green fluid. Autopsy revealed that both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein had blood clots the thickness of goose feathers adhering to them. The blood clots were dark red and adhered to the blood vessel walls. There were countless small bleeding spots in the pleura and the outer membrane of the myocardium, which did not disappear when pressed with a finger. His spleen was slightly enlarged. His esophagus was the right size, but it was very anemic. There was obvious thrombosis only in the first segment. At the entrance to the stomach, there was a 5mm long and 3mm wide round ulcer, surrounded by hyperemia. The stomach was empty, and the mucosa was not thickened, but there was blood stagnation. Near the pylorus, there was also a large ulcer with a lot of blood accumulation. From the jejunum to the anus, there were many black blood clots, but sometimes there was also liquid blood. "

If we consider the above situation in detail, we can infer that the purulent condition of the umbilical vein of this child can be considered a direct cause of umbilical vascular embolism. If the umbilical vascular embolism causes thrombosis in the area to which it belongs, and even promotes the occurrence of ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, there is also a sufficient reason.

### "Sweep the Snow from Your Own Doorstep"

— Wu Yong

The Shen Bao, from the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty, carried an article titled "Questions and Answers in Shanghai," which recorded a question and answer session between a Westerner and a Chinese person. The Westerner, newly arrived in Shanghai, wandered through the city and saw broken bricks and tiles piled up like mountains at the city gate, with no one to clear them away, and the road was almost blocked. He was quite puzzled by this and asked the Chinese person to clarify the matter. The Chinese person offered various explanations, but the Westerner still couldn't understand it. He continued to ask questions, and the Chinese person became impatient, annoyed by his nosiness, and replied to the Westerner, "You are a foreigner, why bother? As the saying goes, 'Sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on another's roof.' Can you please mind your own business?" The Westerner said, "Ah! If everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, why is the city gate of your esteemed country not taken care of?"

"Sweep the snow from your own doorstep, and don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is an old saying. After examining its meaning, I believe it can have two interpretations. The first interpretation is naturally to tell people not to meddle in other people's affairs, focusing on the second half of the sentence: "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof." This is a passive interpretation. The author believes that in addition to this interpretation, there can also be an active interpretation, which is to shift the focus of the sentence to the first half; in other words, "Sweep the snow from your own doorstep" is to teach people to stick to their own positions and do what they should do.

Most people are probably only familiar with the meaning of the second half of this common saying, and they have neglected the active inspiration of the first half. "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is certainly not objectionable. What does the frost on another person's roof have to do with you? If you insist on interfering, you will inevitably break the tiles on the person's roof, and what good will that do you? This kind of overstepping of one's bounds will only neglect one's own tasks and deviate from one's proper position, and the snow in front of one's own door will be left unattended.

In the current malady, as I personally see it, is that some people are not sweeping the snow from their own doorsteps, but they are abandoning their own tasks and interfering in other people's affairs. Some may say that "Don't worry about the frost on another's roof" is a manifestation of the selfishness and lack of social awareness of the Chinese people. However, if people fulfill their duties and do what they should do, this can lead to a state of "national prosperity and people's peace." What is the use of "social awareness" then? The reason why "social awareness" is needed today is simply because some people in society have not fulfilled their duties and have not done what they should do.

Therefore, "Sweep the snow from your own doorstep" can be used as a motto for everyone. If you go the other way, I will worry about the frost on your roof, and you will sweep the snow in front of my door, the result will inevitably be: the frost cannot be removed, and the snow cannot be cleared, only increasing many unnecessary frictions and disputes. If things go wrong, you may even throw the frost on your roof onto other people's houses, or push the snow in front of your door to your neighbor's door. Looking at the examples of shirking responsibility and blaming each other in society, it is truly countless and everywhere. From individuals to individuals, from organizations to organizations, and even from country to country, there is no place without this kind of "cultivating other people's fields" and "overstepping one's bounds." When disputes arise between each other, they always say that the other party is "actually responsible," and when things break down, they always say that the other party "should bear full responsibility." Few people admit that they are wrong. Take the military buildup as an example. Countries always blame the other party for starting the arms race, so their own country has no choice but to do the same to defend itself. Why not try the opposite approach: first disarm all of our own country's weapons and equipment, and dismiss all of our troops, and see what the other party will do? It is said that British police officers only carry batons and do not carry guns, and the number of British police officers killed by thugs is far less than in the United States. From this, it can be seen that "even thieves have principles," and we do not have to guess at the worst of human nature.

Only pointing out the faults of others and not seeing one's own dereliction of duty are all for the sake of "self." There has never been a greater failure to practice empathy than today—or it seems that it has never been practiced at all. In my opinion, precisely because it has never been practiced at all, there is an increasingly urgent need to implement it immediately today.

### Memory

— Leng Leng

Asa Gray, America's most famous botanist, was able to remember the names of twenty-five thousand plants; Caesar could also remember the names of tens of thousands of his trusted soldiers.

The famous English poet Byron boasted that he could recite all the verses he had written; but on the contrary, Walter Scott's memory was terrible, and he would even forget the poems he had written himself. Once he mistook his own work for one written by Byron and praised it profusely. As for the English essayist and philosopher Bacon, he could write from memory his most famous work without missing a word; but like the American stage star Joseph Jefferson, although he had played in "Rip Van Winkle" for thirteen years, he still often forgot his lines.

Charlie Chaplin had a personal secretary who never left his side for seven years, but the strangest thing is that, according to this secretary, Chaplin still didn't know his name!

Al-Azhar University in Egypt is considered the second largest university in the world. The university's custom is that every year, new students must recite the entire Quran for their entrance exam. This Quran is nearly as long as the New Testament of Christianity, and reciting it once takes at least three days; but every year, more than 20,000 people are able to recite it completely without any omissions. How amazing is this kind of memory!

The memory of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt is also worth praising. When receiving guests, he liked to pay attention to their small details, faces, or actions; once he had seen you, he would never forget you again. Undoubtedly, this was of great help to his political activities and often had unexpected effects. Once, he met a Japanese banker whom he had not seen for fifteen years. To the Japanese banker's surprise, the moment he met him, he began to talk about something they had talked about during their first meeting fifteen years ago.

### Occasional Thoughts on a Spring Outing

— Nian Hong

The weather is nice and warm, and although time and money constraints prevent me from visiting any famous scenic spots, I still have to take a stroll in the nearby suburbs. Accustomed to living in a small room, seeing the open fields and hills once in a while, although not as elegant and interesting as exploring plum blossoms and climbing mountains, already feels interesting and has a different flavor. At least in the countryside, I don't see the detestable and boring merchants, and the simple and hardworking farmers have their own loveliness.

I have very few opportunities to come into contact with the countryside, so of course I don't know what their way of life and content are really like. When I was young, I read the verses of Fan Chengda of the Southern Song Dynasty. In those tranquil words, there was a strong fragrance, writing about the life of farmers, simple and beautiful, and it was very tempting for people who were tired of urban life. Therefore, when I was young, I especially liked Fan Chengda's sixty poems of "Four Seasons of Rural Life," and I imagined a very lovely farm scene in my weak mind, and I even had the ideal of living in the countryside when I grew up. I even particularly liked to eat fresh vegetables, and I had the same hobby of "the rich do not find meat flavorful, but only use vegetables as ordinary dishes," and like Fang Weng's famous sentence: "Birds compete to throw themselves into trees, returning cows know their own homes." Fan's "Mulberry trees are sparse under the spring, edges are full of ridges, cabbage hearts are green and tender, mustard platforms are fat, wash and choose by the stream to sell in the shop, sell salt for wine in the evening," "In the sound of laughter and singing, the light thunder moves, threshing all night until dawn," and other beautiful sentences, I recited them again and again, and I especially loved them.

But later, as I got older and read more books, I began to doubt whether the countryside was so worth longing for. I went to the countryside a few times by chance and felt that there was natural beauty, but "farmhouse fun" was not necessarily the case. Even in the Southern Song Dynasty in Fan Chengda's time, it was not necessarily so beautiful. The "History of the Song Dynasty" also says: "Among the four classes of people, the farmers are the most suffering... Fortunately, there is a harvest, and the debts of the government and private individuals compete with each other, and the grain has not yet been harvested, and the silk has not yet come off the loom, and it is no longer one's own..." Also, "If it is a famine year, there is no grain to sell, and the land cannot be sold, so they kill cattle and sell meat, and cut down mulberry trees for firewood. They cannot afford to think about next year's livelihood." This situation is very different from Fan Chengda's poems. Even earlier, there were many texts writing about the suffering of farmers, such as Chao Cuo's so-called "Men working hard, not enough to provide grain, women spinning, not enough to provide clothes," "Poor people often wear the clothes of cattle and horses, and eat the food of dogs and pigs," and even more familiar, "Happy years end in hardship, and famine years cannot avoid death," which also shows the situation of Chinese farmers for thousands of years, which is completely opposite to the atmosphere of "spring rain is full, seedlings are new, the idle day is long, sleep with the yellow calf, watch the clouds to welcome the wheat field, snow piles of silkworm clusters..." (Xin Qiji's words). The situation in ancient times was like this, and the modern situation has only worsened. Phrases such as "rural bankruptcy" and "rural collapse" are also often heard and seen. The recent news of the suicide of a grain official in the mainland also shows that the average farmer is already like chaff that has been squeezed dry. Du Xunhe once had a poem about a widow, which impressed me the most: "Her husband died in battle to guard the weeds, her clothes were made of hemp and her temples were burnt, mulberry trees were abandoned but she still had to pay taxes, the fields were barren but she still had to collect seedlings, sometimes she picked wild vegetables and cooked them with the roots, and burned fresh firewood with leaves. No matter how deep in the mountains you are, you should have no way to avoid taxes and levies." Another poem from the Five Dynasties: "Sell new silk in February, and sell new grain in May, treat the sores in front of you, and cut out the flesh in your heart," which more fully describes the suffering of farmers. Today's newspapers can also often read communication articles about the lives of farmers, and the miserable situation is unbearable to read.

When a person's original views are overturned and denied by later views, he must feel that the first view was wrong and deeply hates it. Because I especially liked the poems of Fan Chengda and others when I was young, when I realized that I had been deceived by him, I was conversely particularly disgusted with these scholar-officials. They only relied on imagination and superficial observation, and then shook their pens and wrote some beautiful poems. After being exposed, apart from the beautiful shell, it was not worth anything!

Traveling is the most beneficial and enlightening thing. Society itself is a living book, and the knowledge in the book is waiting for readers to discover. If you don't pay attention to it at all times, study it in depth, and only take a quick look, you are really wasting the great spring light. On this spring day, when it is time to boat on the lake and climb to the top of the mountain, how many people think about the lives of boatmen, porters, farmers, and fishermen besides reading and sighing at the greatness and beauty of nature? It is no wonder that articles praising the natural scenery are numerous.

### The Greatness of the World

— Yue

The largest musical instrument in the world is the "Apollonican," which was exhibited in London in 1817. This instrument has five sets of keyboards, played simultaneously by five people. The music produced is extremely complex, resembling the performance of a symphony orchestra.

There are currently twenty-nine companies in the United States actively producing wireless image transmitters, with a total of sixty-one different models. The smallest model can be placed on a desk and has a screen area of forty square inches, selling for US$169.50. The largest model comes with projection equipment and is specially designed for bars, schools, inns, and other places, with a screen area of twelve square feet, priced at approximately US$3,000.

The population of the British Empire was originally 566,660,000. After several territories were allowed to become independent in the past two years, the current population has been reduced to 145,700,000, which is not much different from the total population of the United States of 145,300,000.

### The Birth of the Jeep

— Ying Min

Since Marshall took office as Chief of Staff, he has been extremely busy. Many inventions that are beneficial to the war have been reviewed by experts and then finalized by him.

Once, Major Schmidt of the General Staff pushed open the door and entered Marshall's office. He saw several commanders in a meeting with Marshall. Schmidt was about to withdraw when Marshall said, "Come in." He stopped the meeting and asked Schmidt, "What is it?"

Schmidt said that there was a guest outside who wanted to meet General Marshall. This person had been in Washington for several weeks. He had drawn a diagram of a small car and wanted to provide it to the government for testing. However, he had met many people, and everyone was not interested in his invention. In despair, he wanted to meet the Chief of Staff himself to make a final request.

Schmidt had already met with the person and seen his drawing. He believed that it was still worth researching and testing, so he said:

"General, I hope you can meet this person. He is outside."

Marshall asked one or two questions and then said, "Have you looked at his plan carefully?"

"Yes, General."

"What is your impression?"

"I think it makes some sense."

"Okay, I agree. You build one."

"But, General, one is not enough for testing. At least fifteen are needed."

"Major Schmidt, do you think we can afford this amount?"

"Yes, about twelve thousand dollars."

"Alright, then go do it."

This is the birth of the world-famous "Jeep." The entire discussion took no more than three minutes. (Translated from "Together," written by Mrs. Marshall, a biography of Marshall's life before he was sent to China.)

### I Also Ascended the Summit of Mount Tiantai

— Jiang Danshu

Yesterday, I read Mr. Shi Shufan's poem about climbing the summit of Mount Tiantai, which could not help but evoke old dreams. I present two poems, depicting a different scene.

First poem:

Mother and calf yellow cattle know their way home,
Terraced fields seeded by heaven need no cart.
Carefree shepherd seeks fresh herbs,
Smiling, gifts me lilies.

Second poem:

Mount Tiantai is eight thousand zhang tall,
Floating Mount Sumeru in a sea of clouds.
Looking down, the peaks submit on all sides,
Shouting loudly, no echo returns.
The golden crow emerges, claiming the first dawn,
The jade rabbit's palace lingers in dampness.
Most loved is the summer journey, autumn moon order,
Only worried about dried meat and wine being rejected by the monk's kitchen. (Reply)

### The Untrammeled Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter Twelve: A Chance Encounter (95)

When Qi Wan saw Wu Yun talking, his eyes seemed to contain a suction, contracting and expanding, more beautiful than any man. But Wu Yun used his eloquent tongue, speaking eloquently. Qi Wan listened to him while quietly watching his beautiful divine light. She felt as if she was falling into a cloud, until the servant came in and told Dao Yun that there was a phone call for him. Only then did Dao Yun leave Qi Wan's room. Qi Wan, feeling extremely bored, was so persuaded by Wu Yun that her thoughts could not help but sway. She lay on the bed alone and thought for a while, feeling that what Niao Yun said was not without reason. To find a way out, of course, Shanghai was the best. Dao was in Shanghai for many years and was familiar with everything. What he said was of course reliable. At the same time, she thought that Niao Yun was originally the son of a wealthy family, no wonder his words and actions were so generous and natural. He said that he wanted to organize a film company, which shows that his financial resources were very abundant, and such talents are very rare. Seeing his words implying admiration for me, all the words were reserved. Since Beiping cannot stand, and Zhu Zhai cannot be combined, why should I make myself suffer? I should find my own way. Last time, I was angry for a while and wanted to provoke Zhu Zhai. I did not examine it carefully, and met Director Miao, which led to a big mistake and a joke. Now, in order to avoid meeting with colleagues, it is best to go far away. I can't ignore such a handsome man in front of me. Qi Wan was thinking wildly in the room, and she really wanted to go to Niao Yun's room to talk to him again, but she felt that it was not very convenient. It is better to wait and see. If he really pays attention to me, he will definitely come again. That day, she waited until the afternoon, but Niao Yun did not show up. She couldn't help but go to Niao Yun's sick room to inquire, but Dao Yun was not in the room. According to the nurse, Mr. Liu went out on business in the morning and has not returned. Qi Wan asked, "What disease does Mr. Liu have?" The nurse said, "He has hemorrhoids, which are now cured. He will probably be discharged from the hospital in a few days." Qi Wan listened, (and did not say anything, but returned to her room, sat in a stuffy mood for a while, and always felt that there was a question in her heart that had not been resolved, so she walked out of the house again, pacing on the corridor for a long time, watching the setting sun had fallen, and the afterglow hung on the treetops, and a few crows were perched on the branches, croaking. Qi Wan heard the sound of the crows, and it seemed that all her moods were evoked. She leaned idiotically on the railing, staring blankly at the crows perched on the trees. After a while, the remaining light on the treetops gradually disappeared, and the crows on the branches also flew away in pairs, and twilight enveloped the earth. Qi Wan still stood idiotically on the corridor in a daze. At this moment, suddenly someone called out beside her, "Miss Gu!"

### Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation - Inherently Naughty and Repeatedly Disobedient - Expel Adopted Son to Prevent Future Troubles

Hu Jinfang asked: My late husband adopted a son from an orphanage when he was alive. When he was young, he could not study well, and when he grew up, he could not learn a craft. Now at the age of twenty, his behavior is bad. Last spring, he secretly took things out to sell and spent them wastefully. After finding him, he seemed to repent, so he forgave him. Recently, he relapsed, becoming even worse, frequenting brothels and approaching merchants to squander money. His nature is bad, and it pains me to say it. I also have a biological child of my own. I really have no way to deal with this bad adopted son. I ask your newspaper's legal experts to consider the situation and provide a solution for the aftermath, for which the living and the deceased will be grateful.

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] Since the adopted son is bad and not yet an adult, in fact, you can only discipline him at any time. Besides notifying all merchants not to engage in monetary transactions with him, there are no other legal remedies.

### Military Service Clarification (Answer from the Civil Affairs Bureau)

(1) Answer to reader Jia Yuejun:

(1) All those who applied for rice approval in the 36th year will be included in the lottery, but whether or not to recruit will depend on the need.

(2) High school graduates are not subject to general conscription orders, which were promulgated and implemented in January of this year. According to the regulations that laws are not retroactive, it seems difficult to handle the deferment application for the 36th year by analogy.

(2) Answer to reader Lu Zhihong:

(1) Students studying in high school or above can apply for deferment according to the law.

(2) If you have graduated from a public teacher training school and are currently a primary school teacher for less than one year, or if you have graduated from a non-teacher training school and have passed the examination or have no examination and are currently a primary school teacher for more than one year, or if you have graduated from a teacher training or national higher school in the recovered provinces and cities during the enemy-puppet era, and have passed the qualification examination in accordance with the "Revised Examination Measures for Middle School Students in Recovered Areas" or the "Registration, Examination and Training Measures for Primary School Teachers in Recovered Counties and Cities," and are currently a primary school teacher for more than one year, you can be exempted from conscription during the pacification period in accordance with Article 26, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Military Service Law.

(3) Answer to reader Qi Tongxing:

(1) If Mr. Huang is indeed serving in a legal military institution and the service unit has issued a certificate of active duty, he can be exempted from conscription. There is no need for the chief officer to issue a certificate to apply for pacification. It is said that he has already left his job. If he has not gone through the legal discharge procedures, he should be regarded as having eliminated the reason and will still be included in the lottery for conscription.

(2) Those born in the 13th year of the Republic should be males of conscription age.

(3) According to Article 26, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Military Service Law, those who apply for sole responsibility for family livelihood must have a father who is 58 years old or older and is indeed the sole provider to be eligible for deferment.

(4) Those who applied for exemption from prohibited service and deferment of conscription in the 36th year will be included in the lottery this year, which means those males of conscription age who did not apply for exemption or deferment in the 36th year. The application for exemption from prohibited service and deferment of conscription this year is still pending.

### Shanghai and Old Culture

Yesterday, I bought a set of Yijin's [name]'s "Handkerchief and Letter" [style of calligraphy] from a book stall in Liulichang. The binding is exquisite. The last book's tail note reads "Printed by Dianshizhai, Shanghai in the Gengchen year of Guangxu [1880], issued by Shenbao Museum's Zhongchang Calligraphy and Painting Studio. Engraved on stone by Qian Yong of Jinkui in the Dingmao year of Jiaqing [1807]." I also saw two old novels with the note "Shenbao Museum edition" at the end. A friend said, "Northerners only know Shenbao as an old newspaper that publishes daily newspapers. Who knows that it also has many publications?" Gengchen is the sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. To the 29th year of the Republic of China is the second expansion, and now, in the 37th year, another eight years have passed, totaling seventy years. The Shenchang Calligraphy and Painting Studio had already been organized. If the number of its continued Sichuan editions [finely printed edition] were added up, it would be a grand sight to behold.

It makes me think that Shanghai, as an economic center and prosperous world, is praised as the London and New York of the East, while critics call it a cesspool of bad habits and filth. This does not need to be discussed in depth. However, Shanghai has made a very large and special contribution in the field of culture, which is generally overlooked. This matter must be recorded.

Shanghai's publishing industry can be divided into two major categories: "reviewing the old" and "fitting the times." "Fitting the times" means adapting to modern and current practical uses and spreading it at any time. For example, major bookstores target new education with teaching instruments, supplies for schools at all levels, and "spiritual food" for all aspects of society. Major newspapers' editing, printing, and operations are large in scale, all a few steps ahead of the inland. No matter Nanjing or Beijing, which cultural figures do not regard Shanghai as a source of supply? This is a common fact for a hundred years and does not need to be repeated. As for "reviewing the old," it means using new methods to reproduce old books, rubbings of steles, versions of calligraphy, etc. The printing is exquisite and the output is rich, glorifying the national essence, praising the predecessors, and benefiting future generations. Its great achievements and practical effects are unmatched by any other place in the country, and it can even be called the cultural center.

As the ancients said, writing books and establishing theories is something that scholars should do, but writing is not easy, and it cannot be guaranteed that it can be passed down. Therefore, it is better to "engrave books," focusing on the excellent works of predecessors and widely spreading them. This is a contribution to the literary world, and one's own name is also attached to the tail to be displayed. This theory is extremely practical. However, old-fashioned book engraving is not an easy task. It is not as convenient and agile as new-fashioned lithography, letterpress printing, photographic printing, collotype, and new imitations of Song, and various versions of the Juzhen edition, which are also precise and beautiful. This is a gift of science and the grace of the times, which the old gentlemen of the past could not have imagined.

The development of culture is closely and necessarily related to the progress of printing technology. Shanghai is the first gateway to China and the West. Civilized tools naturally have the priority of acceptance. People from Jiangnan are quick to act and most have the spirit of "doing." They do things as soon as they see them. With these advantages (geographical, temporal, and personal), the old thread-bound books and old-fashioned engraved editions, whether they were outdated, cumbersome, secret, or rare, were rescued batch by batch by the Shanghai printing and publishing industry. The rubbings of steles and calligraphy by Dianshizhai, Guoguangshe, and Youzheng Bookstore, and the notes and novels by Saoye Shanfang, are neatly and clearly printed, more eye-catching than the old woodcuts. The layout is uniform and suitable for viewing, and it is also better than the "soft, dim, scattered, and uneven" of the old editions. Other libraries, bookstores, and newspaper offices with good printing all meticulously print old books, or search for secret or unique copies, so that they can see the light of day again and be made public to the world. Or they will sort out the books that are commonly seen but clumsy and expensive, and turn them into products that are beautiful and cheap. They are all meritorious officials of the old culture.

In the old capital, from thirty or forty years ago, the books in the book market were mostly published in Shanghai, both new books and old books (reprinted). For example, the old "Tongwen," old "Hongwen," and "Guangbai Song" illustrated old novels, with their exquisite and clear fonts, clean and elegant paper, and elegant and beautiful illustrations, can all be described as "heart, energy, and fruit" [product of one's entire being]. They occupy a very large value in the history of Chinese art and are truly empowered by Western printing. In the Guangxu and Xuantong periods of the former Qing Dynasty, the old "Tongwen" embroidered image novels were regarded as rare books in the Beijing market and priced according to antique market prices. In the past ten years, even at the new Zhengyangdian fairs, Tongwen novels have not been seen. Even one or two incomplete copies are priced extremely high, as they are already rare treasures.

Recently, most of the woodcut thread-bound books have been bought and sold by the catty as waste paper (some are used for wrapping goods, and some are used as raw materials for making new paper). Commentators think it is a pity and even pessimistic about the old culture. Although there are considerable reasons, after an actual investigation, the survival of the fittest and natural selection are inevitable. Speaking from my own experience, the old books in my family are piled on the shelves, covered with dust, and have not been touched for many years. Because everything is valuable for its use. To browse these old books, you have to use both hands to pick them up, and they take up a lot of space on the table. After reading one side, there is not much content, and you have to turn the page again, which is time-consuming and cumbersome. It is not as clear and convenient as the new-style reprinted products published in Shanghai (of course, it refers to the editions of "Tongwen" and "Saoye," not the inferior products with thin paper, small characters, and secret copies). It is clear and convenient, and the result is twice the work with half the effort. Therefore, during the enemy-puppet period, due to the need for money to exchange for rice, many old books on the shelves were sold. Some friends discouraged or lamented, and I smiled and said: "It is also waste to leave them on the shelves." Of the 20% that were retained, there are Song and Ming editions, two Qing Dynasty large-character editions, and a small number of exquisitely engraved editions, which have been reorganized and are still stored on the shelves, but they are only regarded as antiques and have nothing to do with culture. I read the Old Can's Travels and wanted to see the book collection of Yang Mansion in Dongchang Temple but could not (the book changed "Yang" to "Liu" surname, which is an example of novels). He wrote a poem with the sigh of "Deeply locked in the Langhuan, the bookworms are full." However, the wealth of book collections such as the Qing Dynasty's internal government, the great library of the palace, and the books filling the building, have been sealed for many years. Not only are there bookworms and spider webs, but it is also rumored to be the cave of fox fairies and snake gods. Even if relatives and ministers want to open and view one or two, the guards will change color and tell them, almost like the demons suppressed on the mountain by Zhang Tianshi in the Water Margin. May I ask, even if it is the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, with characters as big as a dipper and books as big as boats, what does it have to do with culture? When I read the Old Can's Travels, if I were in the position of Liu Mansion, I would definitely refuse Old Can to visit, and tell him that it is not because I am hoarding and selfish, but because it takes half a day to fuss and gets you dirty, and you can't read a few chapters and pages, and you can't gain much knowledge. As a result, there are only a few false and good-looking doors in the travel notes.

Another example is the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" of the Qing Dynasty. When Xu Shichang was president, he issued a clear order to send Zhu Qiqian to handle the printing by a certain large library, but it did not materialize. Later, Zhang Xueliang also had this idea, which can be regarded as admiring elegance, but the work is troublesome and costly, and it is difficult to print and sell. This is all worrying for nothing and disturbing yourself. It is better for Shanghai's bookstores, newspaper offices, and printing houses to print many old books throughout the country without fanfare or publicity, which is a practical contribution to culture.
