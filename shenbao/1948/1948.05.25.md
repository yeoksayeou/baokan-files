[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek submitted a message to the Legislative Yuan in the afternoon of the 24th, seeking their approval of the nominee for Premier of the Executive Yuan. The message was personally delivered to the Legislative Yuan by Xu Jingzhi, Director of the First Bureau. The full text is as follows:

Presidential Message (One) No. 1, May 24th, Year 37

It is hereby proposed that Weng Wenhao be appointed as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. It is noted that Mr. Weng is an internationally renowned scholar who has served as a member of the National Government and Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan. He has a long-standing reputation for his understanding of both domestic and international affairs. In particular, for more than a decade, he has served as the head of the Third Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the War Production Board, and the Resources Commission, dedicating his efforts to economic construction and the strengthening of national defense resources, achieving remarkable results. He has also made significant contributions to international relations, education, and culture. At the beginning of this constitutional era, with the dual tasks of suppressing rebellion and building the nation internally, and securing American aid externally, the responsibilities are heavy and the tasks are numerous, requiring a person of exceptional talent. Appointing him as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is firmly believed that he will be able to handle the position with ease and satisfaction. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, this consultation is made to seek your approval so that the appointment can be made. This message is directed to the Legislative Yuan. President Chiang Kai-shek. (Photo of Weng Wenhao, recent photo).

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek's message to the Legislative Yuan on the 24th proposed the appointment of Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan. The Legislative Yuan held its third session of the first meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, exercising its power of consent for the first time. Wu Tiecheng was elected as the chairman according to law, and the session was changed to a plenary meeting to conduct review and discussion. On the point of "requesting the President to notify Mr. Weng to submit his policy opinions," it was passed with the support of a majority of 388 members, finding it unnecessary. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan continued its third session and held a secret ballot. The results showed that a majority of 489 votes solemnly approved the appointment of Weng Wenhao as the Premier of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Weng Wenhao accepted the appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution on the 24th, and immediately began the work of forming his cabinet that evening. After the Legislative Yuan approved his appointment as Premier, Weng stated that he had been appointed suddenly this time, and that he had not yet started any preparations. He needed to consult with the President and contact various parties before he could make any decisions. Weng then went to the official residence at 9 p.m. to meet with the President, seeking instructions on the selection of the Deputy Premier and ministers of the new Executive Yuan, as well as the political commissioners and the chief and deputy secretaries-general, and on the guidelines for governance. The President will issue the order appointing Weng as Premier of the Executive Yuan on the 25th, and other candidates are being consulted separately, and it is expected that a general decision will be made on the 25th. It is reported that the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party will still have ministers and political commissioners in the Executive Yuan, and several prominent figures from society will also participate in order to jointly govern and complete the constitutional nation-building work. It is also learned that Weng has scheduled a press conference at the Resources Commission at 4:30 p.m. on the 25th to report on personnel and policy matters.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Sun Ke and Chen Lifu sent telegrams on the 24th congratulating Weng Wenhao on his appointment as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution.

Legislative Yuan Replies to the President, Requesting Mr. Weng to Submit Policy Guidelines After Taking Office

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The Legislative Yuan has reported to President Chiang Kai-shek on the process and results of exercising its power of consent over the appointment of the Premier of the Executive Yuan on the night of the 24th. This message was delivered by Guang Lang, Director of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, to Xu Jingzhi, Director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Palace, at 10:30 p.m. The message first stated that the Legislative Yuan, in accordance with Article 55 of the Constitution, exercised its power of consent for the first time. After receiving the President's message, it was submitted to the plenary committee for review, and it was deemed that the appointment of Mr. Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan could be approved. The third meeting then resolved to approve it. In addition, it included a summary of the opinions of the members during the review by the plenary committee, requesting the President to inform Mr. Weng to submit a report on policy guidelines to the Legislative Yuan after taking office as Premier of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the Legislative Yuan's message of reply agreeing to Weng Wenhao's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan was delivered to the Presidential Palace, President Chiang Kai-shek attached three appointment orders for Mr. Weng to countersign and issued them late at night: (1) Special appointment of Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan; (2) Special appointment of Wu Dingchang as Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace; (3) Special appointment of Xue Yue as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace. The order appointing Mr. Weng was also countersigned by himself, because according to the Constitution, the Premier of the Executive Yuan has the legal qualifications after being nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan, and any order of the President must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan.

### Review and Voting Process in the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] The third meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 3:50 p.m. on the 24th. President Sun Ke chaired the meeting. After passing the minutes of the second meeting, President Sun instructed the Secretariat to read out Presidential Message (One) No. 1, in which President Chiang Kai-shek nominated Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan and requested approval in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. The attendees listened and applauded to express their welcome. President Sun then declared: According to Article 53 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure on the Exercise of the Power of Consent: "When exercising the power of consent in accordance with Article 55 of the Constitution, the plenary committee shall review the matter and submit it to the plenary session for voting. The plenary committee shall elect one member to serve as chairman to solicit the consent of the attendees and preside over the meeting."

Plenary Meeting for Review and Discussion

Wu Tiecheng was then publicly elected as chairman. Mr. Sun then withdrew with the Chief and Deputy Secretaries-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and Yan Guofu, and the plenary committee meeting was reconvened under the chairmanship of Mr. Wu. Qi Zhihou spoke first, advocating for approval. He said: Mr. Weng Wenhao enjoys a high reputation in international academic circles and has no factional affiliations in domestic political circles. He is a suitable candidate for the current Premier of the Executive Yuan. He only hopes that he can appoint new people to implement new policies. Tian Yushi also followed, saying that Weng is an honest and promising scientist and politician who should be approved by the Legislative Yuan, but before approval, public opinion should also be reflected. He said: Although Weng has very good qualifications, his past political achievements have not been perfect, so he has three expectations for his future policies: (1) to organize a new cabinet that is detached, neutral, and progressive to carry out government affairs, (2) to form a cabinet of talent, and the ministers of the old Executive Yuan should be retained or eliminated separately, without regard to factions, but attention should be paid to the extension and distribution of talent from various regions, (3) to pay attention to the needs of the country and the people, establish policies, and eliminate the phenomenon of paralysis with the courage of a sharp knife cutting through tangled hemp. Tian also finally advocated omitting the procedure stipulated in Article 54 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure, which states that "if deemed necessary, the Legislative Yuan may request the President to notify the nominee to submit his policy opinions." Wang Jian'e said: He did not know much about Weng, but for the sake of the current situation, he supported the President's opinion. He hoped that the new Executive Yuan could (1) eliminate the rampant corruption of high officials, (2) cut redundant agencies. Zhang Jinjian then pointed out that the materials introducing Weng in the President's message were not enough to understand his policies, and advocated that the President be requested to notify Weng to submit his policy opinions. He said: The bad things about past political affairs were that the people in charge were good at perfunctory, but their implementations deviated from national policies. Weng has a wide range of contacts and is extremely clean, but he should be able to make his subordinates not corrupt. Moreover, Weng is someone who has received a lot of capitalist and liberal education, and whether he can accurately implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, regulate capital, and benefit all the people, must be guaranteed by his policy opinions. Otherwise, if the Legislative Yuan rashly approves it without any basis, it would be a disservice to its duties. Ma Chengfeng also said: Judging from Weng's past style, unless there are new methods, it cannot be confidently believed that he can open up the current difficult situation. What his new methods are should be shown to the Legislative Yuan first before he can be trusted and agreed to. Hu Jianzhong and Cheng Cangbo successively expressed their opposition to this opinion, believing that policy opinions were not necessary before approval, but the Legislative Yuan's opinions should be paid attention to. Hu also said: The current priority is to suppress rebellion and banditry and enrich people's livelihood. When Weng was the Minister of Economic Affairs, he was only interested in heavy industry, but there was a lack of achievements in civil industry. As the Chairman of the Resources Commission, his control over his subordinates was also inadequate, so he was not the most ideal candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan, but for the sake of political stability, it is also possible to agree to this honest and capable scholar. Cheng then explained that the person in charge does not have to be a genius, but that his policies are important, and then described what he heard from international friends in Europe and the United States about their concern for our country, which focused on two points: one is the communist bandit problem, and the other is currency inflation, in other words, military affairs and finance. Therefore, he believes that Weng's policy measures should focus on military needs and military training and the redistribution of wealth. Pan Chaoying then pointed out that the new Executive Yuan must end the wavering and unstable diplomatic policy, and at 4:40 p.m., the attendees requested to end the review and discussion. Chairman Wu then solicited the opinions of the attendees on the question of whether it was necessary to request the President to notify Weng to submit his policy opinions in accordance with Article 54 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure. The opinions of the members were divided, and after voting, it was only with a majority of 388 people in favor (587 members present) that it was passed that this was not necessary. At 4:50 p.m., the plenary committee meeting came to an end and adjourned.

Third Session Voting

At 5:20 p.m., the third meeting continued. Wu Tiecheng reported on the plenary committee's review of the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan nominated by the President. President Sun announced that in accordance with Article 56 of Chapter 8 of the Rules of Procedure, a secret ballot would be held to decide whether to approve Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. Wang Qijiang, Deng Hongye, Fan Yushui, Yang Yuqing and other twelve people were designated as supervisors. Voting began at 5:30 p.m. The members went to the podium in an orderly manner to sign and receive their ballots, marked the printed "Agree" or "Disagree" options, and put them into the ballot box. The voting was completed in half an hour. President Sun reported that the supervisors had received 680 ballots, issued 605 ballots, and 75 blank ballots remained. The vote counting then began and was completed in ten minutes under the supervision of the supervisors. At 6:15 p.m., President Sun reported the results of the vote count, with a total of 603 ballots cast in the ballot box. Excluding 20 invalid ballots, the number of valid ballots was 583, including 489 votes in favor and 94 votes against. "The Legislative Yuan solemnly agrees to Mr. Weng Wenhao's appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan." The meeting adjourned at 6:20 p.m.

### First Supervisory Yuan to Convene on June 1st; Preparatory Committee Sends Telegrams to Supervisory Committee Members to Prepare to Attend

[Central Decision Society, Nanjing, 24th] The first Supervisory Yuan will convene on June 1st. This was decided by President Sun today regarding the new Premier of the Executive Yuan.

According to the preparation procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, it is possible to have a legal convention and convocation.

### Weng Wenhao Appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan; Central Standing Committee Unanimously Agrees; Kuomintang Legislative Committee Members Also Support

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the decision to appoint Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan was made at the President's official residence on the evening of the 23rd, President Chiang Kai-shek, in his capacity as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, specially convened a meeting of the Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 24th to first seek consent within the party. The Central Standing Committee was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, with the Director-General personally presiding. He reported on the spot that he had decided to nominate Weng Wenhao as the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the Constitution, and specially sought the opinions of the members. Zhang Daofan, Gu Zhenggang, Li Zonghuang and others stood up and spoke, saying that although Weng's appointment as the head of the Executive Yuan was not entirely ideal, there was no more suitable candidate at present, so they should follow the Director-General's intention, but they hoped that after Weng took office, he could bring a new atmosphere to the future new Executive Yuan. Finally, it was put to a vote, and all the members unanimously stood up and passed it, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Kuomintang Director-General Chiang Kai-shek convened a discussion meeting with Kuomintang Legislative Committee members at the Central Party Headquarters at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th to discuss the issue of nominating Weng Wenhao as Premier of the Executive Yuan. More than 200 Legislative Committee members attended the meeting. Director-General Chiang Kai-shek arrived at the meeting at 2:40 p.m. and delivered a speech explaining the reasons for nominating Mr. Weng. The Director-General pointed out that Mr. Weng is a well-known scholar with international reputation, has presided over economic construction for many years, and has made many contributions. He has also served as Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan and has rich administrative experience. Since entering politics, he has never participated in factions. He is known for his integrity and self-discipline, which is well known at home and abroad. In the past, public opinion from all sides has criticized the government's corruption and incompetence. Now, appointing a scientist and an honest person as the head of the Executive Yuan may change the atmosphere in the officialdom and international perception. At the beginning of this constitutional era, Mr. Weng is probably a more suitable candidate. The Director-General also earnestly instructed that at this time of hardship, the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan cannot be vacant for a long time. A nomination must be decided quickly, approved by the Legislative Yuan, and a new Executive Yuan must be organized to carry out government affairs. Therefore, he hoped that all the members would appreciate this and support him. The Director-General's speech lasted for ten minutes, and his words were earnest, and all the Legislative Committee members were moved. Zhou Yongneng, Kong Geng, Liu Jianqun and others then spoke one after another, believing that Mr. Weng's knowledge was profound and his experience was rich. If he took office as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he would be able to perform the job well and would express his admiration for the Director-General's intention and resolutely support him. All the members unanimously applauded and agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 3:10 p.m.

### Zeng Qi and Xu Fulin Express Opinions

Believing That Weng Wenhao is Suitable to be Head of the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party said on the evening of the 24th that he believed that President's nomination of Weng Wenhao as Premier was very suitable. Mr. Xu believed that Mr. Weng was knowledgeable and meticulous in his work, and was a rare talent in the Kuomintang. Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Executive Yuan, Mr. Xu said that he had not yet considered it because the issue of the Legislative Yuan had not yet been resolved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Zeng Qi, leader of the Chinese Youth Party, issued a statement, saying: "I am very pleased that Mr. Weng Wenhao is forming a cabinet. First, because he is a pure scholar and his attitude is usually very fair, he will definitely be able to accommodate all streams and expand the foundation of the government. Second, because he has made achievements in construction in the past, he will definitely be able to make good use of American aid and carry out large-scale construction to deal with the unlimited destruction of the Communist Party. President Chiang's proposal of Mr. Weng and the Legislative Yuan's happy agreement are all wise moves, and we will wait and see. Mr. Weng's "new policies" and "new lineup" are due to the people's eager hope for governance, and there is really no room for further delays. The implementation of the Constitution is like the "finale," and Mr. Weng will definitely have something to satisfy the audience's expectations."

### Foreign Exchange Control Policy Has Been Effective

Still Should Follow National Policy for Handling

According to the Central News Agency, Yu answered the following questions from reporters yesterday:

(1) Regarding foreign exchange, the government will adopt a control policy. The work promoted by the past Balance Fund Committee has been quite effective. In the future, we should still follow the national policy and deal with the facts in accordance with the circumstances. If there are any improvements that need to be made, I will humbly accept them and review them as much as possible. (2) Regarding stabilizing prices, we should of course treat both the symptoms and the root causes, such as tightening credit and selling materials. In addition, the government has indeed developed new and effective methods, which will be implemented immediately. (3) The Northeast Circulation Certificates were initially adapted to the needs, and then the opinions of the people in the Northeast were adopted to stop them and redeem them. The redemption method has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the legal tender prepared for the redemption has been shipped outside the customs to start the redemption. The main purpose is to seek the stability of the Northeast's finance and the psychology of its people. (4) The short-term treasury bills were issued not long ago and have also achieved considerable results. If local financial figures offer good opinions, they should of course be adopted and improved. (5) Regarding personnel issues, national talents should serve the country. The Central Bank is a business organization, and it is especially inappropriate to be affected by the difference in the person in charge, so there will be no changes in the personnel of the bank.

### Yu and Wu Discuss Price Stabilization

Central Bank Personnel Remain Largely Unchanged

### Mr. Weng Wenhao's Brief Biography

Weng Wenhao, courtesy name Yongni, was born in 1889 in Shitang Village, Yin County, Zhejiang Province. At the age of eighteen, he came to Shanghai and entered Aurora University for his studies. In 1908, Mr. Weng passed the Zhejiang government-funded examination and went to Europe to study at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, researching geology. He was highly regarded by his teachers and obtained a doctorate in science. After returning to China one year before the founding of the Republic of China, he traveled to various places for research and compiled the book "China's Mineral Resources Map." Subsequently, he co-founded the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping with Ding Wenjiang, Zhang Hongzhao, and others. From 1922, he succeeded Ding Wenjiang as the director of the Beiping Geological Survey Institute. During this period, he also served as the counselor of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and concurrently as a professor at Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University, as well as acting president of Tsinghua University. He consistently dedicated himself to research in geology and geography, making significant contributions. He attended conferences such as the International Geological Congress and the Pacific Science Congress as a representative, and served as the president of the Geological Society of China and the president of the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. He also received honorary doctorates of law from the University of British Columbia in Canada and honorary doctorates of engineering from the Berlin Institute of Technology in Germany. In modern China, the academic field that first attracted international academic attention was earth science, which was all the result of Mr. Weng's past research.

In 1935, Mr. Weng was appointed Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; later, he also served as Secretary-General of the National Defense Design Committee and the Resources Committee. In 1937, he was reassigned as Minister of the Third Department of the Military Affairs Commission. During the coronation of the British monarch, Mr. Weng and Kong Xiangxi were both envoys of China, attending the grand ceremony in the UK and visiting the UK, the US, France, Germany and other countries.

In 1938, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, and Mr. Weng was transferred to the position of Minister of Economic Affairs, concurrently serving as Chairman of the Resources Committee, Director of the Factory Adjustment Office, and Director of the Wartime Production Bureau, contributing significantly to the development of rear-area resources for the anti-Japanese war. In 1942, Mr. Weng inspected various places in the Northwest, planning the development of industrial and mining enterprises. In January 1944, the National Government awarded him the First Class Jingxing Medal. In 1945, at the First Plenary Session of the Sixth Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, he was elected as a member of the National Government and concurrently as Vice President of the Executive Yuan.

Mr. Weng remained a scholar at heart even after serving in government for more than ten years. After the victory, he traveled extensively for the restoration and takeover of industrial and mining enterprises. After 1946, he resigned from his position as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and devoted himself to industry and mining, aiming to restore various production enterprises to their former state.

Mr. Weng has authored many books, among which "China's Mineral Resources" and "China's Earthquakes" are particularly respected by the international academic community. In 1933, during the 60th anniversary of the "Shen Bao" newspaper, Mr. Weng, together with Ding Wenjiang and Zeng Shiying, co-edited the "New Map of the Republic of China," which was meticulously selected, accurately drawn, and remains an authoritative work among Chinese maps to this day. Recently, "Shen Bao" planned to revise and republish the map, and Mr. Weng, despite his government affairs, still undertook the work of revising and redrawing the map for "Shen Bao," demonstrating his dedication to academics even while serving in government, which is truly rare. The book, after Mr. Weng's revision, is expected to be published within the year and meet the readers.

In 1933, Mr. Weng had a car accident in Wukang County on his way from Hangzhou to Nanjing, and his face was injured. Visible scars remain on his face to this day.

Mr. Weng's father, named Mianfu, is now seventy-eight years old. During the late Qing Dynasty, he was a reformer who resolutely sent his only son to a foreign country to seek knowledge, demonstrating remarkable insight.

Mr. Weng has four sons. His youngest son, Qinhan, originally served in the Air Force and died in the line of duty in 1944. (The left is Mr. Weng's signature style.)

Editorial

### Expectations for the New Cabinet's Future

The difficult-to-produce Premier of the Executive Yuan was finally nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan yesterday. The person responsible for forming the cabinet is Mr. Weng Wenhao. Mr. Weng was well-known in academic circles before the war. He participated in government affairs and was responsible for developing resources. During the War of Resistance, he presided over the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Wartime Production Bureau. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he served as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and is currently the Chairman of the Resources Committee. In the eyes of the general public, Mr. Weng is undoubtedly a person with ambition, vision, and the ability to make a difference. Although Mr. Weng is a Central Committee member of the Kuomintang, his scholarly demeanor suggests that he can be regarded as a liberal, no different from social elites. Today, when people are eagerly hoping for good governance, it is appropriate to have Mr. Weng Wenhao take on this arduous task, organize an Executive Yuan under the Constitution that assumes joint responsibility, and implement new policies, which should meet the expectations of people at home and abroad.

The new Premier of the Executive Yuan is the first Premier of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution in our country. According to the provisions of the Constitution, he must be nominated by the President and appointed with the approval of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the President carefully considered the candidates for Premier. It is said that the President initially favored Premier Zhang Qun, but Premier Zhang, considering the nation's urgent desire for new people to implement new policies, was unwilling to be reappointed and even left Beijing for Chongqing to show his determination. The President then favored General He Yingqin, who had just returned from abroad, but General He declined the important task, citing "having been away from the country for nearly two years and not being familiar with the domestic political situation." As a result, the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan could not be decided for a time. The President then used the weekend holiday to consider the matter all day and finally decided to entrust the task of organizing the cabinet to Mr. Weng Wenhao. Yesterday, Mr. Weng's nomination was reportedly submitted to the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee for public resolution, which was passed. In the afternoon, the official document was formally submitted to the Legislative Yuan, which was also passed by the third meeting of the Yuan with 489 votes in favor and 94 against. Observing the difficulty in producing the Premier of the Executive Yuan and observing the newly nominated Mr. Weng's morality, writing, talent, knowledge, and vision, we not only deeply congratulate our country's democratic constitutional future for finding the right person, but also wish to take advantage of Premier Weng's commencement of cabinet formation to offer some opinions to express our hopes for the political situation in the future.

First, the essence of the responsible cabinet system lies in the thorough implementation of policies. Whether policies can be thoroughly implemented depends first on whether there are policies, second on whether the policies have been agreed upon by the people's representatives, and then on the results of the policy implementation. Therefore, after Mr. Weng is ordered to form a cabinet, he must first prepare his policy guidelines. We believe that future policy guidelines should avoid empty rhetoric and should be pragmatic. The Constitution of our country has a chapter on basic national policies, which already has principled provisions for national defense, diplomacy, national economy, social security, culture, education, and border policies. Therefore, what is currently needed is not a hollow article, but rather practical measures to address current malpractices and the determination to implement these measures. We believe that under the current circumstances, as a certain authority figure said, two major policies must be implemented immediately: one is the rapid promotion of the military suppression of the rebellion, so as to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion in the shortest possible time; and the other is the effective economic measures, such as how to use US aid, how to stabilize finance, and how to improve the national economy and the people's livelihood. All of these should be brainstormed and implemented with determination. To be honest, today the people of the whole country are living in dire straits, almost unable to breathe. For two months, government affairs have been lax, almost at a standstill, while the communist bandits have taken the opportunity to expand the riots, running amok. If the new government does not quickly form and step up to take on the important task, how can the people live on? "A thirsty person easily takes a drink, and a hungry person easily takes food." Today, when the people are struggling to survive, as long as the government loves and protects the people and relieves their suffering, it is not an unsolvable problem. What is needed is for leadership figures with scholarly demeanor to transform into a new style of "responsible" governance. From the Premier of the Executive Yuan himself to the heads of various ministries and commissions, they must have the democratic demeanor of new politicians. They must not only humbly accept the people's criticism, but also have the spirit of readily adopting good ideas and taking responsibility for their work. Whether they do well or poorly, they must never shirk responsibility. This is the most basic meaning of a responsible cabinet. Only with this spirit can politics be reformed and can there be progress.

Second, the most peculiar thing about the political situation in recent years is the revolving door of political figures. It seems that in a country as large as China, only this group of people can be loyal and effective for the country. As for their ability and political achievements, they are already well-known. Therefore, since today we are touting new people and new policies, the selection of heads of various ministries and commissions and political committee members regardless of departments and commissions should be based on the principle of "appointing people based on merit," eliminating all partisan prejudices, and truly "serving the public," promoting talent without adhering to seniority. Only in this way can new talent be discovered. Foreign and domestic political commentators often say that the government's reorganizations are "new wine in old bottles." If we are still unwilling to employ new people to give the government a new look, and if we are still unwilling to select a few young politicians who are strong, energetic, and insightful to add vitality to the government, how can we expect the government to become "competent"? After the war, the British Labor Party formed a cabinet and employed a large number of new people, maintaining the vitality of the Labor Party government, which can be used as a reference for Premier Weng in selecting the heads of various ministries and commissions. In the past, the Executive Yuan was responsible to the Chairman of the National Government and was also a coalition government organized by the Kuomintang and the Democratic Youth Party. However, the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution is a responsible cabinet accountable to the Legislative Yuan. The issues that should be paid attention to are less political issues and more constitutional issues. Therefore, regardless of whether Premier Weng still intends to recruit figures from the Democratic Youth Party to participate in the Executive Yuan, he should emphasize the talents of the people he chooses to join the cabinet and take charge of any ministry or commission, and he should also emphasize whether their political views are in line with Premier Weng's policy guidelines. In other words, cabinet members should be asked about their talent, not their party affiliation. We believe that only in this way can we organize a "competent" government that meets the ardent expectations of the people.

Third, in today's serious and difficult military situation of suppressing the rebellion, we need a strong government, a government with high-speed administrative efficiency. We never hope to produce a weak and incompetent government, a perfunctory government. The new Executive Yuan must be loyal to the Constitution. Whether it is a major plan for domestic or foreign affairs, it must be carried out in accordance with this Constitution. What we must pay close attention to is the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan has the power to legislate, the power to approve, and the power to question the important policies of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan and only has the power to return for reconsideration. Comparing the two powers, it is obviously impossible to achieve the effect of "check and balance." Since the Executive Yuan is subject to many constraints, many people regard the Premier of the Executive Yuan as a daunting task. However, when we study the legislative spirit of the Chinese Constitution, its essence lies in the division of powers and functions. The people should have full power, and the government should have full capacity. If we only focus on the literal interpretation, the Executive Yuan will ask the Legislative Yuan for consent in everything, and everyone from the Premier of the Executive Yuan downwards will only know how to perfunctorily deal with the Legislative Yuan, holding the idea that "the more you do, the more mistakes you make, the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make, and the less you do, the better." Everyone is sloppy and muddled through the day, then the government will inevitably become a paralyzed and incompetent government. Otherwise, even if it勉强 comes to power at the beginning, it will soon retreat in the face of difficulty. If the Premier of the Executive Yuan is frequently changed, not only will the political situation not be stable, but also no policy can be thoroughly implemented. This kind of political system is definitely not what our people expect. Therefore, we want the Executive and Legislative Yuans to understand the spirit of our country's Constitution. The Executive Yuan must value its policies and implement them with a strong spirit. The Legislative Yuan can only hold the Executive Yuan accountable for its policies, rather than constantly hindering the Executive Yuan in small matters. Only in this way can we hope that the government will gradually become a strong and powerful government with high efficiency in the future.

### Tool Needed to Manufacture Nitric Acid, Seven Jin of Platinum Wire Mesh, Stolen from Our Yongli Factory by the Japanese, Allied Forces Dedicated to Searching and Returning It

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Allied Forces are currently dedicated to searching for seven jin of platinum wire mesh (each jin equals sixteen liang).

Recently, the factory was returned to our country by Japan, but it still lacks this important platinum wire mesh contact agent for nitric acid manufacturing, and therefore cannot produce it. The Japanese government initially agreed to re-manufacture it to compensate our country, but because all precious metals are under the control of the Allied Forces, it must first obtain their approval.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 24th] The Fuda Cao Wei embankment, which surrounds the city, serves as a protective barrier for the residents of Nanchang city and county during severe floods. Due to prolonged rain in recent months, the embankment's foundation has become loose and weak, with a small section collapsing, creating a tense situation. Fortunately, the weather has been clear in recent days, and the water source of the Gan River has not risen. Additionally, the water stored in Poyang Lake is being discharged.

On the morning of the 23rd, the water level in Hankou was 23.77 meters and still showed an upward trend, remaining 4.41 meters below the highest water level. All relevant agencies and the city of Hankou have made considerable preparations for flood prevention.

### After Israel Ordered Jewish Forces to Cease Fire, Arab Forces Still Refuse to Ceasefire; London and Washington Discuss Future Countermeasures; China Hopes the United Nations Can Promote Full Implementation of a Holy Land Truce

[Our Newspaper News] London, 24th Broadcast: A spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated: The British government is determined to do everything possible to urge the Arab side to accept the Palestine truce. Simultaneously, British and American ambassadors in Cairo are in frequent contact with the Egyptian Foreign Minister. The Arab side believes: The Arab side can accept the truce proposal, but the Security Council must guarantee the disarmament of the Jews and the cancellation of the partition plan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] News from diplomatic circles: Foreign Minister Wang Shijie telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lie on the 24th, responding that the Chinese government hopes that the Security Council's May 22nd resolution regarding a Palestine truce can be fully implemented.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Baghdad officially announced on the 24th that the Arab forces fighting in Palestine will continue to advance and will only accept the unconditional surrender of the Jewish army. The Arab League countries will ignore the Security Council's request for a Palestinian truce. This declaration has completely nullified the United Nations' latest actions in dealing with the turmoil in Palestine. The Arab statement is tantamount to indicating that the war in the Holy Land will continue, and the reputation and capabilities of the United Nations organization have once again suffered a major blow.

[Reuters, London, 24th] US Ambassador to the UK Douglas visited Foreign Secretary Bevin again today to discuss the Palestine issue, talking for approximately one hour. This is Mr. Douglas's second visit to Mr. Bevin in forty-eight hours. Related parties believe that the discussion likely concerned the policies to be adopted after the Arab countries rejected the United Nations' ceasefire order.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The Jewish Council has notified the American member of the United Nations Jerusalem Ceasefire Committee, informing him that the Israeli government is prepared to issue a ceasefire order in Palestine at 8:00 PM local time on Monday. If the Arabs agree to an early ceasefire, the Jewish side's ceasefire order can also take effect as early as when the Arabs begin the ceasefire. The Jewish Council's notification stated, "The Israeli Provisional Government has ordered all fronts to cease firing at 8:00 PM Jewish time local on May 24th. If the other side ceases firing at an earlier time, the Jewish side's ceasefire order will also take effect at the same time. If the other side has not ceased firing after 8:00 PM local Jewish time, the Jewish army will continue to engage in defensive battles." The notification was delivered by the Jewish side to the American Vice-Consul in Jerusalem, Puhad, and released by the State Department.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 23rd, Associated Press] The sudden issuance of a ceasefire order by the State of Israel has put the Arab countries in a rather awkward position in the United Nations tonight. A spokesperson for the US delegation stated: He was very pleased with Israel's announcement that if the Arabs do so as well, the Jewish side will cease fire. It is unanimously believed here that Israel's announcement of a ceasefire is actually a brilliant diplomatic tactic. The United Nations is currently awaiting the Arab side's response. If they disregard the Security Council's order and continue to fight after the ceasefire deadline, they may be subject to economic or military sanctions by the Security Council.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 24th] The Security Council is scheduled to hold a meeting at 6:30 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 24th. If the situation requires it, it will discuss the Palestine issue. If the Palestine issue requires swift action, the Security Council will discuss the Czech coup case.

### Arab Disregard for Ceasefire Proposals; Britain and America Will Act in Concert; Britain May Revise the Treaty with Transjordan

[United Press, London, 24th] Well-informed sources in the Foreign Office claimed today that Britain's obligations to the United Nations organization are higher than its obligations to King Abdullah of Transjordan under the amended treaty.

If Mr. Abdullah disregards the Security Council's ceasefire proposal, Britain has the right to reconsider its treaty with Transjordan and may withdraw the forty British military officers serving in the Transjordanian army. Everything must be decided after the ceasefire deadline has passed. It is not possible to predict at this time. According to Foreign Office sources, Britain and the United States may take concerted action in the United Nations organization.

[United Press, Cairo, 24th] The US and British governments today requested that Egypt accept the recommendations of the United Nations organization and implement a ceasefire in Palestine at 5:00 PM standard time.

### Egyptian and Transjordanian Legion Forces Meet; Launch General Attack on Jewish Forces South of Jerusalem; Fierce Battles in the Old City, Most Buildings Destroyed

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 24th] The Haganah bulletin admitted that Egyptian troops and the Transjordanian Legion had met two miles south of Jerusalem and were jointly launching a general attack on the south of the city, but were repelled. Jewish forces in the Old City continue to resist. Haganah solemnly denied Cairo's claim that the south of Jerusalem would be occupied within twenty-four hours.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 24th] If the Arab armies continue at their current rate of destruction, they can clear every building in the Jewish Quarter within a week. The skies over Jerusalem's Old City are shrouded in black smoke, and Arab artillery shells are raining down, with houses falling one by one. Arab regular and irregular forces are searching and advancing step by step behind the falling houses. The trapped Haganah and Irgun soldiers are putting up a desperate resistance with the help of ruins and tunnels. The fiercest fighting today is in the area near the Hospital of the Holy Mother between the Damascus Gate and the Zion Gate outside the Old City, with bursts of thick smoke rising into the sky along with the sounds of collapsing houses. The artillery of the Arab Legion is relentlessly bombarding the new city of Jerusalem. Shortly after the Jewish army's armored vehicles and public vehicles gathered near the Jerusalem train station, Arab artillery shells fell. The bombardment of the Hebrew University and Hadassah Hospital occupied by Jewish forces on Mount Scopus in the new city by Arab artillery has been ordered to cease at midnight last night by the General Command of the Arab Army.

### British Overseas Troop Levels Unchanged, Defense Plans Revised, Britain Finds Its Position in the Middle East Quite Difficult

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Military observers here say that although the British military's withdrawal from India, Burma, and Palestine in 1947 and 1948 will profoundly affect Britain's global strategy, Britain's overall military responsibilities will not decrease as a result. The goal of reducing military personnel to 700,000 remains, and overseas troop deployments will not be reduced substantially. Defense Minister Alexander told the House of Commons last October that the total number of military personnel at the time was 940,000, which would be reduced by 224,000 in twelve months. These reductions are all normal post-war demobilization; not only will the number of standing troops not decrease, but the number of regular troops will increase slightly. Alexander also said at the time that about one-third of Britain's total troops were stationed overseas. This proportion remains unchanged today. Therefore, if the total number of troops in peacetime is 700,000, the number of army, navy, and air force personnel stationed overseas is about 220,000, which is a significant increase compared to the pre-war overseas troop levels. Strategically speaking, although the nature of British military strategy overseas has changed due to the independence of some colonies, its scope has not diminished. This is due to the unstable global situation after the war. The focus of British defense is currently on the Middle East, Western Europe, and maritime communication lines to its respective territories. The defense of India and Pakistan is no longer directly controlled by Britain. In future wars, Britain can only use political means to obtain deployment rights on the Indian Ocean coast or ensure that India supports Britain in combat or remains strictly neutral. Britain's position in the Middle East is also quite difficult. The abandonment of Palestine has caused it to lose a major base in the Middle East, and whether the Suez Canal Zone can be secured depends on the outcome of British-Egyptian negotiations. Therefore, Britain's future position in the Middle East and its oil supply lines depend on Britain consolidating its friendly alliance treaties with Arab countries and establishing several new bases near Arab countries, such as Malta, Cyprus, and East African Kenya. The East African base is still under construction, and its location is central, at the heart of the East and West and the Middle East, making it a suitable base for any pincer tactics. In Europe, the establishment of the Western European Union has inevitably increased Britain's military responsibilities in Europe compared to before the war. Due to the concentration of the British defense system in Europe and the Middle East, the defense of the autonomous territories will gradually be handed over to the autonomous territories themselves. However, in the event of a major war, the autonomous territories will find it difficult to resist strong enemies on their own. When the British Imperial Chief of Staff visited various territories last year, he had already drafted a common defense plan for the British Commonwealth.

### British Autonomous Territories Celebrate Empire Day, Express Loyalty to the Motherland

[Reuters, Cape Town, 24th] South African Prime Minister Smuts broadcast on Empire Day on the 24th, saying that the British Commonwealth is the most successful experiment in world government. In a world divided by fear, Western countries can only re-draft their plans. The United States must occupy a special position in the task of organizing the West. The union of the United States and the British Commonwealth can restrain any strong enemy. The unity of Western Europe is essential and may turn Europe's tragedy into a great achievement for politicians.

[Ottawa Dispatch] Canadian Prime Minister King told the House of Commons, declaring that Canadians continue to be loyal to the British Commonwealth. In today's turbulent world, such loyalty is even more necessary.

[Sydney Dispatch] Australia celebrated Empire Day according to traditional customs. Prime Minister Chifley told Parliament that he was proud of Australia's position in the British Commonwealth, and he also stated that Australia will continue to be loyal to the British Crown.

### Wallace Opposes U.S. Economic Aid to China

Wallace also said, "We will prove that the U.S. policy in Germany and Japan violates every single aspect of what was announced during the war.

### Vitamin B-Enriched White Rice Can Prevent Beriberi, Art Students and Officials Are Conducting Research

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Saicedo, director of the nutrition team at the U.S. Public Health Office in the Philippines, said that he hopes to obtain $25,000 as funding for the Philippines' white rice nutrition enhancement program. Officials from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization here believe that Saicedo's experiment of increasing the nutritional value of white rice with Vitamin B is in fact the most important scientific contribution to the health of rice-eating people in the world. It is said that they are waiting for the results of the experiment. If the experiment is successful, they will introduce this vitamin-enriched white rice to China, India and other regions for trial use to reduce millions of cases of beriberi.

### Turkey Decides to Strengthen Cooperation with the United States to Safeguard the Peace of the Eastern Mediterranean, Hopes for a Fair Resolution of the Holy Land Issue

[Reuters, Ankara, 23rd] Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak delivered a speech at a political party conference in Sivas today, emphasizing that the joint efforts of the United States and Turkey to safeguard peace in the Eastern Mediterranean region are gradually increasing. The United States is well aware that the defense of the Atlantic Ocean begins in the Eastern Mediterranean. The United States' efforts to strengthen Turkey's defense forces and maintain peace are continuing, and it is hoped that this assistance will continue in the future.

Turkey itself is now devoting half of its limited resources to national defense as the most reliable guarantee of freedom and independence. The rumor that U.S. aid undermines Turkey's independence is definitely untrue. Sadak also said that the recent U.S. proposal to Moscow to discuss the resolution of differences shows that the United States has no intention of aggression against the Soviet Union. The U.S. government has assured Turkey that its proposal to the Soviet Union to discuss bilateral differences does not in any way indicate that U.S. policy in the Mediterranean and Middle East will change. Sadak further said, "We must acknowledge that the dramatic changes in the Palestinian situation have hindered the establishment of peace and stability in the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the bloodshed will no longer continue and will not create a permanent factor of turmoil and unrest, in order to achieve a lasting solution that allows the Arab people to be the masters of their rights. Turkey's policy is peace, and Turkey is always prepared to establish the most friendly relations and cooperation with countries that share our ideas and goals. However, if it involves Turkey's own freedom and independence, Turkey will never agree to compromise."

This loan will include the recent $60 million cotton credit loan, a revolving fund totaling $150 million, and a portion of the $100 million reconstruction fund allocated to Japan and Korea. However, Ashida warned questioning legislators that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen must first regulate the production increase and trade balance before this loan can be obtained. Ashida finally announced that after Japan's surrender, in addition to the considerable number of Japanese people who have already left Japan for other countries, in the near future, South American countries, New York, and other regions will also allow the immigration of a large number of Japanese nationals.

### German Communists Launch Petition Drive, Calling for Petitions for German Unification. Disturbances Occur in U.S. and French Occupation Zones

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] The Communist-controlled German People's Congress launched a plebiscite today to decide on the question of German unification. Many disputes occurred throughout the day, and police used batons to disperse the crowds. According to the German news agency registered with the Soviet authorities, police in the U.S. sector of Berlin attacked the crowds. At the Schoenborn military station in the U.S. sector, U.S. military police dismantled ballot boxes. Police in the French sector of Berlin also took similar action. The U.S. and French authorities in Berlin have banned personnel from the "People's Congress" from collecting opinion votes from households. The British authorities did not prohibit it, but issued a statement stating that the move was "completely superfluous." The atmosphere in the eastern and western parts of Berlin today was completely different. The western part, occupied by Western countries, was still like a normal Sunday, with few pedestrians on the streets and all agencies with closed iron gates. The Soviet zone in the east was covered with red flags and slogans, instructing people to sign opinion forms to exercise this democratic right.

### Ministry of National Defense Decides to Recruit Graduates from Public and Private Medical Schools, Orders Schools to Submit Lists of Past Graduates for Selective Recruitment

[Report from this newspaper] In order to cooperate with the national general mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, the Ministry of National Defense has decided to expand recruitment for medical and health personnel mobilization.

The list of recruited personnel and the reporting date will be temporarily announced in the newspaper by the Joint Service General Headquarters. Once the recruitment is announced, except for those with disabilities or chronic illnesses who must have valid supporting documents to apply for exemption, the rest must report to the designated location within one month, otherwise they will be punished according to law and dealt with .

The medical community in this city is paying close attention to the implementation of this new law, and general opinion is that there are many difficulties.

### Thousands of Monks in Shanghai Face a Threat to Their Livelihoods. Transient Troops Occupy Temples. Buddhist Association Petitions Authorities

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association recently convened a meeting of directors and supervisors because several member temples in the city are often occupied by transient troops, affecting Buddhist services and threatening the livelihoods of thousands of monks. The meeting decided to list the reasons and send representatives to petition the municipal government, the transient military comfort association, the port headquarters, and the Joint Logistics Supply Bureau, respectively. The important reasons stated: (1) The number of free schools, clinics, hospitals, and porridge distribution centers run by temples is quite large, and the expenses are huge, all relying on income from Buddhist services. (2) Recently, a large number of monks and nuns fleeing from Northeast, North China, and Northern Jiangsu to Shanghai have been provided with relief by various temples. (3) Water and electricity supply is difficult, and the consumption has increased sharply, and the temples are unable to pay, and the lack of sanitary facilities in the temples affects health and is a cause for concern. (4) Buddhism is one of the religions, and temples and churches should receive the same protection. (5) The temple houses in this city mostly have lease relationships, and all pay land rent and taxes, and should enjoy the same rights as civil houses. (6) With troops stationed in the temples, there are no Buddhist services at all. According to a member of the branch, the responsible authorities have agreed to gradually clear the troops stationed in various temples after the closing ceremony of the 7th National Games. However, it is heard that temples such as Jade Buddha, Longhua, and Guo'en have not yet been cleared, so it is still hoped that the relevant authorities will actively assist in evacuating them in order to solve the difficulties of the various temples.

### Strictly Restrain Soldiers, Only Allowed to Watch Plays with Tickets, Military and Political Authorities Invite Theater Representatives for Discussion

[Report from this newspaper] The military and political authorities in this city, due to the continuous disputes between some soldiers watching plays without tickets and the theaters in recent days, specially invited various theaters in this city to a discussion at the Municipal Government at 4 pm yesterday. During the meeting, theater representatives expressed that they do not discriminate against soldiers, and they are willing to do their best for all matters of entertainment, fundraising, or comfort. The continuous occurrence of disputes should be guaranteed by the authorities. After exchanging views, it was decided that in the future, matters of comforting soldiers will be strengthened. On the one hand, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and Chairman Fang will come forward to invite the leaders of various military and police units stationed in Shanghai within days, and ask their subordinates to strictly abide by discipline. According to Fang Qiatan, in order to solve this problem, in the future, only soldiers holding complimentary tickets will be allowed to enter the venue to watch plays, otherwise they will not be released. The government will guarantee the survival of the theaters, and it is hoped that the heads of each unit will strictly restrain their subordinates and maintain military discipline.

### Theater Does Not Pay Tax Payment, Judicial Authorities Say It Cannot Be Regarded as Justified

[Report from this newspaper] The major theaters in this city, due to the disturbances caused by soldiers watching plays without tickets, have greatly affected their business. After gathering to discuss, in addition to requesting the municipal government to thoroughly guarantee the safety of the theaters, they will also deposit the entertainment tax collected on behalf of the government in the municipal bank. Before obtaining a reliable security measure, they refuse to submit it to the Finance Bureau. A reporter visited the judicial authorities in this city yesterday and inquired about this matter. The judicial authorities made a solemn statement on this matter: it is considered that paying taxes is the obligation of the people. The entertainment tax collected by the theater was originally collected on behalf of the government. Now, the taxpayers (audience) have already paid the tax, and the theater cannot resist paying this tax as a requirement for obtaining security. Military disturbances are certainly inappropriate, but they can appeal to the relevant authorities. It cannot be regarded as a legitimate reason to demand security by resisting the payment of taxes.

### Can be Enforced if Over the Limited Period

Regarding this move by the theaters, the Finance Bureau can, after each theater exceeds the payment deadline set by the Finance Bureau, send it to the District Court for ruling in accordance with financial regulations. Once the ruling is made, the District Court will execute it. If the District Court's deadline for payment and penalty is exceeded, the District Court can seal the house and enforce it. As for the theaters' appeal, the District Court can still enforce it during the appeal period, and the theaters must not delay the payment date on the pretext of the appeal.

### Two General-Ranked Japanese War Criminals Tried and Concluded, Fukuda Still Equivocates, Military Tribunal Scheduled to Pronounce Sentence at Month's End

[Our Report] The military tribunal, presided over by Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, yesterday held a public trial of Vice Admiral Fukuda Ryosaburo, Fleet Commander of the Japanese war criminal class, and Major General Miyagawa Kiyosaburo, Commander of the 40th Division. As is customary with all Japanese war criminals, both criminals equivocated and offered specious defenses regarding the crimes they committed, which were rigorously refuted by the prosecutor. Following the conclusion of the arguments, the sentencing was scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month.

### During the Invasion of China, Their Heinous Crimes Were Obvious

Fukuda Ryosaburo is a graduate of the Japanese Naval Academy, having served as captain of the Japanese Combined Fleet and captain of the Qingyang warship, and was an active member of the Japanese naval community. At the time when Japan's policy of invading China matured, he violated international covenants and participated in the war of aggression against China. Subsequently, he colluded with Wang Jingwei, the leading Chinese traitor, betrayed his motherland, with the intention of destroying China's unity and weakening its resistance efforts. After the establishment of Wang’s puppet regime, starting from May of the 30th year of the Republic of China, under the command of Konoe Fumimaro who concurrently served as the Director of the Asia Development Board, Fukuda assumed the position of the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, with the purpose of controlling the puppet regime in South China, and training traitorous spies to infiltrate Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian Province, carrying out extensive activities to fulfill their intention of enslaving and eliminating the Chinese nation. On November 30th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the position of Commander of the Taiwan Merchant Fleet, controlling over a thousand aircraft, which constantly flew to bomb the rear areas of China, indiscriminately bombing both defended and undefended cities, in order to kill the Chinese people. On May 15th of the 34th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the position of Commander of the Shanghai Chinese Fleet, and allowed his subordinates to steal over four hundred tons of I-beams, water-flow iron, and wire rod and other steel products stockpiled by the Huade Trading Company in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse.

Miyagawa Kiyosaburo is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy, and before the war served as a staff officer of the Shimonoseki Fortress and Principal of the Army Ordnance School, among other positions.

He came to China in the 31st year of the Republic of China, initially serving as the Chief of Ordnance of the North China Area Army and the General Headquarters of the Expeditionary Army. In August of the 32nd year, he was promoted to the commander of the 40th Division. After the Changheng Campaign in the 33rd year, he led his troops to attack Guilin. Passing through the border of Xing'an County, from Xishan and Rongjiang, he ordered his subordinates to massacre defenseless elderly and civilians, rape women, plunder property, and burn houses. When the division first entered the urban area of Guilin and the Daxie Caoping area from the east side of Guilin, it forcibly abducted dozens of women and provided them to its military members for rape and amusement outside the Lizemen General’s Office. In Xintian Village, a man named Qin was subjected to torture and had his genitals cut off. On February 14th of the 34th year, the division transferred from Guilin to Guangdong, passing through Shixing, ordering his subordinates to rob Rev. Liu Zhenying's Gospel Hall of clocks, jewelry, clothing, and 20,000 yuan in cash. The next day, they set fire to the houses and pushed porters brought from Nanxiong into the fire, burning their chests. When the division retreated from Yongning, Guangxi, passing through Qinzhou, Guangdong, it also ordered its subordinates to rob, rape, massacre, and destroy property.

After the relevant department of the Bureau of Civil Affairs learned of this, considering that the national ID card is related to local security and is extremely important, District Chief Wu was deemed to have neglected his duties, and his staff members embezzled public funds, which was deemed highly inappropriate. He was reprimanded with a major demerit to serve as a warning to others.

### Litigation Case Over Land Dispute Involving Refugees: Defendant Ordered to Post Bail During Investigation

[Our Report] Zhang Tonggeng, residing at No. 1, Lane 82, Subei New Village, Xietu Road, this city, was previously accused by 192 residents of the village, Subei refugees including Li Guangjiao, of intending to obtain illegitimate wealth by implementing public intimidation and endangering public safety, requesting a lawsuit. According to the complaint: They were all refugees who fled from Subei to Shanghai and built shacks on barren land on Xietu Road in May of the 35th year to provide shelter. At that time, the original landlord expressed deep sympathy and did not prevent them from doing so. Unexpectedly, after the base was leveled and developed into a village, the adjacent Qinkong Rubber Factory invested in purchasing the land, intending to put the refugees back in the miserable situation of sleeping in the open and eating in the wind. Li Guangqian and others jointly submitted a document to the Executive Yuan for relief, and officials were sent to investigate and stop the factory. The Qinkong Rubber Factory realized that it was difficult and retreated. Unexpectedly, Zhang Tonggeng, who also claimed to be a refugee and lived in a house on the same base, thought of seizing ill-gotten wealth and colluded with Qinkong, threatening and intimidating the residents of the village, saying that he could demolish the houses for the Qinkong factory, or secretly set fire to them, and making all kinds of threats. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhang Tonggeng and conducted an investigation on suspicion of intimidation. At the end of the court session, he was ordered to provide a shop guarantee and a family guarantee, and the interrogation was rescheduled.

### Poppy Pods Can Substitute for Opium, All Seized from Pharmacies, Liu Xuehai Discusses Three Major Anti-Smoking Efforts

[Our Report] The "163" Anti-Smoking Day is approaching, and the municipal government is preparing to expand the commemoration on a grand scale because this is the first Anti-Smoking Day after the implementation of the constitution. The reporter yesterday visited Liu Xuehai, special envoy for the anti-smoking campaign in the Jiangsu-Shanghai area of the Ministry of the Interior. According to him: In addition to burning a large amount of opium at this year's Anti-Smoking Day, a large number of poppy pods will also be burned. Because many smokers use poppy pods as a substitute after quitting smoking, starting this year, poppy pods have been listed as prohibited items. The police station has confiscated 40,000 to 50,000 catties of poppy pods from various pharmacies, which will be publicly burned at that time, and the Central Film Studio will be asked to take newsreels for commemoration.

According to Special Envoy Liu: Shanghai is a hub for drug manufacturing and trafficking. Drug dealers use sea, land, and air transportation to transport raw materials for drugs to Shanghai, process them, and then transfer them to the mainland. Therefore, if all the opium in Shanghai can be cleared, it is equivalent to clearing half of China's opium.

The Poison of Morphine and Heroin is Hundreds of Times Greater than Opium

According to statistics, more than 300 cases of drug use and trafficking were uncovered in April. After analysis, it was confirmed that there are very few smokers in the upper class in this city, not many in the middle class, and most are in the lower class. Most of what they smoke is not opium, but heroin and morphine, which are hundreds of times more poisonous than opium. According to tests, one hundred taels of opium is equal to one tael of morphine, and one hundred taels of morphine is equal to one tael of heroin. Moreover, heroin can be smoked without opium pipes and lamps, which is convenient for concealment. The three major tasks of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Association are: (1) Re-testing all smokers who have quit in the past, who often relapse, and implementing random inspections for re-testing. (2) Smokers who have not been tested and are still hiding will be investigated and arrested by the police station and sent to the court for strict punishment. (3) Establishing a joint investigation office, where the police station, the garrison headquarters, and the anti-smoking committee will cooperate with each other, with Police Chief Yu Shuping as the director.

Jointly Exchange Information to Prevent International Smuggling

Special Envoy Liu currently also serves as the director of the Shanghai Office of the Anti-Smoking Committee. The main task of the Shanghai Office is to exchange information on opium smuggling with the United Nations and establish an international smuggling intelligence network. Because the situation of international smuggling has been serious recently, there have been many cases of smuggling from Malaya, India, Burma, and Southeast Asia to Shanghai for sale. For example, 60 kilograms of opium were found on the oil tanker of Meifu Oil Company a few days ago. The Anti-Smoking Committee is now launching a joint investigation office and customs personnel responsible for paying close attention.

### Improper Practices Discovered in Sugar Rationing, 23 Businesses Penalized, Price of Sugar Rationing Unchanged This Period

[Our Report] The Sugar Group of the Price Evaluation Committee held its 33rd meeting yesterday, resolving that: (1) The price of sugar rationing will remain unchanged for this period, but because the market price of refined white sugar fluctuates drastically, it was decided to increase the quota by 50%, and the price will remain the same. (2) The 12th period of household sugar, allocated with extra-grade granular white sugar, will be allocated starting in mid-June, and the allocation price will be discussed at the next meeting. (3) For the 11th period of household sugar allocation, the joint investigation results by four institutions, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, and the South Goods Industry Association, found a total of 23 vendors involved in illegal mixing. The evaluation committee, considering that it was their first offense, punished them according to the severity of the circumstances, stopping the allocation for one or two periods and issuing warnings. If they commit the offense again in the future, they will be ordered to permanently close down according to Article 11 of the Measures for Sugar Allocation Based on Population. (4) There is an imbalance between the allocation stores and residents in the Longhua District, and the South Goods Industry Association will reorganize it starting from today.

### Mayor Wu Summons Grain Merchants for Talks, Decides on Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices, Retail Price Not to Exceed 6 Million Yuan per Shi

[Our Report] Last week, rice prices in the city fluctuated sharply due to the influence of the production area. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Minister of the Grain Ministry to suppress and stabilize prices in the production area, and summoned representatives of the city's rice market, Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, Gu Yisheng, Cai Shengming, Xu Songren, and representatives of rice stores, Feng Zhenhua and Hu Xianguo, for talks, deciding on two measures: (1) Starting from today, the People's Food Distribution Association will supply 6,000 shi of rice to the market every day, which will be distributed and sold separately according to the required amount of actual sales at each rice store. The supply price is 5.6 million yuan per shi. (2) The retail price of rice stores shall not exceed 6 million yuan per shi. After summoning the rice merchants for talks, the mayor telegraphed the Police Chief to order the subordinates to strictly enforce the rules. Yesterday, warnings were given first. From today onwards, if it is found that the retail price exceeds 6 million yuan, the person in charge will be arrested.

According to the mayor, the city supplies a total of more than 480,000 shi of grain for per capita rationing every month, reaching 63% of the needs of the city's citizens. Now, if another 6,000 shi are supplied every day, it will account for more than 90% of the total needs.

Flour, Grain, and Edible Oil Prices Soar

Also, it is reported that under the crazy rise in rice prices in Wuxi, the situation is even more serious than in this city. Cargo owners are unwilling to sell, and the asking price is shocking, and the market is in chaos. In the early market, white japonica rice was once quoted as high as 7 million yuan. Thin rice was 6.95 million. Later, because the authorities limited the price and it could not exceed 5.6 million, the commission was increased by 100,000, and it was strictly stipulated that retail outlets could not exceed 6 million. People's hearts turned. Later, white japonica rice fell to 6.75 million, an increase of 560,000 yuan.

The rise in flour prices is raging like fire. The prices of old "Che" and "Bing" brands have risen directly to as high as 200,000 yuan. The "Dongyang" gangs secretly collect wheat bran, and large packages of wheat bran have risen to 1.93 million, a sharp increase of nearly 300,000, accounting for 20%.

The prices of miscellaneous grains have soared into the clouds. Cargo owners are holding on to their goods and are unwilling to sell, and the market is very tight. Yellow beans have risen by 300,000, corn has been actively transacted in Qingdao, rising by 500,000, red beans and green beans have risen by 200,000 and 300,000, respectively, selected green beans have risen by 200,000, and sesame seeds have increased by 500,000, and raw peanuts have risen by 1 million.

Edible oil prices have continued to soar. Few oil factories have opened, and the price of bulk soybean oil is at most 16.4 million, and the closing price has turned soft to 16.2 million yuan. Other factory's single bean oil is around 16 million, up about 1 million. Raw vegetable oil has also increased by 1 million, and a can of raw oil is 18 million, also up 1 million yuan. Small vehicle sesame oil opened at 19 million yuan, and the market retreated to 18.7 million yuan, up 450,000 yuan. Soybean cake trading is active, but actual sales are very rare. After the initial rise, it slightly recovered, increasing by 80,000 yuan.

### Local Market News

Suzhou

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] Rice prices in Suzhou have continued to rise for the past two days. Although the authorities are trying to suppress them, much of the goods are flowing into the black market, and people are optimistic about higher prices, making it difficult to curb the rising trend. Today, the market price for rough rice is 6,150,000 yuan, Bai Geng (polished rice) is 6,900,000 yuan, and door-to-door sales of Bai Mi (polished rice) are priced at 6,600,000 yuan, but the actual selling price has already broken the 7,000,000 yuan mark.

Chengdu

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 24th] Chengdu is experiencing a lack of rain, and rice prices are rising again. Shuang Zu (a type of rice) is at 9,280,000 yuan, and miscellaneous grains are generally rising in price. Many poor people in the suburbs of Chengdu are mainly eating vegetable leaves. The municipal government has resumed the Pingxian (price-controlled) distribution system.

Xi'an

### Stagnant Tea Exports

Tea Market for Foreign Firms: Last week, the Wu Chang Tea Company actively negotiated with suppliers for this year's Lu Zhuang Wenzhou Zhenmei tea. A portion of the deal has been completed, with a price of 19,000,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Although the offered prices reflect the principal's optimistic mindset, foreign buyers ultimately find the price too high, and no one is following up. Given this situation, it will be difficult to maintain the current footing. For other varieties, both buyers and sellers are hesitant, and the process is not lively.

The domestic tea market started calmly in the morning, but later became uniformly brisk, especially aged Te Ji Men (a type of black tea), which continued to rise sharply. Due to the high prices of rice and other commodities, sellers of special-grade tea are trying to hold firm. Transactions are limited to sporadic additions on this street, making them as rare as morning stars.

### Cotton Yarn Futures Bidding

The Yarn Management Committee yesterday (the 24th) still entrusted the China Textile Company to bid on three types of cotton, totaling 2,450 dan.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Cloth Sales Are Weak

Yesterday's cotton yarn market benefited from the easing of credit, with ample funds available to the industry. Transactions were frequent, and demand from merchant groups was strong. The market was mainly driven by destocking, and even though Textile Construction put up another auction sign, prices remained firm.

The opening price of 42-count Lan Feng fine yarn in the morning was 5,000,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend, attracting many buyers. Later, due to speculative buying by retail investors, prices rose repeatedly, reaching a closing price of 312,000,000 yuan, a further increase of 12,000,000 yuan from Saturday.

21-count Shuang Ma yarn saw strong destocking and reached a new high of 240,000,000 yuan at the close, a further increase of 10,000,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 3,000,000 to 13,500,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with news of profitable sales, and various merchant groups adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Actual sales on this street were stagnant, and activity from merchant groups was minimal. The industry, however, was selling off a considerable amount of spot goods.

The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth jumped to 130,000 yuan, but there were few buyers, and the price once declined. However, as the market neared closing, news of rising yarn prices emerged, and the price recovered to a closing price of 7,003,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan from Saturday. The markets for other cloths also stabilized.

### Improving Bank Finances

Dai Mingli Indicates Three Principles

Regarding the issue of strengthening financial institutions and improving the quality of bank operations, since the Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, Dai Mingli, announced in Shanghai that the Ministry of Finance had consulted with the National Economic Commission to formulate measures, all sectors have expressed concern about this. Li Lixia, Director of the Financial Administration, stated last Saturday that the capital of banks must be increased to at least 50 billion yuan. Recently, reporters learned from Dai Mingli that the improvement of bank quality has now reached a concrete stage. The measures being discussed by the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Commission may be more flexible than the current measures. It is reported that three principles have now been determined for these measures: the capital of urban banks should be higher than that of inland banks; the capital of banks should be higher than that of Qian Zhuang. Dai also stated that the total capital of banks in urban areas, even at 50 billion yuan, still seems insufficient. For rural banks, around 50 billion yuan should be sufficient to meet current needs.

### Woolen Goods are Quiet Now

The spot market for woolen goods continues to be quiet. Due to high selling prices, buyers are hesitant. Sales of summer goods are decreasing rather than increasing. Although the market sentiment for autumn and winter goods is slightly better, there are few buyers with the financial strength to pre-order. As for future orders, imports have long been cut off, and domestic manufacturers with strong capital are not willing to confirm orders. Small factories have made some orders, but many want to collect 70% to 100% of the payment upfront, which makes potential customers feel unenthusiastic, creating a situation where both the spot market and future orders are quiet.

### Many Sell-Off Rumors, Chinese Stocks Listless

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were somewhat fearful due to the inauguration of the President of the National Bank and the appearance of the heads of the Executive Yuan. As non-industry stocks fell from high levels across the board, the process was listless, and morale was dispersed. The market was even weaker near the close.

In the early morning, the general sentiment, given that the head of the Executive Yuan had not yet been determined, was not without some restlessness. Yong Yarn opened high at 3,000 yuan and even rose to a high price of 3,060 yuan. Many people sold off, and the agency fee opened at the original price and fell to 3,005 yuan. However, at this time, morale was still good, and the price rose back to 3,050 yuan. After that, the market declined steadily amid rumors of sell-offs. Credit tightened slightly, and small but strange sell-off rumors were investigated. The midday close retreated to 2,930 yuan. Compared to the previous settlement, China-America, Jingfu, Match, Xingguang, and Xinhua fell by half a percentage point, Huaxin, Xinyi, and Commercial remained flat, and the rest declined slightly.

In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 2,960 yuan, but buyers waited and watched, and the price retreated to 2,885 yuan. The National Bank had a large negative balance, and the price retreated to a low of 2,865 yuan. After a struggle between buyers and sellers, the market closed at 2,870 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Huaxin, Xinguang, Qinxing, Match, and Xinhua remained flat, and the rest declined slightly. Off-market unlisted stocks were stable, with bank stocks being the most popular.

Foreign Stocks Yesterday also started strong but ended weak. Steel once reached a high price of 1,450,000 yuan, which was still driven by buying interest. Yisha opened in the morning at 5,500,000 yuan and retreated from 5,580,000 yuan to close at 5,200,000 yuan. Hong Kong Electric also reported gains. Although the bank groups and retail investors bought, the securities groups and Guangzhou groups sold. Compared to last Saturday, Yisha and British-American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson and Paper Mill and Plantation declined slightly. Industry and Guangzhou Shipping and Industry and Steel each fell by half a percentage point.

Government Bonds Yesterday were slightly stable, with about 3,000,000 yuan in transactions. Unified C opened in the morning at 240,000 yuan and rose to 262,000 yuan, before slightly retreating. Compared to last Saturday, Unified C rose by 10,000 yuan, and A, B, C, and D each rose by 4,000 yuan.

After careful consideration, President Cheng made the following three decisions: (1) The school will find ways to issue refunds to self-funded students who have already applied for deferred payment of the second half of this month's meal fees, but hopes that the students will understand the school's difficulties and try to make up for the payments themselves; (2) Starting in June, the school will review and provide subsidies to needy self-funded students each month. The maximum amount will not exceed the full public fee amount, and the minimum amount will depend on the number of people who need the subsidy, which can be extended to the end of the summer vacation; (3) Long-term loans are still waiting for the new government to decide. The current government is in the process of reorganization and will need to extend the request time. According to the Self-Funded Students' Association of the school, the school will transfer 1 billion to 2 billion yuan of construction funds to subsidize meal fees for self-funded students and will cooperate with the parents of the students to repay the loans in installments.

### Ministry of Education Indicates Two Restrictions on Fudan Self-Funded Students Becoming Normal School Students

[Our Newspaper] Fudan University's self-funded and half-self-funded students repeatedly requested full public funding on the first day of this month. The school was unable to do so due to Ministry orders and temporarily decided on a flexible treatment method, changing some first- and second-year self-funded students in various departments to normal school students, enjoying public funding treatment. This was reported in our newspaper on the 2nd of this month. Now, it is known that after the school reported this method to the Ministry of Education, the responsible persons of the General Affairs and Higher Education Departments of the Ministry indicated two restrictions: (1) The number of self-funded students in various departments of Fudan University who are changed to normal school students due to requests for public funding shall not exceed the prescribed quota; (2) Students who transfer departments must start from the beginning of the semester and may not transfer departments midway during the semester. Furthermore, it was learned from the school that the number of students who have been changed to normal school students has not yet exceeded the prescribed quota.

The representatives' meeting for this city's university sports games was held at the Municipal Physical Education College the other day. More than ten representatives from schools such as Jiaotong University, Tongji University, and Ordnance Engineering School attended. The meeting was chaired by Jin Zhaojun, the president of the Municipal Physical Education College. It was decided that due to insufficient preparation time for the schools after the National Games, the games would be postponed to June 4th and 5th, starting at 2:00 PM at the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium. The registration deadline was also extended to 5:00 PM on the 29th of this month. Schools that have not yet registered may do so within the extended deadline. Furthermore, during the meeting, many schools suggested grouping the competitions to increase interest. After heated discussion, the following principles were decided:

(1) The Physical Education College will form an independent group. (2) If five or more universities, colleges, and vocational schools participate, they will be divided into three groups. (3) If a college or vocational school group has fewer than five schools, the colleges and vocational schools will be combined into one group. (4) If the total number of colleges and vocational schools is less than five, they will not be grouped. (5) The same principles will apply to both male and female students. If this is the case, schools will have more opportunities to score points, and it is expected that more than 20 schools will participate in the future.

### Two Penalty Kicks Saved Qingbai: British Navy Won First, Lost Later; Qingbai Escaped Death 3-2

[Reported by this newspaper] The combined football team of the British ships London and Wakeful played a friendly match with Qingbai at Yiyuan at 5:00 PM yesterday. Qingbai came from behind in the second half with two penalty kicks in the last seven minutes, defeating the British Navy team 3-2. It can be said that they escaped death. Each side scored one goal in the first half, and the match was tied. About 2,000 spectators watched the match at Yiyuan.

Unexpectedly Exciting

The British Navy football team has never made a deep impression due to the lack of strong teams. However, the team that took the field yesterday played well and launched fierce attacks. Qingbai was embarrassed for a long time. If it weren't for the two penalty kicks, Qingbai would have been defeated. Yesterday, the fans had an unexpected harvest. The game was clean, fast, and quite exciting. Unfortunately, the grass at Yiyuan was long, and the ground was wet after the rain, leading to frequent loss of control, which was a minor flaw. Both sides had several thrilling moments and wonderful shots that hit or grazed the posts. It was a pity they missed by a fraction. The British Navy players were tall and ran fast. The center backs and inside forwards were especially good. Qingbai's forwards seemed to be a step slower. Wu Qixiang's absence was also a reason for Qingbai's nervousness. Qingbai, except for Meng Yiliang and Fei Chunhua, was made up of young players, which inevitably paled in comparison. He Chunhui was the referee, and Chen Jixiang and Shen Huichun were the linesmen.

One Goal Each

The British took the offensive first, but without success. Xiao Fei got the ball and crossed it. Yin Qingbing hit the goalkeeper's hand. Xiao Fei came again, and Gu Qingbing headed it. Wei Geshi caught it and kicked it out. Twelve minutes later, Xiao Fei cut in along the side again. Xiao Luo lightly flicked it, and the goalkeeper扑out it out. Qingbai attacked repeatedly without success. The British army was aggressive and gained an advantage. At 17 minutes, Griffin and Hachey pounced fiercely, but Huang Shijie saved them all. At 22 minutes, Liu Tiyi knocked on the door, but it was too high. Afterwards, Jin Lingsheng and Xu Yiti were injured while fighting for the ball, but fortunately they recovered soon. At 28 minutes, Xiao Luo got the ball and passed it to Lingsheng. Jin cut in and crossed. Yin Qingbing was behind, rushing forward like a flying, breaking through the defense. Qingbai took the lead. Subsequently, Jin Lingsheng got the ball twice and attacked, but both failed. At 33 minutes, the British army's forward crossed it. Meng Yiliang kicked it out not far. Evans窜rushed up and swept it in. Each side scored one goal in the first half, and the match was a draw.

Turning Defeat into Victory

After the break, Qin Bigaoliu Tiyi went off the field, and Zhang Fenggang Gu Yice entered as substitutes. The stalemate lasted until eight minutes, when Hachey carried the ball deep. Shijie撲empty, and Griffin rolled into the net with the ball, taking a 2-1 lead. The British army was very rampant, and Qingbai counterattacked again and again, but to no avail. From bad luck comes good luck. At 25 minutes, Mao Shiman tripped Xiao Fei in the penalty area. Xiao Luo took the penalty kick and tied the score 2-2. After that, the British army launched another attack. In the last few minutes before the end of the match, Jin Lingsheng went deep along the side and had the opportunity to cross. Meng Yiliang took the opportunity to pull the door. Mao Shiman touched阿斗the ball with his hand. Xiao Fei took the penalty kick and swept it in, leading Qingbai to turn defeat into victory 3-2.

### On Kierkegaard

— Jingguan (Observing Quietly)

The 19th century in Europe produced two eccentrics in the world of thought. These two eccentrics both voiced serious protests against the Western civilization of the time. They were both dissatisfied with the prevailing ideas of the 19th century. They both argued that the world of thought should undergo some changes. Therefore, their ideas were incompatible with their times and were regarded as traitors to the world of thought. However, traitors to the world of thought are often heroes of the world of thought. Ideas that are rejected or ignored by one era are not necessarily worthless. The value of these ideas may be discovered and revered by another era. Thinkers often stand ahead of their times. If the distance between a thinker and his time is too great, he may not be recognized by his time. Sima Qian's saying, "Store it in famous mountains, waiting for the right person," is based on this understanding.

These two eccentrics were Friedrich Nietzsche of Germany and Søren Kierkegaard of Denmark. The former is well known to the Chinese and does not need further introduction from the author. The latter is rarely heard of by the Chinese, and even in the English-speaking world, people have only known about Kierkegaard for about a decade. Before a dozen years ago, there were no English translations available of Kierkegaard's works. The earliest English translation was a selected translation published by the University of Texas in 1932. It was not until after the outbreak of World War II that Kierkegaard's works gradually began to be translated by English-speaking scholars. Now, almost all of Kierkegaard's works have been translated into English. From the perspective of the English-speaking world, Kierkegaard is a thinker who was discovered during this war. However, Kierkegaard was discovered earlier in Germany. Two famous contemporary German philosophers, such as Jaspers and Heidegger, were both influenced by Kierkegaard's ideas in establishing their philosophies. The so-called "Philosophy of Existence" originates from Kierkegaard. Even the "Existentialism" currently popular in France, advocated by the writer Jean-Paul Sartre, also regards Kierkegaard as its founder. Kierkegaard has become an important figure in modern thought, and we cannot ignore him.

So, who exactly was Søren Kierkegaard? He was a Danish poet, religious thinker, and philosopher. He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1813 and died in 1855, at the age of only forty-two. He was once passionately in love with a woman, but for no apparent reason, he abandoned her. After that, he remained unmarried for the rest of his life. In university, his life was quite romantic, but soon he became a devout Christian. He considered himself a true Christian, but he was extremely dissatisfied with the Christianity of his time. In his later years, he wrote articles attacking the Danish state church. Therefore, he was almost a traitor within the church. But now it is different. Now he is regarded as a "religious poet," "the greatest Protestant of the nineteenth century," "one of the most profound 'interpreters' of the psychology of religious life since St. Augustine," and even "one of the greatest and most unique thinkers of all time."

What were the ideas of this thinker? Naturally, this cannot be explained in a few words. What can be said here is that he was an opponent of abstract thought and pure intellectualism. He believed that man is not a pure thinker, but an "Existing Individual." Truth is also not purely objective, but subjective. Truth is subjective truth, which individuals must discover and grasp with their absolute sincerity and total passion. This is not a cold observation or a ruthless contemplation. It is a manifestation of the individual's entire spirit and strength. This is an internal struggle, a most important "Choice." Everyone has to discover their own truth, "to discover the truth that is true for me—the idea by which I can live and die." The choice of this truth is my own choice. What determines my choice is the "existential thinking" of my "existing individual," not abstract thinking. The choice I make regarding the relationship between life and death cannot be shaken by any abstract thinking. For those who have chosen Jesus Christ as their truth, Kierkegaard says, "The only possible objection is that he might be saved by another method. He cannot answer that. It is like someone saying to another who is in love, yes, but you might fall in love with another woman. To this, the person in love must say, I cannot answer that, for I only know that she is my beloved. When this lover can answer this question, he is no longer a lover; so when a believer can answer the above question, he is no longer a believer." Faith is not a matter of intellect, nor is truth merely a matter of intellect. Those who try to solve everything with intellect or who use intellect as the basis of religion are opposed by Kierkegaard.

When people are disappointed with intellect, Kierkegaard's ideas are bound to be welcomed. War is the failure of intellect. The fact that Kierkegaard's ideas became popular during and after the war is very relevant. The author does not dare to accept Kierkegaard's ideas. They are too dangerous. Personal sincerity and passion can grasp truth, but they can also grasp error. Choices not based on intellect are often wrong choices. However, there is no doubt that he and his ideas are worthy of attention and study.

### The Psychological Personality

— Sun Qi

The body is the dwelling of the mind, and the mind is the master of the body. The two have an inseparable relationship. The mind, separated from the body, loses its foundation and cannot exist. The body, separated from the mind, is reduced to an unconscious substance, without any function. The whole of a person is composed of body and mind. The body is the expression of the mind, and the mind is the expression of the body. As our Confucian predecessors said: "When the heart is solemn, the body is relaxed; when the heart is respectful, the countenance is reverent." This is the idea. Therefore, human life and activities include both physical and mental aspects. Physical health is certainly important, but mental health is even more important. Without a healthy body, one is certainly not capable of undertaking great responsibilities; without a healthy mind, how can one be a symbol of personality and improve society? Sun Yat-sen said: "The state is the accumulation of people, and the person is the vessel of the mind. State affairs are a phenomenon of mass psychology. Therefore, the rise and fall of politics depend closely on the vitality or listlessness of the human heart." This means that whether or not a person's mind is healthy is of the utmost importance to the individual and the nation.

Human life and activities are due to the existence of the organism. With the existing organism, one becomes aware of the "I." After a baby is born, it knows to suck milk to maintain its life. As it grows, everything it encounters is for the sake of "I." All activities are based on the "I." The "I" is recognized by everyone and valued by everyone. Therefore, modern self-psychologists (Self Psychology), such as James Ward, McDougall, and Miss Mary W. Calkins, believe that of all things in the universe, only the self is most real, and everything else is unreliable. This means that the primary purpose of life is the self (Self). The self is the unified subject of physical and mental activity, and in psychology, it is a functional term. Therefore, if we want to maintain mental health, we must first have a correct understanding of the self. The reason why the self can exist must be expressed through personality. The so-called self-love is to maintain personality, which shows that the relationship between personality and self is very close. As Li Shicen said: "The psychological personality is centered on the self."

The self is due to one's own recognition, and one's ability to recognize must be based on self-awareness. Calkins said: "The positive basis of the self is based on introspection," which is also the idea. Self-awareness, in short, is self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is not easy. As the saying goes: "It is difficult to know others, but it is even more difficult to know oneself." The method of study of the great Greek philosopher Socrates was "Know thyself." To know oneself, the first thing is to be able to introspect, to have the spirit of Zengzi's "I examine myself three times a day," to use the psychological method of introspection to examine one's own shortcomings and advantages, and after knowing one's own shortcomings, to find ways to improve or avoid them, so as to reduce errors or failures, and after knowing one's own advantages, to give full play to one's strengths and benefit society. If a person cannot know himself, or is arrogant, or abandons himself, he will not only harm himself, but also harm society. Therefore, self-awareness occupies a very important position in the realization of the self. For, in addition to the physical form, there is also a kind of spiritual function that can represent the existence of the "I." Although this concept may not be clear to everyone in general, in practice, no matter who it is, they can be angry or ashamed because of slander, or happy or apprehensive because of rewards. All actions of one's self are known to come from one's own spirit. Even illiterate people, as long as their minds are healthy, can do this. This is a clear fact. As for people with a higher level of self-awareness, their introspection is better than others, and they can better recognize their own spiritual function. This can be said to be "my self-awareness."

The most important thing about the spiritual function for the self is the unity of my self. Although my mood and thoughts may sometimes be different, the mind that recognizes things and the consciousness that distinguishes right from wrong are always the same. Yesterday, I could recognize the things of the world and form ideas. Today, this ability has not disappeared, but still exists. Even in comparison, there is some progress, and this progress is a continuation of the past, based on the past, and not something that other elements have been added to. Therefore, this understanding has a fundamentally unchanging permanence. This unchanging permanence is the expression of self-unity. Unity is a key to defending personality. The reason why we can take one path forward without going astray is entirely due to this unifying force. If we lose this unifying force, then the personality will inevitably be split, such as the same consciousness, operating in two ways at the same time, and the two ways have no connection. This is called simultaneous dual personality. As for the same personality gradually changing into a different personality, personality A suddenly becomes personality B, this is called continuous dual personality. This phenomenon of lack of apperception is actually a psychological pathology. Therefore, personality takes the self as its content, and the completion of personality is the unification of the self.

The unification of the self is the spiritual action of consciousness. The development of the unification of consciousness is very great. It can not only unify all the physiological activities of the five senses and hundreds of skeletons, but also unify the psychological activities of knowing, feeling, and willing. Among the so-called knowing, feeling, and willing in psychological activities, the will is completely in charge. Will is the source of the establishment of personality. Will is important in having a purpose and forging ahead. That "knowing" that is important in careful observation, and "feeling" that is important in excellent cultivation, are only side effects that help the will to become enriched. The stimulation of the will is the ideal (Ideal). The ideal is the secret to making people progress, and it is also a good way to prevent people from falling. As the saying goes: "Who is not as good as me in loving goodness?" The heart of making progress is a natural phenomenon. This phenomenon is manifested psychologically, but it is the realization of the self. Therefore, the activity of the self is the activity of the will. The will has the highest authority, and it powerfully controls and overcomes all instinctive emotional impulses that do not coincide with its purpose, so that the individual of the mind is kneaded into a healthy self, which can satisfy the self's proper ideals, and obtain the happiness of self-realization.

The reason why man is man is that man has personality. The reason why personality is sound is that the self is healthy. With a healthy self, one can take personality as the goal, restrain the indulgence of the "small self," and try to develop the "big self." Mencius said: "Those who follow their greater part are great men, and those who follow their smaller part are small men." The "greater part" is the "big self," which refers specifically to the spiritual side. The "smaller part" is the "small self," which refers specifically to the ears, eyes, mouth, and stomach. If a person can realize the preciousness of the greater part, and expand and enrich it from a little of the mind—spiritual function, he can get the "true self." The so-called "true self" is the spiritual self, not the "illusory self" of the physical self. The entire body can be old and die, but the function of the spirit can be as usual. The common term "spiritual immortality" really refers specifically to the value of the spirit, and it is not like the "soul after death" in the sense of the religionists.

One's own recognition of the self and striving for the realization of personality is certainly an important task for establishing oneself and advancing in virtue, but at the same time, one must also have the mentality of self-existence, other-existence, and other-existence, self-existence, and "benefit the world," "if one wants to establish oneself, one must also establish others; if one wants to achieve oneself, one must also help others achieve." Only in this way can one show the greatness of one's own personality. Therefore, the lack of order in today's society and the decline of people's minds are certainly related to people's unhealthy psychology and lack of self-awareness, but the main reason is still due to the decadent habit of most people "only sweeping the snow in front of their own doors, and not caring about the frost on others' roofs." Especially the knowledge class in general who bear social responsibility, mostly hold a "look out for one's self" attitude, thinking that things are not done by me, or things are not related to me, so they do not care. One should know that the relationship between the individual and society is very close. The activities of the individual can affect the whole society, and the individual is also affected by the whole society at the same time. Therefore, for the sake of the individual and for the sake of society, one must not only do good and not do evil oneself, but also persuade others to do good and not do evil. Doing good and not doing evil oneself is passive, and persuading others to do good and not do evil is active. Otherwise, others doing evil and not doing good will directly harm society, and indirectly will also harm each individual. A gentleman loves others with virtue, not with indulgence. Throwing a stone can scald the whole sea, and planting good causes will surely have good results. We must not only strive for the nobility of individual personality, but also use the consciousness of the same kind to promote the nobility of other people's personality, and use the mutual influence of each individual's personality to improve people's psychology and to improve society, so that we can be effective.

From the perspective of the whole of mankind, the level of personality is extremely inconsistent, and the grades of personality are also uneven. The reason why personality can be noble and why it can be great is that it relies on the strength of the human mind. The mind is the "source of all things." We must first be able to maintain mental health, so that people can make appropriate adaptations to external or internal stimuli, and can adapt to changes in order to establish the dignity of personality, and then complete its complete personality.

### Aristotle's First Philosophy

— Ziqiang

Although Aristotle generally included all branches of science within the scope of philosophy, his system implicitly distinguished between natural and social sciences, with philosophy placed above these sciences. He called philosophy the study of the highest principles, or first philosophy; other disciplines were second (his physics was called second philosophy), third, and so on. Aristotle, following Socrates and Plato, believed that knowledge was nothing more than a collection of concepts. Concepts are principles, so knowledge is merely a collection of principles. When principles are categorized, they form different fields of knowledge. Roughly speaking, Aristotle's system is divided into three categories: theoretical, practical, and creative. More specifically, it is further divided into physics, biology, psychology, and so on—all based on the categorization of principles. By combining these categories of principles and using inductive and deductive methods to find the principle that governs all principles, he called it the highest principle. The study of the highest principle he called the study of the highest principle or first philosophy; in reality, it is what is commonly called philosophy. From the perspective of his entire system, it should be called philosophy in the narrow sense.

Aristotle's view of philosophy as the study of the highest principles is essentially the same as Plato's view of philosophy as the apex of all knowledge. Therefore, Aristotle's theory, apart from the scientific aspects lacking in Plato's work, follows the same path in philosophy (in the narrow sense, that is, metaphysics) as Plato's: Plato built philosophy on ordinary knowledge and rational knowledge, while Aristotle built philosophy on the various sciences. They both pioneered what is now called the metaphysics of science. Below, we will compare their similarities and differences in their understanding of philosophy (Plato called it the study of Forms or dialectic, Aristotle called it first philosophy or the study of the highest principles) in more detail:

Similarities: (1) Object—The object of philosophy is pure Being, the common foundation of all existence. (2) Task—Philosophy seeks the roots of things, aiming to reach the universal and ultimate basis and cause behind all things. (3) Position—The position of philosophy is above all learning, being the synthesis of all knowledge. (4) Function—The function of philosophy is to seek the highest good and happiness for life. Because of their above view of philosophy, philosophers were virtually seen as omniscient in their eyes, their knowledge being the quintessence of all learning.

Differences: (1) Content—Plato believed that philosophy included both knowledge and action; Aristotle, however, clearly distinguished between knowledge and action. For him, philosophy stems only from the theoretical instinct and has nothing to do with the practical instinct. (2) Material—Plato's materials were limited to pure concepts; his philosophy was merely a large collection of the separation and aggregation of Forms. Aristotle's materials, however, were empirical facts. His so-called highest principles can be reduced to empirical facts, and in fact are derived from experience.

By comparing Aristotle's so-called first philosophy with the rest of his system, we can gain a clearer understanding of it: (1) Distinction between the practical and creative parts—(A) The goal of practical and creative actions is not the action itself, but the result of the action. For example, the goal of ethical action is the discovery of behavioral norms, and the goal of artistic action is the creation of works of art. Philosophical action is different. Philosophical action is thought, and the goal of thought is thought itself, not another thing outside of thought. (B) Philosophy is a matter of pure thought and has nothing to do with emotion, feeling—the so-called non-intellectual part of human nature. The study of the practical and creative parts, however, is closely related to emotion and feeling. The inability of medicine to detach itself from sensation is self-evident, and ethics is also inextricably linked to issues such as desire. (2) Distinction between physics and mathematics—The object of physics is tangible, changeable things, because its object is entirely that which is in the form. That which is in form has no formless and immutable form. The object of mathematics is immutable, but it has form, such as geometric figures. Although they never change, they have shape. Only the object of philosophy is immutable and formless, because the highest principle in the universe cannot change and has no form.

### Random Notes from the Academic World (23)

— Zhang Qiyun

Western Philosophers on Chinese Civilization (Continued)

Emerson believed that China's advantages lay not only in its emphasis on education. Chinese history has several major inventions, and China has also made contributions to astronomy. Its historical records are more ancient than those of other countries. It is undeniable that China in the past spent too little effort in exploring natural phenomena. However, for thousands of years, countless Chinese scholars have devoted their lives to academics, engaging in profound and far-reaching thinking. Once Chinese scholars shift their efforts to the natural world, Chinese scientific research will definitely make accelerated progress. The Chinese science of the last thirty years can serve as proof of this. In 1935, the late Dr. Ding Wenjiang, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, wrote a concise report entitled "The Study of Chinese Science," published in the British journal Nature on August 10 of that year. In recent years, Professor J.B.S. Haldane of the University of London said in his new book "The Social Function of Science": "Judging from its past achievements, it is not difficult to see that the background of Chinese culture, if it can be slightly reformed, can become a very good garden for scientific work. With the Chinese attitude of rigorous work, the habit of patience, and the virtue of moderation, it can be expected that China's contribution to science will definitely not be less than that of Europe and the United States." Some of the sprouts of China's new science have been transplanted from all directions. At present, many famous professors in Chinese universities have studied in the West, and those who have returned to China and made significant achievements in education and academia are indeed numerous.

After the end of World War I, both Dewey and Russell were invited to China to lecture at various universities. Based on his personal experience, Russell commented on Chinese culture, stating: "The strength of Western culture lies in the scientific method, and the strength of Chinese culture lies in a rational view of life. We hope that the two can gradually combine into one." In recent years, there has been a new trend of thought in China that is developing simultaneously with science, namely the New Confucianism movement. This is a positive and critical humanism. Chinese culture will be revived by the convergence of New Confucianism and science, and it is believed that this new culture will have appropriate countermeasures for the current global problems, or at least help in the solution of the problems.

A great contemporary philosopher once said: "The more we understand Chinese art, Chinese literature, and Chinese philosophy of life, the more we admire the superb realm of Chinese culture. In terms of the vastness of its history and the size of its population, Chinese culture is clearly the most magnificent school of world culture." This is the opinion of A.N. Whitehead, a retired professor at Harvard University. Of course, Chinese culture has many weaknesses, and we are not unaware of them. Chinese scholars have an open mind and are willing to accept new foreign concepts. With the increasing frequency of modern international contact, we deeply feel that the internationality of academic culture is becoming increasingly strong.

In his later years, Emerson declared that a new era was about to begin, meaning that Eastern and Western cultures would converge. Emerson was the first American scholar to focus on the study of Eastern thought and artifacts. His interest in Chinese culture did not diminish in his old age, so he was the most suitable person to be the proclaimer and interpreter of this new era. Great thinkers in history often transcend their times, and Emerson's vision and insight can be said to be lasting and ever new.

### Reader's Opinion: The Simple Facilities of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway: Passengers Jointly Request Improvement

Dear Editor: We are passengers on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Due to the company's various corrupt practices, we find it difficult to remain silent. We are using a corner of your newspaper to appeal to the public to urge them to improve.

(1) Simple Facilities: Regarding facilities, including stations, vehicles, roads, bridges, etc., everything is currently done perfunctorily. The stations are not decent. Passengers have nowhere to sit while waiting for the bus (the Shanghai station is slightly better, but there are too few benches). Vehicles often "break down." The roads and bridges are in a terrible state. A lot of road maintenance fees are collected, but they are unwilling to repair the roads properly. In damaged areas of the bridge surface, two additional fir trees are added, which is dangerous. They save money, but the safety of passengers is a major problem.

(2) Poor Service: Most of the staff at each station are slow and unreasonable, especially at a certain small station along the line. Passengers not only get off the bus first, but also squeeze up. As a result, those getting off cannot get off. The staff ignore this. The Shanghai station is also terribly dirty, and no one is seen cleaning the bus. Buying tickets and departing do not follow the prescribed time. Sometimes tickets are sold only ten minutes before departure. Sometimes passengers buy tickets and go in, but cannot find the bus, and have to wait for an hour, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The order at the Shanghai and Dachang stations is very chaotic.

(3) Rapid Price Increase: The company's bus ticket prices are expensive. The speed and multiple of the price increase are also quite alarming. The price increase of Shanghai's public utilities is only about 20%, and they are still criticized and pointed out by all sectors of society. They, however, increase by 50% at once. At the same time, we know that they are making money every month and are not losing money, so the repeated price increases are unreasonably exploitative.

Finally, we ask the Shanghai-Taicang Company to recognize the nature of their own business and seek improvement to benefit the public. Readers Shen Xiaojian, Zhengqing, Wang Deming, Jiang Yongan, etc., respectfully submit this.

### Visiting Mei Lanfang Again (Part 1)

— Cao Zikai

Last year, during the plum blossom season, I went to visit Dr. Mei shortly after returning to Shanghai from Chongqing. Photos and articles were published in Shen Bao. After Qingming this year, I took my eldest daughter Chen Bao and fourth daughter Yiyin, two daughters who love Peking opera, to Shanghai to watch Dr. Mei perform. Fearing to add to his social obligations during the performance period, I originally did not intend to visit him. However, after watching a performance of The Goddess of the Luo River, I ended up visiting him the next day because Chen Bao and Yiyin were eager to see the true face of the "King of Actors." After seeing his true face, we planned to watch The Selling Horse that evening.

This time, I did not tell anyone else and did not invite a photographer to come along. Instead, I asked his erhu teacher, Mr. Ni Qiuping, to notify him and then quietly visited him with my two daughters at 4 PM. Just as we were about to get into the car, I happened to meet my second daughter's husband, Song Mufa, on Sima Road. He was sitting on a rattan chair by the roadside, having his shoes shined. When he heard that we were going to visit Mr. Mei, he stopped shining one of his shoes and jumped into our car to go with us. Chen Bao and Yiyin said it was "good luck from heaven!" Because he also loved Peking opera, although not as much as Chen Bao and Yiyin. In the eyes of Peking opera fans, getting to know the true face of the "King of Actors" was more glorious than "beholding his great face" and brought more "Dharma joy" than "meeting the Tathagata." So when we got out of the car in front of the Mei residence and knocked on the door, and two small foreign dogs ran out, Mufa teased them, saying, "Wouldn't you be happy to become one of them?"

Sitting in the guest room where I had sat last spring, I looked at the furnishings in the room, which were not much different from last spring. Thinking back on my own mood, it was also not much different from last spring. "Eternal youth" is the perfect phrase to bless the host we were visiting. The host had not yet come downstairs, so the Qin player Ni Qiuping came to accompany us first. This Qin player is also quite extraordinary: he plays the erhu for Peking opera on stage, but he is very fond of Western music off stage, cherishing sonatas and symphonies more than precious jade. Because his daughter has this family learning, she is a talented student at the National Conservatory of Music. He said that his love for Western music was due to reading my old book "Musical Knowledge" (Asia East Library edition). Therefore, he often corresponded with me, and this was the first time we had met. I live in the Zhenhua Hotel, diagonally opposite the Tianchan Theater. Every night after playing the erhu, he would bring his Qin bag to the hotel to chat with me until late at night. Half of the conversations were about Peking opera, and half about Western music. I study Western music but love Peking opera, and he plays Peking opera but loves Western music. They are opposite in appearance but complementary in reality, so the conversation never ends. This afternoon, he came to the Mei residence to wait for us. This was the first time I saw Ni Qiuping during the day. After chatting with him for a few words, the host came downstairs.

During the handshake, I saw that Dr. Mei looked even younger than last spring. His face was fuller, his hair was darker, and his attitude was more amiable. I also caught a glimpse of Chen Bao, Yiyin, and Mufa, staring at him without blinking, without saying a word, without moving, like the three bodhisattvas lost in the City God Temple. I found it funny. Unexpectedly, their gazes turned from the host to me, and they all laughed. I understood the meaning of their laughter: I am four years younger than this host, but my face is haggard and my hair is white, and I look old. This older brother, who is four years older than me, is still young and could pass for my younger brother. Moreover, he can perform beautiful poses on stage in the evening! God's creation of man is really lacking in common sense! How can it not make people laugh?

I raised the issue of the stage performance of The Goddess of the Luo River, hoping to film a sound and color movie so that it can be disseminated permanently and universally. Mr. Mei said there were extreme difficulties and it could not be realized for the time being. I had also urged him to make a movie last spring. I think this matter is his most important and urgent task. We who do calligraphy and painting can make and print our original manuscripts so that they can be permanently and universally circulated. Although opera singers have records, they can only preserve their singing skills; to preserve their performance skills, it is necessary to make a movie. Science has advanced to this atomic age and can use a device the size of a button to kill millions of people in an instant, but it is unwilling to make a few films for our "genius of the century." This is again lacking in common sense, how can it not make people sigh!

The topic turned to symbolic representation. Mr. Mei talked about the performance of throwing water he saw in Moscow: a large piece of white cloth, with people holding the four corners, moving, like water waves; holes are opened in the cloth, people jump into the holes, and then come out, like throwing water. He said that our Fishermen's Revenge is different. It doesn't need cloth, but uses the up and down of the body to represent the undulation of the waves. When he said this, he was sitting on the sofa wearing a suit and slightly making the posture of Gui Ying'er, and everyone laughed particularly. This reminded me of the laughter caused among the audience when I accidentally drew a human head on the blackboard during a lecture. I very much approve of the symbolic expression of Peking opera because it is similar to my caricaturist's method of omission. When I draw portraits, I usually only draw one mouth on the face, and do not draw eyebrows and eyes. Or even the mouth is not drawn, and the appearance is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer. (Therefore, last year a certain tabloid ridiculed me, with a large headline "Feng Zikai is shameless," and the content of the article first complimented me, and finally said that his paintings are uniquely original, with a few strokes, the spirit is lifelike, and the head of the person is drawn without the eyelids, etc. People who only look at the headline and do not have time to read the article must think that I have done something shameless. This tabloid is really mischievous!) This is similar to the expression of Peking opera: opening a door, riding a horse, and rowing a boat, there are no real doors, horses, and boats, all left to the imagination of the audience. The imagined doors, horses, and boats are more beautiful than the real ones. If there is a real background, it is not pleasing. It's like sometimes I accidentally draw out the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose one by one. The appearance is determined, and I often feel that it is nothing more than that, with a complete view, which is clumsier than not drawing and allowing people to imagine freely.

### Memory Club

— Zheng Yimei

Shanghai is a place where culture and talent gather. Poets and men of letters come from all directions to live as temporary residents. Although there is noise from carriages and horses and the clamor of merchants, the spirit of poetry and wine still exists, such as the Southern Society, Ming Society, and Xi Society of the past, and the Huai Chao Society of today. The Huai Chao Society is presided over by Qu Tuiyuan of Shanhua to commemorate his late father, Wen Shen Gong Hongji. Hongji, courtesy name Ziju, sobriquet Zhi'an, was a Jinshi of the Qing Tongzhi era. He served as Minister of Works and Co-Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat. He was skilled in poetry and often composed poems with Boyan, Fanshan, Jie'an, Yifeng, and Yi'an. His collected works, The Selected Poems of Wen Shen Gong, were praised by Chen Shiyi as being well-organized and appropriate. In his later years, he lived in Shanghai, naming his residence Chao Lan Lou, where he read, wrote poetry, and sang, almost forgetting the years. Tuiyuan invited the former officials and students of his late father to establish a poetry society, naming it Huai Chao Society. At the time, famous scholars such as Sun Cangsou, Yang Wansou, Gao Chuiwan, and Wu Meisun, totaling more than ten people, composed poems with excellent verses, comparable to the elegant gathering in the West Garden, illuminating the past and the future. Cangsou and Wansou were the oldest in the society, both over eighty years old. Cangdian's name was Jing, sobriquet Beishan Weng, and he was skilled in writing inscriptions on oracle bones. In his early years, he studied at Nanjiang and studied the Gongyang School. He once served as magistrate of Qingshen County and had a reputation for good governance. The year before last, he revisited Chongqing and composed a poem recounting his father's teachings, and people praised him for his unremitting filial piety. Wansou, a native of Taixing, was named Tiren and was a childhood friend of the late Mr. Cheng Yaosheng. His poems were desolate and passionate, similar to Du Ling's in his time. He was also skilled in calligraphy, elegant and ancient, with the demeanor of cranes hesitating to stop. He intends to expand his connections with scholars in Shanghai. Chuiwan and Meisun were born on the same day of the same month of the same year. Chuiwan's sobriquet is Hanpa, and Meisun's sobriquet is Hanyu, hence the line "Lonely in the Jiangguan, the head is not yet white, the cold light shines brightly." Last year, on the birthday of Dongpo, they held a meeting of poets in his temple. I joined the ranks, offering wine to wish him good fortune. Both were seventy years old, so celebrating Su's longevity was also celebrating their own longevity. Tuiyuan was also present that day. The pleasant conversation continued until sunset.

### Drifting on a Raft at Sea

— Tongtuo

In 1896, two Norwegians in Brooklyn earned a living by dredging oysters off the coast of New Jersey. One was named Sommersen, and the other Haubold. Both were naturally strong and had a wealth of maritime experience. One day, Sommersen said to Haubold: "If someone dares to venture across the ocean in a small boat, they can quickly become wealthy. People would be willing to pay to see this little boat." They both agreed that this was something that could not be done alone, but with their combined efforts, they could complete the voyage in two months, planning to row 54 miles a day. Therefore, they were willing to give it a try.

They spent two years working on this plan in their spare time, building a boat 18 feet long. Fox, the publisher of the "Alarm" newspaper, helped them build the wooden boat, so they named the canoe "Fox." The boatmen shook their heads and sighed when they saw their boat, but Sommersen and Haubold continued to work hard, assembling everything. The boat was equipped with five oars, a compass, a sextant, a cushion, signal lights, and five gallons of kerosene for use on a small stove at the front of the boat. The food included 250 eggs, 100 pounds of biscuits, 9 pounds of coffee, and many cans of meat. The clothing included the clothes they were wearing and a set of oilskins. There was no tobacco, alcohol, or sails on the boat.

The "Fox" sailed out to sea, and the two Norwegians began to carefully calculate the journey: each person had to row at least fifteen and a half hours a day. At first, the weather was excellent, but tending to the oil stove was troublesome. It was difficult to get the oil stove to light even in a light breeze. They had very little coffee, and the eggs were soon gone.

On the fourth night, Haubold fell asleep on the side of the boat. Suddenly, he woke up and shouted: "Something is hitting our boat!"

They turned, and there was another bump on the bottom of the boat, and then a white fish flashed out of the dim water. "A shark!" said Haubold. The shark followed the boat for two days, but the two paid no attention to it,一心一意划向他们的目的地巴黎去。(一心一意划向他们的目的地巴黎去。) (concentrated on rowing to their destination, Paris)

A week after they set off, the weather at sea suddenly changed, and a violent easterly wind blew head-on. The waves rose higher and higher, crashing over the Fox. At 9 AM, the two gave up rowing and dropped anchor. At 5 PM, Haubold calculated the journey, but they had gone backwards 25 miles.

The two tried their best to row, sometimes singing songs, but most of the time they were just trying to row. On July 1, they encountered a fishing boat in "distress." The captain greeted them and was surprised to invite them on board for a short rest. It was the first cooked lunch Haubold and Sommersen had eaten in three weeks.

On July 7, a squall suddenly came from the western sea. They had been battling the raging waves for two days, bailing water out ten times a day. On the second night, a huge wave hit the "Fox" and capsized it. The two fell into the cold water. But in this dangerous situation, they had made arrangements early on. Each person put on a lifebuoy and connected themselves to the boat with bandages. The boat was also equipped with handholds to allow seafarers to hold on. After several attempts, they turned the boat over, climbed into the boat, and bailed the water out with all their might. Most of the food they had brought was lost, and their clothes were completely soaked.

Fortunately, the wind and waves calmed down immediately, but the backs of their hands were extremely painful as a result of the rain, wind, and sun. The most difficult thing was the lack of food. Fortunately, on July 15, they encountered a fellow countryman's boat, the "Westoe," and were re-equipped with fresh water and food. So they continued their voyage.

On August 1, they saw the Isles of Scilly, a small island southwest of England. On August 7, they arrived at the port of Le Havre, France. The shore erupted in cheers.

### On Turning Waste Wood into Meat

— Sun He

A German scientist named Bergus (currently serving in a U.S. infantry division) has invented a miracle: "Turning waste wood into meat." After the Allied forces turned to bombing and destroying German industry, two factories can produce 800 tons of wood-based food per month, enough to supply 1.7 million German citizens with wartime meat rations. If there were 100 such factories, their production would be sufficient to overcome the famine in the years after the war.

This news gives me the following thoughts—

It is an excellent refutation to the many who shout about spiritual civilization saving humanity from catastrophe while denying science; the greatness of the so-called "spiritual civilization" against science is said to be able to eliminate "killing," while the development of natural science is considered likely to assist in killing. But the fact proves that the more developed science is, the more advanced mankind is, and the need for killing is decreasing more and more, not only for humans, but also extended to living things. For example, the cause of war, the argument of "population theory" arises from insufficient food distribution. If waste wood can be turned into meat as shown in the above news, what worries do humans still have about insufficient food and causing war? If this invention is developed to the extreme, it will make the world's food inexhaustible and naturally there will be no so-called "failed countries" that take war as a way out. Furthermore, the reason why the so-called spiritual civilization is touching and pleasing is in "peace," whether Taoism or Buddhism, the motivation of vegetarianism and abstinence from killing is originally impeccable. But the result is that it can only rely on people's suppression of their instincts' "asceticism," not only is it limited to a few high monks and Taoists who can fulfill this ascetic precept, but also they must sacrifice health and nutrition in exchange for the practice of altruism towards creatures. That is to say: not killing life is due to subjective, forced good thoughts, rather than objective natural conditions that make them not need to kill life. The invention of turning waste wood into meat will allow mankind to enter the realm of not killing life without sacrificing health, is it not truly a great civilization? "Spiritual civilization," if there is really such a thing in the world, must also depend on the progress of science to produce and have something to rely on, otherwise it is just the fantasy of metaphysicians.

To thoroughly eliminate the crisis of war, social science and natural science must progress equally and complement each other.

### How to Distinguish the Sex of Goldfish

— Wu Jiren

Friends who raise goldfish often like to match them in pairs. It is easy enough to match colors and shapes that are exactly the same, but it is very difficult to match exactly one male and one female.

Goldfish that grow to several years old are priced surprisingly high in fish gardens. If you calculate carefully, they are not too expensive, because it takes three to five years to grow the fish to select colors, shapes, and general sizes from thousands of fish. Often, a very good pair of fish are either all females or all males, unless the sexes are also matched when selecting species in their youth, they can grow old together in pairs, so as not to become lonely.

The sex of goldfish can be clearly seen when they are an inch long. If you are not sure, you can also touch them with your hands. Hold the fish in your hand and press your finger against its abdomen. The male fish's scales are tightly wrapped, firm and without gaps, while the female fish's abdomen is surprisingly soft, because it contains eggs (when the fish lay eggs, only a part of them are released), you can tell the difference with one touch.

As for large fish of three or four years old, during the spawning period, the male fish's tail fins are torn and have white thorns, and can even emit light, making it even more obvious that it is a male fish.

### 

The mess in the world situation, the fact that human beings are increasingly moving towards destruction through mutual slaughter, although only a few heroic men are responsible, and not all men are to blame, women are completely blameless. For example, the warmongering and martial spirit of Germany, the former such as William II, such as Bismarck, the latter such as Hitler, which one is not glaring and fierce. Also, such as Mussolini of Italy, his face full of muscle, looks like a living devil, and even he has always claimed to be a hero and great man. Also, such as Japan, which has always valued men and belittled women, although Japanese women limit themselves to being virtuous mothers and good wives, they do have a kind and diligent demeanor. Imagine if Japan had turned from valuing men and belittling women to valuing women and belittling men earlier, and made all politics, military affairs, and diplomacy the responsibility of some Willow, Thousand Moon, Uemura Shoko, and Shimoda Umeko, it would not have been as unrestrained as Doihara, Tanaka Giichi, Honjo, Araki, and Tojo. Therefore, I extend the words of a certain mayor and a certain president and create a slogan: "Women of all races in the world, unite!" "Build a special women's international!" "All men in the world, retire from military service! All rule and all military and political affairs will be taken over by women." "Thoroughly settle accounts for the many sins of men." After the establishment of the "Special Women's International," all previous special internationals and ordinary internationals will be abolished!

Europeans use "Man" in Mankind to exclusively refer to "men," saying that Mankind is the entire human race, but when referring specifically to women, there are so-called Woman and Womankind. Woman is an abbreviation of Wifeman. This coincides with the Chinese "woman" and already contains the meaning of inequality. But Europeans also use GentleSex as a special term for women, then it goes without saying that men are Rough Sex. From this point of view, the barbaric behavior of men should be condemned and abandoned, what more can be said.

### Two Recent Poems

— Zhang Yiqu

The State of the World

The sea has not yet calmed, the river is not yet clear, the world is still a puppet that is not public: those who love scabs are full of rich men's houses, those who lick hemorrhoids return to the red society to welcome them. Who are the dogs and worms who cunningly operate? Shrimps run wild and crabs cause chaos and run rampant! The struggle for fame and wealth arises, from ancient times to the present there have been armor and soldiers.

Feelings While Traveling

Spring is old, the traveler is stranded far from home, the war dust urges a white hair, heaven and earth are impartial and cause much killing, every time I want to retreat to the gardens, I hesitate; the years pass quickly, a thousand volumes of poetry, a myriad cups of wine amidst the scattered mountains and rivers, how can I be as quiet as entering samadhi, this heart suddenly like ash in meditation?
