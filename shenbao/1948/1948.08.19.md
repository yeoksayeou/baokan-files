### Stepping Up the Suppression of Overt and Covert Bandits; Each Administrative Region in Zhejiang Province Sets Up a Pacification Work Team; Mao Sen Concurrently Serves as Team Leader

### The Turbulent Situation in Burma

Since Burma declared its independence on January 4th of this year, serious party strife has erupted within the country. If the current Prime Minister, Thakin Nu, is not firm enough, the surging communist forces may have already swept across Burma. The Burmese Communist Party is currently carrying out armed rebellion against the government in various parts of the north and south. A portion of the Volunteer Army, affiliated with the Freedom League, also mutinied and besieged Rangoon on the 14th of this month. The government suppressed the siege with overwhelming land and air forces, and the siege of Rangoon was temporarily lifted, and external communications have also been restored. The current regime may be able to achieve stability. However, the red atmosphere throughout Burma is still expanding, and the serious situation has not weakened. A Rangoon dispatch from the Associated Press frankly pointed out that the situation in Burma is far more serious than generally expected. The government must resort to the strongest measures to curb the communist rebels, as the rebels have the most outstanding military talents. Therefore, the Burmese civil war is just beginning, and its future development deserves close attention.

Burma is located in the western part of the Indochina Peninsula, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. The entire territory is divided into Upper Burma and Lower Burma: Upper Burma is connected to Yunnan and Xikang in China, forming its northeastern face; Lower Burma borders Siam to the east and India to the west. The Burmese mountains are purely the remnants of the Hengduan Mountains in China, and the Irrawaddy River originates purely from the highlands of Kangzang. The relationship between China and Burma has always been close, and the China-Burma Highway passes through the Hengduan Mountains, so the movements in Burma are closely related to China. Based on this relationship, we attach importance to the current situation in Burma; based on the safety of our southwestern border, we are concerned about the current turmoil in Burma. The current coup in Burma is not accidental, it is a link in the communist atmosphere in Southeast Asia and even all of Asia drilling into the Iron Curtain. We should point out the crux of the Burmese turmoil and its relationship to the overall situation in Asia.

First, from the perspective of the nature of the political parties, the current party strife in Burma is a struggle between the Freedom League and the Communist Party; from the perspective of the division of thought, it is a struggle between socialism and communism; from the perspective of the opposition between left and right, it is a struggle between the left wing and the left wing. This is the crux of the political turmoil in Burma. The current ruling party in Burma is the Freedom League, and Thakin Nu is a world-renowned socialist, whose thought is more thorough than even Fabianism. He is honest and impartial, and has fought for independence and freedom for many years. He is the only person who can lead the country after General Aung San. On May 25th of this year, he announced the Fifteen Articles of the Left-Wing Solidarity Program, the content of which is more revolutionary and progressive than even the Communist Party. However, he ignored cooperation with the Communist Party, he declared the Burmese Communist Party an illegal organization, and he believed that opposition parties should not possess armed forces, otherwise they would be completely suppressed. The British were extremely surprised by Thakin Nu's left wing: Soviet public opinion also stared wide-eyed. But Thakin Nu remained firm and unyielding, not hesitating to fight the Communist Party ideologically, politically, and militarily. This shows that the party strife in Burma is a struggle between two lefts.

Second, the rebellion of the Burmese Communist Party is developing in coordination with the recent communist forces in Southeast Asia. It is not an isolated action force, and the strength of the Burmese Communist Party is worthy of attention. The Burmese Communist Party has workers in the trade unions, constantly inciting labor strikes: in the schools, it has student alliances, constantly inciting student strikes. Starting from February 9th of this year, the Burmese Communist Party began to hold armed riots in northern Burma, taking advantage of the fact that the country had just declared its independence and the internal affairs were in a state of transition, thereby controlling places such as Donggua, Basheng, and Saga, and reaching Myitkyina and Puta-O, sixty to eighty miles from Rangoon. Recently, it has even besieged the capital Rangoon. The Burmese Communist Party has tried to win over the Volunteer Army, which is inclined to the Freedom League. The recent siege of Rangoon was the mutiny of the Volunteer Army. The power of the Burmese Communist Party has gradually developed in the past six months, and it has established close ties with the communist forces in Malaya, Siam, and other places. The Burmese independent newspaper, the He Wei Bao, published an article on July 7th opposing the replacement of the Siamese ambassador, citing that the Soviet embassy in Siam had more than 40 staff members, while there were only 10 Siamese Soviet overseas Chinese, and pointing out that Bangkok has now become a major base for instigating riots by the Burmese Communist Party. Although these arguments are inevitably exaggerated, the fact that the Burmese Communist Party is of the same breath as the communist forces in Southeast Asia is obvious. Thakin Nu firmly refuses to compromise with the Burmese Communist Party, precisely because he recognizes that the Burmese Communist Party is not a nationalist party and cannot talk about the unity of a national state with it.

Based on the above situation, the development of the Burmese political situation is subtle, and the battle between socialism and communism is appearing in a corner of Southeast Asia today. This is very different from the situation in Malaya, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Looking at the overall trend, the Burmese government is determined to suppress the Communist Party to the end. Foreign Minister Wu Dingtu has resigned and joined the army. Thakin Nu has decided to resign from parliament on August 16th, and may be succeeded by Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Bo Liye. Thakin Nu's future path is to join the army. He is determined to use the power of spiritual influence and the power of truth to persuade the Communist Party to lay down its arms and implement the nationalization of the army. Thakin Nu's political aspirations and his goals of struggle are to strive for the principle of "forcing the Communist Party to abandon arms." In short, the development of the Burmese turmoil has a great relationship with the future of Asia. May Thakin Nu hold the helm of the times steady and struggle bravely forward!

### Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Rampant Again: China and Hong Kong to Jointly Combat Smuggling, Luo Qingxiang and Gogoer Arrive in Guangzhou to Meet Song Ziwen

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Smuggling on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is gradually becoming rampant again, especially the smuggling of white rice. Recently, a so-called "group charge" method has been implemented. When the train arrives in Shenzhen from Guangzhou, the smugglers unite a thousand or hundreds of people, carry white rice on their shoulders, and rush straight to the small paths along the fields. If customs officers intervene slightly, they will be collectively dealt with by the smugglers, leaving the customs officers helpless.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Due to various indications, the date of implementation of the China-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement is becoming increasingly close. Luo Qingxiang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs in charge of anti-smuggling, and Gogoer, Commissioner of Customs of Kowloon, arrived in Guangzhou on the 18th. Luo was the Chinese government representative who came south two months ago to sign the China-Australia customs agreement. Some time ago, Gogoer went to Shanghai to ask for instructions on issues related to the China-Hong Kong agreement. Luo then accompanied Gogoer back to Hong Kong, and stayed in Hong Kong for many days before coming to Guangzhou today. According to the Guangdong Customs, Luo's visit is to inspect the current situation of anti-smuggling in South China. However, according to other sources, Luo has repeatedly negotiated with the Hong Kong side in Hong Kong, and his visit is to meet with Chairman Song to discuss issues related to this agreement. It is not yet known whether Song will go to Hong Kong. However, the day after Song returned to Guangzhou, he convened an anti-smuggling meeting and decided to launch a full-scale armed anti-smuggling campaign, which is believed to be a measure to cooperate with the implementation of this agreement.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Song Ziwen received Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, who had just rushed back from Hong Kong, at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th to discuss economic and diplomatic issues related to China and Hong Kong.

He Guoguang received reporters from this newspaper alone at his private residence on the morning of the 17th and spoke freely about border affairs: (1) The Design Committee's funding for border affairs has not been included in the Executive Yuan's budget this year, so there is no special fund to handle the five-year development plan. It has been brought back separately by Sichuan representative Zeng Nanfu, Kang representative Wu Liucun, and Yunnan representative Li Guoqing. Wang Lingji has telegraphed his agreement, and after Liu Wenhui and Lu Han express their opinions, they will convene a meeting to implement the plan. (2) Xichang has a climate like spring all year round, suitable for animal husbandry and planting buckwheat and kapok. In addition, silk can be harvested four times a year, and there are many mineral deposits, all waiting to be developed. (3) The visit of the Yi ethnic group to the mainland has had a significant impact on the Yi people.

### Ironclad Proof of Communist Spies Creating Student Unrest (Part 2)

As for the destructive actions of communist student spies in creating student unrest in government areas, they are in complete and close harmony with all the appeals and demands of the communists, fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. For example, the ten major tasks proposed by Mao Zedong on New Year's Day in the 34th year of the Republic [1945], Zhu De's broadcast on New Year's Day in the 36th year of the Republic [1947], and Mao Zedong's report at the Central Committee meeting of the Chinese Communist Party on December 25th in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] all mentioned the so-called liberated areas and government areas in the same breath, and particularly emphasized carrying out extensive mass movements in government areas, putting forward deceptive slogans such as "People's Patriotic Democratic Movement" or "Struggle for Survival." The various student unrests created by communist student spies, and the various slogans shouted out in the successive student unrests, completely matched the demands of these two major appeals by the communists. For example, "Anti-Hunger Movement," "Eat It All Movement," "Anti-Civil War Movement," and "Anti-Tyranny Movement" are even more obvious examples. In fact, the communists' proposal of these two major deceptive slogans was a strategic offensive to disintegrate the government's rear. Under the communists' brutal rule in the communist areas and their policy of closely following the Communist International, the so-called "People's Patriotic Democratic Movement" or "Struggle for Survival" is nothing short of a strong irony. However, communist student spies, nurtured by the communists, took advantage of the government's leniency and accommodation to create various student unrests in government areas without any scruples, to respond to the communists' malicious conspiracy, and sometimes even altered the nature of a movement that originated from the so-called "Struggle for Survival." For example, the "Anti-Hunger Cake Movement" launched by communist professional students last May was transformed into a rebellious movement of "Anti-Conscription," "Anti-Grain Levy," and "Anti-Civil War." Isn't this tantamount to regarding themselves as communist military spies and urban workers, and openly opening up a so-called "second battlefield" in the government's rear?

Moreover, after communist student spies were able to openly and unscrupulously control student organizations in various schools and suppress the majority of good students, they openly turned the sacred and dignified halls of learning into illegal concessions that sheltered communist bandits, and used the schools as centers for launching "urban work activities" to the outside world. Thus, in these Soviet-style school concessions, they openly set up "courts" to "publicly try" good students, monitor the words and deeds of teachers, establish "defense alliances," and even lure young people to escape to communist areas to serve the communists' schemes, treating schools as recruitment agencies for the communists.

2. How Communist Student Spies Create Student Unrest

Under the conspiracy and fabrication of communist student spies who speak sweet words but do evil deeds, large-scale student unrests have been rising one after another in recent years. Among them, the following student unrests are the largest in scale and the deepest in conspiracy:

(1) Using the excuse of opposing the civil war to create the "December 1st" incident in Kunming: At the end of November of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], communist student spies in Kunming used the name of opposing the civil war to instigate strikes in major middle schools and universities. Fortunately, most students saw through the conspiracy and organized anti-strike committees to strongly oppose it. The schools that had already gone on strike resumed classes one after another. Seeing that their conspiracy was not working, communist student spies did not hesitate to resort to violence to carry out sabotage. Just as the students of the Southwest Associated University were holding a meeting to discuss anti-strike matters, a commando team organized by professional students rushed into the meeting place and beat people, disrupting the meeting. They also used weapons and broke into various schools one after another, forcing teachers and students to strike. However, on November 30th, when communist student spies at the Southwest Associated University openly held a meeting on campus to coerce students to strike, the cadets of the Second General Team of Officers in Kunming, according to a pre-arranged schedule, visited Daguanlou [Grand View Pavilion]. As they marched in formation past the school, communist student spies in the school launched an attack with mud, bricks, and tiles, mixed with shouts and insults. The cadets initially retreated and avoided the attack, but then, unable to evade, they began to fight back. The cadets, feeling that they had been humiliated for no reason, sent a written inquiry but received no response. So on December 1st, they collectively went to the Teachers College of the Southwest Associated University to inquire. While they were waiting, Chen Qida, an unemployed soldier bought off by communist bandits, broke in and threw a hand grenade into the college, creating a tragedy. At the same time, hand grenades were also thrown at the cadets in the Literature College of the same school, injuring them. After the tragedy occurred, communist student spies in Kunming City took advantage of the unclear truth to blame the government, claiming that it was using special agents to massacre students, and launched a general strike in all schools in the city. Later, after the government executed the murderer and dismissed the security authorities, the communist student spies' conspiracy to create a nationwide student unrest ultimately failed. However, this incident opened the prelude to communist student spies disrupting schools and destroying education.

(2) Using the "Shen Chong Incident" to create an anti-American movement: On the evening of December 24th of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], Ms. Shen Chong, a student in the preparatory class of Peking University, was raped by US Marine Corporal Pierson. This incident was an illegal act by Pierson personally. The government and the people were equally indignant. The Beiping Headquarters even submitted a serious memorandum to the US military authorities, demanding that the rapist be severely punished. This was originally a simple legal issue and should not have been mixed with diplomacy and politics. However, communist student spies in various places saw this as a great opportunity to undermine Sino-US relations and actively planned to launch an unprecedentedly large anti-American movement in various places. They first launched strikes and parades at Peking University and other schools on the 30th, emphasizing that "US troops should withdraw from China immediately." By the beginning of January, communist student spies in Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Kunming, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and other places had successively planned similar strikes and parades. Their actions and slogans were completely consistent in various places. They took this opportunity to form the "National Student Anti-Tyranny Federation," which acted as an accomplice for the communists.

(3) Launching the "Eat It All Movement" and creating the "May 20th" incident: The "May 20th" incident was rooted in the conspiracy of the "One School, One Affair Movement" during the Communist May-Fourth student unrest. At the same time, the issue of Ying Shi University's relocation, the issue of Jiaotong University's merging of departments, the anti-cumulative point system of Shanghai University, the issue of changing the director and establishing a college at the Oriental Language College, the issue of changing the director and relocating the school at Zhongzheng University, and the issue of public funding for Jinan Central Jinling and other schools successively broke out. Since mid-May, Nanjing, led by Zhongda [Central University], had been brewing an extraneous "Public Funding Movement" and launching the so-called "Eat It All Movement." On "May 20th," led by Zhongda and Jinda [Jinling University], communist student spies coerced a portion of the students, and gathered so-called student representatives from Yingda, the School of Social Education, and the cities of Shanghai and Hangzhou, to form a large-scale marching team. They did not listen to the advice of the security authorities and the well-intentioned dissuasion of the unarmed police maintaining order, insulted the security personnel in every possible way, and attempted to violently break through the police cordon, resulting in clashes with the unarmed police, with mutual injuries. The communist student spies then expanded the propaganda to the so-called "May 20th" blood case, using this to spark a full-scale student unrest. Fortunately, their conspiracy was seen through by students across the country, and the incident was not allowed to escalate. (The text continues on page 5)

### New Danube River Navigation Convention: US, UK, France, Austria Refuse to Sign; Belgrade Conference Declares Closure

[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast, Belgrade News: The Danube River Conference today, by a vote of seven to zero, with the UK, US, and France abstaining, passed the new convention proposed by the Soviet Union. At 5:30 PM (Belgrade time), Chairman Vyshinsky announced the close of the conference.

[News Report] Washington, 18th Broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference that the representatives of the four countries of the US, UK, France, and Austria at the Danube River Conference refused to sign the Danube River Convention drafted by the Soviet Union. The US government has instructed the US representative, Kennan, not to sign the convention, and stated that the representatives of the other three countries also hold the same attitude.

[French News Agency, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch] The head of the UK delegation to the Danube River Conference, Baker, before the vote on the new Danube River Treaty, declared that the UK believes that the 1921 Danube River Treaty remains in effect and cannot recognize the exclusive rights to Danube River navigation specially granted to certain Danube River riparian states in the new treaty. He also stated that the governments of Belgium, Greece, and Italy had requested the UK government to notify the conference that they all reserve their rights related to the Danube River.

### Rumor: Molotov Makes New Demands; Moscow Negotiations in Stalemate; Three Envoys Receive Instructions to Continue Negotiations

[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast: The governments of the UK, US, and France delivered new instructions to the three envoys in Moscow on the 18th, preparing for the next meeting at the Kremlin. Officials refused to reveal whether the next meeting would be with Molotov again, or with both Molotov and Stalin. Diplomatic circles believe that unless there are concrete signs of mutual agreement between the two sides, the current negotiations cannot continue for long. As of now, none of the news from the meetings is optimistic. The three envoys are currently considering a final meeting with Stalin.

[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] It is rumored that Molotov recently made important suggestions during talks with the special envoys of the three Western powers. The British Foreign Office neither confirmed nor denied this claim.

[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] After the report of British special envoy Roberts arrived here, political and diplomatic circles all expressed pessimism. What is incomprehensible is that all evening newspapers tonight announced in large headlines that the three Western powers have accepted the principle of postponing the organization of the West German government, on the condition that the Soviet Union lift the Berlin blockade. However, well-informed observers say that it is highly doubtful that Moscow has reached any compromise.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 18th Dispatch] It is learned that if the Moscow talks fail, the Western countries have prepared a comprehensive plan for Germany. Diplomatic sources pointed out that the talks currently taking place in the Kremlin have reached an impasse because the Soviet Union has made demands that the Western countries cannot accept. They said that unless the Soviet Union immediately withdraws its demands, the Berlin crisis will return to the situation before the talks, and the Soviet blockade will reach its worst state. If this situation arises, the first step for the Western countries will be to concentrate on strengthening the airlift to Berlin, and the second step will be to accelerate the establishment of a West German government, allowing the Soviet Union to implement its strategy for its occupation zone alone. This speculation about the new plan for Berlin was reported on the 17th, as the commanders of the Western countries held a meeting that day, the results of which were not announced. According to reports from Waldorf in southwestern Germany, more than 1,000 US and French troops are engaged in combat exercises.

Czech and Soviet Union to Conduct Trade Negotiations

[French News Agency, Belgrade, 17th Dispatch] The semi-official news agency "Setega" here today published an interview between Czech Foreign Minister Clementis and an American interviewer. According to Clementis, there is no reason for a new war to break out today. Hundreds of millions of people are all hoping for peace. Although the international situation has deteriorated since last year, there is no threat of war. We oppose violating the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements, and we advocate that the United Nations Charter should be respected. He also stated that in the current situation, the Western powers should be held responsible because their policies are aimed at revising the existing treaties and agreements. Clementis then denied the rumors that the people's democracies are at odds with each other. Finally, he said that resolving the German problem is the most important factor in moving towards peace and improving relations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. The economic vacuum currently formed by Germany should be eliminated, no matter how difficult it may be.

[Associated Press, Prague, 17th Dispatch] The Czech trade delegation, led by Minister of Foreign Trade Gregor, left here by plane for Moscow today.

### US Secretary of Defense Forrestal Returns to Washington

[French News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch] US Secretary of Defense Forrestal returned here from Canada tonight. Forrestal originally intended to participate in the bicentennial celebration of the founding of Ogdensburg City and deliver a speech, but suddenly canceled his plans and returned to Washington this week, leading to rumors that Forrestal was recalled by the government. However, this rumor has been denied by both the White House and Forrestal himself.

[French News Agency, Ogdensburg, Canada, 17th Dispatch] While US Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Canadian Minister of National Defense Claxton were celebrating the friendship between the US and Canada in Ogdensburg, Claxton mentioned in his speech that the US-Canadian joint defense agreement is a symbol of the friendship between the two countries and sets an example for all countries engaged in peace and human happiness.

### Anti-Tito Yugoslav General Flees to Romania, Shot Dead; Two Accompanying Officers, One Dead, One Arrested

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior issued a public statement today stating that former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff General Uvalnovic, accompanied by two senior military officers, attempted to cross the border into Romania on the evening of the 11th. They were discovered by border guards and shot. Uvalnovic was killed on the spot.

According to Uvalnovic's position in the Yugoslav army, he was second only to Marshal Tito. (Yugoslav exiles in London claim that Uvalnovic's escape to Romania was probably to assume the position of commander-in-chief of the "Free Yugoslav Army" to support the Cominform's movement to overthrow Tito. It is also claimed that the Cominform is deliberately setting up a puppet government in Yugoslavia to oppose Tito. During the war, Tito and Uvalnovic were inseparable, but Uvalnovic has been expelled from Tito's inner circle for a year.) The Ministry of Interior statement also stated that the two people accompanying Uvalnovic, Colonel Dacic, had fled into Romania, while Major General Petre Cvejic was arrested a few yards from the border. Also killed was Alabapa Bak, the director of the government's border industries bureau. The statement said: "Ah氏受三人之紿代爲引路而'不知彼等圖非法入羅馬尼亞。'" According to the confession of the arrested major general, the three had long agreed to flee, but falsely claimed to be hunting wild boars to go to the border. At that time, a sentry saw three people hurrying towards the border. One of them suddenly opened fire on the sentry. The sentry, for the sake of self-defense, immediately returned fire, killing two people on the spot. The other two fled to the border." The statement did not explain the reason for the three people's escape.

[News Report] London, 18th Broadcast, Prague News: A Communist newspaper on the 18th published an open letter from the Yugoslav embassy attacking Tito and the Yugoslav Communist Party.

### German Situation Serious, UK Considers Reinforcements

[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] Well-informed sources say that the British Cabinet met yesterday to discuss ways to increase the strength of British troops stationed in Germany due to the serious situation in Germany. Representatives from the Ministry of Defence and the Army Staff Headquarters participated. It is heard that the meeting considered the following three solutions and planned to choose one to implement: (1) Temporarily postpone demobilization, with the current monthly demobilization number being 20,000 people; (2) Suspend demobilization; (3) Call up reservists for enlistment in advance. According to military sources, the third method seems to be the most suitable and will be adopted. The government said that no decision has been made yet.

### Rhee Syngman Declares to Reporters That Korea Will Demand Soviet Recognition; Unstable Korean Situation, UK Says It Will Not Recognize For Now

[New Asia Agency, Seoul, 18th Dispatch] South Korean President Rhee Syngman told reporters yesterday that the three major powers, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, had previously expressed de facto recognition of the government of the Republic of Korea. However, the Soviet Union has not made any statement. From Korea's standpoint, the independence and construction of a new Korea can only be ultimately achieved with the joint support of the four countries, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. In the future, the Korean government will continue to strive to negotiate with the Soviet Union, requesting it to adopt an attitude consistent with that of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Korean government is currently preparing all the materials in preparation for making a claim for compensation to Japan in the future.

[French News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] Authorities said that Britain's non-recognition of the Rhee Syngman government in South Korea at present has no political significance. The British government is willing to wait for the United Nations General Assembly to pass the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Korea before considering whether to recognize the Korean government. According to well-informed sources, the reason why the United Kingdom has adopted the current attitude towards the South Korean government is due to reports from the British Consulate and other sources, all stating that the situation in South Korea is quite unstable. The reports all point out that South Korea is in turmoil, and farmers, students, and some intellectuals are opposing Rhee Syngman's "fascist dictatorship." In addition, South Korea has more than 400 political parties, which also seems to be a symbol of chaos. Some reports even point out that the election was completed in terror and fraud. Finally, although the situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of North Korea is unclear, various reports received here indicate that a small number of Koreans are currently fleeing from South Korea to North Korea.

### US Loans to Korea Could Reach $100 Million Next Year

Rhee Syngman Sends Telegram Thanking US for Recognizing Korea

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] According to the most reliable sources, senior officials are currently meeting to discuss whether the State Department or the Economic Cooperation Administration will take over the administration of the aid to Korea plan and the funds that have not yet been used. The government estimates that the total amount of aid to Korea could reach as high as $100 million by the end of the accounting year next June. This number is based on the estimated amount that may be left over from the funds allocated to Korea by the Department of the Army out of the $130 million in occupied area expenses at that time. Authoritative sources believe that Korea will probably be incorporated into the aid to China plan.

[French News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The message from President Rhee Syngman of the new government of the two countries to US President Truman thanking him has been released here today.

### U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee to Announce New Espionage Case; Reiterates Accusation of Truman Blocking Intelligence

Parnell Thomas, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, accused President Truman on the 17th of concealing all evidence in Soviet espionage cases, and said that a previously undisclosed conspiracy to leak "some of our nation's most important intelligence" to the Soviet Union has now been discovered. Thomas promised to reveal all the facts of a new Communist espionage case when the committee resumes public hearings on September 7.

Thomas told reporters, "All the facts are sealed in government archives. Truman should explain why he thought he should hide this information from the people."

### Stalin and Tito's Struggle (Part 2)

— Translated by this newspaper's editorial office (Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine)

Nationalistic animosities existing among satellite states are deeply rooted and gradually weaken the strong front that the Soviet Union wants to show the West. Territorial disputes have estranged Poles and Czechs, Yugoslavs and Bulgarians, and even the Italian and Austrian Communist parties from the Yugoslavs. The Poles, Czechs, and Yugoslavs need a weak Germany, but the German Communist Party, supported by Moscow, demands a strong Germany.

As these nationalistic, political, and economic oppressions intensify day by day, the Soviet Union's greatest gain in World War II, namely Moscow's control over its new Eastern European security zone, will face increasingly severe difficulties. Yugoslavia's current betrayal may trigger unrest elsewhere in the future.

Tito's actions have punctured the paper tiger of the Kremlin's iron curtain. Even if Yugoslavia's loophole is patched up, the Soviet bloc may no longer be as strong and united as it was last year, enough to confront the West. Revealing the inside story of Yugoslavia can clarify why the Soviet Union is having disputes with its bloc. The Yugoslav crisis began to exist six months ago. Last winter, an economic panic struck Yugoslavia, hindering the progress of the Five-Year Plan. The grain produced by farmers was insufficient to meet demand, and materials rationed to consumers were diverted to the black market; production lagged behind the planned targets. To date, the Soviet Union has not been able to supply Yugoslavia with the machinery necessary for industrialization.

The Yugoslav Communist Party experienced internal disagreements regarding the strategies to be adopted for solving the above-mentioned problems. A divided faction emerged under the leadership of two members of Tito's seven-man Politburo. Both of these men had fought alongside Marshal Tito in the guerrilla war during World War II. One was Hebrang, the current chairman of the National Planning Commission, the highest economic position in Yugoslavia. The other was Zhujović, who had served as the deputy commander of the student guerrilla brigade under Marshal Tito. Apart from Tito, Zhujović was one of the most popular leaders in Yugoslavia, and he was also a good friend of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

These two dissenters urged Tito to accelerate the implementation of collective farms and the nationalization of retail businesses and small industries. Tito's followers rejected these proposals, insisting that agriculture must gradually be socialized, and that since large-scale industries had already been nationalized, there was no need to rush to take over small factories and retail businesses.

Indirect Interference by the Soviet Union

After a long time, the Soviet Union began to indirectly interfere in the dispute. The Yugoslav secret police discovered that Soviet agents were recruiting Communist Party members as spies and were encouraging other party members to support the faction of Zhujović and Hebrang. The Yugoslav security police, OZMA, intensified surveillance of Soviet officials.

Members of Tito's group began to criticize the Soviet Union for failing to provide economic assistance, and also made many criticisms of other Soviet policies, and there were suggestions to request assistance from the Western powers in the form of trade and loans.

However, economic problems were soon overshadowed by the question of "Moscow's rule or Belgrade's rule."

Despite having Moscow's backing, the opposition leaders were eventually forced to stop their dissenting arguments. In January, economic authority Hebrang was demoted to Minister of Industry, but Zhujović was promoted to the important post of Lieutenant General, presumably to gain his support.

On March 20, the Soviet Union directly applied pressure to Tito's faction. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, using harsh language and supporting the faction of Zhujović and Hebrang. The letter accused Tito of stifling internal party debate, and the Communist parties of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, under the direction of the Soviet Union, also sent letters to Tito making similar accusations.

### Public Utilities Open Investigation Committee Established; Electricity to be Examined First; Notices Sent to Companies to Submit Income Statements and Other Information for Review

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu attended, as well as city councilors Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Qu Yue, Li Wenjie, and Shao Yongsheng; representatives from the Public Utilities Bureau (Zhao Zengjue), the Social Affairs Bureau (Zhang Chude), the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (Yan Zusheng), the Accountants Association (He Yuanming), the Federation of Labor Unions (Ye Xianggao), the Municipal Industries Association (Tian Heqing), and the Engineers Association (You XunZhao), totaling thirteen representatives from nine organizations (Pan Mingshin of the Electrical Engineers Association was absent). Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the City Council Xiang Changquan, and Municipal Government Advisor Lin Duxin were in attendance. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, first clarifying the meaning and tasks of establishing the Open Investigation and Review Committee. He stated: "Various sectors have many doubts about the income and expenditure of public utility companies, as well as the relationship between the municipal government and these companies. I suggested that the City Council organize a review committee. Following the City Council's resolution, the municipal government is responsible for organizing it. I believe that the most pressing issues for discussion today are: (1) How should the investigation and review be conducted to be appropriate? (2) What kind of public review method should be adopted?"

Li Wenjie suggested the following information for the investigation, divided into two parts: (1) Currently available information, such as the Public Utilities Investigation Report from the Public Utilities Bureau and the City Council, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' amended Public Utilities Price Calculation Explanation, resolutions from the City Council's temporary assembly, and the Public Utilities Price Investigation Explanation from August, etc. (2) Information to be collected: Income statements from each company for January to June of this year, and reports on how each company determined its fixed base. Li stated that the work of the review committee is very arduous, and time constraints should be considered, with all review work to be completed by the end of this month. He advocated that transportation, telephone, electricity, gas, water, and other sectors should be reviewed separately, and the financial, engineering, and accounting heads of each company should be invited to participate in the explanation during the review. It is estimated that completing all the work will require more than ten meetings of the review committee.

Assistance to Companies in Difficulty

Director Zhao expressed agreement with Li's opinion that each public utility should be reviewed separately, as there are six power companies, five water companies, two telephone companies, two tram companies, two bus companies, and two gas companies in the city, as well as city ferries and small train companies, making the organization quite complex and the review time-consuming. He believes that in the current period of suppression of rebellion, the current policy for public utilities should be to maintain their continuous operation as a prerequisite. The attitude towards each company should be: "If a company has difficulties, we will assist in solving them to the best of our ability. If we cannot solve them, we must provide a full explanation to convince them." Director Zhao indicated that the bureau has specialized personnel from all departments of public utility companies available for questioning during the review.

Subsequently, You XunZhao, Qu Yue, Shao Yongsheng, Jiang Haoran, and others expressed their opinions, unanimously agreeing that the task of the review committee is to review the actual expenditures and that reasonable requests based on facts should be accepted. The review method must be completely open.

### Two Resolutions from the Meeting

After discussion, it was resolved: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau will notify each company to submit their actual monthly income and expenditure statements from January to June of this year, monthly raw material consumption figures, monthly inventory statistics of major materials (including July), and balance sheets of each company to the Public Utilities Open Investigation and Review Committee within three days for review. (2) The electricity sector will be reviewed first at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month. The review dates for other items will be decided by engineering experts and the Public Utilities Bureau after consultation with the companies.

The price reductions for trams, buses, and small trains will be implemented within days. It is learned that the price reduction ratios for each item are: water 20%, telephone and gas 15%, buses 20%, trams 1st class 20% to 28.6%, 3rd class 15% to 20%, and small trains 20%.

### Air-Conditioned Express Train Fiercely Criticized by Supervisory Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The operation of air-conditioned express trains on the Nanjing-Shanghai route was fiercely criticized at the first meeting of the Transportation Committee of the Supervisory Yuan on the 18th. The attending members agreed that transportation should prioritize the welfare of the public, and that the national financial resources are currently depleted. The Railway Bureau should not only be unable to economize on expenses, but instead create novelties, spending huge sums to build air-conditioned trains, exclusively for the enjoyment of the wealthy, which is inappropriate for the times. Government subsidies for transportation should only be made under absolutely necessary circumstances, as transportation itself needs to reduce unnecessary expenses as much as possible, and only then should the government subsidize it.

### Hotel Representatives Petition for Increased Water and Electricity Surcharges

Director Wu Promises to Submit for Discussion

[Report from this newspaper] More than 30 representatives from labor and management of the city's hotel industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition, and were received by Director Wu. They stated that the hotel room rates had increased by 95% this time, but this did not include the additional water and electricity fees. They requested to collect an additional fee outside the room rate. The Social Affairs Bureau did not approve this, and the hotel industry felt it was difficult to maintain operations. They explained the difficulties faced by the industry after the increase in water and electricity fees to Director Wu. Director Wu promised to submit the request for discussion at the municipal government meeting and notify the Public Utilities Bureau to inform the water and electricity companies that if the hotels are unable to pay the water and electricity fees, they should not stop the water and electricity supply, but allow them to postpone payment.

### Coal Briquettes Allocated to Public Employees Still Unsold at Five Factories

Hoping Those Who Haven't Claimed Them Will Do So Quickly

According to the Fuel Management Committee, the total number of coal briquettes allocated to public employees in this city is approximately 110,000 dan. The committee prepares approximately 120,000 dan for allocation each month, so there is always a surplus each month, and there is no shortage of allocation. However, because the coal briquette factories distributing the allocations are located in all districts of the city, totaling 50, the factories in the central district, with their convenient locations, have higher demand, so they sell out earlier each time. The factories in the southwest district always have a surplus due to fewer people claiming them. The addresses of the factories that have not yet sold out this period are listed below, so that those who have not claimed them can do so quickly to avoid loss due to expiration: Xinfu, 1030 Guihua Road. Yuedong, Lane 61, 300 Yichang Road. Xinghua, 1410 Nanshi Wai Ma Road. Yuanhua, A25 Anyuan Road. Beiyang, 1302 Anyuan Road.

### Fire at Naval Medical Depot; Cause of Fire Unknown; Losses Cannot Be Estimated

[East China News Agency] Following the explosion at the Joint Logistics Department ammunition depot, a fire suddenly broke out at the Naval Hygiene Materials General Depot at 2181 North Sichuan Road in this city at around 7:00 AM yesterday. The Central Fire Department of the Police Bureau urgently dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire, which was extinguished after half an hour. The General Depot has 72 warehouses of various sizes, fully stocked with pharmaceuticals and medical equipment left by the Japanese Navy. It is usually heavily guarded, with no entry for outsiders. Except for office hours from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the depot gates are always closed, and no one stays overnight. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, thick smoke suddenly emerged from room number 10 on the second floor of the depot. After discovering this, they urgently opened the door for rescue, but the fire had already spread. Fire trucks arrived one after another, and the fire was gradually brought under control after five minutes. Fortunately, it was extinguished after half an hour, with only warehouse number 230 being burned down. It was found that warehouse number 230 stored 40 types of pharmaceuticals, most of which were aspirin, potassium permanganate, calcium chloride and other injectables. Ten types of pharmaceuticals were rescued during the fire. The cause of the fire could not be determined immediately. According to the depot chief, Chen Ende, it may have been caused by potassium permanganate heating up and gasifying. The total loss cannot be estimated at this time. Chen Ende, the depot chief, had just taken office on August 1, and has now submitted a list of losses to the Naval Headquarters.

The foreign exchange settlement certificate has also increased from 3 million U.S. dollars to 7.75 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 158%, so the fares have not been able to keep up with the oil and exchange rates. In the future, before the government has any control and stabilization measures for oil and exchange rates, the two companies will raise fares at any time.

The Merchant Shipping Bureau's Haihang ship arrived in Shanghai from Shantou at 7:00 PM on the 17th and docked at the Merchant Shipping Bureau's Fifth Pier. Customs inspectors boarded the ship at 8:00 PM to inspect passengers' luggage.

They also found twelve pieces of opium, weighing 2.35 kilograms, hidden in the fresh taro and earthenware pots of braised food carried by Huang Rurong and Zheng Yong. Huang and Zheng stated that they were carrying the opium for others and only charged a handling fee of 500,000 yuan per tael. Customs officers asked them why they would take such a big risk for such a small handling fee. Huang and Zheng were quite disappointed after hearing this and asked the customs authorities to forgive them for their ignorance and deal with them leniently. Huang Beiping stated that he owned 32 taels of the opium he was carrying, and the rest was being carried for others to be sold in Shanghai. The suspects and opium have now been transferred to the Police Bureau by Customs for legal action.

### Chen Qilong's Remains to be Encoffined Today

[Report from our newspaper] The news of the passing of Chen Qilong, a remnant elder of the deposed Qing Dynasty, was already reported in yesterday's newspaper. Chen was a Jinshi graduate of the Bingxu year (1886) and served as a Principal of the Ministry of War and a Secretary of the Zongli Yamen (Office for General Management) during the late Qing Dynasty. He was successively promoted to Associate Director of the Ministry of War, then selected as a Vice Minister of the Grand Secretariat, and then Prefect and Magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900), he remained in Beijing and accompanied Li Hongzhang in negotiating peace with the foreign powers. For his contributions, he was appointed as the Henan Provincial Administration Commissioner but did not take office, and was then promoted to Director-General of Water Transport, and then successively transferred to Governor of Henan, Governor of Jiangsu, Governor-General of Sichuan, and Governor-General of Huguang, and finally served as Minister of Beiyang and Governor-General of Zhili. Before the Revolution of 1911 (Xinhai Revolution), he preemptively requested retirement, with Zhang Zhenfang, the Zhili Linyun Envoy in charge of seals of office, acting as his replacement. Within days, the edict of abdication of the Qing Emperor was issued. Afterwards, he retired to Shanghai, indulging in poetry and books for more than thirty years. Before the age of eighty, he occasionally traveled to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shandong, and Hebei, recording his travels in poetry. Thus, he accumulated dozens of volumes of manuscripts, among which the published ones include "Songshoutang Poetry Manuscripts," "Huajinlou Poetry Manuscripts," and "Mingyuan Collection" and other compilations. Chen was already ninety-two years old this year, and was one of the most respected elders of the deposed Qing Dynasty in terms of both age and rank. People from the north such as Wang Kemin were all his disciples, but Chen maintained his integrity, and during the period of occupation, he never interacted with the enemy or puppet regimes. Therefore, when the Chairman first came to Shanghai for inspection after the victory of the War of Resistance, he personally visited Chen's residence to express his condolences. He passed away this time due to a minor illness, and his students and former colleagues all mourn in unison, as his modesty and great virtue were deeply touching. Chen's remains are scheduled to be encoffined at his residence at No. 157 Jiangyin Road at 3:00 PM today. The attached photo is a portrait of Chen taken by photographer Lang Jingshan this spring.

### Public Trial of Okamura Can be Heard Nationwide, Broadcast via Radio Station at the Time; Spectator Seats Limited to 400

General Yasuji Okamura, a Japanese war criminal, will be publicly tried on the 23rd at the auditorium of the Municipal Council. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense specially dispatched two adjutants to inspect the venue and plan necessary arrangements yesterday afternoon. Originally, it was planned to set up 1,000 spectator seats for the public trial. Due to space limitations, it has been decided to reduce this to 400 seats. Ambassadors from various countries in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai, will be invited to attend, so the issuance of spectator passes will be strictly limited. However, the Military Tribunal believes that the historic scene of Okamura's public trial will surely be of concern to the entire nation. To compensate for the shortcomings of the limited seating, in addition to planning to install loudspeakers in the main streets near the Municipal Council to broadcast the trial proceedings to the public, it has also been decided to use the Xindu Radio Station (call sign XLST, wavelength 1200 KC), which is run by the Municipal Council, to simultaneously broadcast to the entire nation.

### Beer Factory Owner Murder Case: Main Suspect Arrested in Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] The Hongkou Police Precinct received a tip-off the day before yesterday that bandits were hiding in Room No. XX of the New Oriental Hotel at No. 35 Dekang Lane, No. 22 Qiujiang Road. Xu Shibin, the head of the Criminal Division, ordered his officers Ying Rumo and Gu Zhongshu to lead police to the scene, where they arrested two robbers on the spot and confiscated a pistol. According to their confession, one was named Zhou Hongsheng, twenty years old, who used to work as a staff member at the Nanjing Yumin Monthly Magazine. He was later dismissed for some reason. Recently, he learned that Sun Youbo, the editor of Yumin, had come to Shanghai from Nanjing, carrying a self-provided pistol, and was staying at Room 107 of the New Shanghai Hotel in Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road. He used the excuse of visiting Sun to steal the gun and then joined forces with the notorious bandit Wang Jianfu (the other arrested criminal) to commit robberies in the western part of Shanghai. After further interrogation of Wang, the officer in charge, Wang confessed to numerous crimes, and also confessed to being the main culprit in the murder of the German owner of the Ewo Brewery. The precinct believes Wang has committed numerous crimes, so they have applied to the District Procuratorate for detention in order to continue the investigation.

### Poor People's Rice Ration Certificates Cannot be Used Alone

The issued rice ration certificates should be used together with the household rice ration certificates when purchasing rice from rice stores and cannot be used alone in order to avoid double benefits.

### The First Time in Three Hundred Years: Heroes from All Walks of Life Gather in One Place; Stunts and Acrobatic Skills Abound at the Tianchan Stage National Martial Arts Competition

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] For the past few days, there has been a National Martial Arts Competition performance at the Tianchan Stage every afternoon. It is organized by the Northeast Branch of the Central Martial Arts Academy to promote national martial arts, starting from the opening on the 16th and lasting until the 21st. Yesterday was the third day of the performance.

The host of the competition is Lieutenant General Li Daheng, the director of the Northeast Branch of the Central Martial Arts Academy. The sponsors include Bishop Yu Bin, Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the Central Martial Arts Academy, and Zhang Fang, a legislator from Henan. Twenty-one national martial arts and combat groups are participating. It is said that a situation like this, where "heroes from all walks of life gather in one place," is the first time since the three hundred years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty.

Yesterday, the performing units included five martial arts associations: Huashe, Hualian, Jingwu, Qunying, and Yuzhong. The performances included various boxing styles and various weapons. The nature of the performances included solo, doubles, and one-against-two matches. In addition to knives, spears, swords, and halberds, the types of weapons included the crescent shovel, pilgrim staff, and nine-section whip. The martial arts included styles such as Gongli Boxing, Huaquan, Single Knife vs. Spear, Yan Qing Drunk, and Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl. It can be said to be a dazzling array, a grand spectacle.

White-Haired镖师 (Dart Thrower)　Unchanged Complexion After Finishing Boxing Set

It is really difficult for outsiders to judge the level of skill and the depth of expertise. The audience's cheers mostly focused on the energetic scenes of fighting and grappling. Whenever weapons clanged on stage, shouts were heard, and the stage vibrated with the force, dust flying, cheers would erupt from the audience. However, at this time, the "experts" among the judges on the stage may not necessarily show approval. It is said that the quality of martial arts should be judged by whether the feet are firmly planted, whether the movements are quick and powerful, and whether the eyes are bright. If any of these three are missing, the skill has not yet reached the level.

In one of the programs, an elderly man with white hair, nearly seventy years old, performed. In the combination of falling, tumbling, and turning, his skills were extraordinary. After finishing a set of boxing, his complexion remained unchanged. This old man is said to be Cai Guiqin, the leader of the Hualian Martial Arts Association. In his youth, he was a镖师 (Dart Thrower), making a name for himself in the greenwood of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. He is so old and yet still so strong, which shows the effectiveness of martial arts in strengthening the body and prolonging life.

Six-Year-Old Child Performs　Actually Possesses Complete Form

Comparable to this old镖师 (Dart Thrower) was a six-year-old child from the Yuzhong Martial Arts Association. He is probably less than two feet tall, but when he performs, he actually possesses complete form. His Monkey Fist and Drunken Fist are not only lifelike in expression but also methodical. Several somersaults with his head not touching the ground were even more crisp and clean. This child is starting to practice at such a young age, so his skill will be truly immeasurable when he grows up.

In the way of martial arts, there are distinctions between the Shaolin, Wudang, Kunlun, Emei, Tianshan, Solun, and Guandong schools. I remember when I was a child reading martial arts novels, I was fascinated and privately yearned for the heroic figures, sword immortals, and chivalrous warriors depicted in them. When I grew older and gained more knowledge, I realized that this era had long passed, and guns and bombs had replaced fists, knives, and halberds. However, as an exercise for strengthening the body and the race, martial arts itself still has its value.

If We Want to Strengthen the Body and Strengthen the Nation　We Must Promote Martial Arts

According to Lieutenant General Li, the host of the competition, the way of martial arts emphasizes the circulation of qi. The internal problems of the body must be addressed before one can practice kung fu. This is where martial arts is superior to Western sports, because Western sports only seek muscle development. He said that before the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people paid great attention to martial skills. At that time, their physique was much taller and stronger than it is now, and the average lifespan was also much longer than it is now. Unfortunately, after the Manchus took over, due to ulterior motives, they emphasized literature and devalued martial arts. As a result, national martial arts declined, and the physique of the Chinese people became weaker and weaker. He believes that if we want to strengthen the body and strengthen the nation, we must promote martial arts.

Lieutenant General Li himself is very accomplished in practicing qigong. Yesterday, he showed it to reporters, and when a stream of qi was directed to his abdomen, it swelled up like a fully inflated soccer ball. In today's program of the martial arts competition, he will personally perform a set. Tong Zhongyi, who served as a martial arts judge at the National Games, will also show his skills on stage today.

### Wealthy Merchant Accused of Being a Traitor, Deng Zhonghe Hosts Reporters, Considers Letter from Wan Lihlang to Him to be Forged; Mayor Solemnly Declares the Accusation is Unrelated to Special Donations

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Zhengwen, a member of the Agriculture and Labor Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, has accused Deng Zhonghe, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, of being a traitor to the High Procuratorate. In addition to the ongoing investigation by the judicial authorities, both parties have been publishing announcements in various newspapers in recent days, making their respective statements. First, Deng Zhonghe accused Zhu Zhengwen of being an "extortion bandit" because he had attempted to extort him twice without success, forging documents, and falsely accusing him of being a traitor out of spite. Zhu Zhengwen then published an announcement yesterday, stating that he had accused Deng Zhonghe of being a traitor and had collected various solid evidence. He said that Deng's accusation that he was an "extortion bandit" was a slanderous attack, which constituted criminal liability, and he would separately pursue legal action. After seeing the report, Deng Zhonghe published announcements in various newspapers today, refuting Zhu Zhengwen's announcement, calling it "all lies and exaggerations, demonstrating the abilities of a village woman scolding in the streets." Deng also publicly hosted reporters yesterday to report on this incident and the issue of special relief donations. In addition to pointing out that Zhu had extorted him twice, he also stated that the reason Zhu accused him of being a traitor was based on a letter from Wan Lihlang, who had been executed, to him. The gist of the letter was that he had donated 50,000 military blankets to Wan Lihlang's troops and 150,000 military blankets to Deng's troops during the period of enemy occupation, so he could obtain cotton control rights. He believes that this letter is a forgery.

Regarding the special relief donation, according to Deng, his Anle Textile Factory, in addition to having been transferred three times by the Wool Spinning, Cotton Spinning, and Dyeing and Weaving Associations at the end of last month, he also pledged to donate 50 billion when he met with Mayor Wu on the 4th of this month. As for the photo of the Wan Lihlang letter shown by the mayor, he believes that it was also delivered by Zhu, with the aim of malicious propaganda.

### Fundraising Committee Proceeds to Investigate Deng Zhonghe's Assets

Yesterday, a reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about Deng Zhonghe's donation fundraising situation. Mayor Wu replied that there were still no results. After Mayor Wu had negotiated with Deng Zhonghe several times, Deng only agreed to donate 50 billion yuan, which was a far cry from the target set by the Fundraising Committee, so the committee decided not to accept it. The Fundraising Committee has now begun to investigate Deng's assets.

### Mayor Admits to Showing Photo

Regarding the rumor that the accusation of Deng Zhonghe being a traitor was related to the special relief donation, Mayor Wu solemnly denied it. He said that Deng Zhonghe received a letter from Zhu Zhengwen after being accused, listing Deng's inferior acts as a traitor, but he did not know Zhu Zhengwen. Moreover, Deng was accused very early, and the court had already been secretly investigating him. As for the fact that Mayor Wu had shown Deng Zhonghe a photo of the Wan Lihlang letter, Wu said that the photo was forwarded by a committee member, and he had repeatedly received reports from various parties accusing Deng Zhonghe of making a fortune from the national crisis, which was in line with the special donation fundraising standards set by the central government. He showed him the photo to persuade him to voluntarily donate.

The reporter further inquired about the progress of the special relief donation. He said that those currently being pursued were all notoriously stingy wealthy individuals. He firmly believed that once this hurdle was overcome, other problems could be easily resolved.

### Ironclad Evidence of Communist Spies Orchestrating Student Unrest Continued from Page Two

(4) Inciting the "June 2nd" Student Unrest, Plotting the "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" in Vain: Just as students in various regions were gradually awakening and patriotic school protection movements were successively unfolding, forcing the conspiracies of communist spy students to subside, the Communist Youth League Central Committee was greatly alarmed. It secretly ordered communist spy students in various schools to intensify the creation of sudden student unrest, and launched the so-called "Three Strikes and One Tragedy Movement." It was predetermined that the Communist Party's "Anti-War Day," June 2nd, would be the general mobilization day for a total student strike, demonstration, and parade in the valley. After deliberation by communist spy student representatives from various student federations gathered in Nanjing, they were separately notified to schools to get the communist spy students to fully promote the "June 21st General Strike and Parade." Fortunately, the security authorities in various regions solemnly declared their determination to prevent it closely and various reasonable guidance, forcing communist spy students in various regions to successively abandon their "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" attempts on "June 2nd." The day actually appeared particularly peaceful everywhere.

(5) The Conspiracy Surrounding Yu Zisan's Suicide: On October 23rd, the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications authorities discovered a letter from Huang Xianlin, a third-year student in the Agronomy Department of Zhejiang University, sent from Shanghai to Yu Zisan, the director of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association. The letter stated that Huang was dispatched to Shanghai by Yu to participate in the Communist Student Federation, and reported to Yu that his superiors had sent Huang Shimin and Chen Jianxin to Hangzhou to guide the brewing of the "Anti-Mobilization Order" and to strive for the work of student self-government associations in various schools. Yu was asked to go to the train station on the 25th to meet them. Thereupon, the security authorities made prior arrangements and simultaneously apprehended Yu, Huang, Chen, and another person in charge of a reading group, Li Bojin, in the hotel. Communist books, documents, lists, and other secret documents were seized on the spot and transferred by the security authorities to the court for investigation. Unexpectedly, the suspect Yu, fearing punishment and attempting to frame the government, took advantage of the guards' negligence and committed suicide by slitting his own throat. As a result, under the instigation of communist spy students at Zhejiang University, committees for "Handling Funeral Arrangements," "Rescuing," and "Accusing" were established, brewing a large-scale student unrest. Students at Tsinghua and Peking University in Beiping, incited by communist spies, also went on strike in response. Fortunately, the fact of Yu's suicide was publicly proven, and the authorities provided effective guidance. Although the funeral once stirred up trouble, it did not lead to a major incident.

(6) The Deliberately Launched "May 21st" Incident: Communist spy students at National Central University in Nanjing originally attempted to create an "incident" on the "May Fourth" Memorial Day. As a result, they failed to achieve their goal due to insufficient mass support. Subsequently, the planned evening party on "May 20th" was blocked by the Greater Nanjing Student Federation. Thereupon, they changed the date to the evening of "May 21st." At this evening party, the program performed was as extreme as possible in insulting the head of state and slandering the government, causing dissatisfaction and serious protests from some students who were stirred by righteous indignation. Unexpectedly, the armed pickets organized by communist spy students actually beat and humiliated the audience and privately tortured Li Zhimin and Ni Yuwen, two students from Central University. As a result, after the evening party, two communist spy students from Central University were dragged to the Garrison Headquarters by the angry and indignant audience. Unexpectedly, they were mistakenly sent to the Youth Department, which refused to accept them and sent them to the police department for transfer to the Garrison Headquarters. Later, the Dean of Students of Central University took them back that night. Thereupon, communist spy students used this as an excuse to go on strike for one day on May 22nd, held a demonstration, and surrounded the Youth Department, making unreasonable demands. Various extremely insulting and slanderous slogans and banners were scribbled on the walls of the Youth Department. Finally, thanks to the calm handling by Minister Chen of the Youth Department, no trouble was caused. However, the rampant nature of communist spy students and their lawless disruptive actions were evident here.

3. Recent Communist Student Movement Conspiracies and Summer Vacation Work

In order to coordinate with the expansion of military rebellion, the Communist Party is trying to make student unrest the core of urban disturbances, use schools as concessions to cultivate rebel cadres, and lure and coerce them to engage in armed riots in rural areas. According to documents seized from the Communist Party instructing communist spy students, the basic task of the Communist Party's student movement this year is to "fundamentally and rapidly and advantageously shake and destroy the rule of the reactionaries." The document puts forward five basic strategies for the Communist Party's student movement this year:

(1) The old forms of student movement must be abandoned, and all possible and favorable conditions must be used flexibly.

(2) Emphasize the effect of propaganda and education and avoid unnecessary sacrifices.

(3) Attack compromiseism and defeatism, and correct blind actionism.

(4) Strengthen the connection between the city and the whole country to avoid being defeated one by one.

(5) Be prepared to attack at any time and do not be satisfied with small victories.

Therefore, the formulation of its basic student movement plan lists items such as starting from doing a good job in homework and living with classmates, from shallow to deep, from near to far, from small to large, from low to high, inside and outside the school, stepping up efforts, and welcoming the new upsurge.

The focus of work specified by the internal and external projects of the school is:

"The focus of student work should be placed inside the school, and the development and purpose of the struggle should be pushed outside the school to the ocean of the people. In the school, we should gradually improve the students' awareness and closely unite the students' strength. In the work, we should cultivate cadres, forge cadres, and lay a deeper and more solid foundation to establish the central fortress of the student movement, and then gradually promote it and continuously transport a large number of cadres to the outside of the school to support the work of other backward departments, resolutely step into the ocean of the people and the main force of the revolution, combine with workers and peasants, strive for the liberation of the people, and complete the glorious historical task, but the transportation is not uprooting, and it is not only to demand materials but not to plant seedlings, but to transport with a plan in a large number of cultivation, speed up the cultivation and continuously transport to maintain the balance of the development of the student movement."

The central work in the project of stepping up efforts to meet the new upsurge is:

"Revolutionary history has proved that the vast majority of great engineers, writers, scientists, politicians, and politicians are forged from the most acute and intense struggle, not from greenhouses that are divorced from actual struggle, so in addition to the need to constantly carry out current affairs learning, spread the situation after the great counter-offensive of the Liberation Army, the suffering of the people and the crisis of the dictator, the happy life of the people in the liberated areas, the specific policies of the Liberation Army, the development of the patriotic democratic movement, and the prospects of the new democratic China, we must also strive to learn about rural and peasant knowledge, learn the skills to serve the peasants and organize peasant struggles, understand the ideology, and be ready to go to the countryside at any time to accept the new upsurge of the revolution."

It is enough to prove that the Communist Party is trying to make the student unrest blend with its military rebellion in order to actively support the conspiracy of the Communist Party to destroy the national order and massacre innocent people.

In terms of application, the Communist Party's instructions are: to consider the objective environment and subjective conditions, and to adopt various forms of "illegal struggle" and "legal struggle" respectively, and in order to implement its strategy of "each student unrest is the forging, review and preparation for the next student unrest", to carry out the stage of rectification and preparation between its "campaigns" and "campaigns", brewing the so-called "fundamentally and rapidly and advantageously shake and destroy the rule of the reactionaries" of the "new upsurge of the student movement", which is manifested in the summer vacation work as follows:

After the beginning of the summer vacation, the Communist Party's pseudo "National Student Federation" has temporarily stopped plotting large-scale student unrest across the country, and has turned to the stage of consolidating the plans and deployments to wait for the opportunity to rise again, the reasons for which are:

(1) Accepting the instructions of the Huadong Branch of the Communist Party.

(2) Schools are on vacation, and most students are dispersed.

(4) During the student unrest in April, May and June, cadres and organizations were too exposed and needed to be adjusted urgently.

According to the Communist Party's Huadong Bureau (the scope of activities is Subei, Sunan and the area west of the Jinpu Road in Anhui Province) recently secretly issued an instruction on the "New Direction of the Student Movement in the Current Stage", the main points are briefly stated as follows:

"The government is stepping up repression, and the student movement is facing greater hardships and difficulties. Two deviations must be corrected: (1) The tendency to be too left, and to continue to engage in large-scale mass actions, without grasping the principle of "reasonable and beneficial and expensive", without taking into account the government's inevitable blows, resulting in unnecessary losses: (1) The tendency to be too right, and to hide passively and wait blindly. Although difficulties have increased, if we can correctly estimate the objective environment and fully grasp the party's route, we can still overcome them. The direction of the student movement in the current stage should be: (1) Concentrate our forces, and strike at a certain point in a hierarchical manner, expand the united front, and narrow the scope of attack, so as to avoid being isolated in the movement, (2) Consolidate the existing positions, and carry out decentralized operations, from near to far, from inside to outside, and gradually develop, with the determination of long-term hard work and the method of steady fighting, accumulating strength little by little, preparing strength, and welcoming the climax, (3) All mass movements, take life struggle and economic struggle as an opportunity, wait for the opportunity to mature, and quickly turn into political struggle, and timely put forward the slogans of anti-American imperialism and anti-× rule. (4) Coordinate the daily economic interests of the broad youth with the long-term political interests, combine the "patriotic democracy" work with daily life, and establish mass relations and foundations from the collective solution of life problems and learning problems," etc.

Based on the above instructions: the pseudo "Shanghai Student Federation" has held several meetings in early July to determine its summer vacation work policy as follows:

(1) Stop large-scale actions temporarily, preserve strength, and reorganize and consolidate the organization.

(2) Return from political struggle to students' own interests struggle (life, economy, learning).

(3) Disperse and go deep into the society and the countryside to conduct investigation, liaison and propaganda to establish the basis for the cooperation of the student movement and the social movement.

The above three items are related to the application of the Communist Party's phrase "step by step and strategically". From the reorganization of the organization, the transformation of the content and method of struggle, to the planting of seeds and the deployment of forces for the new student unrest in the next semester.

Regarding the students' action principles and the deployment of the student unrest in the next semester, the pseudo "Student Federation" has put forward three slogans: (1) "Individual Liberation" (referring to sneaking into the Communist area), (2) "Joint Defense in School", (3) "Collective Return to Hometown", the following are the manifestations of the activities in various places: (1) Regarding the unity of students: such as running summer tutoring schools, reading clubs, typing training classes, lectures, travel groups, investigating the employment situation of graduates and determining the liaison method, running candidate service groups... etc. (2) Regarding the reorganization of the organization: temporarily suspending the recruitment of new members, stepping up the anesthetization of middle school students, extensively expanding new peripheral groups (such as running small journalist training classes), arranging the "Student Federation" members of this year's high school graduates, and planning to take the entrance examinations of national and private universities in order to become new cadres in major colleges and universities in the next semester. The Communist Party has also established a branch within the pseudo "National Student Federation" to strengthen control and manipulation. (3) Regarding the decentralized development of social activities that instigate rebellion: such as running literacy classes and free night schools, conducting rural visits, taking the opportunity to promote "anti-supporting Japan, anti-drawing Ding, anti-collecting reality" to citizens and peasants, and compiling various "living reports" and singing.

4. The Truth about the Communist Party's Mass Inducement of Young Students to Sneak into the Communist Area

It can be seen from the above that the Communist Party is painstakingly plotting a glimpse of the conspiracy to deploy the new student unrest in the next semester. However, what must be paid special attention to is the phenomenon of a large number of communist spy students sneaking into the Communist area this summer vacation. Its nature can be divided into: (1) The Communist Party transferred back for training, preparing to send back again, (2) The face is exposed, fleeing to escape punishment, (3) Bewitched by the Communist Party's slogan of "welcome to participate in the construction work of the liberated area", being induced to go, (4) Fantasizing about the life of "revolutionary armed struggle", being induced to participate in the armed riots in the rural areas behind the government.

The above two items (1) and (4) are part of the Communist Party's conspiracy to strengthen "urban work" and "rural work" behind the government, while the two items (2) and (3) belong to the conspiracy of "Communist area work", so the entire activities of the Communist Party are using Communist-ified youth as a source of manpower, and one of the basic goals of the Communist Party's "student movement" is to "cultivate rebel cadres through actual actions". The following are reliable evidence of the various situations of professional students sneaking into the Communist area recently:

(1) Regarding the transfer and training of cadres to strengthen "urban work": the Communist Party recently received instructions from the pseudo-central government, ordering "a large-scale expansion of urban work across the country, and drawing a large number of workers to study in the urban work department and then assigning them to work in various places... Everyone is inciting the masses in the heart of the enemy's rear, striving for the middle forces, doing a good job in underground work, preparing for the situation to come..." Therefore, the urban work departments of the Communist Party in various places have recently been mobilizing cadres for training, including student movement cadres. Communist Party students in colleges and universities in Shanghai mostly used the name of "summer sightseeing" as a cover, and transferred to Tianjin and Qingdao in two places, and then sneaked into the Communist area for training, which lasted about two months, and some went to Hong Kong for training. When Luoyang fell, more than 300 middle school students captured by the Communist Party were trained by the Communist Party in Zhu Jiaguan in Lingbao, and all of them will be sent back to the Guanzhong area behind the government, using their student identity to cover up their activities. For young students who secretly sneaked into the Communist area in Northwest China, the Communist Party specially established the pseudo-Yan'an University Luochuan Branch to accommodate and train them, and used "study and test at any time" as a slogan. The Communist Party in the Exi Xiangnan area established the pseudo "Patriotic Democratic Cadre School" to recruit and train young students. The Communist Party in the Yue Min border area is also actively recruiting middle school students to give them training. The training class of the ninth sub-regional workers' department of the pseudo-Central China Military Region is located on the coast of Juegang, a county of pseudo-Ru (Bi) Dong (Tai), and trains spies of the Communist Party in the Jiangnan area.

(2) Regarding fleeing to the Communist area to escape punishment, Hua Binqing, a graduate of Central University in Nanjing (has been arrested), attempted to flee to the Communist area in Chao County, Yuan Shuidou of Fudan University fled back to the Communist area in Shandong two months ago, Gan Weiyuan of Jiaotong University has also sneaked into the Communist area, and Yan Tingchang, the secretary of the Guanghua "Student Federation" branch, has voluntarily dropped out of school and fled back to Subei. Several students from Peking University, including Deng Te, who were previously arrested in Beiping in a Communist spy case, were released on bail by the Special Criminal Court. After being repeatedly rejected, they have fled to the Communist area.

(3) Regarding being incited by the Communist Party to sneak in to participate in the work of the Communist area: according to Communist Party students in Shanghai, the Communist Party's Central China Military Region (Subei) recently planned to recruit 2,000 college students from Beijing and Shanghai to work in the Communist area. On July 2, Jiaotong University discovered that a Communist Party student who had been expelled had posted a notice inciting students to go to the Communist area, which is one example. Among the 56 students expelled from Huaxia University on July 5, two-thirds of them left Shanghai in batches in late July, either to Subei and Shandong, or to Hong Kong to enter the Communist area in Guangdong to participate in the rebellion. Yucai Middle School is one of the Communist Party's student movement bases in Shanghai. This year, some graduates of the school have been introduced to the Communist area. In the Pingjin area, Communist Party students launched the so-called "Jidong Action Movement" in various schools, inciting the arrested, "students who are afraid of exams, go to the Communist area in Candong", and have been found to have formed a group, including Sun Jinghuang, the principal of the Beiping National First Midwifery School, and her husband, Zhang Wenjie, Qu Zhiming, Wang Zhenfang, Zhao Huiyuan, Tangshan Feng, teachers of the Central Primary School in Kaiping County, Yu Hongye, students of the Beiping Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, Cui Hua, Li Pan and others. In addition, during the period when Kaifeng was once lost, 79 Communist Party members and members of the Democratic League of Henan University fled to the Communist area in Western Henan, including Ji Wenfu, Wang Yiqi, and Li Houfu. In Hong Kong, the Dade College of the Democratic League officially announced to students on June 5 that it would assist students who have completed their studies or have financial difficulties and are about to withdraw from school or who volunteer to work in the "Liberated Area" The regulations stipulate that those who wish to go to the "Liberated Area" of Ao Gui Min, South China and Nanyang can be introduced by the school board and Xinhua News Agency respectively.

(4) Regarding being induced to participate in the so-called "rural work" to engage in armed riots in the rear: the Yunnan anti-bandit troops found that there were leading figures in the former Kunming student unrest among the Communist Party members in Da Yao Bin Le, Lvxi, Shiping, Yinbei and other lines, such as Ma Li (female), Shu Shou Xun, Jiang Yongzun and others. The Communist Party's Huashang Daily also admitted recently that a large number of Communist Party students and teachers participated in the Communist Party troops in Yunnan. In Hong Kong, the Communist Party has been chanting the so-called: "Intellectuals go to the countryside" and has been engaged in riots for a long time. Recently, it has been constantly found that primary school students are also abducted to the Communist area to participate in the training of the "Little Children's Team" (also known as the "Little Heroes" Team), which has been confirmed by the Hong Kong government and the students' parents, and many cases have been cracked.

It can be seen from the above that the Communist Party today is stepping up the use of schools to induce students, on the one hand, to launch urban riots and rural riots in our country, and on the other hand, to increase the manpower of the Communist area and cultivate rebel cadres. The Communist Party's so-called principles of "combining urban democratic movement with rural armed struggle", "Communist area work and government area rear are progressing simultaneously", and "cultivating rural work cadres from urban struggle" have now been applied one by one. Here it is further proved that the seriousness of the current student unrest has reached the point of endangering the security of the entire country and society, and it must be thoroughly eliminated.

### Miniature News

Shaoxing

[Our Newspaper] The return of civilian land for the Cao'e Airport in this county has aroused many doubts from all walks of life. Disputes have occurred repeatedly, and even armed fights between landlords and tenants have occurred. This was learned by Lu, the station chief of the Ningbo Air Force Station, who came to Shaoxing on the 16th to inquire about the airport land with the county government. It is now known that the original area of the land was more than 800 acres. When registering in 1947, more than 70 acres overflowed. During the re-registration this year, some lawless elements, seeing that there were profits, competed to register first, many of which were impersonations, false evidence, and false claims. As a result, the amount exceeded the original acreage by more than 600 acres, resulting in an opportunity for embezzlement. Station Chief Lu found that the accounting staff had embezzled as much as 30 billion yuan. Currently, local people believe that the return procedures are quite unfair and demand that the county government re-register.

Haimen

### Please Improve the Nanmatou Ferry by the Health Bureau

The Jiangnan Wharf (i.e., Lujiabang Ferry Station) on the other side of the Huangpu River is an important ferry for people traveling to and from Pudong. The Tongren Fuyuantang Lifesaving Bureau is located in the middle. Coffins are displayed horizontally, flies and maggots gather, the autumn sun is rampant, and the stench is soaring. Travelers coming and going are pushing their noses and complaining bitterly. At the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, the epidemic is prevalent, and it is very easy to spread. If we do not find a way to improve the ferry, and once the epidemic area is reported, the consequences will be endless. Shanghai is an international city with a dense population. Preventing problems before they occur is urgent. I sincerely hope that the health authorities will find a way to improve it for the benefit of pedestrians. It is a public convenience.

### The Transportation Management Committee Reviews Non-Quota Goods, Approving 30,000 US Dollars Daily, The Person in Charge of the Non-Quota Department Announces the Review Situation

The Transportation Management Committee stipulates that import goods on the "Appendix" (3A) categories must apply for import permission, but the quantity depends on the actual needs and foreign exchange positions, which is quite flexible. Moreover, the review procedures of the committee take a lot of time, so all walks of life are quite dissatisfied with it. According to the person in charge of the non-quota review department of the committee, the foreign exchange amount woven into the "Appendix" (1) (3A) categories of goods was previously stipulated to be 50,000 US dollars per day and 1.5 million US dollars per month, but in reality, due to backlog relations, the average daily approval is only more than 30,000 US dollars. From the beginning of July to date, a total of 1.25 million US dollars has been approved in one and a half months.

According to the person in charge, this is not caused by the slow procedures of the department, but there are considerable difficulties. It is rumored that the committee has approved the import of 10 million US dollars of production equipment and other materials, which is actually a part of the US aid, which is slightly different from the work managed by the committee. It is also said that the committee has received more than 100 applications for self-provided foreign exchange in the past. Since the promulgation of the measures for the import of overseas Chinese capital and foreign funds, there have been hundreds of applicants, but at present, the implementing rules have not been approved by the Executive Yuan, so it is not convenient to handle them for the time being.

### Wavering Sentiment in the Market: Chinese Stocks End Uncertainly

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were marked by wavering sentiment and tight credit conditions, leading to an exceptionally anxious trading day. The morning session opened weakly, and the situation worsened consistently. A brief rally occurred mid-day but quickly stalled. The closing was very uncertain. With the exception of cement and real estate stocks which reached their daily limit, the rest saw mixed results.

Initially, negative economic news created uncertainty. The market was also disappointed that previous rumors regarding the State Bank’s deposit surplus proved false. Everbright Cotton Yarn opened at 168,000 yuan and fell sharply to 162,300 yuan before being driven back up to 164,500 yuan. Eventually, unusual business activity and a tight money supply caused general stocks to slump. Sell-offs occurred. Besides Shanghai Cement and Everbright Cotton Yarn rising to their daily limits, everything trended lower. Around noon, off-market interest rates rose to 29 and 32 yuan, causing a drop to a low of 161,200 yuan. Shanghai Industrial maintained its position. By the noon close, aside from Everbright Cotton Yarn and Shanghai Cement, which reached their limit, Xinyi, Qinxing, Tongyi, Yonggong, and Commercial Press experienced slight declines, with match stocks remaining flat. All other stocks fell by between 5% and 10%.

In the afternoon session, due to an eased money supply, Everbright Cotton Yarn opened higher at 168,500 yuan. However, renewed external pressures caused a surge, driving the price to a high of 173,300 yuan. This rally was short lived. With the exception of the two cement stocks and one real estate stock, which remained at their daily limit, the remaining stocks retreated from their highs. Conflicting rumors regarding State Bank’s clearing activities further fueled market uncertainty. After struggling, Everbright Cotton Yarn closed at 169,800 yuan. Following the close, due to the State Bank's large clearing surplus, asking prices rose slightly. Compared to the morning close, except for China Cement and Everbright Cotton Yarn which were at their limit, Xinhe, Dongxing, Tongyi, Datong, Underwear, Commercial Press, and Zhabei rose by 5%, with the rest experiencing small gains. Off-market, unlisted stocks such as Dasheng Culture, Bank, Tobacco, and Public Utilities rose by about 5%, while the rest were also stable.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, high prices were stifled by tight credit conditions, preventing sustainability. Types A and B reached 2 million, Type C reached 2.7 million, Type D reached 2.16 million, and Type E reached 2.28 million, all new peaks. A slight correction occurred near the close, but the bonds still rose significantly. Room 552 was sold, while rooms 500, 550, and 503 purchased. Room 360 bought some Type C and sold others, gaining 10% to 15% more than the previous close, with over 5 million in transactions.

### Money Supply Initially Tight, Then Loosens; Banks Still Have Large Clearing Surpluses

Yesterday, the money supply in the city first tightened, then loosened. Four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had significant clearing surpluses in the interbank clearing of checks and drafts, totaling 347.35 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a surplus of 97.82 billion, the Bank of China had a surplus of 228.58 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 48.65 billion, the Farmers Bank had a surplus of 11.32 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 28.37 billion, Postal Remittances had a surplus of 6 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a deficit of 10.71 billion. Commercial banks had a large clearing surplus of 85.8 billion, a small clearing deficit of 144.98 billion, and foreign banks had a total deficit of 210.95 billion.

Severe Shortage of Funds

Although 250,000 New Customs Gold Units have been issued, the supply of cash is still very scarce. Banks continue to impose strict limits on cash withdrawals, leading to numerous disputes between customers and banks. It is reported that after the new banknotes were issued, they were taken to other cities to profit from exchange rate differences.

### Goods Owners Insisting on Higher Prices Leads to Sluggish Sales; Little Change in Rice Prices; Premium Rice Market Softens Near Close

The rice market opened with a slight increase, then declined due to high prices in the production areas. Goods owners strongly insisted on higher prices, driving prices up by 200 to 300 yuan in the early market. However, due to sluggish sales, rice shops took a wait-and-see attitude, leading to a decline. Prices for regular rice in both the North and South markets rose by 100 to 200 yuan. Premium rice remained at its original price of 68 million, but softened even further near the close, with prices similar to the previous day. Brown rice opened at 55 million, then retreated to 54 million. Yesterday's total arrivals in both markets were 5,522 dan.

Flour

Fluctuated sharply. Due to weak sales to merchants, trading was light. Prices were initially pushed higher in the early market, but ultimately softened, although the changes were minimal. Old Army Flour reached a high of 23.8 million, then closed at 23.4 million. Battleship Flour fell from 23 million to 22.7 million, a net increase of 200,000 to 400,000. Red Bee rose slightly by 100,000. Jiancheng remained steady. Bran added 100,000 to 200,000. Wheat mill price opened at 37 million.

Grains

Increased slowly. Due to weak commodity prices, sentiment was low. Merchant demand was moderate. Soybeans increased slightly by 1 million. Hankou beans were 37 million. New corn was popular among merchants, rising by 300,000 to 400,000. Barley rose by 2 million. Broad beans were traded in small quantities with a slight price increase of 50,000. Sorghum did not open. Tea beans had little trading and stable prices. Sesame rose by 300,000 to 400,000, with yellow sesame being more popular. Peanuts declined by 200,000.

Cooking Oil

Various trends in the vegetable oil market. Soybean oil initially opened lower due to flat external commodity prices, starting at 158 million, but rose after a period of consolidation as sales picked up. Factory prices were not low, so soybean oil closed higher at 162 million, the same as the previous day. Rapeseed oil ended at 142 million, also steady. Sesame oil rose by 5 million due to lower prices and limited inventory. Small cart sesame oil saw merchant speculation, rising by 10 million. Soybean cake also trended higher, increasing by 200,000 to 300,000. Lizi cake was 14.1 million.

### Tea Market Rises

Yesterday, export merchants continued to seek tea on the foreign exchange tea market, especially for Zhenmei and other green teas. Jardine Matheson and Xinhua Wuchang tea companies showed a willingness to buy at any price. However, market supply has not increased, leading to limited supply and higher prices. Trading remained flat near the close. Prices rose across the board. Domestic sales followed suit.

### Banks Adjust Domestic Exchange Rates

The domestic exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury were adjusted on the 19th as follows: Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou, all 200 yuan; Shantou, 250 yuan; Chongqing, 250 yuan; Wuhan, 180 yuan; Qingdao, 30 yuan; Zhangjiakou and Jiujiang, all 200 yuan.

### Lumber Market Declines

In the lumber market, fir continued to decline. Sales of foreign pine were sluggish, making it difficult for the market to recover.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 18th] Rice inventory is low, sales are brisk, and demand is strong, continuing to drive prices higher. Other commodities are wavering due to rumors of peace talks.

### New Purchases Stalled, Scattered Sales, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Trend Soft

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market trended downward due to the excessive gains of the previous day, reduced customer demand, tighter credit conditions among traders, and weaker external commodity prices. Textile companies also lowered their bids, leading to scattered sales.

42-count blue fine yarn opened strong. Because the rise in recent days was less than coarse yarn, manufacturers were not selling much, leading to another increase. However, a strong wave of weakness caused a decline of 700,000 to 800,000. Near the close, many rumors of profit-taking emerged, ultimately resulting in the sale of 3.2 billion, with 3.25 billion due tomorrow, down 50 million to 100 million from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined slightly by 30 million to 50 million each. A total of 49 bales were traded.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market trended downward due to concerns about new economic plans and currency reforms, leading to weakened sentiment. New buyers were hesitant to make purchases. Market traders and merchants were eager to sell at high prices due to high interest rates. Many small traders were also selling at a loss.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened firm due to dyeing factory demand, driving the market price up by 800,000. However, increased selling pressure lowered the price by 4 to 5 million. Around 10:30, traders with available funds started buying, pushing the price up to 91.5 million, but ultimately settling at 90 million, a net increase of 1.8 million from the previous day (down 1.5 million from the off-market asking price).

Other fine cloths such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, Tongyanghe, and twill cloth, bleached cloth, and serge rose by 1.5 million to 5 million each. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth were stable due to factory adjustments. Yitong Navtuo rose by 10 million.

After the close, rumors circulated that the Hong Kong exchange rate was being eased, leading to bullish sentiment. Dragon Head fine cloth was being offered at 89 million, with 90.5 million due tomorrow. A total of 2,160 pieces of cloth were traded.

Also, due to rising prices of various commodities in the afternoon, 21-count Shuangma yarn was trading actively off-market, up 3 to 4 million. Dragon Head fine cloth was 3 million higher than the afternoon close.

[Our Correspondent] Fulai Company's Siamese Eamlihao sailed from Shanghai to India yesterday, carrying over 3,100 pieces of yarn and cloth to Zhijia Port.

### World Games Basketball: China vs. Belgium, A Two-Point Victory in Overtime

— Special Correspondent, Zhong Zhen

[Special Dispatch from London] On August 2nd, at 9 PM, our country's basketball team was still at the Harlem Gymnasium in West London, engaging in their first round-robin match against the Belgian basketball team. Due to the rain, the audience was not particularly large. Our team members displayed exceptional skills, and ultimately, in a five-minute overtime period after a tie game, they narrowly defeated Belgium by a score of 36 to 34, with a one-basket difference. This was the first victory for our country's delegation to the World Games, and it was truly exhilarating. The lineup and game summary are recorded as follows:

Wu Chengzhang, Huang Tianxi

Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)

Li Shiqiao, Bao Songyuan.

Leading from the Start

Today, our country's basketball team was greatly boosted by the return of star player Li Shiqiao, who had recovered from illness and arrived in England by plane from Singapore. He made his first appearance and contributed to the team's momentum. After the tip-off, our team immediately took a 5-2 lead. Center Cai Wenhua scored with a long-range shot, making it 7-2. Belgium attempted to catch up, scoring a basket, but unfortunately, left defender Huang Tianxi fouled while Belgium was shooting, resulting in two free throws, making the score 7-6. After this, our team launched an offensive, with right forward Li Shiqiao, using his quick and skillful, beautifully stable movements, passing and attacking with right forward Wu Chengzhang, scoring two consecutive baskets, causing Belgium to call a timeout and make substitutions, resulting in frequent fouls. Our team ultimately led 16-13 at halftime.

Tie Game

After switching sides in the second half, our team continued with the original lineup. After some back and forth, Wu Chengzhang jumped up in an opening and threw the ball in with one hand. Center Cai Wenhua also scored with a long-range shot, giving the Chinese team a commanding lead of 20-13. Belgium launched a desperate counterattack, but their shooting was poor, missing many times, wasting opportunities. Despite their efforts to play with brute force, it was to no avail. In the last ten minutes, right defender Huang Tianxi injured his hand and was replaced by Jia Zhijun. At this time, our team still had a six-point lead at 32-26. Unexpectedly, in the last four minutes, Belgium suddenly launched a counterattack, scoring three consecutive baskets. The game ended with a tie score of 32-32.

Overtime Decides the Winner

In the five-minute overtime period, after switching sides, the situation was extremely tense. Both teams' cheering squads encouraged their players, shouting "Add oil!" After two minutes, the Belgian left and right defenders panicked and committed consecutive fouls, resulting in our team scoring four points from free throws, taking a lead of 36-32. In the last minute, Belgium scored a basket, but ultimately, our team defeated the Belgian team 36-34. This time, our country's basketball team displayed wonderful and clear passing. Li Shiqiao was agile and exceptionally nimble. Wu Chengzhang displayed both intelligence and courage. Center Cai Wenhua's long-range shooting was accurate, which was greatly appreciated by the foreign audience. The two defenders also covered both sides, showing great improvement compared to the match against Chile.

### Our World Games Delegation Departs England in Batches to Return Home

Tian Hanxiang Discusses Reasons for Failure

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Kunming, August 18th] Tian Hanxiang, secretary of our World Games delegation, said during his transit through Kunming: "Our delegation is departing England in batches after the closing ceremony. General leader Wang Zhengting, general secretary Xuan Shouyi, and others are taking a detour through the United States for observation. He, along with Lou Wenao, Chen Yinglang, and Wang Zhenglin, are in one batch. The entire basketball team will depart two days after them and are currently participating in friendly matches in Canada. Continuing, he said that although our athletes did not qualify for the finals in this competition, they have improved in terms of individual technique and sportsmanship compared to the previous games. The reasons for the failure are due to inferior physical strength and the lack of long-term, organized training. The basketball team also has problems with passing techniques. Because players from friendly countries, especially American players, mostly use fast passes, while our team still uses slow passes, the outcome of the games is determined by this. Cyclist He Haohua fractured his neck and suffered abrasions all over his left side during the competition. He cried because he was unable to win glory for his country. He is currently recuperating in England and is expected to be discharged from the hospital in about two weeks."

### Watered-Down Articles

— Wu Yong

Nine out of ten words spoken by a person daily are nonsense. Articles are refined words, and writers, when putting pen to paper, should be concise. The Chinese idiom "言簡意賅" (yan jian yi gai, concise and comprehensive) should be a fundamental requirement for articles. In other words, writers should strive to "speak at length when there is something to say, and briefly when there is nothing to say." Today, not only is there much nonsense in speech, but there is also no less nonsense in writing. In my opinion, rather than listening to incessant nonsense, it would be better if everyone suffered from stuttering and could not speak. The ancient Han Fei "stuttered and could not speak well, but was good at writing." Perhaps his "good at writing" was precisely because he "stuttered" and was not good at speaking nonsense.

Generally speaking, the writing of the ancients was far more concise than that of today. The reason for this is that printing in ancient times was difficult, and carving books was not easy, so writing had to be concise, which is one reason. Secondly, the ancients regarded "establishing words" as being on par with "establishing merit" and "establishing virtue," hence the saying "morality and writing." The sages of old only "retired to write books and establish doctrines" when "the Way was not practiced," viewing it as a very important matter. Their intentions were not entirely the same as those of today's people who desperately attack the authorities before taking office in order to advance their careers, but they are similar to Churchill writing his memoirs after retiring to recount past events in order to illuminate the rise and fall of dynasties. Thirdly, when the ancients wrote books, they never considered manuscript fees of how many yuan per thousand words. If calculated by the number of words, Mencius's seven chapters, with a total of 34,685 words, could be sold for approximately 200 million legal currency at today's general market price, enough to exchange for three loads of rice. Laozi's Daodejing, with 5,000 words, is even less valuable, probably only enough to exchange for two loads of coal balls. Nowadays, writers often dash off 5,000 words a day, and accumulating a month's worth of work is enough to match thirty Laozi's, but the more modern Laozi's there are, the less admirable their writing becomes.

This is not to say that articles should not be written, but rather that one should not rely on selling them for a living. Lu Xun's instruction to his son not to become a "hollow literary man" probably meant the same thing. But consider, if Mencius were born in this era and made writing his profession, and his family were not wealthy, then even if he did not divorce his wife, his wife would inevitably leave him because of the difficulty of making a living without rice. Would it not be a misjudgment to mislead people into such a state by making writing a profession?

Furthermore, it is true that the ancients wrote concisely and with a serious attitude because printing was difficult. However, this does not mean that today's advanced printing technology justifies careless writing and arbitrary content. On the contrary, precisely because today's printing technology is advanced, writers should be more serious and cautious when putting pen to paper. Think about it: with today's printing technology, articles written on the same day can be presented to millions of readers on the same day and spread throughout the country. The magnitude of its influence is not difficult to imagine, and the importance of the writer's responsibility is self-evident. But this is not the case. Today, there are many articles that, upon examination of their intentions, are simply speaking for one's own private interests, or they are elaborately structured, stretching three or two sentences into a lengthy article. Articles have expanded along with inflation and become "diluted."

Reading Han Mingxian's "For Whom the Bell Tolls," this book is over 300,000 words long, but after reading it, I feel that it could be summarized in just three sentences: During the Spanish Civil War, a patriot planned to blow up a bridge, and then had several physical relationships with a woman. The end of the book states that the patriot finally blew up the bridge. The author could have written these three sentences on the back of a postage stamp without feeling cramped, but he did not mind writing a large book of 467 pages. Among all the books I have read, this one stands out as the most boring, worst, absurd, and meaningless.

But looking back at our country, there have been similar books. People often think that our country's publishing industry is poor. In my opinion, rather than spending money to buy and read books written in extremely bad style and with extremely shallow meaning, it would be better to let it be poor and save some paper and ink.

### The Words of a Newsstand Vendor

— Chen Yixian

There is a newsstand near my residence (west of the entrance to the Jindu Cinema). I often go there to buy newspapers or magazines, and when business is slow, I often chat with the newsstand vendor. When the price of each copy of the Ta Kung Pao and Shen Pao increased from 40,000 to 80,000, the prices of various publications also increased simultaneously. He told me: "Before the price increase, I could sell about 7 million yuan a day, making a profit of 2%, which is a net profit of 150,000 yuan per day. After the price increase, I can sell about 10 million yuan a day, but it doesn't double to 1.5 million yuan." Now that the Ta Kung Pao and Shen Pao sell for 160,000 yuan each, one day I asked him about the sales situation. He said: "It's the same as before. The prices of newspapers, magazines, and books have doubled again, but sales have only reached 50% to 60%. On Sundays, I can sell up to 20 million yuan, but on weekdays I can only sell 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. Now I make a net profit of about 3 million yuan per day, but because prices often jump more than double or triple in half a month or a month, the standard of living is not as comfortable as it was with the previous income of 150,000 yuan." He also told me: "There are four people in my family, and although I have 80 to 90 million yuan a month, life is still very difficult." I asked about the sales of major newspapers, tabloids, and magazines. He said: "After the price increase, the sales of major newspapers are still normal. Xinwen Bao, Shen Pao, and Ta Kung Pao sell the most. In the past, tabloids such as Fei Bao, Luo Shihhan, and Tie Bao sold well, but after the price increase, there are fewer buyers. As for magazines, Guancha sells the easiest, followed by Zhanwang, Xinwen Tiandi, etc." Analyzing the above words, one can draw the conclusion that the number of readers has decreased by about one-third in the recent two months of inflation.

In the publishing industry column of the Ta Kung Pao on July 22nd, there was an article entitled "Nightmare of the Publishing Industry," which said: "He dreamed that Mr. Price was flying an airplane with many passengers on board, all of whom were fat, strong, and rosy-cheeked. He remembered the names of these passengers: Miss Gold, Mrs. Silver, Mr. Rice, Young Master Flour... etc. He then looked at himself and his friends, such as manuscript fees, newspapers, books, writers, readers, etc., all of whom were gaunt and haggard, with a deep pallor on their faces. He couldn't help but smile bitterly."

This article, written by Han Songjun, is extremely profound and makes one feel very awkward, unable to laugh. The cultural industry has indeed reached a dead end. Not only publishers, writers, and readers have a deep pallor on their faces, but even those in the newsstand have been greatly affected. I am writing this article to supplement what Han Song has written insufficiently.

### Three Recent Poems

— Zhang Yiqu

河南河北又兵戈，雁失歸羣燕失窠，夕照洛陽宮一角，天涯涕淚在銅駝！(Henan and Hebei are at war again, Geese lost their flocks, swallows lost their nests, A corner of Luoyang Palace in the sunset, Tears flow to the horizon on the bronze camel!)

落帆亭 (Luofan Pavilion)

落帆亭外落帆船，船去船來共一川（亭在嘉興城外，舟楫過此下帆），妾似來船郞似去，去來船總讓人先。(Sailing boats drop their sails outside Luofan Pavilion, Boats come and go together on one river (The pavilion is outside Jiaxing City, where boats lower their sails), I am like a boat coming, you are like a boat leaving, The departing and arriving boats always give way to each other.)

汪亞塵自美寄贈魚樂圖 (Fish Playing, a Painting Gift from Wang Yachen from the United States)

殷勤寓里故人書，展拜新鱗錦不如，栩栩幾忘身是蝶，愉愉寗識我非魚；曾經桑海參三昩，久歷風波付一噓，兵革黄塵今似昔，天涯猶有白雲居。(A letter from an old friend from afar, Unfolding the new scales, not as beautiful as brocade, Vividly, I almost forget that I am a butterfly, Happily, I recognize that I am not a fish; Having experienced the mulberry sea and understood the Samadhi, Having endured the storms, I let out a sigh, The wars and yellow dust are like the past, There is still a white cloud residence on the horizon.)

### Ullambana Festival

— You Mojun

Among the twelve months of the lunar calendar, July is considered the "Ghost Month," so when this month arrives, folk customs include the so-called Ullambana Festival, especially on the fifteenth day, which is the most lively. I remember when I was young, I liked to watch the big-headed ghosts, small-headed ghosts, and impermanent ghosts in the parade, especially the Ghost King, and I was most afraid of the Ghost King. Thinking about it now, it's quite funny. Nowadays, these things are no longer seen. What can be seen are only monks setting up altars in the streets and alleys, releasing flaming mouths, which can be considered a decoration for this ghost festival.

The word "Ullambana" is originally a transliteration from Sanskrit, meaning "upside down," referring to the merit of doing this to relieve the suffering of beings in hell who are hung upside down, not to drive away plagues and epidemics. Therefore, in Yan Zhitui's Family Instructions, the final chapter states: "If you want to repay the boundless virtue and sorrow of frost and dew, sometimes make offerings and the Ullambana Festival in the middle of July, I hope you will do so." The final chapter is Zhitui's will, which earnestly mentions "Ullambana," which can serve as proof that it is not for driving away plagues and epidemics, and it shows that this custom already existed during the Six Dynasties. Nowadays, in the customs of Jiangsu, when a person dies and the first Ullambana Festival arrives, it is called the "New Ullambana Festival." Descendants must hire monks to recite scriptures to transcend the deceased, in order to fulfill filial piety, which is still the intention of the Six Dynasties, but they don't always practice Ullambana.

### Gong Xiaogong and Zhao Huifu

— Zhu An

Gong Xiaogong is a legendary traitor, but there is no evidence. In Beidu, I once saw someone trying to sell a large album of his handwritten letters, all addressed to Zhao Huifu. The handwriting was very strange, and one could tell at a glance that the person was not upright. However, when discussing his own academic thoughts, he still spoke like a Confucian scholar. When discussing the court at the time, he still adhered to the rules of a subject, not as arrogant as the legends say. This is the best research material on Xi Shi's life, but unfortunately, I don't know who owns it now. Later, after seeing the Chronological Biography of Zhao Huifu compiled by Jinren Chen Naigan, I learned that Zhao's Neng Ju Diary had also been leaked out, which included a letter to Wei Banzhong describing his fallout with Gong over the sale of steles. The matter was extremely convoluted and trivial. It was because he was poor and sold things, and because of selling things, he was particular about the value. This is something that collectors and celebrities often cannot avoid. The reason he wrote to Wei was that they were both close friends who could mediate. Mo Shen and Ding'an both belonged to the Daoguang Dynasty celebrities. Because they sought knowledge of anecdotes and paid attention to current affairs, they were both dissatisfied with the status quo. Also, because they were inclined to New Text Confucianism, they liked very much unconventional and strange arguments. Their thoughts and behaviors were not accustomed to by the people at the time, so they became more and more eccentric. I heard that Wei Mo Weng personally chopped the plates of his own Sacred Martial Records in his later years, and it is also rumored that he suffered from phlegm disease in his later years. It is quite suspicious whether he had some revolutionary consciousness. It is unavoidable that Xiaogong's being viewed by people as a traitor is also a manifestation of revolutionary thought. Even Zhao Huifu, who was known as a disciple of Xiangxiang, had a passage in his diary of the sixth year of Tongzhi expressing his dissatisfaction with the Qing Dynasty.

... Yu said: The world has been at peace and unified for a long time, and it will inevitably gradually lead to division. However, the ruler's virtue is inherently important, and the atmosphere has not yet opened up. If it is not a rotten heart, then the situation of the collapse of the earth and tiles will not be formed. Judging by the intensity, the disaster in the future must first fundamentally overturn, and then the various regions will have no master, and people will govern themselves, which will probably not take fifty years. Shi frowned for a long time and said: Then should we move south? Yu said: I am afraid that it will sink to the bottom and will not necessarily be like Jin and Song. Shi said: The current dynasty has righteous ruler's virtue, or it will not come to this. Yu said: The ruler's virtue is righteous, and the country's prosperity has been heavily rewarded. The founding of the country was too easy, and the slaughter was too heavy, so those who had the world were too skillful. Heaven's way is difficult to know, good and evil do not cover each other, and the virtue of the later rulers is not enough to rely on.

From the sixth year of Tongzhi to the third year of Xuantong, it was exactly forty-five years, and his prophecy came true.

### Talking About Meditation Experience (Part 2)

— Jiang Wenyu

Actual Experience in the Past Twenty-Seven Months

When I first started meditating, I placed a watch next to me and counted my breaths silently, considering each breath as one count. Initially, I couldn't prolong my breaths, so going through a hundred counts took a very short time. Later, I continuously put in effort to gradually prolong my breaths. After half a year, each hundred counts took ten minutes. Now, it takes fifteen minutes. Master Zhu once said: "It is already very good to have fifteen minutes for every hundred counts." I believe I can prolong it further in the future.

The most difficult thing to achieve while meditating is not allowing any thoughts to arise. Sometimes, the more you try to eliminate thoughts, the more thoughts come forth endlessly, which is the most frustrating. There is no other way to deal with this difficulty except to train slowly and gradually subdue them. Even now, I can only truly maintain a state of no thoughts for fifteen minutes. Beyond that, I dare not say. I believe that by continuously training in this way, I can continue to prolong the time of thoughtlessness.

A clear mind with no thoughts allows the sensory and motor nerves to rest completely, which is obviously extremely beneficial for physical health. At the same time, a method of deep and delicate breathing is practiced along with it, which is the so-called abdominal exercise, allowing the sympathetic nervous system to be trained. Precisely because of this, two situations that cause impatience arise when first learning to meditate: (1) The chest feels stuffy and uncomfortable because, during normal breathing, muscle movement is only on the diaphragm. When practicing deep and delicate breathing, the diaphragm must move up and down. This is most uncomfortable when practice is not yet proficient, especially during the first month or two. When experiencing this feeling, I used great patience to restrain it. After three or four months, I felt my chest become empty, relaxed, and comfortable. (2) There is also the layer of no thoughts, which can sometimes also make one feel bored. The more you try not to think, the more thoughts surge like a tide. When one thought is dispelled, another thought arises. If one cannot endure this, one may suddenly get up and no longer want to sit. Because I had already made up my mind beforehand, I was able to cope with this somewhat. After about four or five months, I no longer felt so bored.

After four or five months, the first thing I felt comfortable with was the abdomen becoming warm, and then hot. By seven or eight months, the heat was even more intense. After a year, the heat also expanded in range, sometimes reaching the chest, extending to the upper limbs, then to the arms, and then to the back. At this time, the whole body truly felt an indescribable pleasure. I remember that in May of the thirty-sixth year—that is, after meditating for a year—there was one time when my abdomen felt hot, and I suddenly felt my chest tingle and relax. The skin and muscles all experienced a wonderful pleasure. This lasted for about ten minutes. In June of this year—that is, after meditating for two years—there was another time when my abdomen felt hot, and my chest immediately felt loose, which soon expanded to my left and right arms and hands. However, the abdomen feeling hot did not happen every time I meditated. It happened about six or seven times out of ten. Also, the abdomen usually felt hot only after meditating for thirty minutes, but there were also times when I felt hot after sitting for only ten minutes, but this happened less often. I believe that if I continue to meditate in this way, the wonderful states of chest relaxation, etc., mentioned above will continue to "flow forth."

In the first five or six months of meditation, the nerves in my head felt like they were wriggling, but it wasn't tingling. Sometimes, on both sides of my head, it felt like there was a line under the skin wriggling, moving up and down, passing along the sides of my face, reaching the neck, and seemingly going down to the chest. The sensation wasn't too difficult to describe. Once, I felt the wriggling under the skin on the top of my head quite intensely, and then it was directly on top, as if the middle of the right side had split open into a seam, but in an instant, it stopped as usual. This state of nerve wriggling gradually decreased after two years. In recent months, I have rarely had this feeling. Sometimes it only appears briefly and then disappears.

Also, after four or five months, my legs suddenly trembled slightly, three or four times. I haven't had this phenomenon for a long time now.
