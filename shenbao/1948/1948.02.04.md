### Regulations on Remittances and Cash Transportation from Various Regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou: Stipulating a Limit of Two Hundred Million, Promulgated and Implemented by the Ministry of Finance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] In order to cooperate with the strengthened implementation of financial control and credit tightening, and to prevent the excessive concentration of domestic funds in cities, while ensuring the circulation of funds for legitimate industrial and commercial businesses, the Ministry of Finance has specially formulated four management measures for remittances and cash transportation from various regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou. The contents are as follows:

For remittances from national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in various regions to Shanghai and Guangzhou, as well as remittances from national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in Shanghai and Guangzhou to other regions, those exceeding two hundred million should submit a detailed list of circumstances daily to the local Financial Management Bureau for verification. In areas without a Financial Management Bureau, submit to the local Central Bank for verification. When the Financial Management Bureau or Central Bank deems it necessary, it may notify the remitting bank to cease remittances for a specific remitter or to cease payment to a specific recipient in the future.

The amount of funds that national banks, bureaus, and treasuries, provincial and municipal banks, and commercial banks and firms in various regions request the Central Bank to transfer on their behalf each month should be directly negotiated with the local Central Bank.

For those transporting cash from inland areas to Shanghai and Guangzhou, each person shall not carry more than two hundred million yuan. Violators will have the excess portion deposited into a special account at the local Central Bank, and a three-month fixed deposit certificate will be issued, to be returned upon maturity. This regulation applies equally to silver and money businesses.

For those who, due to legitimate reasons, are unable to remit funds or transfer funds through banks and must personally carry cash to Shanghai and Guangzhou, they may apply to the local Financial Management Bureau for a cash transportation certificate, which they can carry as proof, and will not be subject to the above restrictions. In areas without a Financial Management Bureau, applications should be made to the local Central Bank. The Financial Management Bureaus or Central Banks in various regions should list the cash transportation certificates issued monthly and report them to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The above regulations have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry and reported to the Executive Yuan for record.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Suggests to the Executive Yuan to Restore Industrial and Commercial Loans; Expanding the Purchase of Manufacturers' Finished Products to Eight Locations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The government, in order to tighten credit, had temporarily suspended various loans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently received requests from various industrial and commercial groups to restore them and has suggested to the Executive Yuan:

Since the suspension of loans, various manufacturers have deeply felt the difficulty of capital turnover.

Industrial and commercial businesses generally feel a shortage of funds, and the need is especially urgent as the Lunar New Year approaches. Please restore loans before the Spring Festival.

In order to coordinate with production and maximize the effectiveness of loans, please adopt the method of order-based loans to purchase finished products in the future, and the industrial and commercial guidance offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should jointly conduct preliminary reviews with the Joint Treasury Board and its branches. Each point is presented for selection and implementation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The method of Shanghai National Banks and Bureaus purchasing finished products from manufacturers on behalf of the government was originally implemented only in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin. It has now been decided to expand it to Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, and to implement it simultaneously. Furthermore, depending on the industrial situation in each region, purchase methods will be drafted in consultation with the various national banks and bureaus, and a review committee will be formed for evaluation, with applications starting immediately. Furthermore, the Joint Treasury Board will dispatch key personnel to various locations to supervise the handling.

### Goods Without Permits Are Not Allowed to Be Shipped Without Authorization; Relevant Authorities Establish Implementation Measures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the implementation measures for the ban on importing goods without permits, it was resolved at the 25th meeting of the Executive Yuan: "From now on, goods without permits are not allowed to be imported. Violators will be treated as smugglers and all goods will be confiscated." The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has specially drafted implementation measures for the new ban on goods without permits, which were passed at the 8th meeting of the Import and Export Control Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. A report was presented to the Executive Yuan on the 3rd. These measures are based on Article 9 of the Import and Export Trade Regulations: "Importers must not place orders abroad before obtaining an import permit, nor may they ship goods from abroad." Furthermore, the measures passed by the Executive Yuan as announced in Announcement No. 3 of the Import and Export Control Committee stipulate: "From now on, goods without permits are not allowed to be imported. Violators will be treated as smugglers and all goods will be confiscated." The regulations for customs enforcement of the above ban are as follows:

Regarding goods shipped from abroad after October 1, 1947: A. The import declaration for the above goods, along with the import permit, should be submitted to customs within 15 days after the arrival of the import vessel. B. If the import declaration and import permit cannot be submitted to customs within the above-mentioned deadline, the goods will be treated as smuggled goods and should be confiscated. A disposition notice should be issued by customs and sent to the manager of the import vessel for forwarding to the consignee or importer. If the manager of the import vessel or the consignee or importer has sufficient reason to disagree with the customs disposition and has obtained written certification from the competent department of the Import and Export Control Committee that consideration should be given due to the need to supply domestic demand and allocate quotas, a written objection should be made within 15 days after customs issues the notice. If there is no objection after the deadline, the goods will be confiscated by customs. C. Goods without permits may not be applied for storage in bonded warehouses. D. For goods that are indeed unloaded by mistake from import vessels or goods declared on the manifest for transshipment, re-export will be permitted. E. For goods confiscated by customs according to the procedures in item B, the unpaid warehouse rent, vessel demurrage fees, transportation fees, and all other expenses, as well as the bank's lien, shall be resolved by the relevant parties themselves. Customs shall not be responsible for payment under any circumstances.

Regarding goods shipped from abroad after October 1, 1947, and already arrived at the port before the announcement of these measures (including goods stored in customs warehouses), the import declaration for the above goods, along with the import permit, should be submitted to customs within 15 days after the announcement of these measures, otherwise the above goods should be handled according to the procedures stipulated in item (1).

The above regulations also apply to goods imported by air.

### Funds for Increasing Grain Production Recovered 30 Billion Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The government has decided to increase grain production. The Ministry of Agriculture requested additional production funds, and 120 billion yuan was allocated last year. At the routine meeting on the morning of the 3rd, the Executive Yuan approved an additional 30 billion yuan, bringing the total to 150 billion yuan. The planned increase in grain production includes a total of 8 million dan of rice, wheat, and vegetables. It is reported that after the allocation of additional production funds last year, the Ministry of Agriculture dispatched personnel to various regions to assist and guide farmers in implementing increased production. The main uses of the funds are for fertilizers and small-scale water conservancy needs. Personnel currently going to various regions are gradually returning to Nanjing, submitting reports for the Ministry of Agriculture to use as reference. According to Agriculture Minister Zuo Shunsheng, speaking to reporters on the evening of the 3rd: Premier Zhang stated in the ten points of the economic reform plan that the Sino-US agricultural technology cooperation plan should be implemented as soon as possible. The budget for this item is a total of 1.8 trillion national currency and over one million US dollars. It has now been decided to begin implementation immediately, starting with one-fifth of the funds for tung oil research, agricultural economics research, and land surveying. Premier Zhang also expressed his agreement and hoped to implement it early.

### Reduction of Living Allowance Politburo Decides to Re-examine

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] When the Executive Yuan previously passed the measures to adjust the salaries of public education personnel, it was stipulated that all agencies should reduce their staff by a quarter within six months, and the living allowance should be reduced by 5% each month, for a total reduction of 25%. This matter has aroused objections from various parties. The Control Yuan, Legislative Yuan, and Political Consultative Conference have all expressed their opinions. At the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 3rd, it was brought up for discussion again. Various political commissioners spoke one after another, believing that this matter needed to be reconsidered, and decided to re-examine it. The Comptroller General was asked to gather the secretaries-general of the five Yuans to discuss it in detail, provide a plan, and then make a decision.

### Self-Defense Team Expenses Must Not Be Supplemented by Increased Taxes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Xuzhou four-province pacification conference decided to expand the self-defense forces, and the expenses would be borne by the local products and materials in each region. For example, Anhui Province would increase the tax on Huainan coal mines by 10%, and Henan would increase the tobacco tax by 10% to cover self-defense expenses. This matter was brought up for discussion at the political affairs meeting on the 3rd. The commissioners believed that national taxes should be unified and should not be increased. As for the expenses for expanding the self-defense forces in each province, they could only collect special self-defense donations from companies and firms in each region, and it was decided to reject the original proposal.

### Increase in Commodity Tax; Cosmetics and Luxury Goods Category Increased by 60%

### Amendment to Article 8 of the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country Passed by the Political Affairs Council and Sent to the Legislative Yuan for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Regarding the amendment to Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country during the Suppression Period, the Executive Yuan has passed it at the 41st meeting this morning and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review. Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations stipulates, "The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the Executive Yuan in consultation with the Judicial Yuan." The Executive Yuan previously passed the "Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts" at the 38th meeting and sent it to the Judicial Yuan for consultation with the Legislative Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Judicial Yuan replied directly, expressing its strong agreement with the original draft and believing that since it must be sent directly to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the "Emergency Punishment Regulations for Endangering the Country during the Suppression Period" should be amended to "The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by separate regulations," and requested the Legislative Yuan to review it together. At today's routine meeting of the Executive Yuan, it was decided to proceed according to the opinion of the Judicial Yuan and send it to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### Adjustment of Highway Transportation Prices Approved by the Executive Yuan to Take Effect from January

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Executive Yuan approved the adjustment of highway passenger and freight transportation prices at the routine meeting on the 3rd. The case was submitted by the Ministry of Communications based on the Highway Administration's report in December of last year: Due to the impact of foreign exchange on the price of automobile materials, which is increasing daily, and the adjustment of employee salaries starting in October, the cost expenditure has increased by more than double compared to September. Although subsidies of 24 billion yuan per month have been approved starting in October, they are far from meeting the actual needs. It is estimated that the cost in January 1948, if calculated based on the current transportation prices, would result in even greater monthly losses, which the national treasury cannot bear. Therefore, the Transportation Office was authorized to appropriately adjust the current transportation prices starting in January 1948, estimated as follows: Passenger transport: The average ticket price per person-kilometer is increased from 800 yuan to 1,400 yuan. Freight transport: The average price per ton-kilometer is increased from 7,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan. Car rental is increased from 5,200 yuan to 9,000 yuan. After adjusting the above transportation prices, there would still be a monthly loss of 44 billion yuan, and additional subsidies are requested. The Ministry of Communications then forwarded the report to the Executive Yuan, which believed that the recent price fluctuations, foreign exchange adjustments, and increased highway transportation costs were indeed facts. The request to adjust highway passenger and freight transportation prices starting in January seemed approvable, but the losses after the adjustment were still significant. It was proposed to order a rapid report on the business and revenue status of various roads in the previous year for review. Furthermore, the State-owned highway, railway, and postal and telecommunications enterprises, which had originally been resolved by the State Council in the summer of last year to "gradually abolish subsidies to achieve self-sufficiency," have, since implementation, required frequent price adjustments due to the impact of military affairs and prices, and subsidies have also increased significantly. In the future, detailed reasons should be presented and approved by the Executive Yuan before implementation.

This military operation began last month. On the 2nd, the national army force under Bi Shuwen encircled and suppressed bandits in Jingjiang Liuzhang Port.

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The suggestion by US Republican Senator Sands Shilong to issue new currency is not a concern for Chinese officials, but ordinary Chinese people who store US dollars all see it as bad news. Economic experts here are unwilling to speculate on the number of US dollars in China, but most acknowledge that the total amount is in the tens of millions. If the United States issues new banknotes, those who hold US dollars will have no choice but to exchange them for national currency at the official rate from the central bank or risk smuggling them to the United States to exchange them. According to foreign exchange control regulations, holding US dollars and other foreign currencies is not a crime, but buying, selling, or using foreign currencies is illegal.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Major General Chennault submitted a special article to the Scripps-Howard newspaper group today, urging the US government to immediately implement aid to China and "eliminate the threat of war." Chennault is currently the director of the Air Transport Division of the Executive Yuan and the leader of the famous Flying Tigers during the war. Chennault said, "The fuse of World War III is currently burning in the Northeast. The United States needs China's help to eliminate this threat."

[United Press, Washington] Major General Chennault wrote for the Howard newspaper group, advocating that "US military advisers and military guidance that China can accept without harming China's sovereignty" should be used to aid China. He also suggested that the United States should, at China's invitation, send General Wei Demai, Chief of Staff of Chairman Chiang during the war, to China to refuse to assume a position similar to the one he held under Chairman Chiang in 1945. As for the command of air combat, the United States should also send outstanding American tacticians based on China's invitation. American sources here explained on the morning of the 3rd that Chen intended to personally "fish for" this position, but General Chen told the United Press that this interpretation was completely unfounded.

Editorial

### Stability First! Rule of Law Paramount!

The nation is now entering a critical stage of suppressing bandits and quelling unrest. At the same time, the nation is also beginning to move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. At this stage, our most pressing need is stability, and also the rule of law!

The Communist bandits create disturbances, hoping to overthrow the social order through these disturbances. The demands of the general law-abiding people are obviously the opposite. What they need is not disturbance, but stability. The Communist bandits destroy the rule of law, hoping to undermine the government's credibility through destroying laws and disrupting order, thereby using violence to seize power. The general law-abiding people, however, only hope for a peaceful and prosperous life within the bounds of the law, so they must know to respect the rule of law.

Currently, regardless of the overall national situation or local conditions, the general law-abiding people already feel that they cannot coexist with the Communist bandits. With the Communist bandits causing trouble, if they are not eliminated and suppressed, the general law-abiding people will have no room to survive! Therefore, today, when we judge the right and wrong of a matter from the standpoint of the general law-abiding people, the standard is very simple: those who maintain social stability are good, otherwise they are evil; those who respect the national rule of law are righteous, otherwise they are crooked!

Taking Shanghai as an example, three unfortunate incidents have occurred continuously in the past five or six days: on the 29th of last month, the Tongji University student unrest occurred, and the mayor was beaten and humiliated; on the 31st, the dance industry petitioned, and the Social Affairs Bureau was suddenly destroyed; on the 2nd of this month, the Shenxin No. 9 Factory workers went on strike, forcibly occupied the factory, and dismantled machinery, using violence to resist the military police who arrived to suppress them. Judging from these clamorous and disruptive events, regardless of their background or whether they are related to each other, Shanghai, as an international metropolis, inevitably suffers the stigma of "turmoil." Precisely because of the disturbances, people feel that society is becoming increasingly unstable; also precisely because of the disturbances, people are even more uncertain whether the nation still has the rule of law.

What we want to point out here first is that democracy is definitely not "rule by mobs," and constitutionalism is definitely not "lawless governance"! All violent acts, regardless of their original motives, regardless of the object of their violence, and regardless of how pleasant the excuses they borrow, are absolutely not allowed in a modern democratic country. This is because the first meaning of democratic constitutionalism is to give everyone the equal right to freely and reasonably express their opinions within the legal framework, and the violence that is imposed must deprive some people of these legitimate rights and infringe upon them. Under mob rule, there is no freedom; under mob rule, there is no equality. If freedom and equality are lost, where can we hope for a peaceful and prosperous life? The reason why the nation wants to suppress bandits and quell unrest is to "rescue the people from fire and water," and what is meant by fire and water is the "upside-down" life of losing freedom and equality. Shanghai is, after all, only a place that the Communist bandits are conspiring to disrupt, not a bandit-occupied area ravaged by the Communist bandits. The general law-abiding people certainly have the right to demand that the government authorities guarantee stability and implement the rule of law. Only stability and only the rule of law can prevent Shanghai from slipping into the edge of mob rule.

From this standpoint, we believe that the general law-abiding citizens all support the solemn attitude announced by Commander Xuan and Mayor Wu at the press conference the night before last. The Tongji student unrest, the dance industry unrest, and the Shenxin No. 9 Factory worker unrest, regardless of whether there are Communist bandit lurking elements instigating them, the fact that they have evolved into riots is something that the general law-abiding people cannot tolerate. Just listen to the voices of condemnation from leaders and key figures from all walks of life in recent days, and you can know where the true public opinion lies.

Tongji students, wanting to argue with the government or school authorities over the organizational issue of the student union, even if they have reasons, they can only state their case rationally under peace and order. Once they riot, regardless of whether the violent act is directed at the mayor, even if it is directed at teachers or another ordinary citizen, it is illegal and should be sanctioned by law. Whether their original motive for petitioning is pure is secondary. Similarly, dance industry workers and dancers, in order to request a relaxation of the ban on dancing or a change in the ban on dancing policy, could also, according to the law, state their reasons and make a request to the government in a dignified manner. Even if the Social Affairs Bureau, which is implementing the central government's orders, has already drawn lots, it has not yet reached the point of actually closing down. There is still room to file an administrative appeal or appeal to public opinion. Unfortunately, the people who lead these groups, regardless of labor or management, do not have this kind of training in rational living. They are driven by a few unruly elements, indulging in momentary recklessness, staging this ugly drama of mobs destroying administrative organs. Thus, something that might have gained public sympathy, something that might still have had a way to turn around and salvage, has become a loss of social sympathy. As for the workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, their usual treatment was already not bad, and workers in other industries may have felt that they could not reach it. Yet, as the Lunar New Year approached, they suddenly closed the factory gates, coerced a strike, and even used violence to resist the military police. It is certain that they were coerced by a few mobs. Even if the majority of law-abiding workers still had reason, there was no way to escape at that time. We believe that if they reflect on it afterwards, the majority of Tongji students, the majority of dancers, and dance industry workers, and the majority of Shenxin No. 9 Factory workers, will certainly regret it. Regret is the root of repentance, the beginning of moving towards goodness. We would like to remind them: these bad consequences are all caused by a few mobs destroying stability and destroying the rule of law. Therefore, regret alone is not enough. They must wake up and, from now on, not only no longer be incited by those few mobs and become their sacrifices, but also stand together on the side of the law-abiding people and work hard together to maintain stability and respect the rule of law.

Finally, we would also like to offer a few unwelcome words to the government authorities. Mencius said: "Good intentions alone are not enough for governing; laws alone cannot be implemented by themselves." The people currently want stability, and the government must give them stability in order to be good governance. The people currently want the rule of law, and the government must first respect the rule of law in order to hope to implement the law. The current overall situation, the key lies in suppressing bandits and quelling unrest. Great things that help suppress bandits and quell unrest should be done with utmost effort. Other things should be put on hold. Do not be moved by fashionable terms, thinking that this is good governance and that is also good governance, and then try to do everything at once. The result will only be that the laws and regulations are as numerous as the hairs of an ox, and nothing can be done smoothly. Even the officials themselves do not understand how many existing laws there are for managing these matters. The world could have been fine, why must you "make trouble" and "create" some accidents yourself? People could have been living peacefully and happily there temporarily, why must you make them lose their jobs and break their rice bowls at this time? The winter before last, the government vigorously cracked down on street vendors and rickshaws. Fortunately, the central authorities considered the people's livelihood and temporarily leniently handled the matter during this extraordinary period, saying that anything that would affect the livelihood of the common people should be handled slowly. As a result, society reduced some of the factors of unrest. We believe that this is what a statesman who understands the overall situation does. We want to call on the government: the Communist bandits and their blind followers are searching in all directions for topics to create unrest. While the government authorities must strictly guard against them, on the other hand, we must ask everyone across the country to pay attention to all measures and facilities: stability first, rule of law paramount, and also to think deeply and carefully, and not to send them a few more topics.

### Tan Yunshan Discusses Feelings After Gandhi's Assassination: Physical Body May Perish, But Spirit Will Live Forever

[Central News Agency Changsha Dispatch, 3rd] After Indian Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, the world was shocked. This reporter especially visited Tan Yunshan, Dean of the Chinese Academy of India International University and China's cultural representative to India, who is currently on leave and residing here, to inquire about his feelings after Mr. Gandhi's death. He said: Mr. Gandhi's death was for the unity of India, for world peace, for the righteousness of mankind, and for the truth of the universe. It was a victorious death, a successful death, a glorious death, and there is no regret in death. What we mourn is the tragic change in the hearts of the world, and that Mr. Gandhi's great compassion, great benevolence, great courage, universal love, sacrifice, and spirit of saving people and saving the world are not only respected and worshipped by the 400 million people of India, but also loved and admired by people all over the world. Yet, he was not understood by one or two violent thugs who dared to commit the heinous crime of all ages and cause his death. Is this not a tragic change in the hearts of the world? I previously discussed with friends in Nanjing the plan to respectfully invite Mr. Gandhi to visit China. Who knew that this wish would not be fulfilled and Mr. Gandhi would die, and even be assassinated? How can its sadness and pain be expressed to the extreme! Mr. Gandhi's great deeds in his life are known to the world. The most commendable thing is that his words, actions, and will are absolutely consistent. For example, Mr. Gandhi engaged in the movement to liberate the untouchables and regarded himself as an untouchable. He wore the same clothes, ate the same food, lived in the same place, traveled in the same ranks, and rode in the same class of cars. Anyone who saw Mr. Gandhi was moved, even if they were stubborn stones and rotten wood. Today, the world is anxious and depends on Mr. Gandhi's leadership and influence. There is no limit to it. Alas, Mr. Gandhi died like this. However, Mr. Gandhi's physical body is dead, but his spirit will live forever. Among Mr. Gandhi's followers, there is no shortage of talented people who can carry on his legacy. We sincerely hope that India, the entire nation, will inherit Mr. Gandhi's teachings and work harder for the unity of India, world peace, the righteousness of mankind, and the truth of the universe.

The reporter group returned safely to Chengde at 12 noon and will try again on the morning of the 4th. Thirty bandits were killed in the battle, and one of our soldiers was killed. When the gunfire was very intense, the driver Liu Yongqing waited for the reporters to get out of the car and safely drove the car to a safe place, turning back on the road, never leaving the car. When the bandits' firepower gradually weakened, he still drove the reporters back. His bravery and composure are admirable.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 3rd] If the Thai government still refuses to settle the flag raising issue amicably with our overseas Chinese representatives, then our resident minister to Thailand will return home.

Minister Li Tiezheng held a meeting with representatives from the Seven Guildhalls at the embassy last week, and told the overseas Chinese representatives that the Nanjing side has not yet recognized the new Siamese government, and normal diplomatic relations between the two countries are still suspended, but he has tried every means to negotiate with the current new government on various matters related to the rights of overseas Chinese. Speaking of this flag raising issue, Minister Li said that if the Siamese government insists on implementing its order, forcing overseas Chinese schools to only raise the Siamese flag, he will return home immediately. At the meeting, the Chinese representatives (including Yun Zhuting, chairman of the QiongYa Guildhall) immediately decided to draft a joint application in the name of the Seven Guildhalls and all overseas Chinese schools, addressed to the Siamese Prime Minister, in order to resolve this matter.

### Fourth Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting to Be Held on the 20th of This Month, Discussion of Austrian Peace Treaty, U.S. Secretary of State Formally Proposes

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The State Department revealed that Secretary of State Marshall has proposed that a meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers be held in London on February 20 to discuss the Austrian Peace Treaty and the recent new proposals made by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's revised proposal was delivered to Washington on January 26. In addition, the representatives of the four foreign ministers will also discuss France's proposed recommendations on the disposal of German property in Austria, as well as other issues related to the Austrian Peace Treaty. The State Department also announced that it will send Robert, Deputy Director of the European Department of the State Department, as the U.S. representative to the meeting of the representatives of the four foreign ministers, to succeed Tukey, the U.S. member who recently resigned from his position in the Austrian Allied Management Committee.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] At the meeting of the four foreign ministers in December last year, it was agreed that the deputy foreign ministers should meet within five days after receiving the new proposals from the Soviet Union, and no later than February 1. Marshall said that although the Soviet Union's proposal was received on January 26, more time was needed to consider this complex plan, so he proposed postponing the meeting. Marshall, as the chairman of the next foreign ministers' meeting, has the power to reopen the meeting. If the four deputy foreign ministers can reach an agreement, the four foreign ministers will also meet to approve it and draft a formal proposal. However, the issue of German assets in Austria is extremely complicated, and a quick solution may not be possible. The Soviet Union's recent proposal includes the Soviet Union's request to lease several oil fields for a period of fifty years.

### Accusing the U.S. of Assisting in Reorganizing the Iranian Military, the U.S. Rejects the Soviet Union's Protest, Denies Attempting to Turn Iran into a Strategic Base

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] A State Department spokesperson stated that the Soviet Union's accusation that the United States is pursuing militarism in Iran is either a deliberate distortion or a pure lie. The Soviet Union accused the United States of attempting to turn Iran into a strategic military base, which the Soviet Union considers to be interference in the internal affairs of its southern neighbor. In addition, the State Department has two other measures to counter the Soviet Union's series of diplomatic and propaganda offensives:  Preparing to submit a note rejecting the Soviet Union's protest on the 21st of last month regarding the reopening of the wartime U.S. air base in Manrah, North Africa, which violates the Italian Peace Treaty.  Waiting for the delivery of another Soviet Union protest regarding U.S. aircraft reconnaissance of Soviet ships near Japan.

Regarding the Soviet Union's accusations against the United States' actions in Iran, State Department Information Director McKetmore refuted each item as "fabrications" or "distortions" without waiting for a detailed report. According to McKetmore, there are two military delegations from major countries stationed in Iran, one is a military advisory group, and the other is an advisory group to reorganize the gendarmerie. According to the published agreement, their tasks are limited to training and consultation, and the total number of people is only fifty. In addition, the United States has agreed to provide a credit loan of $25 million, allowing Iran to purchase U.S. military surplus, but the Iranian government is now proposing to only use $10 million of it. Moscow criticized that the United States is reorganizing the Iranian army in the American way and reforming the industry to manufacture American-style weapons, etc., McKetmore said that these are not true. McKetmore also denied the Soviet Union's claim that the United States is building a huge airport for aircraft outside of Iran to use, saying that the U.S. government is not building an airport anywhere in Iran. As for the claim that the United States is helping Iran consolidate its border defenses and is using aircraft to map the border, McKetmore denounced it as pure fabrication.

### Tehran, Iran in a State of Panic, Supreme National Defense Council Convenes Special Meeting

[United Press, Tehran, 3rd] After the Soviet Union issued a protest accusing the U.S. delegation of engaging in military preparations hostile to the Soviet Union in Iran, the situation suddenly became tense. The Iranian Supreme National Defense Council convened a special meeting on the 3rd. Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi said that Iran's reply to the Soviet protest is being drafted and can be completed on the 4th. Iranian Chief of Staff Lazimala said that he is constantly maintaining contact with the military defenses guarding northern Iran via radio, as rumors are rife in Tehran that the Soviet Union is about to conduct military operations in the area. The Soviet Union's note accused the U.S. military advisory group of directing Iran's military preparations. The acting head of the group, Marr, denounced the Soviet Union's accusations on the 3rd as completely fabricated. "The Soviet Union claims that a huge airport is being built in Kong Ying, but in fact there is no construction happening. The Soviet Union also claims that the U.S. military has occupied the U.S. wartime military camp near Tehran, but there are no military buildings there either, which proves that the Soviet Union's words are not true. The above-mentioned military camp is now inhabited by university students. Furthermore, U.S. military personnel have not approached the Soviet border to engage in reconnaissance or measurement flights."

### Allied Command Allocates 28 Japanese Warships for Japanese Police to Patrol the Coast; These Warships Will Be Equipped with Heavy Weapons

[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] Japanese sources reveal that the Allied Command has agreed to hand over 28 destroyers and submarines from the former Imperial Japanese Navy to the Japanese police to patrol the Japanese Inland Sea, territorial waters, and the Sea of Japan, and the East Sea. These submarine chasers are currently used to prevent smuggling activities at sea. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they had previously expressed hope that the peace treaty with Japan would include the following provisions: allowing the Japanese police to possess machine guns and armored vehicles to maintain internal security; an adequate coast guard to deal with piracy and smuggling; a small air force to support the police and coast guard.

Allied Command officials stated that submarine chasers have been performing anti-smuggling tasks for several months. Unofficial sources even stated that the Allied Command is considering equipping these warships with heavier weapons. According to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, most of the submarine chasers currently in service are old and dilapidated, with half of them requiring constant repairs. Their maximum speed is only 9 knots per hour, and they are not armed, with only the handguns carried by the police officers. Therefore, they are often unable to chase smugglers. The main force of the submarine chasers is stationed around Kyushu Island to prevent illegal intrusions, while the rest are stationed near Hokkaido, where they can assist ships in distress due to the large waves. Since the submarine chasers began operations, they have captured nine ships illegally entering the country, fifteen ships violating economic regulations, and rescued eighteen ships in distress.

### Frozen Deposits of European Private Citizens in the United States; US Decides to Control Them; Chinese Deposits Not Included

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US Treasury Secretary Snyder recently stated that measures to assist the Marshall Plan in gaining control over $1.1 billion in frozen deposits of people from various countries in the United States have been completed. The US National Advisory Council has approved this measure. Secretary Snyder disclosed the order while listening to the Marshall Plan at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The US National Advisory Council has repeatedly stated that no action will be taken regarding the $4.3 billion in free assets owned by private citizens of the sixteen European countries. Regarding this point, Snyder also stated that it is impossible to investigate the exact amount of private deposits or assets of foreign people in the United States, and the US government cannot control them. This control requires all parties to continue reporting their assets. Our country's deposits in the United States were completely frozen a year ago, but these frozen deposits of our country are not affected by the above measures. The United States has now set a deadline of three months, ordering direct or indirect owners of foreign assets to request their home governments to provide proof, confirming that their bank deposits or other investments are indeed their personal property and unrelated to enemy assets. If sufficient proof is not obtained for the frozen assets within the deadline, the deposit accounts will be canceled, and the funds will be placed under the US government. Subsequently, the United States will conduct a thorough investigation of the declared assets and notify the respective foreign governments. Assets for which proof is not obtained will be transferred to countries receiving aid under the Recovery Plan for future measures.

The United States supplied approximately 95 ships to the Soviet Union during the war under the Lend-Lease Act. The US State Department requested the Soviet Union to return these ships in March 1946, or to pay for them at their assessed value.

### Three Million Workers in West Germany Hold a 24-Hour General Strike to Protest Insufficient Food Rationing

[Reuters, Han, 3rd] Three million workers in the British and American zones went on a 24-hour strike today to protest the lack of food rations. Factories, stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues throughout the area were brought to a standstill. While 750,000 people in the American zone of Baden province were on strike, US military commander General Clay happened to be in Stuttgart in that province to address the monthly meeting of the American zone's state committees. The chairman of the province's trade union, Kleinauschnit, stated that the strike coinciding with Clay's presence in Stuttgart was purely coincidental. Upon arriving in Stuttgart, Clay issued a declaration stating that while he opposed the strike, he would not allow the situation to get out of control. British military commander Robertson convened an emergency meeting of the premiers of the British zone in Hamburg, and afterwards issued a declaration urging workers to maintain essential public utilities. Hamburg trams continued to operate as usual, and the trade union indicated that it did not intend to participate in the strike. Gas supplies in the British and American zones also continued as usual, but electricity supplies in some cities were reduced compared to normal. German Social Democratic leader Schumacher also appealed to the workers, pointing out that the strike would further hinder Germany's ability to obtain more food through self-help. Striking workers were also scheduled to hold major parades in major cities in the British and American zones this afternoon. Although military and police were on alert, officials did not anticipate any accidents.

Previously, Britain and the United States protested during the trial of Peasant Party leader Petkov in Bulgaria. As a result, the Bulgarian government claimed that the protests from Britain and the United States made it impossible to avoid Petkov's death sentence. Therefore, during the trial period of Maniu, the British government did not send a protest to avoid it being used as an excuse.

Rioters in Calcutta threw stones at the residence of the former president of the Mahabodhi Society, Mokerjee, and destroyed the society's newspaper office furniture and documents.

### Hull's Memoirs, Copyrighted by the North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

Isolationists Constantly Make Trouble for Themselves

The path to the establishment of the US neutrality laws was paved by listening to the advice of the Nye Committee. This committee was established by the Senate to investigate the manufacture and sale of munitions. I doubt that any congressional committee has had a more unfortunate impact on our country's foreign relations than this committee, except perhaps the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that previously considered President Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, or one that could be compared to it.

North Dakota Republican Senator Gerald P. Nye proposed a resolution in February 1934, calling for the establishment of a committee to conduct investigations, after publishing several papers advocating the disclosure of details of US manufacturers selling munitions to foreign governments.

After the Senate approved this resolution, minority Republican Senator Nye was appointed chairman of the investigative committee by Vice President Garner. Nye was a figure with a strong isolationist color, and the passage of the resolution was simply a casual result, without careful consideration. This was a major mistake, which Senator Pittman should be responsible for. Pittman himself was an isolationist in many ways. As a rule, when a special committee is established for a certain purpose, it should be chaired by a member of the majority party—which was the Democratic Party at the time—and not by a member of the minority party, especially in an investigative committee. Although Pittman was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he was busy with other work and decided to let Nye take over. If Pittman had recommended another chairman, the vice president would have accepted it.

If I could have dreamed that an isolationist Republican would be appointed chairman, I would have quickly opposed it, but I always assumed that a member of the majority party would be nominated according to usual practice, and that he would limit the investigation to legal and reasonable boundaries, so as not to turn it into a large-scale propaganda campaign.

Appointing Nye was a fatal blow, because under his chairmanship, the committee began to expand the scope of the investigation, attempting to prove that the United States' involvement in World War I was caused by American bankers and arms manufacturers. It ignored or refuted the significant reasons for our participation in this war, namely the illegal sinking of American ships and the destruction of American lives by German submarines, as well as the danger to the United States and its founding principles if Germany were to win. We had to advocate the principle of self-defense.

Our generation holds an international perspective, which is that if world peace is to be maintained, the United States must participate in this effort; we have argued for this point based on reason. Therefore, most of the members of this committee were, in fact, undermining the basis of our argument. Their view was that if the sale of munitions and loans to belligerent countries could be stopped, the United States could automatically avoid war, without needing to cooperate with other countries to achieve this goal. The growing dangers in Europe and Asia were merely a pressing reason for them to retreat within our country's borders, because they were opposed to giving any assistance to other countries to solve these dangers.

This committee insulted President Wilson's motives and sincerity in World War I, ridiculed our former allies Britain and France, and exonerated the German Empire, thus giving the American people a completely false view of why we participated in the 1917 war. The committee undoubtedly made useful disclosures regarding the arms trade, but the impact was to push our country into the deepest isolationism, precisely at a time when it was urgently necessary to use our influence to help avoid the increasingly imminent threat of war abroad.

The committee discovered that the country was enthusiastic about opposing big bankers and arms manufacturers. It attracted a lot of public attention, so its desire for fame was further heightened, hoping to gain more attention. Its chief investigator, Stephen Raushenbush, was largely the main body of the committee, generally guiding its activities. He was eager for the committee to make headlines, paying little attention to the impact of his news on other governments—not to mention our own people—and the news itself was often nothing more than rumors and half-truths.

Furthermore, the committee's senators simply allowed their chief investigator to do whatever he wanted, as often happens in this situation. The members of the committee were very organized, and there were quite a few capable people, several of whom had always taken attacking big bankers and arms manufacturers as a pastime. These people should bear most of the responsibility for the actual work of the committee and the fierce attacks on bankers and arms manufacturers. Their publicity director constantly fed so-called news to newspapers in this country and other countries.

On the government side, it was clear that no one could resist the vortex of isolationism. Just mentioning an investigation would elicit widespread welcome. The President and I, of course, agreed to cooperate with the committee, especially since its original purpose, namely investigating the arms trade, was worthy of praise.

After the committee spent the entire summer of 1934 reviewing documents and collecting evidence, it began to present its opinions on September 4. Our difficulties with other countries began almost immediately. The Buenos Aires government protested against certain rumors related to an Argentine admiral in the committee. British Acting Foreign Secretary Vansittart protested against slanderous allegations concerning King George V. The Mexican government protested against points involving President Rodriguez. Other Latin American governments objected to accusations implicating their senior officials in bribery. The Chinese government submitted a memorandum denying that a $10 million wheat loan obtained from us had been used to purchase munitions.

As a result, I personally went to see the Nye Committee on September 11 and spoke with them for two hours. I pointed out that our country's diplomatic relations were being harmed by the publication of rumors involving the heads or senior officials of other governments. Therefore, Senator Nye drafted a letter to me, acknowledging that some statements in the committee's records might create a false impression, which he deeply regretted. I myself also issued a statement clarifying that neither the committee nor any official of our government had any intention of offending any other government or its officials. I sent Nye's letter and my own statement to the ambassadors of the countries that had protested.

However, the situation worsened when the Nye Committee began to publicly involve documents from the State Department, the publication of which had not been approved at all. According to diplomatic etiquette accepted worldwide, after a government receives a document from another government, it is usually not made public until the other government officially approves its publication. So, for the sake of the Nye Committee, we began to enter into strained relations with many other governments. I found it extremely difficult to contain the exceptionally harmful news of this negligence. I spent a lot of time explaining or apologizing to other governments, because they were deeply displeased.

But when the Nye Committee began to study the background of World War I and began to investigate the records of New York banks that had dealings with the Allied Powers, our difficulties became even more acute. The British and Chinese ambassadors repeatedly protested.

I had been trying to get the President to support my efforts to limit the activities of the Nye Committee to reasonable boundaries. On March 15, I gave him a memorandum urging him to convene the Nye Committee to the White House for a meeting, advising them to "avoid any unnecessary provocations when publicly expressing opinions on issues that could hinder the relations between our government and other governments." The President did meet with the members of the Nye Committee four days later, but for some reason, he did not raise my request.

One point that I hoped the members of the Nye Committee would understand was that Hitler had already overturned the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and Mussolini was completing his plan to invade Abyssinia. The scene of Britain, France, and the United States fiercely arguing about documents from twenty years ago could not stop Hitler and Mussolini's plans. At this time, Britain and France were trying to get Germany to accept an arms limitation agreement and persuade Mussolini to abandon his aggression in Africa. The anti-British and anti-French wave caused by the Nye Committee could not help Britain and France's efforts.

However, the worst example of the Nye Committee's negligence was still to come. On January 15, 1936, in a public statement, the committee mentioned the contents of a confidential memorandum submitted by British Foreign Secretary Balfour to Secretary of State Lansing on May 18, 1917, which involved the secret agreements of Britain and other Allied governments. Nye claimed that it was a lie when President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing stated that they knew nothing about Britain's secret agreements before the Paris Peace Conference. We had previously consulted the British government, asking if they would allow the publication of this memorandum, which they refused, and we had notified Nye of this point on December 23, 1935. Therefore, this action was a serious breach of trust. I strongly protested to the Nye Committee, and as a result, it agreed to return the full copy of the Balfour memorandum to the State Department.

On January 20, I issued a statement to the press, elaborating the State Department's attitude towards the publication of confidential documents in the archives. I said that our government is clearly unable to publish confidential documents without the permission of the relevant government, because that government trusts us to keep secrets."

I said at a press conference: "I worked in the Wilson administration. Needless to say, I, like the American public, have the highest respect for his patriotism and honesty—as it was in the past, so it is now."

Nye's statement provided the springboard for the first neutrality law of our era for isolationists, and it is for this reason that I have detailed it at length.

The truth is that I did not want neutrality legislation. Of course, I did not want neutrality legislation promoted by isolationists like Nye, because it would tie the government's hands and feet, and it would tell potential aggressors like Germany, Italy, or Japan that they could declare war on their intended victims, and we would at that time ensure that our citizens did not supply munitions to the victims.

I did not want to see legislation that would tell the world in advance that if war broke out, we would not take action, because this would hinder our ability to use our influence to prevent war. Nor did I want to see legislation that stipulated that if war broke out, we could not give even the smallest amount of aid to the League of Nations, the world organization, to help it in its efforts to end the war.

### The Mayor, Though Ill, Travels Tirelessly for Impoverished Students - Holding Meetings to Raise Scholarship Funds, Securing 12.4 Billion on the Spot - Speaker Pan Admonishes Students to Know How to Repay Society

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship First Review Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Despite being ill, Mayor Wu attended and presided over the meeting promptly. Those in attendance included Pan Gongqing, Shi Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Gongyun, Li Ximou, responsible figures from the press, leaders from various industries, and presidents of various schools, totaling over 200 people. First, the Mayor briefly mentioned the recent Tongji University student protests, the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau by dancers, and the Longgong incident at the Shenxin Textile Mill. He then emphasized that with such social disorder, it was even more urgent to help young people who were out of school. He stated that the student protests arose from young people's dissatisfaction with reality, and the problem of impoverished students advancing in their education must be solved. Although he had been assaulted, he believed that young people were lovable and students were also lovable. The act of violence was committed by a few rioters, and he still cared deeply for all students. Rescuing those out of school was a responsibility they should fulfill, and he hoped that all sectors of society would donate enthusiastically.

Speaker Pan expressed his gratitude on behalf of everyone that Mayor Wu would travel tirelessly for impoverished students despite his illness, and he gave a brief report on the fundraising for scholarships. The fundraising goal for summer scholarships in the 36th year of the Republic [1947] was 5 billion, and the result was 5.996974 billion was raised. Of this, 4.561 billion was distributed, all of which was carefully reviewed by the Unified Review Committee before being directly distributed to the school authorities. Currently, various schools have high expenditures and have also increased tuition fees. The tuition fee for schools above the junior college level has been set at 4.5 million to 6 million. This number initially sounds very large, but when converted into the price of rice, it is only between three and four "dan" [a unit of dry volume], which is only about 30 yuan before the war. Moreover, the school authorities must take into account that the treatment of professors cannot be too meager, and their situation is indeed difficult, so they cannot be overly criticized. However, after the increase in tuition fees, the problem of being out of school has become more serious, so the target for this year's scholarships is set at 15 billion, which is twice that of last year. However, whether the target can be reached depends on the generous contributions of leaders from all walks of life. The committee has already issued notices asking all units that pledged donations last year to continue their donations. If the amount is insufficient, fundraising will be carried out in other industries.

After Speaker Pan finished speaking, the representatives from various sectors enthusiastically pledged donations on the spot. Yesterday alone, the total amount reached 12.425 billion. The list of pledges is as follows: This newspaper, 600 million; Xinwen Bao, 600 million; Dahua Bao, 100 million; Municipal Government, 5 billion; Stock Exchange, 1 billion; Municipal Bank, 1 billion; Yangtze Electric Company, 200 million; Central Bank, 200 million; Bank of China, 200 million; Bank of Communications, 200 million; Farmers Bank, 200 million; Central Trust Bureau, 200 million; Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, 100 million; Central Cooperative Treasury, 100 million; Cloth Industry, 500 million; Gold and Silver Jewelry Industry, 500 million; Dyeing and Weaving Industry, 500 million; Shipping Industry, 500 million; Inland Water Transportation, 100 million; Flour Industry, 500 million; China Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, 75 million; a reader of Dagong Bao, 50 million.

Speaker Pan then expressed his personal thoughts, stating briefly: Raising scholarship funds is a government and society cooperating together, and automatically helping impoverished students. However, we must take this opportunity to admonish the students that we do not owe them anything. Since we owe no debt, we have no obligation to raise this money. Students should understand that with society putting in so much effort, they should know how to repay society. If young people still do not understand and are still being used by others to stir up trouble, complaining that 15 billion is not enough and attempting to greedily ask for more, then what reason do we have to continue to care for these young people? I received news yesterday that students from various schools gathered at St. John's University to hold a meeting, advocating that the Municipal Standing Bureau should allow each school to raise funds on its own. I believe that this is absolutely unacceptable. Social order must be maintained. Students will not be allowed to block traffic and rush around everywhere, thereby disrupting social order. Furthermore, sporadic fundraising by students will likely not amount to 500 million or 1 billion, which will not help the matter and may instead create opportunities for causing trouble. Therefore, I believe that while the government should care for the students, it must also admonish them with a strict attitude! If any school is found to have students going out to raise funds on their own in the future, their eligibility to apply for scholarships will be revoked.

Subsequently, Commander Xuan, Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yunsheng, Zhu Jingnong, and others gave speeches separately.

Finally, the Mayor stood up and expressed his gratitude to the representatives from various sectors for their enthusiastic donations. He also reported that he had recently received intelligence that the Communist Party had recently published "Student Daily," in which they attacked the government's fundraising efforts for scholarships and declared that the government should guarantee that every young person has the opportunity to study. Such a claim is simply absurd. Today, I am publicly promoting "Student Daily," hoping that students will study it for themselves! Regarding the handling of the arrested students, he does not intend to be overly strict, but he will also not be lenient, and will handle it completely according to the law. Those who assaulted others will receive the punishment they deserve, and those who incited them will also receive the punishment they deserve.

### Mayor Wu Recounts the Whole Story of Being Assaulted

Regarding the whole story of Mayor Wu being assaulted at Tongji University the other day, Mr. Wu gave a detailed account yesterday. He said: Before the conflict occurred, I repeatedly advised the students not to move forward in order to avoid contact with the police. Around 4:00 PM, everything was still calm and peaceful. Most of the students were talking to me with great enthusiasm and rapport. Later, chaos suddenly broke out. I believe that someone must have been directing them. At that time, stones and mud were flying directly at the police, causing the police to become very emotional. At that time, a large group of students rushed forward, and I was standing in the middle of them. I only had a policeman and an adjutant with me. Suddenly, five people rushed towards me, and someone next to me shouted, "Hit him!" I personally heard the chairman of the school's student union shout, "Don't hit the mayor!" But I was already hit on the left and right sides of my forehead. Seeing that the situation was critical at the time, I quickly ordered the police, "Do not fire!" Before I could finish speaking, someone grabbed my throat. Someone next to me shouted, "Your police are hitting people!" I said, "Let me up, and I'll tell the police not to fire!" But someone next to me shouted, "Don't let him up!"

Recalling the time, I felt extremely dangerous.

Looking back on it, I felt that the situation at the time was extremely dangerous. The conspirators had already made meticulous arrangements, using students as sacrifices and the government as a tool, attempting to create a bloody tragedy. At the time when I was being assaulted, if I had just shouted "Help!", I am certain that the police would have opened fire. In order to avoid bloodshed, I ordered the police not to fire, and my throat was strangled. After calming down and reflecting on the pain, I realized that the conspiracy was truly frightening. Thanks to God's blessing and the strict discipline of the police, their plan did not succeed. Now, after the incident, the conspirators are spreading rumors, claiming that the mayor was not injured by students but was trampled by police cavalry, which is extremely absurd. I hope that young students will not be used by them.

### Li Mo'an Passes Through Shanghai on His Way Back to Tongzhou - Welcomed at a Tea Party by Fellow Jiangsu Natives

Seven groups, including the Jiangsu Native Place United Relief Association and others, held a tea party to welcome General Li Mo'an, Commander of the First Pacification District, Chief of Staff Cao Yaozu, and others, who were passing through Shanghai after attending the Xuzhou Pacification Conference on official business. The tea party was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the reception room on the sixth floor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Building on Guangdong Road. Several hundred prominent figures and fellow natives of Jiangsu residing in Shanghai were in attendance. Chairman Zhang Zhenxi delivered a welcome speech, and Zhang Jingli and Wang Zikui presented banners on behalf of the group. It is reported that Mr. Li and his party left Shanghai that evening to return to their defense area.

### Telephone, Gas, Water, and Electricity to Increase by 20% to 30%

The Mayor will make a final decision today on the adjustment of new prices for the four public utilities: electricity, water, telephone, and gas. The implementation may be announced as early as tomorrow. The increase in fares for trams, buses, small trains, and ferries will be postponed. It is reported that the average price increase will be 20% to 30%.

### Two Supervisory Committee Members Sent to Shanghai to Investigate Electoral Fraud

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Control Yuan, regarding the Shanghai legislative elections, based on information from various sources and Vice President Sun's report at the previous monthly meeting, believes that there is indeed a suspicion of fraud. In order to clarify the truth, the Control Yuan specially sent Supervisory Committee Members He Hanwen and Fan Zhengbo on the 3rd to conduct a thorough investigation.

### Rumor is that Chuan Zhengmo Returns to Shanghai After Inspecting

Lieutenant General Chuan Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd after inspecting Baoshan, Jiading, Taicang, Kunshan, and other counties. He will continue to visit the remaining counties in the near future.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Attaches Importance to the Shenxin Incident - Zheng Jiemin Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the Truth

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The news of the conflict at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill in Shanghai has reached the capital and has attracted great attention from all parties. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in particular, attached great importance to it. On the 3rd, he successively summoned Zheng Jiemin, Vice Minister of National Defense, at 4:00 PM and Gu Zhenggang at 9:00 PM to inquire about the matter and give instructions. Vice Minister Zheng immediately took a train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM to investigate the truth of the matter. Furthermore, President Zhang Qun summoned Zheng, Gu, and other relevant officials at 5:00 PM to discuss ways to handle the aftermath of the Shenxin incident properly. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang also attended the political affairs meeting on the 3rd and reported in detail on the course of the conflict at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill in Shanghai. After the members expressed their opinions, they agreed that in order to stabilize people's hearts, the handling of the Shenxin No. 9 Mill incident should still adopt a guiding approach. President Zhang also stated that some practical issues, such as year-end bonuses and welfare, should be resolved responsibly so that the lives of the workers can be stabilized.

### Shenxin No. 9 Mill Returns to Calm - Doors are Closed, Remnants Still Remain - The Instigating Workers Have a Tight Organization, the Source of the Wooden-Case Gun Bullets is Worth Investigating

[Report from this newspaper] The Shenxin No. 9 Mill has returned to calm after the turmoil of the previous day. Yesterday evening, this reporter went to inspect the mill and saw that the gates were already closed, with only the side door left open for entry and exit. Three or four policemen were patrolling outside the door, while some idlers from the nearby neighborhood were still peeking and craning their necks at the entrance. A notice posted on the wall by Yan Fang stated: "This mill has unfortunately experienced a strike. Various equipment inside the mill has been severely damaged. We are now actively organizing and gradually resuming work. Once the organization is complete, the resumption of work in each department will be announced separately." There was also a notice from the mill's industrial union stating: "The labor unrest that occurred in this mill has resulted in bloodshed, which was entirely caused by a few insidious elements. Our good workers were unfortunately used by these villains because they were unaware of the inner workings, which is truly pitiful. Our union, standing on the side of the workers, will urge the factory to resume production as soon as possible in order to maintain their livelihoods. We will do our best to protect the workers who did not participate in the riots. We hope that our workers will calmly wait for the date of resumption of work and not trouble themselves unnecessarily." The remnants of the conflict inside and outside the third iron gate inside the factory have not yet been cleaned up, and broken tiles, gravel, iron bars, and other debris are still scattered all over the ground. According to the person in charge of the factory, because most of the staff have not rested for several days and nights, and the relevant authorities are still waiting to take pictures as evidence, the cleanup will not begin until today. The replacement and repair of damaged parts on various machines is still possible and should not affect production. However, in terms of timing, it is feared that it will be impossible to resume work within the lunar year and it will be delayed until the beginning of the lunar new year. Bad elements among the workers will be purged, and the rest will continue to be employed.

Workers not involved remain in dormitories

According to Chief Qi of the Putuo Road Police Precinct, the five firearms lost by the police officers in the chaos at the Shenxin Mill have not yet been recovered. However, two wooden-case gun casings were found in the mill. According to what he knows, the military police who went to the Shenxin No. 9 Mill to suppress the unrest that night did not have these kinds of firearms and bullets, so the source of these firearms and bullets is worth investigating.

The workers who have been found to have no involvement in the riots are currently residing peacefully in the factory dormitories. The sixty-eight workers who were suspected and arrested at the time have been detained in the headquarters, Lujiawan, and Songchu police precincts.

5,000 rice bowls also used as weapons

According to the post-incident investigation, the workers' riots were well-organized in advance. The command center was located in the office of the mill's engineering department, which issued orders and controlled the actions of all workers. Underneath it, there was also a transportation team that used yarn-carrying vehicles to transport yarn spindles and parts to the second and third floors as weapons to resist arrest. In addition, ten large oil drums were found on the roof of the three-story fine yarn workshop, containing large amounts of stones, bricks, iron rollers, and iron wheels. At that time, the rice bowls in the dining hall were also used as weapons, so all of the more than five thousand rice bowls were destroyed.

Some female workers miscarried due to being crowded

According to the person in charge of the factory's labor union, the incident was purely instigated by a small number of conspirators and was not negotiated through the labor union. Most pitiful of all were the majority of female workers who were forced to participate. They were confined in the factory building and were not allowed to go out. Some of these female workers had infants at home or elderly and weak family members who were crying from hunger and cold. Some pregnant female workers miscarried due to being crowded, which is truly unbearable to hear.

### Police Chief Yu Announces the Aftermath of the Three Major Disturbances - Plans to Increase Security Police to Deal with Contingencies

The three major disturbances that have occurred in the city recently have all come to an end. Police Chief Yu announced the handling of the aftermath to reporters at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd as follows:

Regarding the Tongji University student protests and the assault on Mayor Wu Guozhen on January 29th, a total of 97 suspects were arrested. After a detailed interrogation, it was determined that Shao Zhao and two others were highly suspicious and suspected of being Communist spies. It was decided to send them to the Garrison Headquarters for military legal proceedings. Another 39 were sent to the District Attorney's Office for questioning, and the rest have been gradually released on bail. The situation at Tongji University has improved, so the authorities have decided not to dissolve the university. The armored unit of the police stationed at the school has been withdrawn, and only a security police squad is stationed nearby.

Regarding the incident of dancers and dance hall employees destroying the Social Affairs Bureau on January 31st, 797 people were arrested at the time. After two days and nights of interrogation, 116 people were detained, and the rest were released on bail. Among the 116 people, more than 40 were seriously involved and will be dealt with severely. Those with particularly serious circumstances will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for legal proceedings, and more than 40 others will be reprimanded and released on bail. The rest are still under consideration. Regarding the dance hall unrest, Section Chief Li Junhou of the Criminal Investigation Section stated that according to the interrogation results, it can be determined that the initiators of the incident were the employees (dance hall managers). As for the dancers who participated, there were no big names like "Ah Gui Jie" from Red Star or Da Dong. These people had shallow knowledge and experience and were easily agitated, just to make up the numbers. Therefore, the police's interrogation will be based on the criminal behavior to determine the severity of the punishment. Among the 40-plus people who will be dealt with severely, there is a person named Jin Ying who cut electrical wires and broke glass at the time, and another person named Tan Peiwu who shouted loudly, leading the crowd. The "three giants" of the dance industry, Sun Hongyuan, Tang Zongjie, and Hu Junyuan, are also included. In addition, there are also "Xiao Lang" and other elements who participated in the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau. They are very young and are interested in destructive work, but are ignorant and should be held legally responsible. Regarding the handling of these people, Yuan Wenzhang, Director of the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, suggested sending them to the vagrant work rehabilitation center, but a final decision has not yet been made.

Regarding the workers' riot at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill on February 2nd, a total of 199 people who were identified on the spot as the instigators were arrested, including 132 men and 67 women. Among them were Wu Shizhen, Fei Gaogen, Sun Hanchao, Zhang Fuda, Miao Xinggen, and others who played a leading role. The Criminal Investigation Section is currently conducting a detailed interrogation and will send them to the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Department or the District Attorney's Office for questioning, bail, or release depending on the severity of the circumstances. During the riot, 37 workers were injured and 3 died, including Wang Junmei (trampled to death), Zhu Minzhen, and Jiang Zhengxin (both shot to death). 51 police officers were injured, including 5 seriously injured. As for Zhang Yusheng, a Jiaotong University student who was arrested at the scene, Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Mill, proved that he was a teacher hired by the mill workers and has been taken back by the factory director.

Police Chief Yu also revealed that, in light of the recent disturbances, the police have drafted a plan to increase the security police by one more regiment, totaling one thousand people (currently there are two regiments), to deal with temporary emergencies.

### The Trade Union Confederation Announcement - Strictly Prevents Villain Activity

The Shanghai Trade Union Confederation, on the 3rd, issued an announcement regarding the unfortunate incident at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill, the original text of which reads: "The unfortunate incident at the Shenxin No. 9 Mill this time was caused by insidious elements who infiltrated the workers, deliberately destroying production and disrupting social order. Most of our workers were blinded by them and caused a bloody incident, acting blindly and going on strike suddenly, not only making unreasonable demands but also refusing negotiations. When the matter became unresolvable, although most of the workers realized that they were being used by villains and coerced by evil forces, they persisted for many days, eventually clashing with the local military police, which is truly unfortunate for the labor community. The damage to the machinery in the factory was also an unwise move. We hope that all trade unions will take strict precautions from today onwards. If any villains infiltrate the trade union or factory to carry out activities, they should immediately report to this confederation or notify the security authorities to investigate."

### Police Chief Yu and Others Sent to Console Injured Police Officers

In the Shenxin No. 9 Mill riot, police officers were ordered to suppress the unrest. The workers in the factory attacked the police with bricks, stones, and nitric acid, resulting in dozens of police officers being injured in the line of duty. Mayor Wu deeply commended the officers' service spirit and yesterday morning sent Police Chief Yu Shuping and Chief of General Affairs Ouyang Zunquan to the police hospital to visit them separately.

### Factory Manager Wu Kunsheng Talks About the Reasons for Difficulty in Accepting Conditions

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Mill, told reporters yesterday that whether the factory accepts the conditions proposed by the workers of the No. 9 Mill will affect the entire cotton textile industry and other industrial and commercial enterprises. The factory cannot accept them. As for the year-end bonus, it had already been distributed in 40 days, 50 days, and 60 days before the end of the lunar year, discounted at 80%, with a total of 23 billion yuan being distributed. The factory had already exhausted its resources when raising this amount and could not raise more funds. After the labor unrest is resolved, the Social Affairs Bureau still needs to decide on the handling of the aftermath. However, the original industrial union of the No. 9 Mill must be reorganized. All workers must re-register. They will be re-employed after investigation. He hopes that work can be resumed within the lunar new year.

### Work Stoppage at China Textile No. 1 Mill Returns to Normal After Persuasion

[Report from this newspaper] A work stoppage occurred at the China Textile No. 1 Mill at 62 Changshou Road, starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. Upon receiving the news, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Trade Union Confederation immediately sent personnel to persuade them. Chief Qi of the Putuo Road Police Precinct also personally led police officers to the factory to maintain order. The workers complied with the persuasion and resumed work at around 3:00 PM.

### Social Affairs Bureau Makes Preliminary Decision on Review Standards for Reopening Silver Shops

[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau is re-registering silver shops in order to allow them to reopen. Yesterday morning, a review meeting was held at the bureau for the application of licenses to silver shops. He Yanmin, secretary of the Financial Administration Bureau, Yao Guiqing, and representatives of the silver shop industry, Chen Dezhang, and Wu Pengnian, attended the meeting. Zhou Weixin, Section Chief of Price Management, and Wang Baoyun, Section Chief of Industrial and Commercial Registration of the Social Affairs Bureau, were also present. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division, chaired the entire meeting to discuss how to stipulate the review standards for silver shops. It was decided that: 1. The capital should be above 5 million. 2. The opening should be before the promulgation of the Supplementary Regulations to Article 4 of the Administrative Measures for Silver Shops' Purchase and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry. (New silver shops established after this time will be reviewed after being reported to the Ministry for verification). 3. The application for the silver shop and the person in charge should not be permitted if they have committed gold and banknote cases and have been criminally punished. 4. The person in charge of the newly established silver shop must have been engaged in the silver shop business for three full years and have official proof. 5. The silver shop must have a storefront and workshop facilities. 6. If the silver shop names are the same, there must be a consent certificate, otherwise, the review should wait until the name is changed. 7. Those who join the industry association will be given priority review.

After the above review standards have been stipulated, the Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to hold a meeting on the afternoon of February 7 to formally review them.

### Elder Brother Does Not Engage in Honest Work - Blaming His Infatuation with His Beloved Concubine

Woman Tragically Murdered, Body Buried in Mud Pond to Eliminate Traces, Exposure of Failure

[Report from this newspaper] At noon on the 2nd of this month, Chen Tianjun, a native of Suqian residing in a shack at No. 24, Lane 1166, Changning Road, reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station of the Xin Jing Police Precinct that his concubine, Xu Guohua, also known as Hongbao (20 years old, native of Huai'an), had been missing for eight days, and her whereabouts were unknown. He requested an investigation. Officer Zhuang Zanxi dispatched detective Zhang Shouzhen to investigate and reported to Du Shiyan, the judicial section chief of the precinct. After 24 hours of investigation, it was learned that the so-called missing young woman was instigated by her younger brother-in-law, Chen Tianqing, to be murdered by fellow villagers Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang, who then moved her body and buried it in a mud pond on the bank of the Fan Huang Du Creek. The body was exhumed yesterday noon, and Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang were arrested (pictured). However, the principal offender, Chen Tianqing, and another accomplice, Hou Meiling, are still at large. Chen Tianjun, the husband of the deceased, was originally a lieutenant officer in the Nanjing Adjustment Warehouse of the Quartermaster General Headquarters. Last year,

he was laid off.

He then brought his beloved concubine, Ms. Xu, to Shanghai and lived in the shack at No. 24, Lane 1166, Changning Road, with his younger brother, Chen Tianqing. Subsequently, three fellow villagers who had followed Chen for many years, Zhou Qinghua, Zhang Yongtang, and Hou Meiling (all soldiers from the Adjustment Warehouse), were also laid off and came to Shanghai. Before long, Chen ran into difficulties with his finances because he had little savings, so he recently colluded with Zhou and Hou to steal a suitcase from somewhere nearby. Afterward, his younger brother learned about it and believed that his elder brother was going down the wrong path. He believed that the biggest reason his elder brother was not engaging in honest work was

infatuation with Ms. Xu. Therefore, he did not care about breaking the law and conceived the idea of killing Ms. Xu. On the 25th of last month, taking the opportunity of Chen's trip to Beijing, he summoned Zhou, Zhang, and Hou to discuss the matter. The three of them were also deeply afraid that the theft would be exposed, so they agreed to his request and agreed to take action on the evening of the following day. When the time came, Chen and others knocked on the door, first on the pretext of asking for a cigarette. After entering the house, they used the prepared hemp rope to forcibly strangle Ms. Xu to death. Afterward, Zhou and Hou carried the body to the bank of the Fan Huang Creek and buried it in the pre-dug mud pond, covering it with thick soil,

Intending to eliminate traces. Seeing his beloved concubine, he inquired everywhere, but there was no news. His younger brother claimed that Ms. Xu was probably on the run. Chen was half-believing, so he rushed to his concubine's home in Zhenjiang on the 30th to inquire, but the result was nothing. He returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month, at which point his younger brother had also disappeared. So he went to inquire at Zhou Qinghua and Zhang Yongtang's place. Zhou was also afraid of the case being exposed and had left home. When Chen arrived unexpectedly, Zhou's wife's attitude was abnormal for a while. Zhang smiled and said, "The matter is over, so there is no need to pursue it." Chen asked if she was dead, and Zhang remained silent. At this point, Chen became more suspicious, so he reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station on the 2nd. Zhang and Zhou's wife were detained for interrogation, but they

Refused to tell the truth.

So, he reported to Du Shiyan, the judicial section chief of the precinct. Immediately, people were dispatched to wait at the nearby train stations. Sure enough, Zhou Qinghua was arrested at the Zhenru train station that night. He immediately confessed and confessed to the whole story. The body was exhumed at noon yesterday. In addition to strictly arresting the fleeing criminals, the entire case will be transferred to the headquarters for questioning.

### I am Negotiating Extradition of Xu Jizhuang through Diplomatic Channels

Zheng Zhong Exonerates Feng Zhongda in Shanghai

Zheng Zhong, the former head of the investigation office dispatched by the Garrison Headquarters to Hong Kong to arrest Xu Jizhuang, along with Feng Zhongda, head of the social affairs section, and Zhao Guanglu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Zheng, our side is negotiating with the Hong Kong side through diplomatic channels for extradition. This procedure should be completed within a month, and the suspect Xu should be escorted to Shanghai at that time.

### "Pan American" - A Small Gift, a Deep Sentiment: Two Lemons to Console the Mayor

The Shanghai branch manager of Pan American Airlines, Wei, sent two large lemons brought from California to the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to comfort Mayor Wu.

### New Asia Hotel Submits to Social Bureau Seeking Protection for New Staff

The New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road was recently leased by the U.S. Army Advisory Group as officers' quarters. A large number of waiters and laborers were recruited and employed, and they began working on January 16. Unexpectedly, former employees who had already been dismissed with compensation by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) rose up in opposition, demanding that the personnel management office of the U.S. military officers' quarters dismiss 41 of the newly recruited employees and replace them with the old UNRRA staff, leading to a dispute. The new employees argued that UNRRA and the U.S. Army Advisory Group were not part of the same system, and that the old UNRRA staff had already been dismissed with compensation. They questioned how such an unreasonable demand could be made again, causing them to suffer the hardship of unemployment once more. Therefore, in addition to submitting a request to the Social Bureau for legal protection, they also appointed representatives to seek assistance from all sectors of society.

### Sugar Merchant to be Summoned for Questioning in Military Aircraft Cash Transport Case

[Our Newspaper] Sheng Fanchu, a candy merchant in this city, became acquainted with Li Zhaoxin, the squadron leader of the Second Brigade of the Air Force Supply Command. Taking advantage of Li's military aircraft flight from Shanghai to Guangdong, he entrusted Li to transport 199 million yuan in cash to Guangzhou to purchase goods and return to Shanghai. The matter was discovered by the Air Force authorities, who transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the prosecutor opened a court session for interrogation, but only the defendant Sheng Fanchu appeared in court. After a brief interrogation, the prosecutor ordered him to post bail and rescheduled the hearing.

### Spring Festival Troop慰勞: Agreed-Upon Measures

The various sectors of the city launched a Spring Festival troop慰勞 effort. At 3:00 PM yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at 580 Aitang Road, where the following resolutions were made:

### Counterfeit Western Drug Manufacturing Operation Cracked; Five Criminals Arrested, Mastermind in Hankou

[Our Newspaper] In late last month, Dong Yixiang, a member of the Lujiazui Branch Bureau, and officer Zhao Hengqing received a tip-off that the Hua Fu Western Medicine Store on the second floor of 115 Hankou Road was specializing in selling counterfeit drugs. Director Dong led his subordinates Zhang Han, Weng Hongxun, Feng Bojun, and Liu Xianglin to the address, seizing counterfeit drugs such as 北地那爾, 新斯梯波, 消除龍, 阿四匹靈, and 加當, arresting Jin Hesheng, 20 years old, from Shaoxing, the younger brother of the store owner, and two employees, Wang Xinwu. After questioning, they went to their home (No. 10, Gonglefang, Shangwen Road, Nanshi), and found 56 bottles of counterfeit 双桃奎寗, as well as 22 copper plates, over a thousand empty boxes, and a large quantity of counterfeit drug raw materials. They were all brought to the bureau. According to Jin Hesheng, the counterfeit drugs they sold were mainly sold in Taiwan, Jinan, and northern Jiangsu. They then went to the Central Grand Theater on Beihai Road to arrest Shi Zixiu, 21 years old, from Chongming. According to Shi, the counterfeit quinine was handmade. They first purchased white blanks, then added a sugar coating and mixed them to make the drug. The printed materials were ordered from Jin Heng and Weng Jingwen. Later, they continued to arrest the aforementioned two at 162 Yunnan Road and seized several dozen counterfeit 凡拉蒙丸. According to Weng, the counterfeit drugs they sold were purchased from Su Yuan, Xu Haicai. He also revealed that the machine for manufacturing 阿四匹靈 was hidden at No. 21, Dongle Lane, Xituqing Road, North Sichuan Road. The original officers seized a machine, as well as counterfeit instructions and beakers and other equipment. It is said that the mastermind, Ma Qishan, is currently in Hankou selling goods, and the branch bureau is continuing to pursue him.

### Enthusiastic Donations to "Air Book Fair"; Board Chairman Du of This Newspaper Donates 100 Million to Aid Education

Mr. Du Yuesheng, the chairman of this newspaper, in response to the educational aid movement and to rescue young people who have dropped out of school, generously donated 100 million yuan to the "Reader Education Aid Fund," setting the highest record for donations to the "Reader Education Aid Fund" in this session. While receiving this donation, the colleagues of this newspaper would like to express our deepest gratitude on behalf of all impoverished students in the city. We also hope that business tycoons in Shanghai will follow suit and enthusiastically contribute, so that the educational aid movement can achieve a complete success.

After the Huaming Tobacco Company joined the "Air Book Fair" at the Cultural Radio Station to appeal for donations to the "Reader Education Aid Fund," the results were remarkable. Yesterday, a total of 18 donation notification slips were received, and special messengers will collect the donations from door to door today. This newspaper also thanks the enthusiastic public for their support of the "Educational Aid Movement" and will publish donation reports in the social services column.

[Our Newspaper] The Central Broadcasting Orchestra, led by Director Wu Daoyi of the Central Broadcasting Administration, consisting of over 40 people, arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening at the invitation of Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council. They will soon be hosted by the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee to perform on a large scale at the Jincheng Grand Theater Cultural Hall.

### Judge Accused of Perverting the Law; Plaintiff Appears in Court to State Reasons

[Our Newspaper] Lawyer Cheng Mengming, previously sued for the return of arrears after the "postage price increase," but was rejected by Judge Ling Yuanging of the Civil Court of the District Court. Cheng complained that the judgment did not mention a word about the second supplementary pleading, and the reasons for the rejection were not sufficient. Therefore, he accused Ling of "perverting the law" in the Criminal Court of the District Court. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Cao Zuwei opened a court session for questioning. Because it was a review of the self-litigation investigation court, Judge Cao prohibited onlookers based on Article 318 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The defendant, Judge Ling Yuanging, did not appear. The plaintiff, Cheng Mengming, was summoned to court for questioning. According to sources after the session, Judge Cao first hoped that the situation in the case would not be excessively expanded. He then asked the plaintiff how he could prove that the defendant "perverted the law." Cheng claimed that the later supplementary pleading explained that an order cannot change the law, and that the proposal passed by the State Council was only a legal principle, not a law. However, Judge Ling's judgment did not mention a word about the pleading. If he had not seen the pleading at all, there would have been negligence in administration. If he had seen the pleading but deliberately did not adopt it, then he should be held responsible for "perverting the law" under the Criminal Law. One of the two must be true. After the questioning, Cheng was dismissed, and Ling Yuanging was scheduled to be questioned at a later date.

### Mobilizing 20 Billion in Funds for Winter Relief Facilities in Three Months; Accommodating and Providing Work Relief for 3,000 Refugees Each; 14 Soup Kitchens Can Save 30,000 People

[Our Newspaper] At a time when the end of the year is approaching and social order is fluctuating, all parties are expressing great concern about the situation of winter relief work. Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically released a summary of the facilities of the Winter Relief Committee in the past three months as follows:

The current relief funds mobilized are only 20 billion, including the construction projects of 16 cold shelters, refugees' clothing, food rations, medical care, dredging equipment, and soup kitchen equipment. Relief facilities are divided into:
  Accommodation and Support: Three cold shelters have been established. As of last month, the three shelters accommodated a total of 3,000 refugees. The refugees are given rice rations according to government regulations, with each person receiving two dou of rice per month, and a food allowance of 50,000 yuan per month. After entering the shelter, each refugee is given two sets of underwear, a cotton-padded jacket and pants, a cotton quilt, and a pair each of cloth socks and cloth shoes, as well as hygiene supplies such as towels and toothbrushes. The Third Cold Shelter, in particular, was established the latest, and its management lacked experience, resulting in poor performance. Four administrators from the Children's Education Center have been dispatched to assist. Whenever visitors arrive at the cold shelters, the refugees surround them or kneel down to beg, which has been happening in previous years. This is because most of these people are beggars, who can earn tens of thousands of yuan a day on weekdays and are not accustomed to a disciplined life.

  Work Relief: Currently, dredging work has begun, including dredging the Jiangwan Shajing Port, Caohejing Puhuitang, Dachang Zoumatang, Pudong Dutai Pu Majiabang, and other places. In addition, several ditches are being dredged in western Shanghai. To facilitate construction and provide food and accommodation for work relief refugees, the Public Works Bureau has designed and built 13 work relief cold shelters at various construction sites, and all have been started. As of now, 3,000 refugees have participated in work relief, and more can be added successively.

  Soup and Clothing Distribution: Eight soup kitchens are run by the committee, and six are jointly run with local communities, totaling 14 soup kitchens. The distribution locations of the soup kitchens include five in Zhabei District, one in North Station District, one in Nanshi, two in western Shanghai, two in Pudong, one in Jiangwan, one in Wusong, and one in Hongkou. The equipment and personnel management of those jointly run with local communities are the responsibility of the local communities, while the Winter Relief Committee is responsible for firewood and rice. The soup kitchens started distributing soup one after another from the first day of the new year, and can save more than 30,000 people. In addition, there is a mobile soup truck that can save 2,000 people each time it goes out. As for clothing distribution, it is currently limited to the old clothes donated by various sectors, and distribution also started from the first day of the new year. As of now, distribution has been carried out in Zhabei, North Station, Penglai, Changning, Jing'an Temple, Sichuan Road, Jiangwan, and other districts, and a total of 41,600 pieces have been distributed. As for the 5,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes recently delivered by the Women's Volunteer Corps for Cold Clothing Donation, the distribution method will be determined after Huang Yanfang provides her opinion.

  Relief for Hidden Poverty: 200 million yuan has been allocated from the relief funds for relief for hidden poverty. Due to limited funds, the scope has had to be reduced. To date, the list of more than 60 approved households has been approved, and cash or food rice has been distributed.

### Local Briefs from This City

The Junpu Donation collected by the Jianghai Customs will be levied at a new rate from February 1, with taxable import goods changed to 6% of the standard tax, and tax-free import goods changed to 3 per thousand of the cargo value.

The officers and soldiers of the Second Brigade, Directly Subordinate Units, Sixth Regiment, and Fourth Regiment of the Youth Army 202nd Division stationed in Shanghai saved 3,688 catties of rice from their meals, which was transferred by the Quartermaster Office to the Winter Relief Committee to provide relief to refugees. The painter Wang Chongnian will hold a preliminary introduction exhibition of his few old oil paintings at the Sino-British Cultural Association in the HSBC Building from tomorrow to the 6th. The Gospel Radio Station has been approved to move back to 760 frequencies, and the evening program will be postponed by one hour.

A Central News Agency jeep, military number 18773, was parked on Yuanmingyuan Road on the 1st afternoon and was suddenly reported stolen. The police station was notified to arrest the thief, but there was still no trace.

A female corpse was found in room 229 of the Natural Hotel at 66 Zhifu Road at around 1:30 PM yesterday. It is reported that the deceased was Zhang Wu, 30 years old, from Songjiang. Her husband's name is Zhang Xinyu.

### The Leading City of Eastern Jiangxi: Shangrao

[Special Dispatch from Shangrao, Our Newspaper, 1st] A few days before the Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was connected, I visited Shangrao with a joyful mood. After eleven and a half hours of being confined in a dilapidated railway carriage, the violent jolting was unimaginable to every passenger, and I was no exception. Fortunately, there was a talkative conductor on the train who chatted about everything from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and also about the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which would soon be fully operational, reducing much of the endless loneliness. With great difficulty, I endured this not-so-short period of vexation and arrived at this leading city of Eastern Jiangxi at around midnight. In order to sleep more soundly, braving the cold wind, I went into the city to find a cleaner place to rest and shake off the fatigue of a day's journey.

Having revisited Shangrao for the fourth time, I felt that everything had changed. The clean and bustling urban prototype of the past has disappeared without a trace, and now it leaves me with an impression of disorder, filth, and decline. Shangrao was formerly the seat of Guangxin Prefecture. The city is located on the upper reaches of the Xin River and is the gateway from Jiangxi Province to Fujian and Zhejiang. The water and land transportation here are very convenient. Upstream along the Xin River, you can reach Yushan. Downstream, passing through Guixi and Yujiang, you enter Poyang Lake, which can connect the two major rivers, the Yangtze and the Gan. The highway also follows this route to become the center of eastern Jiangxi. Through Yushan, you can enter Zhejiang. There are two branches to Fujian Province, one entering Fujian via Guangfeng, and the other entering Fujian via Qianshan. There is also a trunk line extending through Linchuan and Ji'an to enter Hunan, and another branch directly reaches Nanchang. In addition, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs through the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan. Therefore, due to its strategic location, it has become an important town in eastern Jiangxi.

This county town, with a population of 480,000, is not only conveniently located for transportation, but also has abundant products. The local pears and summer cloth are quite famous. Other products include Guangfeng's tobacco leaves, Yushan's vermicelli and dried bamboo shoots, Qianshan's handmade paper, Hengfeng and Yiyang's chicken, duck, and pork, and Nanfeng's oranges... All the local products of eastern Jiangxi are gathered and transshipped here. Originally, before the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Qianshan's Hekou Town was the distribution market for local products in eastern Jiangxi. Since the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Shangrao has replaced half of Hekou Town's commerce and has become a commercial city in eastern Jiangxi.

Shangrao's commercial district is located on West Street outside the West Gate, extending west to the vicinity of the railway station. The long street is extremely dirty and full of stench. The road surface is paved with flagstones, low in the middle and high on the sides, with many traces of cart wheels forming tracks. Therefore, it is always damp and never dry. On both sides of the street, there are many two-story buildings, which are built very simply, vulgar, and the arcades on the sidewalks are scattered and extremely uneven. From the perspective of urban appearance, it is extremely unsightly. In addition to West Street, other relatively lively streets such as Shengli Road, Tianjing Street, and Kangjian Road are also outside the city. There are no lively streets inside the city. Although Shangrao was the seat of the former Qing Prefecture, the city circle is not large. The Zhongshan Park in the northeast of the city almost occupies a quarter of the area of the entire city. Zhongshan Park is the quietest and cleanest area in the city. There is a large sports field in the park, a provincial medical vocational school, two elementary schools, a fairly grand Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, and the Eastern Jiangxi Library. These buildings are said to have been built when the headquarters of the Third War Area Command was located here. Although the scenery remains the same today, the personnel are no longer the same. For example, the Eastern Jiangxi Library exists in name only. The tables and chairs in the room are all covered in dust, and there is no need to mention the library equipment. Many honorary soldiers are also stationed in the Kangjian Memorial Hall, making those who revisit it sigh at the changes between the past and the present.

After living in Shangrao for a few days, I felt that Shangrao's cultural undertakings were still up to standard. There is a Minfeng Daily here, which is sponsored by the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Jiangxi Province. The newspaper is published daily in a broadsheet format. Unfortunately, the layout is not very attractive, and the supplement is also not up to standard. The circulation is limited to the counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth District of Jiangxi Province. However, it is the only broadsheet newspaper on the Hangzhou-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, except for Hangzhou and Nanchang.

The educational undertakings here are also considered to be developed, with six or seven middle schools such as Zhu Tong, Provincial Shangzhong, Provincial Medical Vocational School, County Middle School, and County Teachers' School. Before the victory, the private Chengming College of Shanghai also moved here for a period of time. When the victory was won, it moved back to Shanghai. Immediately afterwards, the Eastern Jiangxi Joint Xinjiang Agricultural College was founded, adding a gem to this mountain city. A year ago, it moved to Ehulu in Qianshan. Recently, the students of the school are launching a

movement to return to Rao. When I arrived in Shangrao, the Agricultural College was brewing a student strike. The student union and the alumni association sent representatives to Shangrao to appeal to all sectors of society, hoping that people from all walks of life would support their "Return to Rao Movement." From an objective point of view, it is necessary for the Xinjiang Agricultural College to move back to Shangrao, the political, economic, and cultural center of Eastern Jiangxi, because a specialized school is confined in the mountains and valleys, suffering from the strangulation of material conditions, which causes problems with school equipment, faculty recruitment, book and newspaper supply, etc. In order to solve these difficulties and improve the school, I also strongly agree with the students' request to move the school.

On the eve of leaving Shangrao, I talked with some local people in Shangrao about the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway being connected, and what is placed before everyone

There are two problems: security and epidemic prevention.

In today's world where bandits are everywhere, Guangchang, the old nest of bandits, is only fifty li away from Shangrao, so whether Guangchang will become a bandit's nest again is inseparable from the security of eastern Jiangxi. According to local people, the current security problem in eastern Jiangxi has not yet reached a serious stage. It seems to be much better than in the neighboring northern Fujian, eastern Zhejiang, and southern Anhui. As long as the grassroots political organizations do not arouse popular resentment, eastern Jiangxi can be quite stable.

Epidemic prevention is an urgent issue in Shangrao at the moment. Not long ago, the Shangrao station and Shahan Town were both plagued by the spread of the plague, and it had a prairie fire trend. Fortunately, the weather was cold and the epidemic was slightly suppressed, but it is possible to recur in the spring. This black threat makes people shudder, but the government and the people are equally short-sighted. If no patients are seen, the epidemic prevention work will stop.

On the way home, I also wish the people of this mountain city to be able to revive in peace, no longer suffer from the threat of the plague, and restore prosperity to the mountain city as soon as possible. (Reporter Jiang Feng from This Newspaper)

### Bank Loans of 3.6 Billion to Relieve Wuhu Power Plant's Coal Shortage

[Special Dispatch from Wuhu, Our Newspaper, 1st] The amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee to the Mingyuan Power Plant in this city each month is far from meeting the actual needs. The plant has been requesting to borrow coal from the next month's allocation on a monthly basis to maintain operations. At the same time, the plant implements zonal power outages at night to save coal. Local people are deeply worried that once the light is lost at a time when the Lunar New Year is approaching and winter defense is tight. The power plant authorities are also trying to find ways to secure a source of coal. Regarding the 1,450 tons of coal stored in Wuhu on the Pinghan Railway, they have repeatedly negotiated with the Purchasing Department of the Railway Bureau and the Fuel Management Committee, and fortunately they have been approved. However, this coal must be deducted from the allocation for January and February, and transportation costs, unloading fees, interest, and storage fees must be paid. The allocation price of this coal is originally higher than that of the Huainan coal, so the total cost of this batch of coal reached 6 billion yuan, which must be paid off before the delivery order can be issued. Because the amount was too large, the power plant, despite its best efforts, only managed to raise one-third, leaving a shortfall of more than 3 billion. If it cannot be paid off as scheduled, the Pinghan Railway Bureau and the Fuel Management Committee may take the opportunity to change their minds, which is extremely worrying. The other day, the military and political leaders and local elders of Wuhu City invited the managers of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries to discuss solutions. Finally, all the banks, bureaus, and treasuries decided to jointly grant an emergency loan of 3.6 billion yuan to the Mingyuan Power Plant, with a time limit of 40 days. The Bank of China was designated as the representative bank to be responsible for handling all loan procedures. The coal shortage of the Wuhu Power Plant can be temporarily resolved, allowing the city to get through the Lunar New Year.

### Statistics on Overseas Remittances from Singapore

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, Our Newspaper, 31st] According to official statistics from Singapore, it was announced that the amount of household remittances sent by local overseas Chinese to China in December of last year reached 1.60081 million yuan (Singapore dollars), of which 1.243108 million yuan was remitted from Singapore and 3605973 yuan was remitted from Malaya.

### Taipei Police Authorities Release Statistics on Smuggling Cases Last Year

[Special Dispatch from Taipei, Our Newspaper, 31st] The provincial police authorities released statistics on a total of 331 smuggling cases cracked last year, including 194 inbound cases and 137 outbound cases. Keelung Port had the most cases, mostly public monopoly products such as tobacco, alcohol, and industrial and mining equipment. The confiscated goods included 7,280 packs of cigarettes, 23,273 catties of tobacco leaves, 7,372 catties of alcohol, 42,385 alcohol bottles, 3,586 catties of camphor, 79,610 catties of coal, 154,370 catties of charcoal, 43,392 catties of rice, 53,069 catties of copper, 288 catties of tin, 9,320 catties of aluminum, 885 gallons of gasoline, 4,472 catties of seafood, 11 trucks, and 11 motorboats.

### Repeated Store Closures in Wujin: Bao Da Xiang Store Under Liquidation

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Wujin, 2nd] As the end of the year approaches, the business community in this county faces tight cash flow, leading to successive closures. Following the closure of the Lao Bao Hua Silver Shop, the Bao Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Store on South Street also announced liquidation starting on the 26th. After a meeting of creditors on the 27th for settlement, the total deficit was only 1.1 billion yuan. The remaining inventory and assets could cover the difference, so the issue wasn't overly significant, only that operating capital could not be secured and disagreements among shareholders made it impossible to continue, leading to the shutdown.

### Wujin Hospital: White-Clad Angels' Work Slowdown

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Wujin, 1st] Wujin Hospital, a leading local hospital run by the American Mission, is known for its well-equipped facilities. Recently, due to the interruption of supplies from the United States, the hospital's income has not been able to cover its expenses, leading to financial difficulties. The staff's salaries are meager, initially paid according to central government employee standards. This has recently been changed to calculation based on the cost-of-living index. The hospital still paid the January salaries according to the index from December of the previous year. The hardworking nurses felt this was unfair and repeatedly requested improvements without success. They began a work slowdown starting on the afternoon of the 27th, causing considerable anxiety among patients. The hospital has now agreed to temporarily suspend deductions for meals.

### Major and Minor Fires in Lanzhou: Eight Occurrences in Half a Month

[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Lanzhou, 1st] The Fire God has frequently visited Lanzhou. In less than half a month, there have been eight fires of varying sizes. On January 15th, the Lanzhou office of the Gansu-Qinghai Branch of the China Petroleum Corporation had a small incident at 10 PM. A fireplace caught fire, igniting the ceiling. The flames blazed intensely, but quick action prevented a major disaster. On January 20th at noon, the new building of the Northwest Salt Administration caught fire. Because the walls were not plastered, 36 rooms burned down, with losses exceeding 800 million yuan, likely caused by carelessness with heating. On the same day, around 3 AM, General Zhang Zhizhong's private residence, Xinghua Village, on Zuogong West Road, also caught fire due to a faulty fireplace, destroying eight rooms and causing losses of about 200 million yuan. On January 24th, at No. 178 Linsen Road, a cotton fluffer's shop knocked over an oil lamp, burning a corner of a quilt. Fortunately, it was discovered early and extinguished. On the night of January 25th, at the home of Liu Zichang, a staff officer at the Fourth Division, Zhangjiazhuang, a stovepipe malfunction ignited a roof beam, but it was quickly extinguished. At 6 AM on the morning of January 26th, Commander Ma Xiwu's residence on the former East Road also suffered a fire caused by the same reason, destroying three rooms. On the night of January 28th, a fire also broke out at the Guanzhou Power Plant, but effective firefighting kept the damage limited. This morning, the Liangbei Wool Textile Factory also reported an accident. The intensity of the fire and the extent of the damage broke decades of records. The city's firefighting equipment has never attracted much attention, and its development is severely limited by funding. The Gansu Provincial Police Department has only about 20 firefighters and four manual water pumps. The department has decided to expand its firefighting equipment as a preventive measure and promote fire prevention awareness to the public. In addition to purchasing two gasoline-powered pumps, they will use police sirens every night to warn citizens about fire hazards.

### Newly Found Gold Performed in Tianjin

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Tianjin, January 31st] Li Bangzi, a thirteen-year-old from No. 77 Xuhujuan outside the South Gate of this city, makes a living by collecting scraps. On the afternoon of the 24th, he went out to collect scraps again and found a gold bar in a pile of garbage on Xinxing Road in Nankai. Wang Zhongyao, another scrap collector, saw it and demanded the gold from Li. They agreed to saw the gold bar in half and divide it equally. This was rumored among several scrap collectors, and later reached the 15th Precinct of the Police Department. When Constable Zhi Changhai heard about it, he went to Li's house with several scrap collectors that evening, threatening a lawsuit in an attempt to get a share. After negotiations, they sold half the gold bar for 21 million yuan. Li received 9 million yuan, Zhi Changhai received 2.5 million yuan, the scrap collectors received a total of 5 million yuan, and the rest was distributed to other police officers. Unexpectedly, Zhi Changhai went to Wang Zhongyao to demand a share of his gold, resulting in Wang Zhongyao losing 4 million yuan. Zhang Guoxing participated in the gold distribution. Zhang felt that Li received too little and that someone was damaging Zhang's reputation, so he reported it to the police on the 28th, leading to the disclosure of the gold discovery. The police department immediately summoned and interrogated the suspects.

### A Sea of Fire in the Yellow River's Ice Flow: A Record of the Burning of the Northwest Wool Textile Factory in Lanzhou

[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Lanzhou, 1st] At 2:25 AM on the morning of the 29th of last month, under a waning moon and scattered cold stars, the Northwest Wool Textile Factory in Hebei suddenly caught fire. Tongues of smoke and flames shot into the sky. At the height of the fire, the flames reached six or seven feet high. Due to the northerly wind, the wool in the combing section had already been mixed with oil and processed on the machines, causing the fire to spread rapidly. The entire machine room, spinning machines, and weaving machines were completely engulfed in flames. The crackling explosions, combined with the shouts of firefighters and the terrified screams of nearby residents, made a scene. Sparks rose continuously with the smoke column, turning half the sky red, reflected in the icy flow of the Yellow River, creating a tragic and horrifying scene!

Thick Smoke from the Combing Department

When the fire first started, a guard at the factory noticed thick smoke coming from the combing department of the factory building and immediately shouted for help. Factory workers woke up from their sleep and gathered at the site of the fire. Because the factory building was large and there were no firefighting tools, they could do nothing but run around and inform others. Hearing the shouts, the Jingyuan Road Police Station of the Sixth Precinct determined that the Northwest Wool Textile Factory was on fire and immediately reported it by telephone to the Sixth Precinct, the Fire Brigade Headquarters, and the Third and Fifth Precincts, requesting assistance. Nearby military police units, the Lanzhou Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Command, the Second Battalion of the Garrison Regiment, and local agencies and Baojia personnel all came to help fight the fire. Some firefighters bravely climbed onto the roof, using saws, axes, and fire hooks to demolish the steaming and dyeing machine room adjacent to the fire site to isolate the fire. Four water hoses simultaneously sprayed the center of the fire. Some police officers bravely rushed into the fire and dragged out semi-finished products and raw fabric from the machines and stored in the room. After three hours of effort, the fire was mostly extinguished by 6:30 AM. Roughly estimated, 67 factory rooms were reduced to ashes, and most of the combing, spinning, and weaving machines were destroyed, with losses often exceeding 200 billion yuan.

Delayed Discovery Leads to Major Disaster

The cause of the fire is speculated to be a burst underground flue, with sparks escaping and igniting the accumulated wool. Because electricity was cut off at night and work was suspended, all factory doors were locked from the outside. No one discovered the fire when it first started. By the time it was discovered, flames were already shooting out of the windows with thick smoke, making it impossible to control, thus leading to the major disaster.

After hearing the news this morning, Governor Guo of Gansu Province immediately inquired about the incident by telephone and expressed his condolences. Mayor Sun Runan and Police Chief Li Ruwei both personally went to the fire site to inspect and offer condolences. Leaders of other agencies and organizations all expressed regret over the unprecedented loss suffered by this largest-scale civilian industry in the Northwest and went to express their condolences. This reporter accompanied Mayor Sun on a tour of the disaster area this morning, guided by Qi Henian, the acting factory director's secretary. Debris was scattered everywhere, and remnants of machines were scattered throughout the courtyard. Yarn spools and raw fabric were visible everywhere, and smoke still lingered in the factory buildings. The steaming, dyeing, and washing areas to the east were fortunately unaffected.

Work Can Resume in Two Months

Regarding the fire, the factory has taken recorded photos and is preparing to send them to the Shanghai Relief Association. Around 3 PM this afternoon, Acting Factory Director Qi contacted Chairman Liu Hongsheng of Shanghai by telephone to report the fire, but the transmission was unclear, and there was no result. That night, he rushed to Shanghai to provide a detailed account of the losses and the recovery plan. At 8 PM, Qi hosted reporters at his private residence, reporting the "speculated" cause of the fire and the course of the fire. He also downplayed the losses, saying they were not as high as the rumored 200 billion yuan. Qi repeatedly stated that if the China Textile Corporation in Shanghai could allocate some machinery, he believed that work could resume in two months. Currently, they will maintain the livelihoods of the existing employees by undertaking wool washing and accepting custom dyeing orders, and they will not lay off or reduce wages under any possible circumstances. All employees of the factory are determined to grit their teeth and slowly restore the former glory!

Qi met with Governor Guo this afternoon to personally report the incident. According to reports, Governor Guo stated that the Northwest Wool Textile Factory is the only industrial enterprise of some scale in the Northwest, and the provincial government will provide strong support under any unfavorable circumstances to ensure that it does not collapse. Governor Guo hopes that the factory will contact the directors in Beijing and other places to determine the assistance measures. The factory was founded in 1945 with investments from Shanghai industrial and commercial magnates Luo Qingshu and Liu Hongsheng, using the financial resources of the East to aid the Northwest. Liu serves as Chairman and General Manager, and Ping Bolu serves as Associate Manager and Factory Director. Currently, both the General Manager and Deputy General Manager are not in Lanzhou, and Secretary Qi Henian is acting on their behalf. Unfortunately, this major disaster has occurred, unprecedented in Lanzhou in decades. (Reporter Song Lin)

### Yuan Changya: Controlled by Fate

He entered Japanese nationality at the age of five and has now returned to the embrace of his motherland. In his thirty-three years of life, he has experienced suffering that no one else in the world has ever encountered!

[Airmail Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changsha, 1st] This is a modern tragedy, a real-life story that even writers struggle to depict. The protagonist of this story is named Hirai Eizaburo, but he is a Chinese man of pure Chinese descent. Although he was a Japanese for more than twenty years, he has now returned to his motherland and is once again a citizen of the Republic of China.

A Farmer's Son

Hirai Eizaburo's family home is in a village in Linxiang County, Hunan. His father was an honest farmer named Yuan. Unfortunately, he died of illness before the age of thirty. His young mother, now a young widow, had no inheritance left by her husband to support her and her son. She had no choice but to take her beloved son to Hankou to make a living. At that time, Hirai Eizaburo was only five years old.

In Hankou, his mother was lucky enough to find work as a nanny in a Japanese-owned foreign firm. The manager of this firm, Hirai, fell in love with the young widow, and the widow then married this foreigner. From then on, both mother and son became Japanese citizens.

Foreign Adoptive Father

Under the care of his foreign adoptive father, Hirai Eizaburo went from elementary school to middle school to university. Because he was very intelligent, he graduated from the Department of Political Economy at Tokyo Imperial University. His habits, of course, became thoroughly Japanese. He did not even know that he was Chinese. It wasn't until he was twenty-six years old, when his mother was critically ill, that she told him his true family name and urged him to return to his motherland if he ever had the chance. Only then did he learn of his pitiful origins. From that time on, he began to think about returning to his roots and resolved to find an opportunity to return to his motherland.

Called to the Front Lines

When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Japan had a conscription system. Whether students or professors, everyone had to enlist and go to the front lines. Non-military students were given medical training and served with the army after graduation. Hirai Eizaburo became a member of a medical team and stepped onto the soil of his motherland with the troops, returning to the embrace of his motherland.

Even though his motherland was in ruins at that time and his compatriots were so disappointing, he still loved it because he was Chinese.

He arrived in Hankou, and due to work opportunities, he met Miss Liu, a nurse at the Si Ren Hospital in Hankou. Miss Liu was from Changsha. She told him which direction Linxiang was in, where his ancestors' graves were, and where his deceased mother longed for day and night. He was extremely excited. One night, he deserted from the army and fled to the French Concession. Unfortunately, he was captured by the Japanese military police. He could not freely return to his motherland and became a prisoner.

War-Torn Lovers

The Japanese military police severely tortured him, breaking his bones and tearing his flesh. After three months, he was transferred to the Japanese military court in Nanjing and sentenced to seven years in prison. After being imprisoned for several months, he was reassigned to the military. This time he was lucky enough to be with Miss Liu again, and they served in the same unit. Working together, their friendship gradually developed into a romantic relationship, and they eventually announced their marriage in Hankou, becoming a couple who shared adversity in the war.

Surrender in Linxiang

In 1943, the Japanese army attempted to open up land transportation routes and launched the Xianggui Campaign. His unit marched to Linhu. This was his hometown, and he could no longer bear to leave it. So, he and Miss Liu managed to flee to the mountains of Linxiang and surrender to Commissioner Wang Jianbo's office. Commissioner Wang confirmed his family name and that everything matched. He learned that he had no relatives left at home, only a few old houses. He also only knew that his surname was Yuan and did not have a Chinese name. Commissioner Wang then named him "Changya." From then on, he was no longer Hirai Eizaburo of Japanese nationality, but Yuan Changya, a citizen of his motherland.

Although Yuan Changya had returned to the embrace of his motherland and was now a Chinese citizen, according to wartime law, those who surrendered could not simply be let off and had to undergo legal procedures. Commissioner Wang had no choice but to transfer him to Commander Wang's headquarters, who then transferred him to the Hunan High Court. The court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison for treason. He had just escaped from the shackles of a foreign country and returned to the embrace of his motherland, but unexpectedly, his motherland not only did not give him any warmth but gave him this cursed gift. In prison, he thought of his wife left in Linxiang, who had given birth to a child and had no savings, relying entirely on her two hands to farm and gather firewood in the countryside to make a living. He also thought of his mother buried in a foreign land and his half-sister... and he thought of his own tragic fate. He became pessimistic and almost mustered the courage of a Japanese to commit suicide in prison and end this suffering life. Fortunately, he was dissuaded by fellow inmates. He was also highly educated and had gone through a difficult struggle. His motherland needed his talent. After accepting the advice of others, he began to pursue a new path.

Prison Life

After the High Court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison, someone in prison helped him file an appeal because he had become a Japanese citizen at the age of five with his mother, and he did not know that he was Chinese. Later, when he found out, he still did not even have a Chinese name. His arrival in his motherland with the army was precisely his attempt to seize the opportunity to return to his motherland. How could he willingly accept the punishment of being labeled a traitor by the court? After a retrial by the Supreme Court, his sentence was reduced by half. Although he was still unwilling, what could he do? He had no choice but to abide by the law in prison. In prison, his behavior reflected his education and upbringing. He worked hard to study Chinese and prepared to dedicate himself to his motherland after his release. Earlier this month, his sentence was completed. He walked out of the prison gates. This was the first time he truly breathed the free air of his motherland. However, he was alone and penniless in Changsha. Where could he turn to in this unfamiliar place? Fortunately, Fang Beidu, a nurse at the Catholic Hospital, had once been a fellow inmate with him in prison and knew of this pitiful person's plight. He specially took him to his home and had him stay there. The colleagues at the Catholic Hospital pooled together more than 3 million yuan to enable him to return to Linxiang to meet his long-separated and suffering wife.

New Opportunities

After Yuan Changya was released from prison, he stayed in Changsha for a few days and then returned to Linxiang. He had exchanged letters with his family in Japan while in prison and learned that his adoptive father had been killed in a bombing raid, his elder brother had died in military service, and his second brother was the manager of a company. His half-sister had graduated from medical school and married an engineer. He still had an inheritance in Japan, and he planned to return to Japan to settle matters and resolve his current financial difficulties. He is thirty-three years old this year, in the prime of his life. He is knowledgeable, ambitious, has good habits, and is physically strong. Introduced by a friend, the reporter met him on the day of his departure from Changsha. His Chinese is still not very fluent. After pouring out his past, he firmly stated that he was not disappointed in his motherland at all. On the contrary, he wanted to dedicate himself to his motherland, as long as his motherland did not abandon him.

Early one morning in late January, he lonely boarded the Changwu Express train back to Linxiang. As the figure of Yuan disappeared into the horizon, the reporter gazed into the distance, silently blessing him: Friend, go ahead and strive for your ideal. Your motherland will not abandon you, as long as you have the courage to continue to strive. Is not a bright path ahead? (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)

### Tongji University Student Unrest Subsides: Hang Liwu Returns to Beijing

[Our Newspaper News] The student unrest at Tongji University, after several days of handling by Education Ministry Vice Minister Hang Liwu and the municipal authorities in Shanghai, has come to an end. Mr. Hang finished his public affairs in Shanghai and took a military plane back to Beijing last night. Before his departure, he issued the following written statement: "The central government originally intended to dissolve and reorganize Tongji University because of the student unrest caused by a portion of its students. However, after the students expressed remorse and the resumption of classes proceeded well for several days, and after repeated inspections by dispatched personnel, order has gradually been restored. Therefore, it has been decided to exempt the university from dissolution, but the Ministry will issue another order requiring the university to be strictly reorganized. The students who initiated the trouble must be identified and punished accordingly. Since the incident occurred three weeks ago, President Ding's sense of responsibility has been consistent, and the Ministry deeply trusts him. The faculty and staff of the university have also adopted a consistent and upright attitude, which is commendable and gratifying. On the day of the incident, President Ding maintained close contact with the municipal government and alumni, discussing matters closely. The rumor that he could not be found at that time was a misunderstanding. Yesterday, the presidents of various specialized colleges and universities in the city held a meeting, unanimously praising President Ding's courageous sense of responsibility. I also explained to the presidents that the central government and colleagues in the Ministry are well aware of the difficulties faced by the school authorities, which are beyond the imagination of outsiders. Since society's expectations of school authorities are so profound, achieving educational stability and academic progress requires the earnest cooperation of the government, society, and schools. Students in all schools should especially recognize the current severe domestic and international situation and understand the rights and obligations of the people during the constitutional and mobilization periods, striving to ensure that their words and actions do not exceed the bounds of the law. Regarding this incident, in addition to ordering Tongji University to undergo thorough reorganization, the Ministry has also ordered all universities where students participated in the incident to thoroughly investigate the circumstances in order to rectify the situation."

### Astronomical Miracle: Discovery of a New Variable Star; Professor Zhang Zichun of Zhongshan University Receives Supreme Honor in the United States

[Shenzhou News Agency News] News from the China Science Society in this city: Professor Zhang Zichun, Director of the Department of Astronomy at National Zhongshan University, went to the Harvard University Observatory in the United States last year for research. In December, he discovered a group of new variable stars in the southern end of the constellation Camelopardalis, at right ascension 4 degrees 5 minutes and declination 53 degrees 14 minutes. This new discovery has attracted widespread attention and interest from observatories around the world and is rightfully regarded as a supreme honor for our astronomers abroad. Dr. Shapley, Director of the Harvard Observatory, immediately telegraphed the discovery to major observatories around the world. This newly discovered variable star had previously been noticed by Dr. Detman of the Yerkes Observatory in the United States. After examining the spectrum, it was known that the star was similar to the R Coronae Borealis type variable star, and it was predicted to be another variable star, but no factual proof was obtained. Later, Professor Zhang reviewed more than 800 photographs of the area where the star was located, from 1898 to the present, and finally, between Julian days 2,429,596 and 2,429,676, he obtained the area where the star's brightness was at its minimum, proving that it was indeed a variable star. He also determined that its minimum luminosity occurred on January 17, 1940, at approximately 10.30 international photographic magnitude, and its average brightness was 8.70 magnitude. It belongs to the K type, and other characteristics are still under study. Currently, there are more than 20,000 known variable stars in the universe, but the brightness change of the R Coronae Borealis type variable star has no fixed period, so it is extremely difficult to discover. To date, only about a dozen or so are known. This type of star has an extremely high surface temperature, and the surrounding nebula contains a large amount of carbon, so it is also called a hot carbon star. The full type star spectrum is from G type to K type and has supergiant characteristics.

### Unified Scholarship Method: University Presidents Express Support

The presidents of 25 private universities and specialized schools in this city held a meeting at the Tsinghua Alumni Association yesterday, believing that this method is well-intentioned, expressing unanimous support, and deciding to jointly publish an announcement in local newspapers to inform all students.

[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Fine Arts College Student Aid Society stated that since the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Examination Committee is coordinating scholarships for poor students in various schools, students do not need to solicit donations themselves. The society has now ceased its activities, and the tickets for the drama that the society had planned to perform to raise funds have been collected and canceled.

### Dawn of Agricultural Education in This City: Birth of Qibao Agricultural School, Planned and Promising

Yesterday, at the invitation of a friend, I took a XiangSheng Company bus from Shanghai to Qibao. As soon as I got off the bus, I saw the enrollment advertisement for Shanghai Municipal Qibao Agricultural Vocational School. I walked through the bustling street, around the southern end of the town. A bend in the stream greeted people with a shallow smile; walking east along the stream, surrounded by slowly flowing waters, were several semi-palatial buildings. White powder walls, green tile roofs, vermilion corridor pillars, light green water pipes, verdant pines and ginkgo trees - the scenery at this angle was too delightful. Finally, I arrived at Qibao Agricultural School. Led by a receptionist, I sat down in the reception room, where the kind-hearted President Chai Zifei came in to shake hands and chat with the reporter, and accompanied me on a tour.

President Chai, around forty years old, with a ruddy complexion and radiant spirit, and a pair of bright eyes fully revealed his brilliance and talent. He is a local, born into a farming family. He has been the principal of Xicheng Elementary School for more than ten years and is currently an executive member of the Municipal Party Headquarters and a member of the Municipal Council. He is an extremely active and well-respected figure in Shanghai. Last year, he was supported by local people to take charge of all the preparations for the founding of the school. The school is municipal, but the municipal education funding is tight, and it can't provide any money at all. President Chai has worked hard to make something out of nothing: many of the buildings were renovated from dilapidated temples; hundreds of acres of farmland were donated by the local charity Sanshan Hall; other operating expenses were raised from local people. Qibao was once located at the junction of the city and the county, and the situation was very complicated. Fortunately, with President Chai leading the way, everyone was happy to help him succeed because of what he was doing in creating this new school. Because it is a newly established school, currently only two classes are open for both junior and senior levels. The junior level has more than 100 people, and the senior level has more than 60 people. The junior level curriculum, in addition to focusing on the agricultural labor course, is the same as ordinary middle schools. At the senior level, this semester, there are more courses on crops, animal husbandry, soil and fertilizer. There are forty-two classes a week, which is almost a quarter more than ordinary middle schools, which has to be said to be very heavy.

Agricultural schools are very difficult work. The reporter asked President Chai to guide him to see the agricultural farm facilities, but he told me that what he most felt was insufficient this semester was that the farm has not yet been equipped. He led the reporter to the southern end of the stream, pointing to the distant fields bounded by several cypress trees, he said that the area totals hundreds of acres, which is prepared for use as a farm. Because many fields still need to be exchanged with farmers, after several consultations, the procedures have recently been completed, and more than 60 acres have already been acquired, which can be returned to the school for cultivation when the spring harvest is collected. President Chai pointed east and west to tell the reporter: there he plans to build livestock houses, there he plans to build flower rooms, where is the nursery, where is the farm office, ... he explained the various construction plans in detail. Facing this field, the reporter imagined the scene when its construction was completed based on President Chai's plan, and he was convinced that a beautiful picture could be created in three or four years.

On a field to the east of the existing school buildings, President Chai pointed out to me the plans for the new school buildings to be built next semester: six classrooms, laboratories, a large auditorium, dormitories, etc., as well as a sports field. He wanted the reporter to participate in the opinions on civil engineering, but I was a complete layman and could only stammer without knowing what to say.

Finally, the reporter asked about the relationship between the establishment of the agricultural school and the lives of local people. President Chai told the reporter very seriously: The school has signed contracts with the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Plant Pest and Drug Machinery Manufacturing Experimental Factory. This year, with a target of 1,000 acres of cotton fields, it will promote the planting of American cotton. Materials will be provided by the Improvement Office and the Experimental Factory, and the manpower will be the responsibility of all teachers and students of the agricultural school. If the 1,000-acre trial is successful this year, it can be increased to 6,000 acres next year. In addition, a production and marketing cooperative is also being organized. After its establishment, it will borrow money from the Central Cooperative Treasury to fund agricultural production and marketing. On the other hand, several local people have initiated the establishment of a farmers' education experimental area and have submitted a plan to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval. In short, the establishment of the agricultural school has grown up from difficulties. Every time a difficulty is overcome, the interest in handling affairs can be increased by one level. What is currently difficult is the fundraising. The total construction cost of various buildings is more than 4 billion yuan. Next semester, we must find ways to come up with a solution and complete them step by step.

Due to time constraints, the reporter had to say goodbye and leave. The impression gained from this visit was like watching a movie about the rural construction of the Tennessee River in the United States, and the spirit was extraordinarily excited. In today's China, to talk about strengthening the foundation of the country, what could be more important and practical than developing agricultural production! This school is the dawn of agricultural education in this city and the cradle of new agriculture in China. Not only does the nursing President Chai have the responsibility to love and nurture him, but I think every powerful Chinese person also has the responsibility to provide this baby with nourishment so that he is healthy and grows up.

### Renyu's Triumphant Performance: One Point Over Encars: Xiqing Succumbs to a Comeback; In Another Game, Donghua Forcefully Defeats Team V

[Our Newspaper News] Last night in the group basketball league, Renyu came from behind, defeating Xiqing's strong team Encars by a single point, a truly satisfying performance. The score was 36 to 34, with Renyu trailing by 15 to 20 in the first half. The entire game was exceptionally tense. From the start, after each side tied at 6 points, Xiqing consistently led by 2 or 3 points until Renyu first tied the score at 21 points in the second half.

In the first game of Group B, Indian vs. Xinsheng, Indian did not have enough players and declared forfeit, Xinsheng winning without a fight.

Donghua Wins First

The game between Donghua and Team V started at 6:30 pm. In the initial engagement, Zhuang Yirong opened the scoring, but Donghua struck back shortly after, with Lin Genbang scoring successively, taking the lead by 4 to 2. Team V was unwilling to be outdone, launching a full attack, with Wang Shouli, Zhuang Yirong, Zhu Mingxing, and others scoring repeatedly, taking a commanding lead of 11 to 4. Donghua adjusted its lineup, and after Long Haideng entered the game, the momentum changed immediately. By the end of the first half, the score was tied at 15 points, with the outcome undecided. After switching sides, both teams re-entered, with adjustments to their lineups. Zhuang Yirong made a layup under the basket, and Youliang immediately returned the favor. After each side scored 17, Donghua suddenly found their rhythm, with Wu Guoxiang, Long Haiyou, Ren Youliang all scoring accurately. The scores of the two teams remained close, with a difference of two or three points. Team V was not as strong as Donghua, and by the end of regulation time, Donghua narrowly won by 41 to 37.

### Renyu Achieves Final Victory

In Group A, Renyu vs. Encars, after the two teams lined up, Xu Zhongyi dismounted and Shi Wei broke the basket, Encars tied the score. After Shen Pengju waved in with one hand, Renyu called a timeout. The mercenaries took advantage of the situation, and Gretlis and E. Kailuosi successively scored, and Huaiting's close-range probe tied the score at 6 points again. After entering, both sides became more tense. The mercenaries always led by a difference of two or three points. Not long after, the first half ended, with Renyu trailing by 15 to 20. After the break, the two teams switched sides and restarted the battle. Bao Lai committed a foul by intruding, and Wu Xinyun immediately scored a point. Xu Zhongyi shot under the basket, and the difference was only one point at 18 to 20. Shen Pengju's close-range probe hit the target, and the two sides tied again at 21. The mercenaries called a timeout to adjust their lineup, but it still didn't work. Xu Zhongyi scored on a free throw, and Wu Xinyun scored a wonderful goal with one hand. Renyu took the lead by 24 to 21. The mercenaries counterattacked and tied the score again at 24. Renyu's Wu Xinyun made both free throws, and Frank also returned the favor in the same way. One after another, the tension was extraordinary. After each side scored 27, Renyu suddenly emerged, taking a lead of 33 to 27. After V. Kailuosi graduated, Shen Pengju was also dismissed. The mercenaries still tried their best to make a final sprint, but time did not wait for them. When the bell rang, Renyu won a narrow victory over Encars by 36 to 34, a difference of one point.

### East District Industrial Sector Table Tennis: Post Office B Wins the Championship

The East District Industrial Sector Table Tennis League has completed all of its matches. In the final match the other night, Post Office B defeated Merchants A at the Post Office No. 5 hall.

Daily necessities and soap market also saw soaring prices due to extremely strong buying interest from all parties and new buying activity. As a result, Gu Ben, Arrow, Knife, Guanghua, and other soaps all rose sharply by about 100,000 yuan. Prices of Match, Beauty, Phoenix, and miscellaneous brands also rose by more than 10%.

### Customs Collects Dredging Donation on Behalf of the Government; Changed to Collect According to Normal Tax

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Jianghai Customs recently issued a public announcement stating that, upon order, the dredging donation collected by the Customs on behalf of the government will be changed to 6% of the normal tax for taxable goods and 3/1000 of the value of the goods for tax-free goods, starting from February 1 of this year.

### Officials and Merchants are Still Negotiating the Detailed Rules for the Management of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Gu Yuqian, Secretary-General of the National Economic Committee, came to Shanghai to discuss the implementation of various implementation methods for cotton yarn and cloth with the leaders of private yarn factories. It is said that the focus of the discussion is still concentrated on two points: (1) The Yarn Control Committee will first issue raw cotton and then spin it into cotton yarn. (2) The agency fee cannot be rigidly stipulated to be 259.5 pounds of raw cotton. According to the current cost of living index, the provision is too far from the actual cost, so there must be a flexible provision.

### The Pharmaceutical Industry is Declining

The pharmaceutical industry has recently concluded its accounts, with more losses than profits. Annual expenditures have increased dramatically, profits are meager, and the situation is precarious. The market has been lifeless in recent days, and the crisis in the pharmaceutical industry is worrying.

### Domestic Capital Flees; Factories Move to Hong Kong

[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to reliable statistics, domestic capital continued to flee to Hong Kong in the past year. More than 50 factories, large and small, have moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong, with an estimated total capital of more than 50 million Hong Kong dollars. Among them, large-scale companies include cotton spinning factories, electric appliance factories, leather factories, and chemical factories. Recently, Shanghai merchants are also planning to establish a relatively large-scale iron factory in Hong Kong, specializing in the manufacture of textile machinery and its parts; at the same time, they will establish a weaving factory to cooperate with it. The capital amount of the former is set at 3 million Hong Kong dollars, and the latter is more than 1 million Hong Kong dollars. The factory sites have been determined and are all located in the Hung Hom district of Kowloon.

### Commercial Briefs

The Industrial Association assists the Import Quota Allocation Department in handling the allocation of raw materials for the fourth quarter. It has been decided that starting from February 4, every afternoon, the actual production and the types and standards of raw materials required by various industries will be discussed and reviewed at the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office. The first batch of industries to be reviewed include glass, pharmaceutical, paint manufacturing, celluloid, ink, spices, domestic pigments, and groceries.

Regarding the purchase of raw cotton, the Chairman of the Flower Yarn Management Committee, Mr. Yuan, and the person in charge of the Shanghai Cotton Merchants Association have discussed and decided to entrust the "Shanghai Flower Commercial Joint Business Office" organized by the association to purchase raw cotton. It is planned to purchase a total of 1 million market dans from February to August, requiring a total fund of approximately 7 trillion yuan. The raw cotton obtained can be used for mortgage, at 80% of the market price.

The Central Agricultural Bank Shanghai Branch is actively handling the settlement of the spring and autumn silk collection affairs in the 36th year of the Republic of China. On the one hand, it urges manufacturers who have cleared various loans to settle, and on the other hand, it settles accounts with manufacturers who have cleared various loans, with the aim of completing the task by the end of the lunar year.

The China Silk Company and the Xin Guang Underwear Company are cooperating to manufacture silk shirts and underwear. After trial production, the results are quite good. Hundreds of dozens have been rushed out and plan to be shipped to France, Britain, the United States, and Southeast Asia for sales in the shortest possible time.

Twelve companies in this city, including the Zhenhua Paint Factory, have repeatedly requested the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to transfer the required raw material turpentine to the China Petroleum Company. The Industrial and Commercial Office has recently received a letter from the company asking them to notify the industry to submit a list of applications for review and allocation.

Yesterday's timber market saw sellers asking higher prices for foreign pine due to foreign exchange adjustments. However, due to sluggish actual sales, market prices may be difficult to sustain.

Literature

### In Memory of Gandhi

— Wang Jinshan

—The great mountain must crumble! The mighty beam must break! The wise man must wither!—Confucius

The world ultimately cannot retain

Your symbol of Eastern spirit.

Though stabbing you was "late,"

Your passing still feels too soon.

——"The journey is long,

With no return in sight!"

You bared your chest,

Facing the enemy head-on.

——"In this fleeting moment,

Adorn your robe."

Enduring the assassin's attack,

You forgave the perpetrator with your hand.

——"Mother will not scoff,

You depart now!"

Blood splattered on your homespun clothes,

You will no longer return to the mortal world.

——"You depart now,

Into that dust!"

What kind of world is this?

Everywhere, riots and bloodshed!

——"Into that dust,

Cover you with ashes."

"A Jesus without a cross,"

Some also call you "another name for sacrifice."

——"Join their ranks,

And please bathe in the fragrant water."

Ultimately becoming a sacrifice for an independent India,

And fulfilling the pursuit of reason and a sacred heart.

——"And please bathe in the fragrant water,

Choose your robe yourself."

You came from the dust of the earth,

And now you are one with the dust.

——"Choose your robe yourself,

The journey is long."

Oh, the sobbing Ganges River,

The blood and tears of history!

——"The journey is long,

With no return in sight!"

This world cannot retain you,

The prophet of truth and peace!

Note: The quotes "" are all translations of Gandhi's own words. "A Jesus without a cross" is what Romain Rolland called Gandhi, and "another name for sacrifice" is what Tagore called him.

And anti-aircraft guns (battlefield)

(11) Shanghai South Railway

Station, on the train (Evening)

The passengers on the train all gaze out the window.

Passenger A: The Chinese planes are bombing; it's extremely dangerous!

Passenger B: This time is more intense than the January 28th Incident.

Passenger A: Of course, the Chinese compatriots, united against a common enemy, will vent the resentment of a century this time.

(12) Battlefield Scene

Anti-aircraft guns in the distance atop tall buildings fire continuously

(13) Miscellaneous Scenes

(Intense sounds of gunfire from battle)

Cartoon map: "Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Dushan, Guiyang."

Superimposed image: A man and a woman walking.

Superimposed image: A train.

Superimposed image: A man and a woman walking.

Superimposed image: A car.

Superimposed image: A man and a woman with a little girl.

The cartoon map then reaches between Guilin and Guiyang.

Superimposed image: A woman fleeing with a girl of about eight years old.

(In this section, it is implied that He Qi and his wife fled from Shanghai to Nanjing, Hankou, with their child Xiuzhen. In the autumn of 1938, they fled from Hankou to Changsha. After arriving in Guilin, they lived there for six years. He Qi then went to Hong Kong after arriving in Guilin, and then to Southeast Asia. During the period between Guilin and Guiyang, there were only the mother and daughter. Please note).

(14) On the Highway

(The highway from Guangxi to Guizhou)

A large group of refugees walks along the road. Guo Canyun and Xiuzhen are also mixed in with the crowd fleeing.

(15) Liuzhai, on the Guangxi-Guizhou Border

(End of November 1944)

Refugees, wounded soldiers, and troops fill this small town. Everywhere there are people, vehicles, and refugee stalls, a variety beyond description. Suddenly, an air raid alarm sounds, and the people panic and flee in all directions. Canyun and Xiuzhen are also mixed in the crowd. "Close-up": At this moment, she still has a small suitcase and a bundle in her hands. Then comes the sound of anti-aircraft guns as they struggle to run in the crowd, because enemy aircraft are spotted overhead. "Close-up" immediately followed by the sound of bombs exploding. Thick smoke and fire rise everywhere, and many houses in the town are destroyed, with heavy casualties. Canyun is covered in dust and her face is ashen. She only carries a bundle; the small suitcase has obviously been lost. She shouts loudly, "Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen! Xiuzhen!" But no one answers. Anxious, she cries and asks everyone she meets if they have seen a girl of seven or eight years old, but everyone says they haven't. Canyun searches everywhere, and even goes to identify bodies among the many people killed by the bombing, but to no avail. On the other hand, a Red Cross relief vehicle is parked near the bombed area. The relief workers carry the injured women and children onto the vehicle one by one. The vehicle is filled with a dozen people and then drives away. Xiuzhen is one of those rescued by the Red Cross relief vehicle. Canyun just missed it and is afraid she won't be able to find Xiuzhen.

(16) Guiyang Duyun Refugee Relief Association

Canyun (Canyun is now thirty-seven or thirty-eight years old) fled to Duyun, not only exhausted but has become a 100% refugee. It is impossible to tell that she was once a wealthy lady. She goes to the Refugee Relief Association to inquire about her daughter's whereabouts, walking into an office and seeing an administrator working there. There are many refugees in the room.

Canyun: Excuse me, sir, are you in charge of refugee relief?

Administrator: Yes, what can I do for you?

Canyun: I fled here from Guilin. My daughter was lost when enemy planes bombed Liuzhai. I've searched all the way here but haven't found any news. Now everyone is fleeing to Guiyang, but I have no relatives there, and I don't know what to do. I have relatives in Hongjiang, Hunan. I don't know if there's a way to get there from here?

Administrator: Yes, there is a waterway not far from here to Hongjiang. You can take a civilian boat.

Canyun: But sir, I lost all my money and valuables in Liuzhai (in a difficult situation). I have no money now...

Administrator: That doesn't matter. We have refugee boats to send refugees downriver. If you are willing to take a boat, I can give you a boat ticket.

Canyun: I am willing.

Administrator: (Immediately fills out a boat ticket and hands it to her.) A boat with favorable winds will leave tomorrow. Please come to the Relief Association early tomorrow morning, and someone here will take you to the place where you can board the boat.

Canyun: Thank you very much. (Takes the boat ticket and exits.)

(17) Guiyang City Street (December 4, 1944, Afternoon)

A corner of the Guiyang city square. Many people hurry back and forth, their faces showing panic, worry, and confusion. Many people are whispering to each other. From their various expressions, it can be seen that everyone believes the overall situation is hopeless. Suddenly, a newsboy loudly shouts as he sells extras.

Newsboy: (Holding a roll of newspapers under his left arm. Holding a sheet of extra high in his right hand, he shouts as he walks.) Extra! Extra! Five yuan a copy! Selling extras! The enemy has reached Dushan! The frontline troops are putting up a strong resistance in Pingzhou! (Many people hear the newsboy's shouts and become even more anxious. Everyone scrambles to buy extras. After several people buy them, the newsboy shouts and walks away.)

Person A (Having bought an extra and read it.) It says that another group of enemies has already reached the vicinity of Duyun. So the large bridge near Duyun has already been destroyed. What will happen if we can't resist the enemy?

Person B: What to do? Do you want to run? Where to run to? I heard that Commander-in-Chief Chiang has sent Chief of Staff He to oversee Guiyang. He arrived yesterday. Commander Tang has also gone to the front lines to command. The devils have penetrated deep into the mountains of Guizhou. They're just coming here to die. What's there to be afraid of?

(18) Emergency Meeting (December 10, 1944)

Around 4:00 PM. About twenty or thirty leaders from the Party, government, and military in Guiyang hold an emergency meeting in a conference room to address the current situation. The meeting is in progress. Deputy Commander Zhang rushes in.

Chairman: (The chairman of the meeting) The situation is so urgent. I hope that everyone will take responsibility and work hard to carry out the many things we just decided on...

(Just as the chairman finishes speaking, Deputy Commander Zhang enters the conference room and greets everyone. The chairman asks Deputy Commander Zhang to sit on a chair to his right and continues to speak.)

Now that Deputy Commander Zhang has arrived, we invite him to tell us about the situation on the front lines. (Everyone applauds to show their welcome.)

Commander: (Standing up to report) Chairman, gentlemen, the first thing I want to report to everyone is that the fighting on the front lines has stabilized. (Everyone is happy to hear this, and applause breaks out.)

Brothers, I rushed back to Guiyang from Machangping this morning. The enemy in Dushan has indeed been driven back by us. Our troops recaptured Dushan City yesterday afternoon. The enemy twenty li near Duyun are being attacked by our land and air forces and are also retreating southward, and we are currently pursuing them. So, in terms of military affairs, please rest assured. But in the Duyun, Guiding, and Longli areas, there are about hundreds of thousands of refugees flooding towards Guiyang like a tide. Once they arrive, not only will housing be a problem, but food will be an even bigger problem. If it is not handled well, the security of Guiyang is really worrying. I reported this to Chief of Staff He on the phone last night. I don't know if everyone has discussed a good solution yet?

Chairman: Regarding this matter, yesterday's meeting already decided to establish a Refugee Relief Committee to be responsible for handling everything. Now we are preparing shelters. All agencies, schools, and large residences in Guiyang City can be arranged as refugee reception centers. At the same time, we are also considering how to transport the refugees away. This is closely related to transportation and we are currently discussing it with the Rear Service Department. This is Mr. Gu, the director of our Relief Committee. (Gu and Zhang exchange brief greetings.)

Commander: That's very good. It is the responsibility of us soldiers to fight hard on the front lines. Everything in the rear must trouble you all. (He sits down after speaking.)

Chairman: Thank you, Deputy Commander Zhang, for bringing us good news. The meeting is adjourned. I hope everyone will work hard to prepare everything separately. (The chairman stands up to adjourn the meeting.)

(19) Near the Suburbs of Guiyang

(Mid-December 1944)

The weather is freezing and bitterly cold. Remnants of snow can be seen in the fields on both sides of the highway, and there is also accumulated snow on the distant mountains. On the highway near Guiyang City, thousands upon thousands of refugees are surging towards Guiyang City like a tide. There are old and young, men and women. Except for a few strong people, most of them have pale faces, obviously having fled for a long time without a full meal. The vast majority are walking, supporting the elderly and carrying the young. Occasionally, a dilapidated small car is spotted, filled with seemingly wealthy refugees. Bundles, bedding, and luggage are tied behind and on top of the car. Suddenly, one or two sedan chairs arrive, carrying old or sick refugees. A large truck is packed with more people than it can carry, and they all look sick. Many people walking are using various kinds of canes. Some are made of bamboo, some are made of small tree trunks, and some are genuine canes. The clothes worn by the refugees are strange and varied; except for a few who are still dressed well, most are ragged. Most ridiculous is an old man with a full beard wearing a woman's cheongsam. Many female refugees are actually wearing military uniforms, some female refugees wearing a short military uniform over a cheongsam, and there are also male and female refugees wearing long clothes and military caps on their heads. There are husbands pulling horses and wives riding on the horses, and there are children riding on the backs of oxen, with their fathers and brothers taking care of them as they walk. Occasionally, a young woman wearing high-heeled leather shoes and walking slowly is seen. Many people don't even have straw sandals. Some walk with their feet wrapped in rags and cotton, some young men support the elderly, some men and women carry children on their backs, and some mothers lead several children, fearing they will get lost, tying their children around their waists with ropes. There are also innocent and lively children following everyone without understanding what is happening. The refugees carry all kinds of luggage, and there is nothing that is not there. Some refugees carry it themselves, some carry it on shoulder poles, and some carry it together. Among the many refugees, some retreating soldiers are often mixed in. Some have neat military uniforms, some have untidy ones, some carry rifles and pistols, and some are unarmed. Red Cross trucks are often seen carrying wounded soldiers and sick refugees, moving slowly through the refugee crowd, with their horns honking to make way for the refugees.

In Guiyang City, a large building can be seen here, with the sign "Guiyang Finance Department" on the left and "First Refugee Reception Center" hanging on the right. Another place has "Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters" hanging on the left and "Fifth Refugee Reception Center" on the right. Still another place has "Guizhou Branch of the Youth League" hanging on the left and "Third Refugee Reception Center" on the right, with "Star Grand Theater" above and "Twenty-second Refugee Reception Center" below. The left side of "Guizhou Daily" is "Cultural Persons Reception Center," and so on.

In front of the gate of one building hangs "First Refugee Hospital." (To be continued)

### Continued Sentence Annotations: "Idle Dreams"

— Lü Lianggeng

Heroes are easy to come by, sages are difficult. There are more writers than talented scholars.

The difference between the former lies in correct action and the ability to distinguish right from wrong. The difference between the latter lies in the level of innate talent.

The greatest writing of all ages is formed from blood and tears.

This statement is similar to that of the Western philosopher Nietzsche: "The greatest writing in the world is written in blood."

The word "emotion" is what maintains the world. The word "talent" is what embellishes the universe. If there were no emotion or talent to maintain it, the world would have ceased to exist long ago.

There are those whose appearance is ugly yet admirable, and those who are not ugly but not worth admiring. There is writing that is unpolished yet lovely, and writing that, while polished, is extremely repulsive. These things are not easily explained to shallow people.

Ingenious ideas and inspiration from beyond. Truly understanding the essence of a saying can be considered the destiny of writing.

Better to be cursed by petty people than despised by gentlemen.

This is similar to Lu Xun's saying: "Better to be cursed to death by heroes than praised by bastards." They happen to agree without prior consultation.

Each flower must be seen in bloom, each moon must be seen full, each book must be seen finished, each beauty must be seen in high spirits, only then is there reality. Otherwise, it will all be for naught.

Such insight shows that Xinqi is truly a sentimental person. Doesn't he know that imperfections in the world are the most intriguing? The most beautiful things are those that can be imagined but not attained. Once obtained, they are nothing more than that! Wang Guowei once wrote a poem saying: "Having reached Penglai, one finds Penglai shallow!"

It is not advisable to be overly meticulous in everything, but one must be meticulous in reading. It is not advisable to be not obsessed with anything, but one must be obsessed with doing good.

Why forget the most important saying: "One must be obsessed with using emotion."

Small grievances in the heart can be dispelled with wine. Great injustices in the world cannot be dispelled without a sword.

Li Bai's heroic drinking and killing is the true color of a poetic hero.

If one must flatter, then do so with words, not with writing. If one cannot help but scold, then also do so with words, not with writing.

Ink leaves traces. Whether flattering or scolding, it is simply not worth it.

Reading "Water Margin" up to Lu Da beating Zheng Guanxi and Wu Song killing the tiger, one thinks that life must have at least one satisfying event to not be wasted in this life.

Nine out of ten things in the world are unsatisfactory! How many satisfying things are there in life? But one must strive for them.

The spring breeze is like wine, the summer breeze is like tea, the autumn breeze is like smoke, the winter breeze like mustard.

And what about the winter wind? The north wind is so cold, like bitter medicine, making it unbearable.

One should model one's character on the Song dynasty Confucians, and one should incorporate the free-spiritedness of the Jin dynasty into one's engagement with the world.

Confucianism and free-spiritedness do not hinder each other.

One cannot be without pride, but one cannot have arrogance. Without pride, one is close to being a vulgar person. With arrogance, one cannot be a gentleman.

Xinqi's second layer of interpretation has some problems. We want our hearts to be higher than the sky and our eyes to be above the top. Without pride, how can one establish oneself in the mundane world? Without arrogance, how can one criticize the current trends? If one were to abandon one's principles and conform to the world, I would never do that!

Sages are the substitutes of heaven and earth. (Continued sentence) Beauties are the representatives of wind and moon. One who can be free from what the world is busy with can then be busy with what the world is free from.

Those who find leisure in busyness are interesting people. Those who find busyness in leisure are intelligent people. The most terrifying thing is to be idle, bored, and busy with nothing!

Writing a new book is a great undertaking for thousands of years. Annotating an ancient book is truly a great achievement for ten thousand generations.

This is the self-narration of the author of "Idle Dreams," who deeply understands the joys and hardships. This is why I am willing to annotate Xinqi's "Idle Dreams." When the temperaments are similar, it is believed that the meeting of minds is not far away. The author's painstaking efforts, meticulous design, and painstaking operation should all be conveyed in detail! Although I dare not claim to be a great achievement for ten thousand generations, I want to speculate on the Dharma eye.

(Annotated in Guling in the summer of 1947, re-transcribed in Xunyang in the winter of the same year)

### The Latest in the World of Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

The Literary Scene in Turkey

Turkish writers, both during the war and now, tend towards America, especially during Truman's presidency. In the past, Turkey was inclined towards England.

Turkey's American inclination can be seen in a recent book, "Dreamland," written by the young Turkish female writer Sakibe Soyukut. She studied in America and, after returning to Turkey, told her compatriots about this magical Western land. This book has a Hollywood flair—but this is exactly what the Turkish market needs. In the eyes of merchants in Ankara, "American" is the easiest commodity to sell. Even if it is clearly a British product, the girls selling sewing needles will shout "American!"

Several books about America have already been translated into Turkish. The most successful is Phyllis Bentley's "Ishte Amerika," as well as Andre Maurois's "History of America," and a collection of essays generally discussing America, which were originally published in Turkey's best-selling newspaper, Vatan.

The Turkish book market almost follows American bestsellers. For example, the translation of Elliott Roosevelt's book used the strange name "I Admit," and Victor Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" was also translated. Henry Wallace's "The Century of the Common Man" (translated as Halk Asri) has also been published. Wendell Willkie's "One World" is translated as Tek Blr Dunya.

Booksellers in Ankara say that the most popular American books are those by Pearl Buck and Bromfield. The most popular American popular novel is Kathleen Winsor's "Forever Amber." The Turkish translation only translates the word "Amber," a term Turkey adopted from Arabic.

As for Turkey's own literature, it is still very narrow and cannot be compared to that of the West. The only internationally known female writer is Halide Edib, who is currently teaching in Istanbul. She introduces the new Turkey, both domestic and international issues, to the West. Apart from her, the rest of the writers are probably only known within the country.

Modern Turkish writers are absolutely nationalistic. During Kemal's rule, there was no national awakening because at that time there were many countries, and Turkey was just one of them, only a larger country. Someone wrote a biography of the current president, Ismet Inonu. In addition, recent publications are about Turkish art, archaeology, history, and education. Turkey has turned to Rousseau's education, and his "Emile" has already been translated.

Many people in Turkey read books, and selling books is quite profitable. There are many bookstores in every city, but there are very few original Western books, probably due to the influence of foreign exchange. The Turkish government does not pay much attention to libraries. The largest one is located in the House of Representatives in Ankara, but there are very few new books, not even as good as a middle school library in America. The United States Information Service has established a library in the embassy, but most people do not approach it.

The Turks are very eager to learn about modern American literature. They also hope that American literature professors can come to teach, and they hope to have a large-scale exchange of teachers and students.

### Snowy Lanzhou

— Junzuo

I flew to Lanzhou from Shanghai on January 19th. As soon as I got off the plane, I felt that the climate was a bit strange. The sky was clear for thousands of miles, but the crystal cold was like the summit of Mount Emei. The friends who came to the airport to pick up guests were all wrapped in fur coats, only revealing a section of their eyebrows, which could be distinguished. That night, I washed my feet and went to bed in my residence. When I looked the next morning, the water I used to wash my feet was frozen into ice.

I have been back in Lanzhou for a week. In this week alone, it has been seventeen or eighteen degrees below zero every day. The cityscape of Lanzhou is a kind of light, powdered, silver attire, like an exquisite and peerless beauty in a jade pavilion, who cannot bear the cold at great heights. Ice flowers and snow blocks are visible everywhere in the streets and alleys. Pedestrians are curled up like hedgehogs. The ear-splitting east wind is terribly cold, and some of the old men's beards are frozen into ice hooks.

The fantastic impression given to people from the southeast is that the charm of the northwest snowfall is extraordinary. The day before yesterday night, the moon was bright in the sky, without a speck of dust. The fluttering white snow rippled in the moonlight. Mount Gaolan stood majestically in the south, shining in the moonlight and snow, still faintly enveloped in a thin mist. Such a wonderful sight, has the Jiangnan region ever seen? Yesterday morning, I pushed open the window and looked out. What a big sun, and the snow was still flying so frantically, the layers colorful, sketching the entire Lanzhou. Although the sun was shining brightly, the snow did not melt, one layer covering another. Overnight, it was four or five inches thick, like ground powder, unable to see the six-petaled snowflakes. Such a wonderful sight, has the Jiangnan region ever seen?

The sun comes out on one side, the moon comes out on the other, and snow falls on the other. What is the reason for this? Can climatologists enlighten me a little bit? People who have lived in Lanzhou for a long time are used to it and don't find it fantastic. Only lonely people, distant guests, have some fresh feelings.

Although the climate is so severe, if you compare it with Shanghai, the winter in Lanzhou is still lovely. Generally, most agencies and homes burn coal stoves. There is a A'qian town very close to Lanzhou City, which is rich in coal. The warmth of the entire city depends on it. The "Democracy Chief" of A'gan Town is Chairman Guo Jiyao of Gansu Province. Although the outside temperature is as low as seventeen or eighteen degrees below zero, the indoor temperature is often kept as warm as the gentle spring sunshine. Wearing a thin cotton robe is enough. The market price of coal is recently 1.6 million yuan per ton. What about Shanghai? Shanghai generally cannot afford to burn coal, and the largest hotels are stingy with the opening of their radiators. In Shanghai, it is cold outdoors and cold indoors, but Lanzhou is not like that. As long as you dress in fur from head to toe before going out, the onslaught of the severe cold will ultimately be useless.

Winter in Lanzhou is not desolate. Coupled with the boundless ice and snow, the ice skating movement is popular. Zhongshan Forest and Lanyuan, the cultural heart of the region, each have a larger skating venue, and thousands of people skate there all day long. On the Yellow River, which is not completely frozen, in the fields, and in the squares, there are natural ice rinks everywhere, and everywhere you see brave skaters. People in the northwest are not afraid of the cold, can endure hardship, and have drive. If they fall, hurt their backs, or break their tibia, they still skate as usual, until the snowflakes stop flying and the ice melts, which is probably already in the second or third month of spring. At that time, "Suddenly overnight, the east wind comes, and thousands of trees and thousands of trees bloom with pear flowers," and they will soon go to Anningbao to enjoy the peach blossoms. If Lanzhou's ice skating "permanent knives" were not sold for one or two hundred thousand yuan a pair, but were more accessible to the common people, then this kind of winter recreational movement would definitely be more enthusiastic and widespread.

I miss Shanghai, and I miss my friends in Shanghai even more. In the midst of the flames of war, in the midst of the boundless ice and snow, I send this unrestrained and surging enthusiasm in this corner of the great northwest to my friends, just let it burn like coal. (Sent from Lanzhou on January 26)

### The Miracle Cure for Foolishness

— Copper Camel

Six-year-old Manwen used to be extremely dull. A year ago, whether it was simple matters like feeding himself and dressing, or playing with other children, Manwen seemed like a mentally deficient child.

His parents had despaired of Manwen, assuming that even if he didn't remain mentally deficient when he grew up, he would be an idiot. A doctor suggested they try a new medicine for the brain.

Since taking this medicine, Manwen's mental immaturity has gradually disappeared. He can now put on shoes, button his buttons, and play with children his age. If he continues to improve like this, his intelligence will be the same as that of a normal person when he grows up.

At this moment, there is indeed something that can be sold as food for the brain. This is a recent discovery by scientists: "Glutamic acid," extracted from protein. After taking it, it can make children intelligent.

A group of children with intellectual disabilities were fed a food containing this "brain food," and tested with intelligence tests, and they were found to have made significant progress. In fact, the mental development of some of these children was faster than that of normal children of the same age.

According to research, glutamic acid is the only chemical agent among amino acids that can be directly assimilated by brain tissue. After the acid interacts chemically with brain tissue, it can be converted into subtle electricity, promoting nerve activity and intellectual progress. Three scientists in New York are studying the relationship between glutamic acid and intelligence.

They selected nine children and gave them glutamic acid for six months, and they made significant progress in intelligence. The average score on the intelligence test in the first month was 107, and after six months, the average score was 120.

One two-year-old child had an intelligence level of only eight months. After half a year of taking glutamic acid, the child's intellectual development exceeded what it should have been in six months. Another child's intelligence was equal to his actual age: four years old. After eating this new drug for six months, his intelligence was equal to that of a normal child of six years and four months.

This is the first experiment on this new amino acid's ability to improve human thinking ability. It was initially tested on mice. Mice that had taken the acid were able to find a box containing food in a complex path in half the time it took mice that had not taken the acid.

Among the daily necessities for public service personnel—rice, coal, sugar, oil, and salt—coal is the most troublesome. The inconvenience of purchasing and transporting it goes without saying, but when you put a coal briquette into the stove, it often doesn't light. When it finally does, the fire is very weak, and whether you're boiling water for tea or cooking rice, it takes a long time to get anything done. If you need to rush to work after eating, you'll often be late. The family doesn't know how many complaints they've made about burning coal briquettes, but since that's what we're allocated, there's really nothing to say.

This is naturally a problem of ingredients. Because coal briquettes are made by mixing coal and mud, more coal makes them easier to burn, and more mud makes them harder to burn, so a weak fire is inevitable.

Analyzing the ingredients of coal briquettes shouldn't be difficult, but no one pays attention to it, so coal merchants can be unscrupulous.

I remember when I was young, because I was physically weak, adults often made me take tonic pills made of Chinese medicine. Although the instructions for the tonic pills differed in their descriptions of the medicinal properties, there were two sentences that were always the same. What were those two sentences? They were "Although no one sees the compounding, Heaven knows the intention." Because the authenticity of the pills couldn't be seen on the surface, and the effects were very subtle, everyone believed them without a doubt based on these two sentences. Perhaps people were more honest back then, and the composition of the pills wouldn't have differed too much from what was claimed.

Unfortunately, today's coal merchants don't rely on "Heaven knows" intentions like those past medicine merchants, and they're not accustomed to applying science. No wonder coal briquettes, which should contain more coal, are mostly mud, and tap water, which shouldn't contain salt, is salty.

### Reflections on Year-End Thanksgiving

— Nian Hong

Every year at the end, there is always a year-end thanksgiving ritual. This custom, tinged with superstition, is deeply rooted among our people. Even though the Gregorian calendar has been established for more than thirty years, as the Lunar New Year approaches, the price of paper ingots in incense shops and chicken, duck and meat in the market all increase several times. Although people are constantly lamenting the economic downturn, the long-standing custom of year-end thanksgiving and worship of the gods remains unchanged, and the scale has not diminished.

The reason why humans are called intelligent animals is the responsibility of the gods, because the gods are always astute and excel at using the lowest cost to obtain the greatest reward. And we descendants of Yan and Huang are even more intelligent. Even before the gods, who are praised as supreme, sacred, pure and bright, we still apply a set of human tricks appropriately. In addition to kowtowing with utmost respect, we also offer sacrifices of livestock, wine, dishes, fruits, and finally burn a large string of gold and silver ingots and paper money in the fragrant red candles to send them off, euphemistically called "filial piety." We piously offer wine and silently pray, hoping that everything will go smoothly in the coming year and that good fortune will come. Trying to exchange paper products for real objects is truly "throwing a brick to attract jade," a truly brilliant move. Chicken, duck and dishes are in the name of sacrifice to worship the gods, but in reality, it is to satisfy one's own appetite. The pity is that whether the so-called gods are all fictitious, or whether they are respected as gods and are not moved by profit. In fact, every year every household always offers year-end thanksgiving and worships the gods, but every year every household does not necessarily have enough food and clothing. On the contrary, except for a minority of the minority who can suddenly become rich, most are getting worse and worse, one year is not as good as another, a family in relative comfort has been reduced to barely making ends meet, and those who barely make ends meet are already unable to continue their livelihood.

However, those who offer year-end thanksgiving still offer year-end thanksgiving, because although this year has been full of misfortunes, the future is still long, and we always hope that next year will be enlightened. Based on this hope, although incense and ingots are expensive, they are absolutely indispensable. When praying, they are also particularly pious, and dare not have half a complaint about this year's misfortunes, but just kowtow like pounding garlic, entrusting their hope to the unknown future.

The result of being particularly pious is being particularly embarrassed, but the determined people do not think that this is because the heavenly gods have received courtesy every year but do not give any reward, and still always think that their attitude of kowtowing is not respectful enough, and that the wine and dishes are not rich enough, so they are angered by the gods. On the other hand, if you are sure that you are sincere, then "sincerity is efficacious", "heaven will not fail those who have worked hard", and the gods can always "grant every request" for slight wishes.

In the end, if you ask yourself whether the effort of being upright and sincere has been done to the fullest, and the wine, dishes and sacrifices have also been exhausted, and you have given all that you have, but the embarrassing situation has become worse, then the fault is of course still unavoidable, the fault is only your previous life's "fate".

This is the reason why people offer year-end thanksgiving every year and are poor every year.

### Rickshaw Puller and Dancer

— Bao Zhongzuo

One day, I passed by a dance hall and saw a fashionably dressed woman arguing with a rickshaw puller. Of course, such a situation is obviously a dispute over the fare. Although people walking on the streets of Shanghai have become accustomed to such quarrels and are not surprised, looking at the identities and appearances of these two protagonists, this scene is obviously a bit out of tune.

Therefore, I imagine: the identity of the rickshaw puller can be determined undoubtedly. He pulls the rickshaw, moves his legs apart, and runs around the street, driven by life. His dispute with customers over the fare is understandable from the perspective of a kind rickshaw puller. On the contrary, a rickshaw puller who is insatiable and does not keep his promises, his quarrel with customers is not worthy of sympathy.

Let's talk about the fashionably dressed modern woman. Although I don't know what kind of person she is, I guess she belongs to the category of dancers. Based on this assumption, I can't help but have many thoughts.

Let's not talk about the right and wrong of their quarrel, let's look at their environmental encounters: the appearances of the rickshaw puller and the dancer are completely different. The former is ragged, barefoot, vicious, and extremely poor; the latter is gorgeously dressed, wears high-heeled shoes, and is "overwhelmingly beautiful." However, after thinking carefully, the rickshaw puller and the dancer are both people who have fallen from the world. Earning a living by "footwork" is also a last resort. Both the round and square toes are the same, why do they have to quarrel?

Do you still remember the ban "rickshaws will be gradually phased out and eliminated" a few years ago? Isn't it the same as today's "dance halls will be gradually shut down"? Although the rickshaws are still running on the Shanghai Bund today, I won't discuss it; whether the dance halls will be completely banned by the end of September is unknown because the time has not yet come. If you look at the reality, what is the difference between rickshaw pullers and dancers?

I once had a delusion. If you add up the number of times the dancer revolves and dances in the dance pool, then the distance she has traveled under her feet is really an amazing number, perhaps comparable to that of the rickshaw puller. The only difference is that the rickshaw puller's rickshaw pulling is "vectorial", while the dancer's dancing is just spinning around in the pool, and there is no other purpose other than entertainment.

The dancer only has one youth. When she gets old, her appearance will decline. Like an old and tired rickshaw puller, how many people will pay attention to you?

### Longevity Like the Southern Mountain

— Lei Hong

　Ollier, a member of the French Academy of Medicine, wrote "Reaching the Age of One Hundred", and himself lived to be one hundred and three years old. Ollier once told an interesting story; one day in 1554, Bishop Dumanoir saw an 80-year-old man sitting at his door crying. The bishop asked him why he was crying, and the old man replied that he had been beaten by his father. The bishop found it strange and wanted to see this father. Guided by the 80-year-old man, the bishop arrived at the house and met a father who was healthy and had the appearance of a child with white hair, aged 113. The old man told the bishop that the reason he beat his son was because this "kid" saw his grandfather and walked past without even saying hello. It was because this kid was too disrespectful, so he was punished. The bishop then met the great-grandfather—already a 143-year-old man.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (62)

Xiao Bai listened, feeling both annoyed and amused. He then made a few perfunctory remarks. Zhu Zhai saw that there was nothing else to do and hurriedly left again. After Zhu Zhai left, Xiao Bai sat alone in the room, carefully studying the matter. He felt that it was possible for Zhu Zhai to run away and get married outside without his family's permission. To prevent this from happening, Zhu Zhai's father would have to step in to make it legitimate, but if he didn't handle it well, it could lead to worse consequences. Xiao Bai sat for a while, then lay down for a while, smoking several pipes of incense, and finally came up with an idea. Because there was no performance at the restaurant tonight, after eating dinner, it was already past nine o'clock. He took a car straight to Xu Yuru's house. Because he knew that Yuru's temper was very stern and impatient, if he told him everything, Yuru would definitely get angry and call Zhu Zhai back and scold him, which would only make things worse. So, when he met him, he didn't dare to say it directly, and first talked about some trivial matters. Later, he slowly inquired about Zhu Zhai's recent situation. Yuru then complained: "I am confident that my mind is very open. After Zhu Zhai started a family, I thought it would be good for him to organize a small family outside, so that he could gain more experience. Your second sister doesn't agree. Lately, not only doesn't this daughter-in-law come to see me, but even Zhu Zhai doesn't show his face! Your second sister complains about me all day long, saying that I married a daughter-in-law and lost a good son. Now is this kind of era, every family is like this, what can I do!" Xiao Bai smiled and said: "It is not necessarily a bad thing for them to organize a complete small family. I am afraid that they will recklessly do things outside with their young temperaments. It would be better to call them to move back home to live together, and under your supervision, they will know the principles of living at home and dealing with people." Xiao Bai had just said this when Yuru's wife interjected: "Second brother, what you said is right. I also think so. When a new daughter-in-law enters the door, she must know all the rules of the family. Living separately is not appropriate." Xiao Bai said: "There are good and bad aspects to this, it all depends on what they do. I have something to tell you, but this is just hearsay, not confirmed. You two are smart, don't get angry." Yuru and his wife asked very attentively: "Is Zhu Zhai making any jokes outside?" Xiao Bai said: "According to what I have heard, Zhu Zhai and his wife are not very harmonious." Yuru said: "I have also heard about this." Xiao Bai said: "Recently, they are getting a divorce, because Zhu Zhai wants to marry someone else." Yuru listened, unable to hold back his temper, and said impatiently: "This is outrageous, I must call him back and strictly discipline him." Xiao Bai said: "I told you not to get angry! Do you know who Zhu Zhai wants to marry?" Yuru said: "I think it must be Zhang Yunqing. They have been together since they were children. This time Zhu Zhai's marriage was forced by the situation, and he was very reluctant. I see this situation very clearly." Xiao Bai said: "You guessed wrong. Even if Zhu Zhai has this intention, the famous and virtuous lady may not be willing to seize someone else's husband. It's not her, it's the now very famous Gu Qihuan in the opera world." Yuru said in shock: "What! Gu Qihuan? I often see this name in the newspaper. It is unreasonable for Zhu Zhai to marry her."

### Mark Twain

— Ge Chunliang

During a speaking tour, Mark Twain arrived in a small town in California. Before dinner, he went to the barber shop for a shave.

"You're new to town, aren't you?" the barber asked.

"Yes," Twain said, "This is my first time here."

"You're in luck," the barber said, "Mark Twain is giving a speech here tonight, I suppose you're going?"

"Oh, I guess I probably am."

"Got a ticket? If you haven't, you'll have to stand. Because everything's sold out," the barber warned.

"Good heavens!" Twain said humorously, "I've never had such bad luck! Every time that fellow speaks, I always have to stand."

### The Dispute Over Skulls

— Mao Yi

Anthropologists have long debated the intellectual superiority between people with long heads and people with round heads. Now, Franz Weidenreich of the American Museum of Natural History, after continuous research, strongly criticizes that both factions of scholars are wasting their time. Dr. Weidenreich presented compelling evidence to overturn the fallacies of the "cephalic index" created a hundred years ago by Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius.

Retzius believed that the superiority of races could be distinguished by measuring skulls. The index created by the ratio between the length of the head (measured from the forehead to the back of the head) and the width of the head was the compass for distinguishing the superiority of races. Since the publication of Retzius' theory, anthropologists have divided all humans into three types: "long-headed," "broad-headed," and "moderate."

Many echoing scientists immediately divided Europeans into two types: "superior" long-headed races—Northern Europe and the Mediterranean coastal peoples. "Inferior" broad-headed or moderate races—Central European peoples. And their emergence was assumed to be the result of interbreeding caused by broad-headed races invading from Asia.

Now, the number of cephalic indices measured by anthropologists is countless, and Dr. Weidenreich feels the evidence is sufficient. The facts he found are: Asians (the prominent Mongolians) who are considered to have "contaminated" the long-headed races of Europe are also long-headed, not round-headed. The only dominant long-headed peoples in the world today are the savage peoples of Australia and Africa. The heads of all people of all civilized races are gradually becoming rounder, probably as a result of the change in human posture from quadrupedal crawling to bipedal standing, because this posture changes the shape of the spine and the base of the skull.

Therefore, the dispute over whether long heads or round heads are superior is meaningless, and all humans are evolving towards "rounder faces."

### A Casual Talk about Large Banknotes

— Ruyi

If we now advocate "issuing banknotes with a face value of 100 million yuan," I'm afraid many people would scold us for being ridiculous, right? However, in fact, there are not only single banknotes worth 100 million yuan of our national currency, but also banknotes worth more than 1 billion yuan each!

To put it bluntly, it's actually very simple. What I'm referring to is just a US dollar bill with a face value of $10,000. According to the US dollar benchmark price of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, isn't $10,000 equivalent to $1.195 billion in our national currency?

Of course, very few of these $10,000 US dollar bills circulate outside. In fact, many Americans don't even know that the Federal Reserve has printed such large-denomination banknotes. Most of these banknotes are stored in the vaults of the Federal Reserve, and their main purpose is for the US Treasury to make transfers, but despite "transferring" back and forth, the accounts are different, but those large banknotes often remain untouched in the same place.

However, a few years ago, a major fire suddenly broke out in the vault storing these large banknotes, and as a result, a small portion of the $10,000 banknotes were circulated to the public. Of course, it is quite difficult to exchange such a large-denomination banknote for smaller denominations, so the holders of these large banknotes were willing to devalue them automatically, and were satisfied with exchanging them for only $750.

You may say, "Isn't it too uneconomical to exchange a $10,000 banknote for only $750?" Not so. Even if you can only exchange it for $75, it's still a bargain, because after the fire, the government has declared those $10,000 banknotes circulating outside invalid.

Now, the famous US Federal Bureau of Investigation is heavily guarded. Whenever a $10,000 banknote appears, the holder is immediately summoned and forced to hand over all the $10,000 banknotes in their possession. Therefore, this type of $10,000 banknote has gradually disappeared.

You may even say, "What is $10,000 US dollars?" Well then, the US government not only owns so many of these $10,000 banknotes, but even the banknotes with a face value of $100,000 have already been printed! (You calculate: $100,000 US dollars, according to the official price, should be 11.95 billion yuan in our national currency.) This type of banknote is also exclusively for the use of the US government, but has never been circulated to the public. Therefore, the US dollars circulating outside still have the $10,000 denomination taking the lead.

In addition, $5,000 US dollar banknotes can also be seen, but not many have been issued, with only 2,500 circulating throughout the United States. According to the authorities of the Federal Reserve, the purpose of issuing banknotes with a face value of $5,000 is to "facilitate the public." But the general American public can't figure out how much "convenience" this large denomination can give them, because it is actually very "in"convenient to use. However, the all-knowing Federal Bureau of Investigation found an answer. They said that large denominations of more than $1,000 are actually signals indicating black market transactions. It can simply be said that "wherever there are large banknotes, there are abuses," because they can be hidden to evade income tax, and in case something goes wrong, large banknotes are also easy to "hide up your sleeve." Based on this opinion, the US Treasury Department has issued an order to all banks in the United States that customers who request to exchange large denominations must leave their name and address for future reference.

### Random Talk about Names

— Wang Baili

Ancient people's names had three characters, with rhymes that were the same: Tian Yannian (一先), Gao Aocao (四豪), Liu Youqiu (十一尤). (See Tea 余客话)

Ancient people had three-character style names: In the History of the Northern Dynasties, the twelve sons of Emperor Wen of the Zhou dynasty all had three-character style names, such as Emperor Xiaowu, style name Tuoluoni, and Emperor Wu, style name Miweitu. 湛国札记载 records: Zhang Tianxi, style name Gongchun Jia, Qifu Mumo, style name Anshiba.

Ancient people had "great names that hang in the universe," but little names (including nicknames) are not seen and are special: Cao Cao, nickname Jilin, also known as A'man. (A'man is very familiar, so it is not included, but its character is strange, so it is retained.) Tao Kan, nickname Xigou, Emperor Guangwu of the Han dynasty, nickname Hu. Lin Xiangru's name was Quanzi. Yu Xin's son was named Gou. Fan Weizong's nickname was Brick. Bai Xiangshan's nephew was named , and his daughter was named Luozi. Dongpo's grandson was named Chulao. Ziyou's son Yuan, nickname Hu'er. When Wang Anshi was born, the badger entered the delivery room, nickname Huanlang. Emperor Xiaozong of Song, nickname Yang. Zhu Xi, nickname Shenlang.

Names that are connected, in ancient times, there was Liang Taichang Cheng named Tang Yao, and Han Linwu Chang named Shun. Now there is also a councilor in this city named Chu Shun. Wenzhou has a lawyer named Xia Shang Zhou. As for the lawyer named Bao Ying in Nanjing before the war, it is even more wonderful.
