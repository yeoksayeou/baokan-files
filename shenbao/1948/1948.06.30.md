[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The first session of the First Legislative Yuan, by decision of the Yuan meeting on the 29th, has been extended again until July 20th, with the recess beginning on the 21st. During this period, the Yuan will concentrate all its efforts on handling the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year and other important bills urgently requiring resolution.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Legislative Yuan will hold a closed meeting on July 2nd to discuss the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year in installments. At that time, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Comptroller-General, and the Minister of Finance will all attend as required by Article 33 of the Budget Law to provide explanations. The national general budget was originally scheduled to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan on the 28th, but due to time constraints in printing and proofreading, it could not be issued as scheduled. Comptroller-General Xu Kan visited Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, on the afternoon of the 28th to explain the reason, stating that it would be submitted as soon as possible on the 29th. However, during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 29th, Secretary-General Zhang received telephone calls from Li Weiguo, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and Xu Kan, stating that the printing and proofreading of the general budget would take time and likely not be submitted to the Legislative Yuan until the morning of July 2nd. The meeting then decided to cancel the originally scheduled temporary secret meeting on the 1st and instead hold the scheduled meeting on the 2nd in secret to discuss the matter. At the same time, a temporary motion by Yin Shuxian and others was passed, stating that the review of the general budget should be absolutely confidential and that no related news should be reported before a decision is made, in order to show seriousness.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] During the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 29th, a temporary motion by Ma Chengfeng and others requested Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan to attend the afternoon meeting and report on whether there were any measures to stabilize prices, which sparked heated discussion. Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhijiang, Yu Xilai, Zhang Jinjian, Wang Dezhen, and others all spoke, emphasizing the severity of the current situation with the drastic depreciation of the legal tender and the soaring prices, but most did not advocate for engaging in further futile reports and reviews. The final resolution was to exchange views with Premier Weng, Minister of Finance Wang, and Central Bank President Yu on the issuance of legal tender and the control of prices.

### Premier Weng Visits the President: Presents Newly Drafted Measures to Stabilize Prices, Focusing on Controlling Financial Markets

It will be implemented after the President's approval. In drafting this plan, Premier Weng widely sought the opinions of experts and, in response to the special causes of the current price increases, proposed targeted solutions.

After these three cases were dealt with, the various discussion items listed on the original agenda were continued.

The resolution was submitted to the Finance and Economics, Economic Resources, Land Administration, and Overseas Chinese Affairs committees for joint review. The Foreign Affairs Committee replied to the review of the temporary motion by Li Yunliang and others, requesting the government to quickly adopt emergency measures to prevent all actions that promote Japanese military and economic power, and to be aware of the serious crisis that the American DeLay Plan may cause. After Liu Wendao, convener of the Foreign Affairs Committee, explained the reasons for the committee's resolution, the review opinion, "Temporary Retention," was passed. Song Shuqiao and others proposed that the organizational laws and regulations of various agencies should be completed within a time limit, and that agencies not established in accordance with the law should not be included in the budget and paid from the national treasury.

### Liu Wendao Explains Reasons for Retaining Anti-American and Pro-Japanese Case: The United States Did Not Propose the DeLay Plan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 29th, the review opinions of the Foreign Affairs Committee were accepted without objection, and it was resolved to "Temporarily Retain" the temporary motion on "Anti-American and Pro-Japanese" sentiments previously proposed by Li Yunliang. According to Liu Wendao, convener of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the reasons for the review were explained. Regarding the point in Li's original case about being alert to the serious crisis that the American DeLay Plan might cause, it was believed that (1) the legal basis of the Bao Lai Plan, passed by the Eleven Far Eastern Commission in September 1945, had never been shaken. (2) The Striker Plan and the DeLay Plan are still only plans, and the United States has not indicated that it will adopt them as national policies and submit them to the Far Eastern Commission. (3) We retain the veto power in the Far Eastern Commission, and we can insist on opposing and vetoing any opinions that are unfavorable to our country. The Legislative Yuan can certainly resolve to supervise and support the government, but there is absolutely no need for aimless emergency measures at present. As for preventing the resurgence of Japanese military and economic power, it is believed that (1) trade with Japan is unilateral, and Japanese ships are not allowed to carry goods to our country's ports. (2) Our country has never designated a protected fishing zone, and Japanese fishing boats fishing outside our territorial waters, those sunk or arrested, are still being dealt with. In short, we will never allow them to infringe upon our fishing rights. (3) We have obtained the most from the Japanese compensation amount, and it is not good to demand too much. (4) What facts there are about American support for Japan still need to be fully studied before they can be determined. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee decided to temporarily retain Li's case. Liu also said: Although Li's case has attracted domestic and foreign attention, recognizing American support for Japan and adding opposition, public opinion can express opinions, students can take action, but the Legislative Yuan must carefully judge and make a decision on this.

### Supervisory Yuan Passes Resolution to Appoint Members to Investigate the Truth About Prices: And Requests the Executive Yuan Again to Take Effective Measures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 13th meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 29th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the 12th meeting, Wang Guanwu first reported on the results of reviewing the Executive Yuan's reply to the corrective case on price stabilization (recorded in this newspaper on the 29th). Then, the members expressed their opinions separately. Some advocated immediately sending members to investigate the truth, and some advocated immediately forming a financial and economic committee to thoroughly study the matter. Then Mao Yiheng advocated that the objects of investigation in the review opinions should be Ping, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and that Guangzhou should be added to the city because Guangzhou is the base camp of South China. At the same time, national banks and production loans should also be investigated and opposed, because in general, they are "production loans in name, loans to wealthy families in reality." Chen Zhiming said that those who implement policies are those who manipulate policies. Combining the speeches of various members, there were no major discrepancies in the review opinions. Finally, Chen Darong made a suggestion, saying, (1) the Executive Yuan should be requested to take effective measures again, (2) the Yuan should continue to conduct a thorough investigation of the truth and submit it to the general assembly for review. Regarding the investigators, it is not necessary for the members to elect them, the President can appoint them, and they must keep it secret. After voting, Chen Darong's opinion was passed. Then, Tian Jiongjin reported on the experience of attending the Legislative Yuan Review Committee on the 28th, and reported that the Supervisory Law sent by the Supervisory Yuan to the Legislative Yuan had been submitted in the Legislative Yuan Review Committee, but because there was no legal basis for the Supervisory Yuan to submit legal cases to the Legislative Yuan, the review could not proceed. A compromise was then adopted, and it was submitted to the Legislative Yuan by Legislative Yuan members signing. Finally, the draft organizational regulations of the Supervisory Committee's Administrative Office were submitted for discussion. There was much discussion and disagreement about the term of office, native place, and number of members of the Administrative Office. Finally, some people believed that the draft had been discussed for several days without results and should be submitted to a vote immediately. After the chairman summarized several opinions and voted on them separately, the final decision was that there would be three members of the Administrative Office, and whether to avoid the native place of the members would not be a rigid requirement. Their term of office is one year and cannot be re-elected. The meeting adjourned at 12:30.

### Organizational Regulations of the Administrative Office: Supervisory Yuan Amends and Passes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Supervisory Yuan continued its 13th meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 29th to discuss the draft organizational regulations of the Supervisory Committee's Administrative Office.

After the break, Li Xuhuan proposed that Article 4 be deleted and stipulated in the detailed rules of procedure, which was approved by 51 out of 91 people present. Yang Shangdong proposed in Article 5 that a second item be added: "The chairman of the Administrative Office Committee meeting shall be held by the members in turn," which was also approved. There were not many amendments to Article 6 and below. Zhao Guangchen only proposed that Articles 11, 12, and 13 be merged into Article 10, and Article 14 be moved to the second item of Article 10, which was approved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] At the 13th meeting of the Supervisory Yuan on the afternoon of the 29th, President Yu Youren sincerely explained that the country's current financial difficulties make it difficult to appoint the staff that should be allocated to the Supervisory Yuan's various committees and administrative offices at one time, and that the administrative offices may not be established at the same time, and several regions must be selected first for establishment based on factual needs.

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 29th] Students from Beiping Normal College went to Beijing to petition today and were blocked, and they decided to wait for a reply from the Ministry of Education within three days before taking further action. Students gathered at Xushi this morning, and except for the fourth grade who should take the graduation exam, they were all prepared to leave.

The situation was extremely tense for a time, with pushing and shoving. After more than ten minutes, the students were finally pushed back into the school gate by the superior 营宪.

### Editorial: Freedom from Fear in Academia

—Another Word for Professors and Students of Chen Xue University—

In August 1941, the late U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill issued a joint declaration, first mentioning the need to strive for all mankind to enjoy "freedom from want and freedom from fear." The United Nations Declaration of January of the following year also accepted this principle. Roosevelt continued to emphasize in later broadcasts on the ideals of the post-war world "freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear." Freedom of speech and belief is an old tradition of democratic ideals, "freedom from want" became more important after the climax of the Industrial Revolution and capitalism, and "freedom from fear" can be said to be the spiritual freedom that people increasingly feel the urgent need for in the growth of modern totalitarianism and new aggression.

In today's world and today's China, we are particularly fearful of whether a third world war that will destroy peace will come early, and we are already suffering from the military threat and fear of the communist bandits' rebellion. Within the walls of universities and colleges that study advanced academics, honest professors and studious students are particularly subject to a special kind of terrible spiritual threat: what they feel more deeply painful than the difficulties of life is the spiritual loss of "freedom from fear"! In the rapid series of activities and tense atmosphere of some students staging "wall posters," "meetings," "elections," "strikes," and "parades," they have lost the freedom to teach and the freedom to learn; in the suffocating atmosphere of not daring to express their opinions directly, they still have to immerse themselves in worries about "not being able to attend classes" and the terror of accumulating a bad reputation or disaster because of dissent!

Roosevelt's tomb is covered with grass, but his last words are still in our ears. The blood of our soldiers and civilians in the War of Resistance has dried, but justice has not been extinguished. University teachers and students who admire the truth, reminiscing about the shout of freedom that was advocated seven years ago, and recalling the past scene of stability and progress in our schools ten years ago, should not be overwhelmed by the feeling of human affairs vicissitudes and the fear of cultural and educational shrinkage!

We do not often comment on the student unrest that has been fluctuating for the past six months, and when we do, we only criticize the misguided and harmful behavior of strikes, and call on professors not to sit idly by, and hope that teachers and students can use reason to express the opinions of the majority, in order to regain social sympathy. Now we would like to point out how the majority of university teachers and students are trapped in confusion and fear based on the situation of several universities in the past month, for the discussion and reflection of our professors and students who are loyal to their work.

In the midst of the confrontation between the two major international blocs, and the increasingly fierce Cold War, all mankind is suffering from the threat of war. However, although people cannot enjoy the freedom of being completely free from the fear of war, all countries, from top to bottom, must be able to use their wisdom to postpone the disaster of war because the wounds have not yet recovered. In China, the more direct fear comes from the persecution of the Communist Party. In addition to the accumulated actions of the bandit army, this persecution is taking different forms, infiltrating various departments like bacteria, so we have witnessed Chinese higher education being trapped in turbulence, unease, and the un-freedom of fear, which has become increasingly intense in the past year and a half.

The university is a cultural center for free research and free lectures, "reason should reign over everything" (quoting Plato). This is the tradition of Western universities, and also the spirit of Confucianism in establishing education. In academia, scholars may not all be able to obtain "freedom from want" (the ancients had the saying "worry about the way, not worry about poverty", and even modern scientists devote themselves to the study of "utilizing and enriching life", not for their own food and clothing), but they must be able to strive for "freedom from fear." For the sake of this freedom, countless men of virtue have sacrificed their lives: from Socrates' execution, Bruno's persecution, and the martyrdom of many scholars in China's party disasters and changes of dynasties, all are examples. The May Fourth Movement freed us from the remaining shackles of the old era. Respecting reason and trusting in freedom are the true traditions of the May Fourth Movement, and of course, we must also reject "dogma" and the fear that persecutes people's freedom of will. Everyone has freedom, without infringing on the freedom of others, this is the basic meaning of democracy! Fully develop reason, without using any fear of violence, this is the true spirit of the university!

But what has become of the universities and colleges in China in the past year! We cannot bear to look back on the past, we only need to close our eyes and think about the student unrest that has been constantly staged in the past month, using strikes and other means of coercion. We can’t enumerate all of them - such as the fights and boycotts caused by exhibitions at Shanghai Law School and St. John's University, the beating of the Youth Corps by some students of the three universities in Nanjing, such as Zhejiang University’s pursuit of the president to withdraw the order to expel students, Jiangxi Zhongzheng University’s asking for public funds, South Teachers College’s rejection of the president, Zhejiang Yingda’s smashing of Jinzhong, and even the recent sudden request for nationalization of Shanghai Guanghua University and Daxia University on the eve of the final exam, ... almost making society suspect that the university is not a place to study academics, but just an old center for seeking materials to oppose the government, making the country's education and culture constantly regress. Taking Jiaotong University as an example, Jiaotong University has been too unstable, too little progress, and too lost social inquiry and credibility in the past year. Fortunately, the June 5th parade did not expand. The municipal authorities sternly questioned President Cheng Xiaogang. The students who manipulated the student union skillfully coerced President Cheng, causing President Cheng to resign in this situation of losing "freedom of will." Before leaving, he also gave the students an earnest warning. The newspapers in the capital have criticized him too severely, or said that he protected the vocational students who answered the country's questions, or said that his method of "guiding with virtue" had failed completely, and even criticized his words as "close to the tone of the concession authorities." But when we think about President Cheng's situation and trace his intentions, we simply feel a little unbearable to deeply blame this president who has the intention to do good, but cannot firmly run the school in this environment. His mood and actions are almost involuntary in the loss of "freedom from fear". The so-called "student union not only leads autonomy from Song, but also first destroys and obstructs the school's maintenance of order", the so-called intention to dissolve the student union but finally failed, wanting to vomit but holding it back, the head of a school is like this, the atmosphere in the school is even more imaginable how it suppresses the majority of pure professors and scattered and docile students.

An unbiased observation can also make it clear that a small number of vocational students with special backgrounds who are good at controlling and manipulating have entered the famous universities in the country, creating an atmosphere of fear and threat, and playing a role in destroying order and harming the country. Some of these vocational students return from studying abroad and still go to university to enter the second or third grade, and some graduate from university and still go back to middle school to attend classes. If there is no other intention, why do they do this? The ways they create fear are: first, using false democracy, leading elections, so-called public opinion surveys, using the lack of organization and indifferent onlookers of the majority to carry out their core operations and achieve their goals of manipulating groups. The second is violence, which is used when necessary to coerce a part of the students who dare to speak and dare to dissent. The third is the abuse and satire in propaganda techniques. For professors who are relatively close to the government, no matter how high their academic reputation is, they will use all methods to denigrate them, preferably making them retreat in the face of difficulties, or at least not allowing them to have a position to speak in the school; for students who are strong and have a sense of justice, they will try to dissuade them from being the target of public criticism and dare not do good; for those who love vanity and fear bad names, they will either wrap them in the beautiful name of freedom and democracy, or spend them with the exposure of the country's special reaction; to further sneak in and include new members and give them special training, they will coordinate the methods of street racing. In addition, they will also use the unrest in current affairs and the economy to find every problem to emphasize the government's incompetence and fully alienate the centripetal force of the middle class towards the country. In today's distorted changes in national affairs and the economy, the intellectual cultivation of professors and scholars is not easy to be very strong, and students' intellectual training is even more insufficient, so teachers who cherish themselves fear the bad name of "stubborn and corrupt elements"; students who are generally unclear about reason and are timid because of no organization are even more threatened by the double threat of vicious comments and violence. If we want to understand how a small number of vocational students can exert great power in schools and make every student unrest seem to be a unified demand, its main operation is probably like this.

We never want to dogmatically say that all student unrest is directed by communist vocational students and ignore the internal unhealthy factors of the school, nor can we ignore the general political and economic unrest and contradictions of today. However, we must point out that the atmosphere in most schools today has such a strange and bizarre threat, making most students dare to be angry but dare not speak out, making some students be deceived and instigated and unconsciously shout with them, making some teaching assistants and lecturers also use core operation methods as their periphery, making most professors have some powers of precept and remain silent, or speak out in anger but also have no effect, and finally making the president fall into isolation, and even being intimidated by their unreasonable demands. The school cannot be stable, the interruption of studies is intermittent, the level is getting worse, the academics are regressing, and the largest expenditure of the national cultural and educational budget is almost completely equal to a waste!

To break this atmosphere of fear, restore the dignity of the majority of professors in lecturing, and protect the rights of the vast majority of students to study and the progress of national academic education, we believe that professors with intellectual cultivation and the majority of students who love themselves and love the country must stand up firmly, discuss together, and exert the organized moral force, which is by no means something that the educational administration or local political and police authorities can solve on their behalf. Only by breaking the terror threat in schools and restoring "freedom from fear" in universities can we realize the mission of higher education in our nation's suppression of chaos and nation-building.

### Forceful Japanese Rectification Work

— Wu Jiatang

No matter how ambitious a Japanese person is today, whether they have a future depends on their wartime conduct and whether the Allied Supreme Commander can trust them. This is because the rectification work in Japan is being carried out with considerable seriousness. In my previous article, I mentioned the third invisible atomic bomb that is changing Japan's political, social, and economic structure, and the main power of this slow-motion explosion comes from this rectification work.

When Allied Supreme Commander officials talk about the rectification work to outsiders, they emphasize that this work is not punitive but preventive. I am ashamed of my lack of research into these theoretical issues, but it is clear from the implementation process of the rectification work that there is a lack of retaliatory behavior. In Japan, the word "rectification" is indeed different from the collective purges and brutal killings in some countries. Therefore, some people who advocate revenge accuse the Allied Supreme Commander's policies of being too lenient. These people who like bloodshed believe that to rectify, the purged elements should simply be lined up and shot. They do not believe that there are other ways to eliminate political enemies besides bloodshed. However, the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan did not take this path. The bloodless methods they use may take more time, but they can achieve the expected results. At the same time, this kind of orderly plan can prevent a political disturbance, otherwise, if chaos occurs, it will only benefit the Japanese Communist Party.

The historical basis of the Japanese rectification work can be traced back to the Potsdam Declaration and the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Allied Supreme Commander. The latter instructed the Allied Supreme Commander to remove "all past militarists and aggressors, or powerful members of patriotic terrorist groups, so that they can no longer hold public office or important positions in enterprises." In addition, those who were active in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association or who showed hostility to the goals of the Allied occupation must be subject to the same restrictions. Based on this instruction, the Allied Supreme Commander issued the famous January 4th Directive on January 4, 1946, ordering the Japanese government to remove militarists and aggressors from government agencies, including the following categories: (1) war criminals, (2) professional army and navy personnel, special higher police and army department officials, including army and navy generals, military councilors of the Grand Marshal's Office, Privy Council, senior personnel of the army and navy departments, and all officers and soldiers who participated in army, navy, police, or intelligence work, (3) powerful members of secret patriotic terrorist groups, (4) powerful figures of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and the Asia Patriotic Association and its affiliates, (5) officials of national policy companies related to Japan's external strategy, including the directors, presidents, vice presidents, advisors, and managers of branch offices in occupied areas from the "July 7th Incident" to September 2, 1945, (6) governors of occupied areas, including all civil and military officials of Japan's wartime colonial empire, (7) all military remnants and extreme nationalists. Once the directive was issued, the Japanese government established an agency on February 27, 1946, to implement the instruction. The Japanese government also issued orders specifying who could be used and who should be rejected, and finally explained how the screening work should be completed.

Under this law, all middle and lower-level officials, as well as companies and groups under government control, and all personnel preparing to participate in elections and public agencies, underwent screening procedures to determine their eligibility. At the same time, based on the broad provisions of the seventh category, the Japanese government announced a list of all the highest-ranking officials in Japan who had decision-making power during the period from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to the Japanese surrender, attached with high-ranking officials of secondary status, and prepared to purge a group of officials whose crimes were obvious, including the following categories: (1) signing treaties with Axis countries or puppet countries to prepare for the so-called "Greater East Asia War," (2) suppressing anti-militarists, (3) concluding economic agreements with occupied countries, (4) planning financial and production plans for Japanese military activities. As a result, 183,000 professional army and navy officers and personnel of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and its secret patriotic groups were permanently disqualified from holding office. At the same time, due to the Japanese government's interpretation of the Allied Supreme Commander's directive, members of the House of Representatives who had been recommended by the Tojo government to participate in past elections were not allowed to participate in public affairs.

As the initial rectification work rapidly developed, the Allied Supreme Commander issued another statement in August 1946, expanding the scope of the purge from the top to the bottom, extending to the fields of journalism, art, and science. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander stipulated that those who were not included in the first directive were also not allowed to participate in the upper and lower houses of the National Diet and local assemblies, and those who were rectified were no longer allowed to work in political and economic organizations.

According to the Allied Supreme Commander's proclamation, the Japanese government allocated a new standard for screening and dismissal, with broad content, including all positions in the central and local governments, staff in many companies, and editors-in-chief, chief writers, and reporters of newspapers and magazines. This law punished the following types of people: (1) instigating war, (2) suppressing anti-war elements, (3) advocating dictatorial systems, (4) controlling speech, (5) implementing political manipulation and economic exploitation in occupied areas, (6) promoting important plans for wartime mobilization. This law involved a large number of writers and artists who advocated for aggressive ideology. Those who were purged were those who established theoretical and ideological foundations for policies such as "Greater East Asiaism" and the "New Order in East Asia" through their political or philosophical theories. In addition, powerful national policy companies and their large companies were also rectified from top to bottom. At the same time, another intention of this law was to allow more new people to appear on the government stage, so it was stipulated that mayors, deputy mayors, and district chiefs who held office from September 1, 1945, to September 1, 1946, could not participate in any elections within the next four years. As the rectification work gradually progressed, the issue began to touch on so-called "invisible war criminals," referring to Japanese who participated in political activities but did not fall into the above categories. This group was also individually nominated by the Japanese government and gradually rectified. Due to the wide scope of the rectification, some people said that the elements who were excluded from the government had turned to underground activities. When I was in Tokyo, I tried to study whether there was a powerful underground government in existence. I sought information from various sources, including several well-informed and reliable journalists, but none of them could tell me for sure that there was such a planned and organized underground organization in Japan at present. Based on the evidence collected by the author, it is impossible to prove that there is a so-called underground movement. If there is one, it probably refers to the secret activities led by the Japanese Communist Party.

### Four Leaders of Yugoslavia Fall Out with the Soviet Union Internal Split Revealed Behind the Iron Curtain Marshal Tito May Be Under Surveillance Yugoslav Government to Issue Statement Responding to Comintern Condemnation

[Our dispatch] London, 29th – The official Yugoslav news agency reports that the Yugoslav government's statement regarding the Comintern Information Bureau is expected to be released around 6 PM today.

[United Press London, 29th] The Italian radio station's report that Yugoslavia has declared martial law nationwide has been denied by Belgrade. Meanwhile, American diplomatic sources say the Soviet Union may create a pretext to send troops into Yugoslavia.

[Reuters Washington, 28th] Diplomats with extensive experience believe that the Comintern's public condemnation of Marshal Tito indicates that Tito has been "placed under surveillance" and is no longer the active leader of Belgrade. Two points can be determined: (1) the communist leadership will now have to deal with the first major split in the Eastern European bloc; (2) the communist leadership must have taken action before publicly condemning, as communist parties inside and outside the Soviet Union have invariably taken this approach when implementing purges for many years.

[Reuters London, 28th] Moscow's declaration through the Comintern Information Bureau is actually a call for the Yugoslav people to revolt against their government and leaders. The Comintern's call for loyal members of the Yugoslav Communist Party to replace their leaders is effectively ordering them to take direct action against the government. The four Yugoslav communist leaders most severely condemned by the Comintern Information Bureau – Marshal Tito, Rankovic, Djilas, and Kardelj – are the figures who control Yugoslavia today. Tito, as a hero of the resistance war and Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, will certainly gain the loyalty of most of the Yugoslav standing army. Rankovic, as Minister of the Interior, controls the national police, including the highly effective political police. Kardelj, regarded as Tito's brain during the resistance war, is the soul of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and is the main guide of Yugoslav foreign policy. Foreign Minister Simic, who participated in the Warsaw Conference last week, is merely a figurehead. As for Minister without Portfolio Djilas, he is an explosive and powerful figure in the Tito system, and also a hero of the resistance war, with close ties to the army. Therefore, the condemned Yugoslav communist leaders are actually the nerve center of Yugoslavia. Without direct intervention from external powers, it is not known how the so-called loyal comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party can replace these four leaders. Relevant sources also believe that Marshal Tito, as a hero of the resistance war, leads post-war Yugoslavia, so non-communist elements in the country also have a good impression of him. The Comintern's condemnation of Tito is tantamount to regarding Tito as a defender of Yugoslav independence against Moscow's interference, which will inevitably increase the Yugoslav people's goodwill towards Tito.

### Different Perceptions in Various Countries Regarding the Yugoslav Incident Believed to Accelerate the Completion of the Austrian Peace Treaty and Early Resolution of the Trieste Issue

[Reuters London, 29th] It is reported that the Yugoslav government will issue a statement on the 30th, responding to the Comintern Information Bureau's accusations against the Yugoslav Communist Party and its leaders. Communist members of parliament in Paris are keeping silent, but right-wing elements believe that the expulsion of the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders from the Comintern Information Bureau is a reassuring phenomenon for Western countries and a lesson that Eastern European countries should be wary of. People in Rome are very excited about this news, and expect Yugoslavia to become closer to Italy and resolve all outstanding issues between the two countries.

People in London also believe that Tito's break with Moscow may lead to a resolution of the Trieste issue, accelerate the completion of the Austrian peace treaty, reduce communist oppression of Greece, and that the split behind the Iron Curtain will prevent the Soviet Union from going to war with Western countries over the Berlin crisis.

[United Press Lake Success, 29th] United Nations officials are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tito incident, believing that more information is needed to understand the full picture. However, many people share the attitude of officials in Washington and London, believing that the Soviet Union must have been confident of controlling Yugoslavia before announcing the split.

### Views of Our Political Figures

[United Press Nanjing, 29th] Senior political circles expressed excitement over Yugoslavia's exclusion from the Soviet Union's satellite sphere, considering it a major victory for Western countries, but some observers warned against excessive optimism. Some predict that the Soviet Union will intensify its suppression of other satellite countries, and may simultaneously re-apply large-scale pressure on East Asia. Others said that this may be an "apparently important but actually worthless discovery," and that "any gift from the Communist Party must be carefully considered for its goodness." He also said, "This news is too good to be true."

However, the unanimous opinion is that the Soviet Union has lost its main European stronghold, thus greatly reducing Stalin's strength. Some even said that the main bases of the Soviet Union's cold war strategy in the future will be Trieste, Greece, and Italy. Another senior Kuomintang official said that the Soviet Union's expansionism has clashed with the nationalism of its satellite countries, and that the differences between them are irreconcilable. The Balkan countries are mainly agricultural countries, and they really hope to cooperate with the industrial countries of Western Europe, even though they and the Soviet Union belong to the same Slavic nation. The Marshall Plan has given the Soviet Union's satellite countries great enticement and is becoming unstable. The same events may become clear with the passage of time, but the Soviet Union will undoubtedly "nail rivets on its Iron Curtain."

### US Ambassador to Yugoslavia Returns Home for Consultation

[United Press Lisbon, 28th] The US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Cannon, arrived in Lisbon on the 28th and will return to the United States from here to report on the Danube River Conference and the internal situation in Yugoslavia.

[French News Agency Washington, 28th] The authorities do not want to rush to criticize the Comintern Information Bureau's resolution condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party until they receive information from the US representatives in Eastern Europe.

### The Situation in Berlin Is Gradually Improving The Soviet Union Has Lifted the Blockade of East-West Transportation Air Transport Continues, and There Is No Shortage of Food in the Western Sectors

[United Press Berlin, 29th] The Soviet military authorities announced this morning that the blockade of transportation between the eastern and western parts of Germany has been lifted, but the railway blockade of the western sectors of Berlin will not be lifted for some time. The reason is that the Herstel-Berlin line is still under repair and will take some time to complete.

[Reuters Berlin, 29th] The Western powers are transporting food to Berlin by air and waterway, which is expected to invalidate the Soviet Union's blockade of the western sectors of Berlin. Forty four-engine giant planes, each capable of carrying seven tons of cargo, have joined the British two-engine transport planes starting today to transport food between Berlin and West Germany. Another 23 cargo ships are expected to arrive in Berlin from Hamburg today. The German News Agency, registered with the Soviet Union, also said that German passengers between East and West Germany, who hold transit permits, can travel freely, but railway traffic will not be restored for the time being.

### Important British and American Officials Active in Berlin

[Reuters Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall said: The signing of bilateral agreements with the sixteen European countries indicates that the European Recovery Program has taken another step forward. The success of this plan depends on the determination of the European people to cooperate together to complete the recovery.

The basic provisions of the bilateral agreements are the points that European countries deem necessary to complete the recovery. Since the Paris Conference last summer, cooperation among European countries has improved significantly. If the countries concerned continue to cooperate and work hard under these conditions, the European Recovery Program will surely be successful.

### Comintern Information Bureau Declaration Severely Condemns Yugoslav Leaders Accuses Policies of Violating Leninism and Marxism

[Reuters Prague, 28th] The communist newspaper "People's Rights" recently published the Comintern Information Bureau's communiqué after its recent meeting in Romania, which is virtually equivalent to expelling Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito from the party and calling on loyal comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party to replace their leaders. The communiqué accuses the Yugoslav Communist Party, led by Tito, of tacitly acknowledging the threat of capitalist countries to Yugoslav independence under Soviet policy, engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda, adopting a dangerous attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party, and distrusting Soviet experts in Yugoslavia, even monitoring their actions with security police. Therefore, the Comintern Information Bureau confirms that the Yugoslav Communist Party has adopted erroneous policies that deviate from Marxism and Leninism, deviate from unified socialist policies, and move toward betraying the international solidarity of the working class. It acknowledges that the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's exposure of the erroneous policies of the Yugoslav Communist Party Central Committee, especially the two leaders Tito and Kardelj, is indeed true. The communiqué said that the Yugoslav communist leaders have begun to adopt an attitude that regards the Soviet Union as a persecutor, repeatedly slandering the Soviet Communist Party and Soviet leaders. Their anti-Soviet attitude is unprecedented, and the leadership of Eastern European countries has already felt threatened. Internal divisions have already occurred within the Yugoslav Communist Party, but domestic and foreign people have repeatedly criticized the Yugoslav Communist Party, and the Yugoslav Communist Party has retaliated against critics with the most brutal measures. The simplest rights of party members have been denied, and expulsions and arrests have occurred repeatedly. In addition, unreasonable laws have been promulgated to nationalize small shops and organize self-cultivating farmers rashly. These measures, without preparation, are implemented rashly by administrative orders, which will inevitably cause serious consequences. The Bureau confirms that the anti-party and anti-Soviet opinions and actions of the Yugoslav communist leaders, and their refusal to attend this meeting of the Bureau, have deviated from the unified anti-imperialist socialist front and moved toward betraying the international solidarity of the working class. The Bureau hereby solemnly announces that the Yugoslav Communist Party Central Committee has therefore separated itself and the Yugoslav Communist Party from the Communist Party family and withdrawn from the Communist Unified Front and the Comintern Information Bureau. The Bureau believes that this is due to the fact that the hidden nationalists within the Yugoslav Communist Party in the past five or six months have openly interfered in the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party. The Yugoslav communist leaders have overestimated their country's strength, mistakenly believing that they can establish their socialism without the support of the Soviet Union and other communist parties. They are intimidated by imperialists, believing that they can lean toward capitalism and win the favor of imperialists, and reach an agreement on Yugoslav independence. They tacitly accept bourgeois nationalism, believing that the threat of capitalist countries to Yugoslav independence is still below that of the Soviet Union. The Bureau believes that there must be a considerable number of believers in Yugoslavia who are loyal to Marxism and Leninism and can force their leaders to correct their policies and return to the path of internationalism. Otherwise, these leaders must be replaced, and it is believed that the Communist Party will be able to fulfill this glorious task.

### Melting and Selling Gold Bars, Manipulating the Black Market: Authorities Crack Down on Major Organization; Mastermind Released on Bail the Same Night After Arrest

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, this city cracked down on a shocking black market gold and currency operation. The mastermind behind this operation not only had the power to manipulate the city's entire black market for gold and currency, but also brazenly claimed to have close relationships with several high-ranking officials. The organization was equipped with its own furnace, masquerading as several major gold firms by counterfeiting their marks and secretly adding impurities to produce "pure gold" that was not of sufficient purity. Over the past three months, countless people have fallen victim. Recently, the city's highest public security authority learned of the above situation and, in a swift and decisive action yesterday, joined forces with relevant authorities to investigate and crack down on the operation. The organization was located at 331 Jiangxi Road Central, originally the Jitai Silver Firm, now renamed the Jitai Yarn Firm, and the mastermind was Hu Xinyi. It is reported that after the authorities announced the strengthening of the crackdown on black market gold and currency transactions, Hu immediately went into action, establishing a relationship with personnel from a certain organization. He then used this relationship to flaunt his influence and, in the furnace on the third floor of the firm, secretly added impurities to gold bars collected from the black market to reduce their purity. He then re-melted them into bars and sold them in a roundabout way. Every day, hundreds of gold bars melted and manufactured by him flowed out through the black market. For every bar sold, he could earn a net profit of one tael of gold from the impurity. By secretly operating in this way, he accumulated countless wealth. However, after being arrested, Hu vehemently denied any criminal activity. After questioning, the investigating authority released him on bail the same night, pending further investigation and verification.

### Military and Police Authorities Take Further Steps to Suppress Prices With All Efforts

(2) A deadline will be set for the investigation and clear identification of all black market gold and currency traders and hoarding profiteers in each jurisdiction, so that they can be severely punished at any time. (3) Inspections of warehouses will be strengthened. If any suspected hoarding is discovered, its source must be investigated. Once verified, leniency will not be granted.

[Another Report] The Municipal Police Bureau convened an important temporary meeting yesterday morning in the bureau's conference room, attended by heads of police precincts and above, to discuss measures to suppress prices. Songhu Garrison Commander Yi Tiewu also attended and delivered a speech. Commander Xuan first made a profound analysis of the domestic situation, and then pointed out the seriousness of the current price problem. He stated that the solution to this problem is no longer suitable for the general measures of the past, and that from now on, extremely severe measures should be taken to deal with speculative profiteers in order to achieve effective results. Commander Xuan subsequently gave a similar speech at the garrison headquarters to all officers, in order to encourage them.

### Steamships Universally Increase Freight Rates, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Implement Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The National Steamship Joint Association has decided to universally increase passenger and freight rates for Yangtze River and coastal steamships by 80%.

For transit goods, the increase from Shanghai to Hankou is 2.5 million per ton, and from Hankou to Yichang, 1.1 million. Bulky goods will be subject to an additional 80%.

### Oil Supply of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Fears Not Resolved

A person in charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company said: After the last suspension of navigation, the company was able to barely maintain operations due to the supply of 5,11 tons from Mobil Oil Company. However, the company's monthly oil consumption is at least around 15,000 tons, and 5,000 tons can only last for about ten days. By the end of this month, the oil reserves will be completely exhausted. Because of the difficulty in purchasing oil domestically, the company recently chartered a ship to purchase and transport 15,000 tons from the Texas Shanta Company in the Persian Gulf. However, based on the estimated voyage, it will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until early August. Therefore, the company has no oil source for the entire month of July.

### Soldier's Association Decides to Provide Additional Subsidies for Second Phase of New Soldiers' Family Allowances

The City Soldiers' Association held its tenth regular meeting yesterday.

Recently, new soldiers have requested that in-kind goods be distributed for the second phase of family allowances, which has further strained the supply of family allowances. During yesterday's meeting, it was decided after discussion: (1) An additional subsidy will be provided when issuing the second phase of family allowances. The specific amount will be discussed further. (2) The ninth regular meeting had decided to issue the family allowances for July based on the price of rice in June. After discussion, it was decided to change this and issue them based on the price of rice in July. (3) Only 30% of the family allowances for new soldiers in May and June have been collected so far, which is insufficient for distribution. The matter will be discussed further at the next meeting.

### Municipal Assembly Scheduled to Adjourn Today; Yesterday Passed Resolution Adjusting Municipal Construction Tax Rate on Motor Vehicles; Also Universally Levying Taxes on Non-Motor Vehicles

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sixth session of the Municipal Assembly held its sixth meeting yesterday. More than one hundred proposals were scheduled for deliberation, but only a small portion of the proposals from the Social Affairs Committee and the Mayor and Speaker were discussed. It was impossible to adjourn as scheduled yesterday. The Assembly passed a motion to extend the meeting by one day. Before adjourning, the Assembly passed a temporary motion by Chen Baotai and 28 others, "Requesting the Municipal Government to strictly prohibit the use of false pretenses, impersonating public opinion, and gathering crowds to petition, in order to quell the source of unrest." The measures are: (1) Each petition group must strictly adhere to the central government's regulations, and the number of representatives sent during the petition must not exceed ten. (2) Each petition representative must carry a national identity card, a professional certificate, and a certificate from a professional organization.

(2) In order to cooperate with the needs of price and road engineering, it is proposed to adjust the municipal construction tax rate on motor vehicles and universally levy taxes on non-motor vehicles to benefit municipal construction. Resolution: The adjustment of tax rates was approved, and all motorized and non-motorized vehicles (rickshaws, small carts, and manure carts will be exempted for the time being) will be taxed, starting in July 1948.

### Designating Three Areas as Category C Areas, Factory Location Regulations Revised

Of the eleven cases submitted by the Speaker, only three were discussed and completed yesterday. Regarding the nine items related to military service raised by the telegram from the Ministry of National Defense, it was decided to combine the proposed answers by the Autonomous Committee with the supplementary opinions of Lu Yinchu and Xie Dahuang to form a reply. Regarding the case proposed by the Public Works Bureau to temporarily designate three areas in Shanghai, namely the Hubai Dachang District, the Huxi Pusong District, and the Hudong Pudong District, as Category C areas before the cremation system becomes widespread, it was resolved to pass the case as is. However, existing Category C buildings that are not within the designated areas should be relocated as much as possible, and no further construction should be allowed. Regarding the regulations on the location of factories in this city, in order to take into account the difficulty of relocating factories that have already been established on a considerable scale in non-factory areas, the regulations are revised as follows: In the "Shanghai Measures for Dealing with Factories Already Established in Non-Factory Areas within the Built-up Area," the following article is added after Article 12: "Category A or Category B factories or workshops already established in non-factory areas, that have obtained construction permits and are still in operation, if their boundaries retain sufficient open space around them (accounting for 30% or more of the total base area) or firewalls to isolate them from neighboring properties, and have been re-examined and approved or ordered to improve in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, may be temporarily allowed to remain and expand appropriately within their original boundaries."

(2) It was passed to request the Executive Yuan to immediately strengthen the control of daily necessities and implement full rationing in major cities to ensure the livelihood of the people. (3) Five measures to improve the city's food policy ultimately considered that Chairman Ren of the People's Mediation Committee has made the greatest efforts in the city's food administration and should be given sympathy.

(5) It was passed to request the Municipal Government to take effective measures to suppress prices to ensure the livelihood of the people. (6) It was passed that the Assembly telegraph to the Executive Yuan, ordering the China Trust Bureau to stop bidding for Japanese woolen goods.

### China Textile Workers Initiate "Seizing Food Movement," Clearly Being Used by Others; Authorities Strengthen Prevention

Shanghai News: A portion of workers at the No. 17 China Textile Factory, citing soaring prices and the inability to maintain a living, recently gathered more than ten workers from the factory and initiated a "Seizing Food Movement." On the morning of that day, this group of workers planned to launch their first seizing food movement during lunch. However, because the plan was not kept secret, the factory learned of it and took precautions, resulting in the failure of the movement. At midnight that night, when the staff and machine foremen were eating their midnight meal, the group of workers once again took the opportunity to rush in to seize food. Fortunately, they were prepared, and the attempt was still unsuccessful. However, they seized all of the staff's meat and vegetables. On the 27th, the workers again used the "Seizing Food Movement" as a threat, demanding that the machine foremen make five demands to the factory on their behalf: (1) Each person to borrow 500,000 yuan; (2) To provide each worker with two dou of white rice per month, according to the treatment of private factories; (3) To require the factory to provide a meal at a fixed time; (4) Each person to receive a general wage increase of three jiao; (5) Each person to be issued a set of work clothes. However, when Factory Director Yang convened a meeting of machine foremen and department heads of the factory on the 28th, the machine foremen did not raise the workers' five demands. Seeing that their goal was not achieved, the workers gathered more than a hundred workers when the machine foremen were having dinner at noon on the same day, and prevented the machine foremen from having dinner as a demonstration. They also contacted workers from other factories to expand the movement. Currently, various China Textile factories are brewing similar movements, including the No. 3 China Textile Factory, the No. 4 China Textile Factory, the No. 10 China Textile Factory, the No. 12 China Textile Factory, the No. 14 China Textile Factory, and the No. 19 China Textile Factory. The situation is quite serious. In addition, at 10 am yesterday, more than two hundred workers at the No. 1 Needle and Thread Factory of China Textile in Hudong also attempted to launch the "Seizing Food Movement." The factory learned of this and, fearing that the situation would escalate, telegraphed the Yangshupu Police Bureau to dispatch a large number of police officers to the factory to prevent the incident. No accidents occurred.

Relevant authorities believe that this type of illegal movement affects public safety, and that the initiators of this incident are only a portion of the workers. Therefore, it is clear that some workers are being incited and manipulated by bandits. In addition to paying close attention to prevention to avoid escalating the situation, they have also placed the leaders of the movement under surveillance. Therefore, the situation is expected to be calmed down in the near future.

### Demanding Price Increase, Last Resort; Western Film Distributors Stop Supplying New Films; Cinema Industry to Hold Emergency Meeting Today; May Negotiate to Show Latest Domestic Films to Overcome the "Crisis"

[Our Newspaper's Report] The nine Western film distributors in the city, dissatisfied with the current low ticket prices of various cinemas and the failure of previous requests for adjustments, have resolutely stopped supplying new films since the day before yesterday. In the past month, the internal problems of the cinema industry have been numerous. Currently, the situation is becoming more complicated due to the cessation of new films by Western film distributors. On the Social Affairs Bureau's side, it is believed that the cinema industry association must be in collusion with the Western film distributors, resulting in repeated unreasonable demands. On the Western film distributors' side, it is consistently believed that the cinema industry association maintains a tacit understanding with the Social Affairs Bureau, so they deliberately create difficulties for their every request. At the same time, the second, third, and fourth-run cinemas are also disgusted with the association, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the first-run cinemas because their opposition to the low price limit for the first run failed. However, the first-run cinemas also have many grievances. They have never wanted to implement price increases based on the standards of Western film distributors to increase their own operating income. However, on the one hand, it is difficult to expect approval from the authorities, and on the other hand, they are also concerned about whether excessively high ticket prices can be welcomed by the audience. Therefore, in the case of hesitation and hesitation on all sides, the Western film distributors chose the last resort, stopping the supply of new films to protest. It is said that before this matter was declared a breakdown, someone proposed that, in addition to the minimum price limit, the ticket prices of first-run cinemas may be stipulated flexibly, with a base price of five jiao calculated based on the cost of living index every half month, in order to seek a permanent solution. However, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that it would not consider this matter, and the Western film distributors also stated that they could not be satisfied with this figure. Currently, in order to break the deadlock, the cinema industry association has decided to hold an emergency meeting this afternoon and invite all relevant parties to participate in the discussion to find a more reasonable solution. Before a concrete solution is obtained that satisfies the Social Affairs Bureau and the Western film distributors, the new films previewed by the city's first-run cinemas will not be released. However, they are prepared to negotiate with domestic film distributors to show the latest domestic films when the seat sales of old films are low, in order to overcome this period of lean times.

### Zhejiang Natives in Shanghai Hold Reception for Chen Yi

### Labor-Management Dispute in Tea Industry, Supplementary Measures Agreed to Resolve

[Our Newspaper's Report] The employees of tea shops in this city had previously had a dispute over their salaries. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management to mediate. Because the previous record was a flexible regulation that was prone to disputes, the two sides agreed to revise the supplementary measures, and the dispute was resolved. The important points are: (1) The base salary of Category C employees must not be lower than 26 yuan. If employees have no faults in the future, their base salary will increase by 2 to 3 yuan each year. (2) For apprentices who start in the fourth year after completing their apprenticeship, their base salary will be raised to 23 yuan. After one year, their base salary will be raised to 26 yuan for Category C, and thereafter, it will increase by 2 yuan every year, the same as the treatment of Category C employees.

### Female Nurse Seduced and Defiled; Ji Zhengyuan Released on Bail Pending Trial

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Meifen, a female nurse from Jiangyin at the Fifth Municipal Hospital, was previously seduced and abandoned by Ji Zhengyuan, an intern at the hospital. After attempting suicide by throwing herself into the river and being rescued, she formally filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against Ji.

### Child Laborer Swallows Corrosive Liquid and Commits Suicide; Father Files Complaint Against Cotton Weaving Factory

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhu Yougen, a 54-year-old printing worker from Haimen at the Qingda Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 7 Tangjia Lane, Dadongmen, Nanshi, residing at No. 69 Weiwu Lane, Jumen Road, Nanshi, introduced his son, Xiaofa, now 20 years old, to work at the factory. However, the factory did not pay Xiaofa the same wages as other workers, resulting in Xiaofa's meager monthly income and inability to maintain a living. Previously, he had planned to borrow 100,000 yuan in legal currency from the factory to buy rice, but the factory refused. Xiaofa, stimulated by this, swallowed the corrosive nitric acid used by the factory and committed suicide. Afterwards, Zhu's father filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against the factory, alleging that the factory's improper storage of the corrosive liquid led to the tragedy, and accusing the factory of assisting suicide. The District Prosecutor's Office summoned the plaintiff Zhu Yougen, the defendant Chen Wenhao, the factory owner of Qingda, and the managers Chuan Shengsheng and Chen Shiwena to court for questioning yesterday morning. The court then ordered a rescheduling of the trial, and the defendants were released on bail.

### Impersonating Plainclothes Police to Extort Money; Two Criminals Arrested Together

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Changsheng, from Kunshan, residing at No. 14, Lane 173, Xinhui Road, possessed a 45-caliber Mauser pistol. Accompanied by his friend Zhang Zhiming (21 years old, from Nantong), he impersonated plainclothes police officers at around 10 pm yesterday at Room 504 of the Baxian Hotel on Yongshou Street, extorting 20 million yuan from Zhou Peixiang (31 years old, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Limpy"), a fruit merchant. Zhou saw through the scheme and went out to report it to the Songshan Road Police Precinct. Seeing that their plan had failed, Wu and Zhang hurriedly fled on a pedicab. When they reached the entrance of the Longmen Theater on Zhongzheng Road Central, they were suddenly caught up by the police officers who had been following them and arrested together. They were taken to the police station for questioning. According to their confession, they had extorted 50 million yuan in legal currency from Qian Agui, a silk cotton broker at No. 28 Yongsheng Lane, Xujiahui Road, at 2 pm on the 26th, stating that they would collect the money on the morning of the 29th.

### All-Night Petition Finally Resolved; Private School Teachers Return Satisfied; Mayor Agrees to Advance Loan of 5 Million to Each

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Approximately two to three hundred private elementary school teachers in this city have been petitioning the Education Bureau since 3:00 PM the day before yesterday regarding loan and rice allocation issues. Because they found the Education Bureau's response unsatisfactory, they remained gathered in the vicinity of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road overnight. Yesterday afternoon, around 4:00 PM, educational figures Du Zuozhou, Yang Weiyu, and Chen Bochui arrived to persuade them and reported on their negotiations with Mayor Wu. The petitioning crowd was deeply moved and gradually dispersed around 6:00 PM. The stalemate lasted for 27 hours. Fortunately, the authorities handled the situation with prudence, and no incidents occurred, which is a fortunate outcome.

Around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a heavy rain fell. The petitioning crowd sitting in front of the Education Bureau were unable to withstand the rain and sought shelter in nearby stores. Shenjiang Hospital and some stores voluntarily opened their doors, inviting teachers inside to rest and providing tea.

Elementary School Students Form Teams to Offer Comfort: Around 7:00 AM, elementary school students formed teams to comfort the teachers, soliciting money to purchase sesame cakes and fried dough sticks to provide them with food. In total, more than one hundred students gathered. The gate of the Education Bureau on Lin Sen Middle Road was not opened. The petitioning crowd used the steps in front of the gate as a command platform. Several leaders issued orders, and the four large characters "Anti-Hunger Arena" were posted. Banners of support and encouragement were hung, sent by the Jiaotong University Student Union, the Teachers College, the Kindergarten Teachers College, Wanfang Silk and Cloth Store, a group of parents, a group of middle school students, the China Vocational School, and others – thirteen banners in total. The walls were covered with red and green slogans and cartoons, with hardly any space left. Singing and shouting rose and fell, mixed with tension and reaching an extreme.

The police station maintained a strict guard. Cars and pedestrians were not allowed to pass, but they did not interfere with the teachers' actions. Throughout the entire event, peace was maintained.

Small Episode with Three Messengers: Around 10:00 AM, three messengers visited the Education Bureau to seek instructions but refused to reveal their names or the schools where they worked. The Education Bureau investigated and discovered that one of them was Shu Yueqiao, who had reported Li Ze. He is currently a teacher at the New New Company Employee Children's School, but the school has not been registered with the Education Bureau. The other two were temporarily detained. After verifying their identities – one being Huang Jun (female, Qinde Elementary School Kindergarten) and the other being Chen Ming (male, Huamin Elementary School) – they were released because they were confirmed to be teachers.

Four Demands – Answers Obtained:

Around 4:00 PM, educational figures Du Zuozhou, Yang Weiyu, and Chen Bochui, accompanied by Zhu Juntian, the Director of the National Education Department, arrived, causing great excitement among the crowd. Du Zuozhou stated first: "I hope this matter will not be expanded. I have negotiated with Mayor Wu and Director Li. The answers to your four demands are as follows: (1) A loan of 10 million yuan will be issued, with 60 billion yuan borrowed from the City Bank first, and 5 million yuan will be advanced to each person. The remaining 5 million yuan will be negotiated with the Four Joint Offices for allocation before the summer vacation. (2) Regarding the rice allocation issue, the reason why many schools have not received rice is due to the limited number of personnel in the Civil Affairs Committee. However, the guaranteed shortage of rice will be cleared in the short term. In the future, if any embezzlement of rice is discovered, report it to the Education Bureau to exchange with the Civil Affairs Committee. (3) The issue of maintaining the original price for rice allocation during the summer vacation from July to September is not something the Education Bureau can decide, but the Education Bureau is responsible for negotiating with relevant parties. As for returning one dou of household rice, the Education Bureau is not aware of this matter and will be responsible for negotiating with the Civil Affairs Committee. (4) Regarding the issue of increasing the 130,000 yuan subsidy, the Education Bureau has decided to strive to increase it in the Municipal Council starting from the next semester." Subsequently, Yang Weiyu, Chen Bochui, and others persuaded the petitioning crowd, offering much encouragement and comfort. Zhu Juntian then advised everyone to disperse, return home to rest, and that their demands could be expected to be resolved.

Shouting Gratitude Before Leaving:

By this point, the petitioning crowd was exhausted and hoarse, extremely tired. Seeing that the problem had been largely resolved, they no longer insisted. Although Tai Shuangqiu and Shu Yueqiao claimed that Mayor Wu only promised 5 million yuan, with the remaining 5 million only being issued if it could be borrowed, believing that Du and others were contradicting each other, almost causing another disturbance. Fortunately, the situation had eased, and the private school teachers trusted Du and others' guarantees, and they gradually dispersed before 6:00 PM. Before deciding to leave, one of the elementary school teacher representatives stood up and shouted: "Our petition has achieved considerable results. Thank you to the police officers, the reporters, and the members of society who care about us!" The 27 hours of commotion finally came to an end.

### Director of Education Bureau Issues Written Statement

Director Li of the Education Bureau issued a written statement yesterday stating: "The treatment of private elementary school employees should originally be the responsibility of the school's board of directors and principal, and this bureau can provide no further advice. However, in recent times, prices have soared, and this bureau sympathizes with the teachers' difficult living conditions. In addition to asking the municipal government to issue a subsidy of 2 billion yuan to subsidize teachers and staff, it has also asked the mayor to negotiate with the Civil Affairs Committee to issue fair-priced rice and to negotiate with the Four Joint Offices for loans. In terms of the welfare of private school teachers, the Education Bureau has asked itself if it has fulfilled its responsibilities. However, a small number of private school teachers, not understanding the process, came to the bureau to petition, insisting that the Education Bureau guarantee that each private school teacher would borrow 10 million yuan, and that it must be allocated by the end of this month. They do not know that the Education Bureau is not a lending institution, and forcing the Education Bureau to bear a responsibility that it cannot bear can be said to be a misunderstanding of the target. Later, the mayor summoned representatives of private school teachers and staff groups to give a formal response. Before the Four Joint Offices approved it, the Municipal Bank would advance the loan to relieve the urgent need, and each person would be allowed to borrow 5 million yuan, totaling 65 billion yuan. Most of the representatives thought it was satisfactory, but the petitioners still gathered and refused to disperse. After questioning the petitioning representatives, the police station discovered that there were a small number of people with unclear identities mixed among them, and there were also many elementary school students involved. Whether their actions are similar to a normal teachers' group, and whether they are being exploited by others, this bureau is investigating. This time, we are deeply grateful to the police officers of the Police Headquarters and the Songshan Branch for maintaining order day and night, so that no accidents occurred."

### Gold Control Bureau Assists in Stabilizing Prices; Large-Scale Inspection of Firms and Banks; Bills, Warehouse Pledges, and Loans All Subject to Inspection

To stabilize prices, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, in coordination with the municipal authorities, has taken emergency measures. Since the 28th, it has intensified its inspection of firms and banks. All personnel below the Chief Auditor of the bureau have been mobilized, and a large number of staff have been borrowed from the Auditing Department of the Central Bank to assist in the work. This is the first large-scale inspection since the bureau was established. The number of people mobilized and the scope of the inspection are unprecedented. The bureau's inspection has three major objectives: (1) Inspecting suspicious bills from firms and banks at the bill exchange; (2) Inspecting suspicious clients dealing with firms and banks; (3) Inspecting firms and banks' affiliated warehouse pledge accounts. All three of these situations are sufficient to create facts of hoarding, manipulation, and speculative profit-making. The impact is very serious. If the bureau finds any suspicious circumstances or speculative hoarding of goods during this inspection, it will deal with them severely according to the law. As for the firms and banks that have already been penalized, such as replacing managers, it is waiting for the order from the Ministry of Finance to arrive before it can be handled according to the law.

### Constant Inflow of Idle Funds; Stock Market Trend Stable

The stock market continued to be lively yesterday morning. The direction of idle funds is still constantly flowing in. Therefore, although the industry center's intentions were weak, the burden of the holiday and various unfavorable influences were swept away halfway. The lining of small stocks and strong stocks was eager, and the situation was somewhat gratifying.

At the opening in the morning, the market opened lower due to the shadow of the industry center and the trip of a senior official of the Securities Exchange to Beijing, which caused people to feel tired. Yongsha opened at 5200 yuan. Nos. 163, 157, and the bank group sold to 5140 yuan. Nos. 176 and 145, etc. came in and rose to 5320 yuan. The agency fee opened at 71 yuan and 77 yuan, which required five days to bear, so it was inevitably a small disc. In the end, idle funds penetrated everywhere, and small stocks maintained their signs of strength, with Neiyi Huaxin Lian rising to the limit. The securities group and the Guangdong group both entered, and the price rose to 5410 yuan. Hong Kong Electric rose slightly to one and a half jiao. Nos. 104, 13, 89, and the Guangdong group No. 202 continued to sell vigorously. Nos. 155 and the bank group also closed, and the noon closing retreated to 5230 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, except for Lian Nei Yi Hua Xin, which rose to the limit, and Xinguang, which was still flat, Yongsha Xinhe Jingfu Tongyi Rongfeng Wuhe Zhabei slightly decreased, and the rest were slightly increased. The off-market prices of unlisted stocks were stable, except for Shijie, which rose by 10%, and Dasheng, which rose by 50%.

Public Bonds: Yesterday, they were slightly weak. Tongbing opened at 620,000 in the morning and once rose to 650,000, but then fell to 560,000 before stabilizing. The turnover was 3 million, which was 20,000 lower for A, B, D, and E, and 10,000 lower for C.

Foreign Stocks: Yesterday, due to the authorities' surveillance and various concerns, trading could not be carried out normally. It was not until 11:30 AM that trading was opened. Hong Kong Electric rose slightly to one and a half jiao. Yisha once fell to the 10.1 million mark, and most of the time it hovered around 10.5 million, which was 50% lower than the previous closing price of Yisha Zhiban. Shipping fell by 10%, and the rest fell slightly.

### Banks and Firms Settle Accounts at the End of June; Money Market Slightly Tight

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] June has ended, and commercial banks and firms are settling accounts for half a year. The money market is slightly tight, and the price increase trend has also slowed down. Banks and firms will be closed for two days starting tomorrow. It is reported that most of the banks and firms in this city have made considerable profits. Among them, those with strong capital and good management have made very high profits. After deducting all expenses such as public reserve funds, donations, taxes, and employee bonuses, each share of capital can obtain a net profit of about 2,000 yuan. However, judging from the total amount of deposits in banks converted into prices, the strength of the current banks and firms is very empty. Before the war, the strength of banks could fully control industry. Currently, in economic relations, banks are actually subordinate to factories. The so-called prosperity is entirely a superficial phenomenon, except for a few who own foreign exchange positions.

Yesterday's money market was tight because the end of June was approaching, and national banks and bureaus were tightening. In the exchange of money and bills, banks and bureaus were short by a total of 145.97 billion, the Central Bank was short by 71.74 billion, the Bank of China was over by 41.79 billion, the Bank of Communications was short by 38.09 billion, the Farmers Bank was short by 8.39 billion, the China Trust Bureau was short by 58.42 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau was over by 4.61 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury was short by 15.73 billion. The large exchange of commercial banks and firms was over by 142.84 billion, and the small exchange was over by 107.42 billion. The amount of foreign banks' overage created a new record, totaling 107.42 billion yuan.

### Banks and Firms Transfer Funds; National Banks Allow Remittances

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The opening of domestic remittances has been implemented since the day before yesterday, but it is limited to interbank remittances. Whether it is the transfer of funds by national banks and bureaus or commercial banks and firms, the Central Bank can provide unlimited remittances. The area includes all parts of the country. It is reported that remittances from national banks and bureaus will be handled first today, and remittances from commercial banks and firms will begin tomorrow.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

However, according to Shantou News: The price of rice in the area has soared, reaching a high price of 50 million yuan per market stone.

### Foreign Rice and Cotton Arrive in Shanghai

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The "Da Zhongshan" ship, managed by the Hualun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 26,730 bags of rice from San Francisco, USA. It is currently berthed at the Rihui Port Wharf for unloading.

### Off-Market Sales Prices Hover at High Levels; Rice Still Has No Formal Transactions; Flour Owners Discouraged, Prices See Downstream

The rice market is still restricted by the community bureau at the price of last Friday, and no one sells it. Although the production area has seen a short return, it is still higher than the price of last Friday, and there are still no formal transactions. The Civil Affairs Committee continues to sell 6,000 shi of rice, and the price remains the same. Off-market transaction prices are still at their peak. White japonica and thin rice are each 18.5 million, early rice is 17.5 million, Jiangxi Jixian is 17 million, and coarse japonica is 15.5 million. Starting today, the grain market will be closed for three days due to the semi-annual settlement.

Flour trading is normal, and prices are slightly downstream. Because Wuxi prices have fallen sharply and the money market is tight, the owners are discouraged and sell successively, especially the supply of miscellaneous brands of flour is more abundant. Laoche flour is 4.85 million, and Bingshen is 4.75 million, and they all retreat to the limit price, which is about 200,000 lower than the previous day. Bran is 3.9 million at the original price, and wheat opens at 6 million.

There are still no formal transactions in miscellaneous grains. Both parties entering and exiting are mostly watching, and it was not until the close that they started trading slightly, standing at the price of last Friday. Hankou zhadou 8.2 million, Che Dou entered 1.8 million, Maojiashi Qingcan no bag cargo opened at 7.2 million, Yuanmai traded more, Kunshan Yuanmai 6.3 million, Changdun Yuanmai 6.4 million, secondary Nai Ma 18 million yuan.

Edible oil only has various oil factories opening and selling soybean oil to supply the needs of the city, and the price is 50,000 yuan lower than the closing price of last Friday, which is 27.45 million yuan. All factories are the same, and this is not a formal transaction either. It is a special price reduction to assist in suppressing prices. However, there are few porridge and more monks, and there are many who are left out. In addition, the small cart sesame oil is 49 million yuan, and the Doubing first market factory opened at 4.04 million, and then the retail investors were forced by the money market and sold a lot. The Shenrenji cake retreated to 3.95 million, which was a small 30,000 to 40,000 yuan lower than the dark market on the previous day.

### Pricing Method for Unified Purchase of Cotton Approved by Ministry of Economic Affairs for Implementation

[This Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The interim measures for pricing of cotton for unified purchase drafted by the National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Management Committee have been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The ministry has also telegraphed the Cotton Management Committee to implement them immediately. The details of the method are as follows: (1) This committee formulates this method to adapt to the actual situation of the cotton market in various places, and to seek fairness and rationality of prices for the unified purchase of cotton. (2) The pricing of cotton prices in each market shall be determined by this committee and its offices in various places in conjunction with China Textile Company and its offices in various places, based on the actual supply of cotton in the cotton market within their respective jurisdictions, and with reference to the prices of rice, yarn, cloth and other daily necessities, and the prices shall be determined daily according to the origin, type and grade of cotton. The prices shall be telegraphed to this committee for record. This price shall be the reference price. (3) In areas where this committee has not yet set up offices, but China Textile Company has set up offices, the office shall draft the prices on its behalf and telegraph them to this committee for record. This price shall be the reference price. (4) All cotton merchants entrusted by this committee to purchase cotton and self-purchasing factories shall purchase within the scope of the reference price and shall not raise prices to compete for purchase. (5) All cotton merchants entrusted by this committee to purchase cotton shall compile a report on the type, quantity, grade and price of cotton purchased on a daily basis and submit it to the office that originally determined the price for verification and forwarding to this committee for verification on the same day as the basis for the settlement of the price after the cotton is shipped to Shanghai for consolidation. (6) If the location of the cotton purchase by each cotton merchant is too far away from the office that originally determined the price and the report cannot be delivered directly, it may be reported to the office in charge by telegram on the same day for verification and forwarding. (7) These measures shall be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and implementation.

### Tight Credit and Weak Demand for Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Asking Prices Soft

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was bleak due to the strict surveillance by the police in the market and the prohibition of all idlers from watching outside the door. In addition, the end of June account settlement was approaching, credit was tight, customer sales were sluggish, and many bulls sold off, causing the market to fall. Forty-two blue phoenix fine yarn opened late at 11:15 AM, opening low at 800 million yuan. It was unable to recover halfway, and later it rose to 830 million yuan at the end due to retail investors absorbing the low, which was 50 million yuan lower than the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also generally fell by 10% to 15%.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was still prohibited due to the fact that the supply and demand of faucet fine cloth and gentleman cloth were not yet normal, but the asking price outside the market has been soft. The speculative gangs were generally watching, and there were many new buyers and old bulls reselling. Faucet fine cloth has dropped from 20.7 million to 19.5 million, and the final 20 million has also been sold. Gentleman cloth also ended with a small 20.8 million, which was 1.5 to 1.6 million lower than the previous day outside the market. Five-fortune fine cloth in the market plummeted by 2.3 million. In addition, only Shilin cloth, blue cloth and raw cloth continued to be popular, while the rest fluctuated.

### Ministry of Food Announces Newly Revised Measures for Grain Pledge and Loan (Continued)

(6) When grain merchants use loans and remittances to purchase grain, the local government authorities shall closely supervise and assess them, and strictly prohibit them from being used for other purposes.

(7) Grain merchants should purchase and transport grain from grain-abundant areas or distribution markets when using loans and remittances, and shall not compete to purchase, thereby stimulating grain prices.

(8) When grain is scarce or grain prices fluctuate, the local grain authorities may order grain merchants to redeem their pledged grain for sale in the market in advance. If grain merchants violate this order, they shall be forcibly purchased with reference to the cost of each batch of grain plus profit, and the local authorities shall evaluate and sell it to regulate people's food.

(10) The local grain authorities and the Four Joint Branches or their designated banks shall inspect the purchase, transportation, storage, pledge and sales of grain pledged by grain merchants and the amount of remittance at any time, and report them to the Ministry of Food and the Four Joint Headquarters for record on a monthly basis.

### World Games Farewell Match, Another Victory Over Enkas, Fifty to Thirty-Six

[Our Dispatch] In the World Games' sixth match in Shanghai, they faced Enkas again yesterday, winning by a score of 50 to 36, a fourteen-point victory. The score at halftime was 26 to 20. After a few days of rest, the players were noticeably rusty, especially in the first ten minutes of the game. Even the usually calm Wen Hua was unstable, missing all four shots, far from his usual accurate state. Fortunately, after ten minutes, the performance gradually returned to normal, and Enkas gradually faltered.

The World Games team started with the five tigers: Huang, Bao, Cai, Wu, and Li. Wen Hua's performance was not smooth, missing two shots, and Gorbunkov saw the opportunity, scoring the first point. Shi Qiao doubled the return, after which the game fell into a chaotic state. Enkas led by one or two points several times. At 14 to 12, Li Shiqiao scored two shots, reversing the situation. From then on, it was smooth sailing, and Enkas never had another chance to rise. The score at halftime was 26 to 20, with the World Games team leading by three goals.

When the second half began, the World Games team's lineup changed, but the momentum remained strong. Song Yuan, Wen Hua, and Tian Xi scored, making it 37 to 26, with the World Games team leading by eleven points. With seven minutes remaining, the automatic timer suddenly broke down and was replaced with an electric clock. Both sides scored with long shots, and in the end, the World Games team defeated Enkas again with a score of 50 to 36.

World Games Team: Shots, Penalties, Fouls, Points

Li Shiqiao: 6, 0, 1, 12

### Interpretation of a New Poem

— Yu Qin

1.  Longing — Bing Xin

Hiding from longing.

Putting on a fur coat.

Walking out of the brightly lit and quiet house.

In the small path, the moon shines brightly,

Dead branches –

On the snowy ground

Writhe across each other writing of longing.

The word "love" today is just like the ancient Chinese word for "longing." The poem's title, "Longing," is a general term for the sentiment of love. The first part describes the attempt to avoid the emotion of love. The emergence of love emotions is always triggered by various scenes, as the saying goes, "scenes evoke emotions." Among the scenes encountered indoors, none is more effective than a solitary lamp. A solitary lamp accompanies a solitary guest; its light reflects the person's shadow, illuminating the wall. Looking back, one immediately feels lonely, and thus the emotion of love arises. Although the emotion arises, the beloved is difficult to see, so one cannot help but feel perplexed by "Tonight, my form and shadow are together before the lamp," and "There is no one to share the spring cold." This poem describes a winter night, so the latter part mentions the snowy ground. Winter cold is far more intense than spring cold, so the depth of feeling is even greater than in other seasons. If the remaining lamp is dim, hazy and sleepy, as in the saying, "The blue lamp dimly flickers," then because the shadow it casts is unclear, the emotion of love arises but is not deep, the anxiety is not great. If the lamplight is bright, the wick is fully lit, as in the saying, "A clear night with a bright lamp," then because the shadow it casts is clear, the emotion of love arises both deeply and greatly. Moreover, when it is late at night and people are quiet, at the time of "Night has passed three watches" and "Alone quietly," this is already enough to create "A deeper night, people gone, silence," and to evoke infinite love emotions, let alone "But the lonely lamp reflects the wall." On such a night, alone in an empty room, keeping company with the lamp, even if one trims the wick, it only increases sorrow. Wei Zhuang did not say, "Trimming the lamp and writing out red letters, I am still bored." Li Qingzhao also once "Played with trimming the lamp wick in the late night." The reason for playing with the lamp wick was probably "Embracing deep sorrow, I have no good dreams." Because it is so, why not leave this empty room, leave this solitary lamp, and imitate the ancient woman's "Walking alone out of the secluded gate," going out for a stroll to dispel sorrow. However, the outdoor temperature is not as good as indoors, especially at night, so one has to open the wardrobe, take a fur coat, and put it on before leaving the room. The latter part describes the unexpected summoning of the emotion of love. In human affairs, generally, what one intends to harm, one ends up helping to achieve, what one intends to avoid, one ends up encountering. The protagonist of this poem has already left the room, walking alone in the small path, fully believing that they can dispel their sorrow by doing so. Even if the sorrow cannot be completely dispelled, at least a large part of the sorrow should be removed. But things are far from that. The gentle moon not only exists tonight but is particularly bright tonight, bright to the point where it illuminates everything without exception, with nothing escaping its gaze, like a person spying on an object, determined to catch it. Thus, the protagonist of this poem is again discovered by the moon, which is brighter than the lamplight. The person's shadow is on the ground, lonely and alone, and the emotion of love that one wanted to avoid suddenly strikes again – a mighty army marching swiftly, secretly entering the heart's capital – and countless strands of sorrow arise from this. This is not all. Looking again at the white snowy ground, it is doubly clean under the moonlight, and it seems to have words of love written on it. They are scattered everywhere, catching the eye at every turn. Examining the reason, one sees that the dead branches of the old trees are illuminated by the moonlight, and the dead branches are like hundreds of writing brushes, taking advantage of this rare white paper to write large characters of love. Thus, although the protagonist of this poem wants to avoid the emotion of love, everything serves to evoke an even greater and deeper emotion of love.

This poem is concise and profound. The meaning is beyond words, quite capturing the essence of old poetry and lyrics. And the last sentence is derived from Zhou Meicheng's "Six Ugly": "Fearing that there are still words of longing on the broken red," further demonstrating the poet's skillful use of old poetry and lyrics.

2.  Paper Boat Sent to Mother — Bing Xin

I never recklessly discard a piece of paper

Always keeping—keeping,

Folding it into a very small boat,

Throwing it from the deck into the sea

Some are blown by the heavenly wind into the windows of the boat,

Some are dampened by the waves, sticking to the bow

I am still unflaggingly folding every day,

Always hoping that one can float to the place I want it to go.

Mother; if you see a very small white boat in your dream,

Don't be surprised that it enters your dream for no reason.

This is folded with tears by your beloved daughter,

Ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, asking it to carry her love and sorrow back.

The subject matter of this poem is not only novel but also carries profound meaning. Looking only at the words "paper boat," one feels it is monotonous and childish. Looking again at the three words "sent to mother," one feels the poetic meaning is elegant and pure. Although it carries a childish flavor, it further shows its unparalleled innocence. The first part describes folding the paper boat and throwing it into the sea. The hearts of children are mostly full of innocence. Because children play more, their toys are also not uncommon. Among the most common toys, none is better than folding paper games. I also used to love this in my youth, folding paper into countless shapes, including clothes and pants, tables and chairs, towers, and also boats. Because boats can float on the water and be carried away by the wind, they are most pleasing to me, and so it is with other children. Although this poem is written by the author in the first person, it actually contains the common group of children within it. It is a glimpse of the children's life. It is best to fold a paper boat without creases, folding it into a small and exquisite shape in one go, and then putting it in the river to float on the surface, carried away by the wind, which has a secluded charm. However, the author does not put it in the river but throws it into the sea, because this poem is written by the author after going abroad across the ocean. The middle part describes the fate of the paper boat and the continuation of its work. Because the boat is light and thin, and the seawater is turbulent like madness, it cannot maintain its original speed and direction of flow. It is fortunate that it is not submerged! Some are blown into the boat's window, and some stick to the bow. However, the author's entrustment to this small paper boat is far-reaching, and they will definitely not give up folding because of this setback. Therefore, they continue to do the work of folding boats every day. The last part describes the reason for sending the paper boat. Generally, travelers who leave their hometowns all have a feeling of homesickness. The farther they are from their hometown, the deeper their feeling. Traveling through ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, their longing for their hometown also amounts to ten thousand bushels and a thousand bells. However, each mountain and river in these ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains is watched and hoped for by their mothers at home. Thinking of the young birds feeding back to their parents, the filial thought of not being able to return to care for them arises spontaneously. "Returning dreams are often of the hills and trees beyond the screen," already belongs to homesickness. If there are external scenes to stimulate it, such as "mournful forest birds" or "cold pestle pounding homesickness," then the thought of "lingering in the courtyard" arises, and the sorrow of "Where is my hometown at sunset?" is born. On such a day, the traveler's feeling of longing for their hometown and the wind's memory of Mount Qi and Mount Ju are almost endless. This poem not only wants to write about their longing for their mother but also wants to write about their mother's love. A loving mother's heart for her child is meticulous. When her child travels far away, she leans on the door and looks, waiting for their return, or waiting for a letter of their safety. At night, she dreams of their return, as in "The high hall should dream of their return." However, if a small white boat suddenly appears in her dream, she cannot help but be surprised. Why? Because it enters her dream for no reason. If she knows the origin of this small white boat, that it was folded with tears by her beloved daughter, and that what is carried in the boat is all her daughter's love and sorrow, then the loving mother will also be filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. The hardships of wind and frost are what she worries about, and suddenly receiving news of their safety is what she delights in. If so, then the feelings of the mother and daughter are able to converge with the help of this small white boat.

This poem expresses homesickness and longing for the mother, entrusting emotions to objects, and obtaining the proper nature of the heart. The last line can be said to have come from: "How can a homesick letter be delivered? The returning geese follow the Luo River." Although the small white boat in this poem is not a homesick letter, what it carries is equal to a homesick letter. The only difference is that the messenger is one is a goose, and the other is the sea.

The Seven Types Weekly will be temporarily suspended from July 1st. This publication and the publishing industry weekly still have several稿費 (payment for submissions), but due to unknown addresses, they cannot be sent. We hope that the original authors will indicate their current address so that we can complete the procedures.

### White Lotus

— Jin Liu

### Painting's Realm

— JS

——One of Arabian Nights

In my mind, there is a painting's realm: a slanting sun over an ancient ferry, a few returning crows, misty and boundless ripples, rising wisps of cooking smoke, serene, everything is serene, a wisp of twilight at the edge of the forest, shrouded in the solemnity of dusk.

I yearn for the painting's realm in my heart.

——Suddenly, a dark shadow slowly moves through the dim twilight, walking from the forest towards the ferry dock. Now it is slow again, heavy yet hurried, somewhat like a sleepwalking patient. Slowly I hear a sound, as if that mad old woman from the play "The Big Thunderstorm," like a ghost, appears before my eyes, running and shouting:

"The storm is coming, -- the end of the world is at hand!" The repetitive and labored voice trembles in the twilight, echoing, intimate and familiar. Again, it is a familiar friend, with a bitter expression, holding tightly to a heavy heart, listlessly pacing the waterside, groaning at the dock, lamenting in the vast dusk.

Suddenly, an explosion, like the previous sound, but now it has become a sign before a volcanic eruption, shouting: "Shanghai is in trouble, the Bund of Shanghai -- Shanghai is about to collapse!"

Then I suddenly realize that the place where he lingers is not some painting's realm, nor is there a slanting sun over an ancient ferry. What appears before our eyes is precisely the Bund of the Huangpu River.

Listening again to that shouting, sometimes distant, sometimes near, sometimes bright, sometimes silent; the one shouting is not some friend, nor is it some madman, but someone who has lost their footing and drowned in the river. I am frightened. Looking more closely, he transforms into hundreds and thousands of drowning people. The Huangpu River before my eyes has become a bloody pool under the Bridge of Helplessness exposed in the Hell Transformation Zone. The men and women falling into the water are like vegetable vendors crossing the Pudong River, a basket of radishes overturned in the heart of the river. The radishes float and sink in the water, one trying to emerge, crashing into another, unable to withstand the impact of a wave, or pushing against each other, they all sink again. Those who have sunk still try to emerge, their mouths constantly shouting, yelling, but gradually their strength is exhausted and their voices become hoarse, some sounding unclear. That voice also changes into --

"Save the drowning people!"

The cooking smoke had long since vanished, and the crows had disappeared. The dusk is visibly deep, and many ox-headed and horse-faced demons holding three-pronged forks are standing by the bloody pool in the twilight, straightening their sharp forks, aiming at those drowning weaklings. Stabbing once, again and again, at those struggling to emerge, those still shouting for help, stabbing into the eternal abyss, a stream of fresh blood gushing out with the tip of the fork as it is pulled out. The fresh blood floats on the water, steaming, and the corpse silently sinks, never to surface again.

Then the imps look triumphantly at the river water dyed red with hot blood, laughing wildly with hideous laughter. The cruel laughter ripples through the heavy air, shaking many ornate glass windows, rattling them. Inside the windows sit gentlemen and ladies with large nearsighted, color-blind, even blind eyes, appreciating the sunset on the river. At this moment, they cannot help but feel a bit shocked, a flicker in their hearts, but they immediately cover it up with a kind of composed mockery.

However, the hideous laughter by the river has not stopped, and entire boats of radishes are capsizing into the river. The men and women floating and sinking in the water huddle closer, squeeze harder, and trample even more fiercely. The horse-faces stab again and again with their forks, like so many points, and the hot blood spurts out like a showerhead.

This is the fall of souls that even Jesus cannot save, the destruction of lives that even Buddha cannot deliver. Occasionally, one or two enthusiastic people, with bitter expressions, holding heavy hearts, utter the voice of a prophet, recounting the absurd stories of sending charcoal in the snow from ancient times; but no one listens, no one understands. Unable to withstand the surging tides, they are soon swept into the raging waves, allowing the following waves to chase the preceding ones, the big waves to cover the small ones, and finally they are submerged into the water, sinking into an even deeper abyss. Even those gentlemen and ladies who think they are enjoying the drowning of others will, in the blink of an eye, capsize into the heart of the river like radishes; the result of eating people is still being eaten. There is no exception.

Thus --

The painting's realm in my heart, in the blink of an eye, turns into a dark night, the earth is deathly silent, there are a few sparse stars in the sky like jade beads, and a few fishing lights across the river; perhaps it is fishermen from afar casting their tattered nets, wanting to net the dregs of history. A loud sound, desolate and drawn out, a lone wild goose lamenting the past flies across the sky. The shadow of the goose disappears, and the fishermen fall into dreams.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Spanish Poet Lorca

The recent English translation and publication of three tragedies written by the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca is a major event in the literary world. Among them, "The House of Bernarda Alba," the best of the three, has not had any other translation besides the English version. All three plays are very well translated, and can be considered authoritative translations. The translators are O'Connell and Graham-Lujan, who have translated all of Lorca's works. These tragedies range from prose dialogues to tense lyrical passages. "Yerma" is a revised version of a previous translation, while "Blood Wedding" is a new translation. The poet's brother, Francisco, wrote a preface that is both elegant and accessible, appealing to both scholars and general readers.

In order of writing, Blood Wedding, Yerma, and The House of Alba are Lorca's works from the last three years, representing the highest development of his artistic central tendency. This is what his brother called: "Recapturing tradition and expressing it in modern idioms." After the first two plays were performed on the Spanish stage, they were immediately hailed as masterpieces, and his works were seen as being in the tradition of Lope de Vega and Calderon, and not just the works of a modern writer. Like his predecessors, he placed poetry on a serious stage. He valued poetic meaning over realism. Blood Wedding is almost entirely lyrical dialogue, but it is more moving and more dramatic than prose. The House of Alba is particularly successful in its use of symbolism and the tense emotions of the characters. The play is simple, economical, and structurally complete.

These three heroic tragedies are completely Spanish, with a strong local flavor.

There is also a "Lorca: Selected Poems," translated by Stephen Spender and J. L. Gili. Originally published in 1939, it has now been selected and republished. It can be said to be a representative work of Lorca. The preface by R. M. Nadal has been deleted, and the original Spanish text has also been omitted, probably to reduce the price. However, the inclusion of some new translations is a welcome development. It includes the complete translation of "Ode to Walt Whitman" and "Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias," the latter of which is probably Lorca's greatest lyrical poem. This new edition also corrects some mistranslations and has been revised to be more faithful, aiming to achieve the rhythm of the original poem. These revisions are very successful.
