### The Key to Victory in the Bengbu-Suzhou Campaign Lies in the Confluence of Li and Huang's Corps; Current Distance is Only Thirty Li

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] It is undeniable that the National Army is currently facing a critical juncture in the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield, namely the confluence of Li and Huang's two corps. Once this key is unlocked, the problems facing the southward-advancing corps are likely to be readily resolved. Although the Li Yannian Corps on the southern front is facing increased resistance from the enemy's reinforcements, with defenses set up in every village, and with the recent weather being unfavorable for air force activity, it seems that a trend towards positional warfare has formed. However, this does not mean that the confluence of Li and Huang will face any difficulties; its impact will only mean that the time for the confluence will not be as fast as generally expected. Considering the development trend of the war situation, the National Army on the southern front is currently in a favorable position to complete the encirclement and annihilation of the stubborn bandits facing them. The Huang Wei Corps continues to advance southeast, forcefully pressuring the bandits on the north bank of the Xie River to fall into the encirclement set up by the National Army. This corps is currently advancing with a steady and solid, step-by-step offensive, making every place its troops arrive a strong position. This is because the corps has formed an extremely stable base with the three major strongholds of Shuangduiji, Dayingji, and Luoji, and cannot easily abandon them. Therefore, yesterday, the bandits opened a gap near Dayingji, a stronghold on the southeastern side of the corps, attempting to lure the Huang Corps out and intercept it. However, the Huang Corps saw through their trick and was not deceived. Instead, it used counter-encirclement tactics to defeat more than one of the enemy's divisions. As of yesterday, the distance between the Huang and Li corps was about forty-five li. With the full advance of the two corps, the date of their confluence is not far off. The confluence of the Huang and Li corps will also be the turning point for the National Army to gain an advantage in this battlefield. As for the Qiu, Li, and Sun corps on the northern front, after inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, the originally cut-off positions have now been integrated into one. The enemy's attack is aimed only at preventing the National Army from rapidly advancing southward. With the current infantry and artillery strength of Chen Yi's troops, they are by no means capable of encircling and attacking this powerful corps. From this, we can clearly understand that the Communist bandits have always been known for their "one point, two sides" tactics, but in today's Bengbu-Suzhou campaign, they have completely ignored this point, forming a "three points, one side" situation, causing them to be concerned about everything in front of the three major battlefields and losing the initiative. Therefore, once Li and Huang join forces, the bandits facing the southward-advancing corps will naturally collapse without being attacked, and the exhausted and crippled troops will most likely be unable to escape the pincer attack of the National Army.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] The southern front of the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield is still progressing steadily. Currently, in the fifty-li battlefield, the war actions formed by both sides are no longer simply pursuit and obstruction. On the enemy side, they are currently using the countless villages in this area, setting up defenses everywhere, trying to use the "dispersed deployment" tactic to avoid air force bombing and artillery fire on the one hand, and to obstruct the National Army's attack and delay the time for the confluence of the Li and Huang corps on the other hand. As for the National Army, according to preliminary information obtained this afternoon, the pincers-shaped offensive of the Li Yannian Corps has gradually changed to an arc shape. In addition to launching attacks on Xiaoji (between Xinji and Baojiaji, the mutual distance is ten li) and Baojiaji in front of this arc-shaped front line, its left flank has been extended to the south side of Renheji, and it is now also launching a fierce attack on this stronghold. This nearly thirty-li arc-shaped front line was originally facing northwest, but the current arc opening has turned to the west-north direction. This strategic trend of the National Army will likely focus on the left flank, allowing it to continue to detour northward, in order to form an encirclement and annihilation of the stubbornly resisting bandits facing it. On the Huang Wei Corps side, yesterday, it continued to focus on Dayingji (on the north bank of the Xie River) and advanced southeast, hoping to force the remnant bandits to the south bank of the Xie River and join forces with the Li Corps to encircle and suppress them. The corps' position has been extended to the Wangzhuang and Zhuzhuang line (about five or six li east-southeast of Dayingji), and it has defeated more than one enemy regiment.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] Reliable sources: Taking advantage of the Huang Wei Corps' movement southeast, Liu's bandits concentrated their forces from yesterday onwards to fiercely attack south of Shuangduiji, attempting to cut the corps' position into two sections. According to the Commander-in-Chief's Office communique tonight, after a day and night of fierce fighting, the offensive slightly subsided this morning. At noon, the bandits increased reinforcements and attacked, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 12th] The Commander-in-Chief's Office announced: The right wing of the Li Corps is progressing rapidly. Today, it successively captured Xinji, Guantangmiao, and Waji. According to reports, Waji is about eight li west of Xinji, and the distance between the positions of the Li and Huang corps is now only thirty li.

### The National Army in Eastern Hebei Takes the Initiative to Make New Deployments; Bandits Attacking Fangshan are Repelled; The National Army Outside Zhangjiakou Expands its Victory and Captures Yongfeng Fort

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The remnant Communist Nie Rongzhen's 7th Column has been pressing towards Fangshan County (southeast of Beiping) from Zhangfang, west of Fangshan and along the Juma River, for days. There was fierce fighting in the suburbs of Fangshan City last night, but they have been repelled by this morning. Today, the Ping-Bao line is open to Liangxiang, and the Ping-Gu line is open to Tongxian, but there are no passenger trains. Many passenger and freight trains between Beiping and Tianjin are suspended or delayed.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 12th] The situation in eastern Hebei has changed rapidly. The National Army has taken the initiative to make new deployments. Guye was occupied by bandits at 1:30 PM on the 12th. It is reported that the Kailuan East Three Mines are safe. Communication between Tangshan and Tianjin was cut off at 2:30 PM this afternoon. The details are unknown. Trains to eastern Tianjin are all stopping at Tangshan. One train heading west arrived in Tianjin, carrying a full load of Catholic personnel. Refugees on foot along the way are also endless.

[Our Tongxian Dispatch, 12th] According to an official source, the main force of Lin's 7th Column, numbering over ten thousand, left Yutian northward on the 11th. The stretcher teams recruited by the bandits in the area were unattended and have been automatically disbanded.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The battle situation in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway is gradually becoming quiet. After the Communist bandits near Xinbaoan were fiercely attacked by the National Army's powerful forces, they fled in defeat to the northeastern mountainous area and have not dared to act recklessly in the past two days. Taking advantage of the victory, the Zhangjiakou National Army expanded its gains. From yesterday afternoon to this morning, it launched attacks on the remnant bandits near Laohushan in the southeast of Zhangjiakou and Wulaha Pass in the northwest of Zhangjiakou. The morale of the National Army is high, and it is continuing to mop up the area. The Ping-Sui trains were open to Nankou the day before yesterday and yesterday, but passenger and freight trains are suspended today. Military trains passed through Shahe this morning.

[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 12th] The outer perimeter of Zhangjiakou was calm all day on the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 11th] The National Army outside Zhangjiakou continued to pursue and suppress the remnant bandits. The National Army moving north recovered Yongfeng Fort on the 11th.

They have been restored today. At the same time, telecommunications between Yangzhou and Taizhou were also restored today. As for the people along the way moving south in droves, it is really unnecessary panic. Due to the crowding of passengers in Gaoyou, the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou liner only went as far as Shaobo today.

### Hoffman and Members of the American Aid Committee Hold Informal Talks; Weng Wenhao Urges Hoffman to Consider Temporary Aid to China Measures; President Sun Hosts a Dinner Party for Hoffman Last Night

[Report from this newspaper] After the Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, he held the first informal meeting with the members of the Executive Yuan's American Aid Utilization Committee at the ECA branch office here starting at 4:30 PM yesterday. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the American Aid Committee, Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Yan Jiagan, Shen Xirui, and Mayor Wu, as well as Mr. Lapham and Mr. Griffin, attended the meeting, which lasted about an hour. The atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious.

During the meeting, Chairman Weng made a request to Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Weng stated that if the US Congress delays passing the new aid-to-China plan for the next year, Mr. Hoffman should consider temporary arrangements for aid to China. The existing economic aid to China funds, totaling 275 million US dollars, must all be spent or designated for specific uses before April 3rd of next year.

Mr. Hoffman told Mr. Weng that he has been closely connected with the actual situation in China with the help of Mr. Lapham. Mr. Hoffman particularly emphasized that the United States has always paid attention to "helping free people who are willing to obtain freedom" in the past and will continue to pay attention to it in the future.

Mr. Hoffman also held meetings with US Ambassador to China Stuart and US Consul General to Shanghai Cabot yesterday morning. Mr. Stuart and Mr. Cabot provided Mr. Hoffman with opinions on the current situation in China. After the meeting, Mr. Hoffman summoned representatives of various American volunteer charitable relief organizations in China to hear reports on their work in China. Attendees included Edward of the United China Relief Association, Father McCue and Father McHugh of the Church Charitable Relief Association, Lidtke of the Customs General Tax Office, and Henry of the US Advisory Committee of the World Council of Churches.

### Guo Zongfen Analyzes the Overall Situation in the North; If We Can Ensure Beiping and Tianjin, There is Indeed Potential in North China; Whoever Can Seize the High Ground Can Manipulate Victory

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] Guo Zongfen, deputy commander-in-chief of the North China Suppression Headquarters, told reporters that Beiping is a cultural city in the north, Tianjin is an industrial center in North China, and Taiyuan is a military industrial base in the north. As long as these two points are ensured, there is still potential in North China. From Tianjin, through Beiping, Zhangjiakou, to Datong, is a large wall in the north. Although this wall has partially collapsed and is no longer complete, it still has its function. The Communist bandits are currently doing their best to push down this wall, and a decisive battle between the two sides is almost inevitable. From the perspective of the National Army, the closer this decisive battle area is, the more advantageous it is. The Guankou on the Great Wall line is an "隘道戰" area. Whoever can seize the high ground can manipulate victory. This time, the National Army occupied the high ground in Guankou, so the Communist bandits avoided fighting in Guankou and shifted their forces south. Speaking of the Taiyuan battle, Mr. Guo said: After the fierce battle in the northwest suburbs a few days ago, the battle situation in Taiyuan has become quiet. Air force planes frequently fly over the area every day for reconnaissance and bombing. Chennault's air transport team has increased three shifts of aircraft starting on the 12th to strengthen its forces. Mr. Guo finally said that if 10,000 more troops could be added, the situation in Taiyuan would have the possibility of unfolding.

[Report from this newspaper] Weng Wenhao, chairman of the Executive Yuan's American Aid Utilization Committee, in order to prepare to provide the Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, with the necessary information, convened a meeting of the committee's members staying in Shanghai at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning. Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Yan Jiagan, Shen Xirui, Mayor Wu, and others attended the meeting, which lasted until nearly noon before dispersing.

### President Sun Discharged from the Hospital; The Date of Return to Beijing is Not Yet Determined

[Report from this newspaper] President Sun Ke, who had been staying in Shanghai for several days to have a leg tumor removed, was permitted by the doctor yesterday and was discharged from the hospital at around 9:00 AM, accompanied by his wife and eldest son, to rest at the official residence on Columbia Road. According to President Sun's aides, the date of President Sun's return to Beijing is not yet determined. Dr. Lin Dawei, who performed the surgery for President Sun, told reporters that the wound left by President Sun's tumor removal was quite large. Although new muscle has now joined together, there is still hidden pain when walking, so he has instructed President Sun to rest as much as possible in the next few days and not engage in activities like ordinary people.

The deposit and exchange of gold and silver procedures announced by the Beijing Central Bank on the 12th are still the methods applicable to Nanjing only.

### The Committee Investigating Actions Against American Interests Releases State Department Secret Documents; Relating to British-Japanese Diplomatic Relations Before 1938

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The US House Committee Investigating Actions Against American Interests released secret documents on the 10th concerning the movements of Japanese troops in China in 1938 and setting forth the British-Japanese relationship at that time. According to these documents, it was rumored that they were stolen from the State Department ten years ago and obtained by Soviet spies. In the "most confidential telegram" sent by US Ambassador to Japan Grew to Secretary of State Hull on February 13, 1938, it was stated that the British Ambassador to Japan made the following recommendations to the British government: (1) Continuing to aid China with war materials, money, or any other means would be detrimental to British interests. (2) The British government should always pay attention to promoting peace talks, which may allow China to have hope of revival. The House released a total of twelve documents today, including Grew's telegram. According to reports, these documents were all stolen from the State Department, namely by Chambers, who confessed to passing information for the Communist Party. According to the House Committee Investigating Actions Against American Interests, a total of 200 documents were found from Chambers. The above-mentioned twelve documents are only a part of them. Grew's telegram stated that in a certain meeting between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, Hirota twice became furious due to the British side's protest against Japan's occupation of some small islands near Hong Kong. According to Grew, Craigie was deeply concerned that Japan's guarantee of no territorial ambitions in China could change at any time, so he made the above two recommendations to the British government. The second document released today was a telegram sent by the US Consul in Qingdao to the State Department on January 30, 1938, which detailed the military actions of the Japanese army in the Qingdao area. In addition, those released today also included a report sent by US Counselor to Beiping Lockhart to the State Department on February 11, 1938, explaining the situation of the Japanese army moving south along the Ping-Han Railway, a report sent by US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss to the State Department, explaining the situation of the Japanese army occupying Shanghai University, and on March 31 of the same year, the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment in Beiping also reported to the US authorities that a division of the Japanese regular army had been withdrawn from Central China to Japan. Grew's telegram to Hull is the most important document related to the Far East problem that has been stolen and published. This telegram stated that Craigie asked Hirota to guarantee that the Japanese government's announcement of no territorial ambitions in China included the entire Chinese mainland and its affiliated islands. Hirota told Craigie at that time with an angry attitude that, in the current state of war, Japan had done everything possible to make all reasonable guarantees. Hirota did not guarantee that Japan would not occupy Hainan Island during this conversation with Craigie. Grew also told Hull that Hirota was becoming increasingly severe in his words and tone regarding the interests of other countries in the Far East, and that the leader of the extremely patriotic elements in the Japanese government was not Sumitsuke Nobumasa, but Hirota. Craigie also learned that Japan had concentrated a large army in Taiwan and concentrated ships in Kaohsiung, so he believed that Japan was about to attack Guangzhou and other South China ports. Grew expressed considerable dissatisfaction at the time with British Ambassador Craigie's almost daily protest to the Japanese government against the military actions of the Japanese army in China.

### Immediate Sympathetic Consideration for Any Aid-to-China Suggestions; A Conversation with Bloom, the New Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Democratic Congressman Bloom, the incoming chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today that his committee will give immediate sympathetic consideration to any and all aid-to-China suggestions from the government. After Madame Chiang met with Truman last night, the details were kept secret, so outsiders speculated a lot about the success or failure of her mission. Mr. Bloom issued this statement under these circumstances. He said that American aid must not be too late. Mr. Bloom advocated providing China with all aid except for assistance in combat. According to reports, after Truman's unexpected election, he announced his opposition to continuing aid to China. Soon after he contacted Truman and the State Department, he said that he intended to follow the government's policy. For the past four days, he has repeatedly declared that he would strengthen and expand aid to China. Some people believe that he may be reflecting the government's views or engaging in exploratory actions. There is no question that the United States can continue to provide aid at least in its current form. Whether large-scale military aid can be on par with the level of aid to Greece is what the general public is paying attention to. Truman recently declined to express an opinion on this. Marshall believes that everything depends on the opinion of Congress, so this possibility has not been erased by the government.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] US Democratic Congressman Bloom said today that American aid to China should be "not too little and not too late." Mr. Bloom will serve as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the next Congress. He declared that the United States should immediately consider the China issue so that the National Government can receive US aid in time to resist the Communist Party. Mr. Bloom also said that any aid given to China should be shipped to China immediately.

### The Huaihai Campaign: Summary of the Second Stage of Military Operations; Report by Zhang Yujin, Spokesperson for the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters: The Battle of Feishui Will Surely Secure the Yangtze and Huai Rivers Forever

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 12th] Major General Zhang Yujin, spokesperson for the Pacification Headquarters here, recently released a military report on the second stage of the Huaihai Campaign, summarized as follows:

Dates of the Campaign

First Stage – November 6th to 25th, including the battles near Huang Kou, Xuzhou, and Nianzhuang. The communist forces participating in this stage were the entire force of Chen Yi and parts of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's forces. The result was approximately 200,000 communists killed or wounded, and Chen Yi's main elite forces were defeated. Our Huang Baitao Corps also suffered significant losses. Second Stage: November 26th onwards, battles in the vicinity of Su County and north of the Fei River area. The communist forces are the remnants of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and the entire Chen Yi force. As of the morning of December 9th, nearly 100,000 communists have been annihilated, with over 3,000 captured prisoners, over 200 horses, approximately 5,000 rifles, over 400 light and heavy machine guns, over 200 submachine guns, and over 40 artillery pieces of various types. We have completed seven or eight tenths of the path to victory.

Course of the Second Stage of Battle

(1) In the first stage, the communist army used Chen Yi's full force to fight our main corps around Xuzhou, while Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's units harassed the northwest area of Su County, cutting off our rear communications and preventing our reinforcements from moving north. Afterwards (starting from November 26th), Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng used their full force to fiercely attack our Huang Wei Corps moving north near Nanpingji, south of Su County. Chen Yi's remaining main force fled south, capturing Lingbi and Guzhen, attempting to block our Li Yannian and Liu Ruming Corps along the Fei River north of Bengbu. At this time, because our Xuzhou corps moved south with all their strength, the communists turned north again, fleeing back and forth between Su County and Yongcheng, to prevent our army from converging from the north and south, attempting to take advantage of our main force being dispersed and shake the morale of our rear areas with their arrogance, in order to achieve their dream of crossing the Huai River and the Yangtze River. This is the current second stage of the battle. The General Headquarters and this headquarters had already judged the communist situation, so after the first stage of the campaign, the second stage of the campaign was implemented. On November 26th, the Huang Wei Corps was used in Shuangduiji (south of Nanpingji in Su County) to contain and engage the two communist forces of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, while the two corps of Li Yannian and Liu Ruming attracted the main force of Chen Yi's communists south from Renqiao and Guzhen to the north bank of the Fei River. The three corps of Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang of Xuzhou were led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du on the night of November 30th, advancing south with all their strength to attack the communist army. This headquarters also moved to Bengbu on November 28th to direct and supervise the mutual support and cooperation of the various corps, in order to exert the highest fighting spirit, in order to annihilate all the communist forces in Central China in one fell swoop, once and for all, laying the foundation for securing the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and achieving overall victory in the suppression of bandits. (2) In recent days, our Huang Wei Corps has annihilated an average of more than 2,000 communists every day, and the communist army is like moths flying into a flame. After stabilizing the Fei River defense line on December 1st, our Li Yannian Corps counterattacked the communists on the 2nd, and recovered Xinmaqiao on the 6th. It has now advanced to a line five kilometers west of Heji and Huoxingmiao. The corps led by Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du, in the area between Su County and Yongcheng, has defeated five communist columns that were blocking our southward advance from the 3rd to the evening of the 8th. They are unstoppable. Currently, our three-pronged forces have broken through the strength of the communist army facing them, and they are only 30 kilometers away from the Huang Wei Corps. They will be able to converge in the near future.

Current Situation of the Communists and Us

(1) The main elite force of the communist army, Chen Yi, suffered heavy losses in the first stage of the campaign. Currently, the personnel of each column have had their cadres replaced to the third batch, and only three or four veterans remain in each squad as squad leaders and team leaders. The rest are supplemented by militia and mixed with our captured soldiers, and their combat strength has been greatly reduced. "As long as you kill their company commander and squad leader, the soldiers will surrender." Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng originally had very poor combat strength, and now they have suffered heavy casualties. According to the captured communists, they have been fighting day and night for thousands of miles, and they are not full for a single day. Their ammunition is exhausted. "Each soldier has less than 20 rounds of ammunition." They will die whether they are killed in battle or starve to death. Those who do not starve to death will be killed in battle. Either way, they will die in the end. Most of those who survive are unwilling to fight again. Therefore, the communists not only have no ability to continue fighting, but also have no will to fight again. (2) Although our army has suffered considerable casualties and losses, it is only three or four tenths of our full strength, and most of our combat strength is still intact. Moreover, due to the urgency of the communist army, we no longer have some of the unhealthy psychology of the past. We understand that when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. Therefore, we all hold the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats. The morale is higher and higher, and the supply is constant. The number of soldiers who automatically join our side and defect on the battlefield is gradually increasing, and our combat strength can still be maintained without declining.

Conclusion

It is undeniable that the National Army developed a habit of defense during the past eight years of the war against Japan, and it is not easy to change its thinking for a while. Moreover, after the equipment was improved, the number of supplies transported from the rear increased, which inevitably burdened the movement and made it slow, making it difficult to be as elusive as the communists, resulting in some disadvantages. The general society's loose, opportunistic, and self-preserving psychology has also been transmitted to the troops. After this campaign, the weak have been eliminated and the strong have been retained, and many things have been corrected invisibly. However, the foundation of military strength is entrusted to politics, economy, and ideology. If we want to continue without declining, we must strengthen and improve the effects of politics, economy, and ideology. We must also have a national belief in victory and the army must have the determination to die. The front and the rear must be of one heart and one mind, so as not to be shaken by the communists' false propaganda, so as to complete the great cause of suppressing bandits and saving the country. Judging from the fact that all the members of the comfort groups have enthusiastically come to the front, not only bringing a large number of comfort goods automatically donated by the people in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, but also bringing the enthusiasm of the people in the rear for supporting the suppression of bandits, and the strong morale and stable morale of our front-line troops can also be brought back to the rear by the members of the comfort groups who have seen and heard with their own eyes, and tell the whole people. This is enough to prove that our front and rear soldiers and civilians have become one, and the future of suppressing bandits is indeed optimistic. It is expected that the Battle of Feishui will surely secure the Yangtze and Huai Rivers forever, and lay the foundation for the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

### Editorial: Welcoming Mr. Hoffman

Mr. Hoffman, Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, arrived in Shanghai by plane on the 11th, accompanied by his special assistant, Mr. Lee Que-Shi, and Mr. Hebar, special assistant to Assistant Secretary of State Pan Libu. The Chinese and American leaders in Beijing and Shanghai have expressed a warm welcome to Mr. Hoffman's arrival. President Chiang Kai-shek has specially appointed Mr. Weng Wenhao, chairman of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, to come to Shanghai to greet him and will have a sincere discussion with him. Mr. Hoffman is the main figure in charge of foreign aid in the United States. This time, he came to China from Europe to conduct on-the-spot inspections, which is undoubtedly a prelude to the United States' expansion of aid to China. In addition to cherishing the importance of Mr. Hoffman's mission, we also welcome the arrival of Mr. Hoffman and his party with a heavy and enthusiastic mood.

Mr. Hoffman is a well-known political entrepreneur in the United States today. He has a very close relationship with the current government and is deeply trusted by President Truman. Before taking office, he served as the general manager of Studebaker Corporation, as well as the director of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Encyclopedia Britannica, United Airlines, New York Insurance Company, Chicago Company, etc. Therefore, his career and wisdom have been developed in many ways and have achieved remarkable achievements. In 1942, he served as honorary chairman of the U.S. United Aid to China Association. On April 5, 1948, he was appointed as the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, specializing in the implementation of the Marshall Plan. In the past six years, Mr. Hoffman has worked hard to engage in foreign aid and reconstruction, with planning and order, and has achieved remarkable achievements. He has a great reputation at home and abroad, especially his concern and emphasis on aid to China, which has long been admired by the Chinese government and the public. In terms of the traditional friendship between the American people and the government towards China, and in terms of Mr. Hoffman's outstanding achievements in hosting aid to China over the years, Mr. Hoffman is indeed the best and closest friend of the Chinese people and the government. Today, it is a very exciting and pleasant thing that a good friend has come from afar, and the significance it contains is extremely important.

In recent years, the United States' policy towards China seems to be wavering. The emphasis on Europe and the neglect of Asia in the "Marshall Plan" has had a sufficiently heavy impact on the reconstruction and security of Asia. It cannot be said that the Chinese government's call for the United States to provide greater assistance to China is not appropriate, but the United States has not yet made a clear statement. The United States' aid to China policy seems to have fallen into a dilemma. Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States coincided with Mr. Hoffman's departure from the United States to Europe. This time, Mr. Hoffman flew from the "cold war" Western Europe to the "hot war" Asian continent, and will have a new experience in policy and understanding, and then analyze the situation from the experience and formulate a new method to contribute to the United States government authorities. Therefore, Mr. Hoffman's trip is a welcome symbol in both the United States and China. Mr. Hoffman said when he left the United States on December 4: "My visit to China is to obtain impressions that can only be obtained through personal contact. The work of the resident Chinese branch has been underway for several months. If I can inspect the situation on the spot, I will have greater confidence and more understanding of the work that can be accomplished in China." This shows that the current stage of the United States' aid to China work is to seek practical assistance in prudence and to determine the size of assistance in experience. As for the premise of aid to China, we firmly believe that it has not wavered and needs to be strengthened.

It is reported that Mr. Hoffman will stay in China for four or five days, and will go to Beijing to meet President Chiang Kai-shek to exchange general opinions and plan to return to the United States via Korea after the 15th. Mr. Hoffman's inspection of Western Europe focused on the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This time, his work in the new continent of Asia focused on China and Korea. This fully shows that President Truman has recognized the urgency of the situation in China and Korea. Without practical and effective assistance, the development of the deteriorating situation in China and Korea is a matter of great concern. The traditional friendship between the American people and the government towards China is very deep. Today, China has suffered long-term destruction and communist rebellion, and its finances and economy have become even more difficult. All economic reconstruction work has been hindered and destroyed. Therefore, for the survival of the Chinese nation and the progress of economic reconstruction, the Chinese people and the government sincerely hope that the United States will strengthen its aid to China.

It is still necessary to explain to the people of Hoffman. In recent years, American friends have often criticized our government based on the loyalty of good friends. We deeply understand this, because the deeper the concern, the deeper the disappointment. However, because of this, the evil propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party is inevitable, thinking that the Chinese people may have abandoned today's National Government, or even that the Chinese people no longer insist on anti-communism; this is a big mistake. Mr. Hoffman has come to Shanghai, the economic center of China. We sincerely hope that he can have the opportunity to contact the leaders of the Chinese industrial and commercial circles and listen to their opinions, so that he can know the absurdity of the Communist Party's propaganda. Yesterday, at the founding meeting of more than 1,000 members of the Shanghai Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association, when discussing the constitution, the whole group unanimously passed the resolution to support the head of state, assist the government, promote political and social innovation, and mobilize the people's strength to save themselves and save the country. This is the clear proof that the Chinese people will never compromise with the Communist Party under the firm call of President Chiang Kai-shek. If the United States wants to implement the spread of communist forces throughout the world, it should strengthen its aid to the National Government led by President Chiang Kai-shek.

Mr. Hoffman is the executor of the Marshall Plan and a politician who values ​​reality and experience. Today, China needs more and greater assistance from the United States. I think Mr. Hoffman will have a deep understanding of this trip, and bring these fresh insights from the Asian continent back to the American continent. The strengthening of U.S. aid to China in the future should start with Mr. Hoffman's successful visit; this is what we can expect.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] The Northeast Materials Adjustment Bureau previously purchased 400,000 shi of levied grain in Hunan, and 180,000 shi have been shipped out one after another. The remaining 220,000 shi have also been collected and transported to Changsha early. However, Chang Pan abandoned the city, and in fact, the Northeast no longer needs food. The Hunan Economic Commission approved the purchase at a reserve price to alleviate the food shortage in the province.

### Mobilization Period for Suppression of Rebellion: Regulations for Issuing Identification Cards

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The identification card formats of various provinces, cities, and counties differ greatly, and the content also varies. Inspectors often find it difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit cards, and criminals take the opportunity to forge them, causing confusion. Regarding this matter, according to the Population Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, the current identification cards issued by various provinces and cities are printed independently based on the formats attached to the Implementation Rules of the Household Registration Law. The paper may vary, but the content is uniformly regulated. Only the "Candidate for Public Office" column in the original format was changed to the "National Obligatory Labor" column in January of the 36th year [of the Republic]. Furthermore, the identification card formats previously issued by provinces and cities such as Henan, Jiangsu, and Nanjing differed slightly from the provisions of the Household Registration Law, but they have now been corrected. In order to strengthen the effectiveness and control of identification cards during the mobilization period for the suppression of rebellion, the Ministry has also formulated the Implementation Regulations for the Production and Issuance of National Identification Cards during the Mobilization Period for the Suppression of Rebellion, which have been submitted for approval and promulgation. The full text is recorded as follows:

Article 4: As a principle, all national identification cards shall have a photograph affixed, and a steel stamp shall be affixed to the seam of the photograph. If it is indeed difficult to take a photograph, a fingerprint impression may be temporarily used instead.

Article 5: Each county shall prepare a register of national identification cards issued, and affix the photograph of the recipient, or record their fingerprint impression for reference.

Article 6: National identification cards shall be issued uniformly to people aged eighteen and above, and provinces and cities shall decide on the procedures for those under the age of eighteen.

Article 17: Those who forge or alter national identification cards, or sell, transfer, or fraudulently receive national identification cards with the intention of plotting wrongdoing, shall be sent to the judicial authorities for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law.

### Final Debate on the Korean Question: Soviet Union Uses Delaying Tactics; Third UN General Assembly Adjourns One Day Late

[United Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly reconvened its plenary session at 2:45 PM today to continue discussing the Korean question.

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to close on the evening of the 11th. However, the Soviet bloc used lengthy speeches to address the Korean issue, preventing the General Assembly from adjourning as scheduled. The meeting on the 11th lasted until 2:00 AM. The President of the General Assembly, Evatt, was exhausted and, hearing the Soviet bloc reiterate its old accusations against the US action in South Korea, resolutely declared a recess. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Manuilsky, spoke for 55 minutes first, and the Chinese representative, Chiang Ting-fu, immediately spoke for 8 minutes in response. The Byelorussian representative, Kiselev, also took the stage to deliver a lengthy speech. The Political Committee had already voted to recognize the South Korean government as the legitimate government of Korea and to establish a permanent United Nations Commission on Korea, to be appointed by the nations on the Interim Committee. The Soviet Union strongly opposed this. Manuilsky stepped onto the podium and announced that he intended to discuss the Korean dispute "in detail," continuing to denounce the United States for using terror to force the South Korean elections. He also stated that the United States had no right to unilaterally preside over the Korean elections and that they should be presided over by the major powers. As Manuilsky spoke at length, the representatives appeared unable to bear it. Evatt, who usually listened attentively to the speeches of the representatives, took off his headphones and slumped in his chair. The New Zealand Prime Minister, Fraser, fell sound asleep. Manuilsky protested angrily, but Fraser remained motionless and sound asleep. When Kiselev took the stage, only 145 people remained in the public gallery, barely enough to fill it.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] The United Nations General Assembly failed to take final action on the Korean question this morning and is scheduled to meet again this afternoon in order to seek a solution to the Korean question before leaving Paris. The General Assembly must pass the joint proposal of China, the United States, and Australia. This proposal has already been passed by an overwhelming majority in the 58-nation Political Committee. It (1) recognizes the Korean government elected under the supervision of the United Nations as legitimate; (2) establishes a Korean commission to continue the work of the current temporary delegation to Korea, with the same member countries; and (3) advocates the rapid withdrawal of the occupying forces stationed in Korea. This proposal is being strongly opposed by the Soviet bloc countries. The Chinese representative, Chiang Ting-fu, spoke after midnight last night, arguing that the General Assembly should complete action on the Korean question at this time. He said, "Our work is only half done. If we make an appropriate decision tonight, 30 million Koreans will be forever grateful." Although the representatives of the Slavic countries are using lengthy speeches to delay the time, observers seem to believe that the Korean question will definitely be put to a vote at this afternoon's meeting.

### Achievements of the Current General Assembly

[United Press, Paris, 12th] The current General Assembly received a total of 75 proposals, and less than 60 were passed by vote, many of which were minor issues. The important resolutions are listed below:

(1) Recognition of the South Korean government. (2) Establishment of a Palestine Conciliation Commission. (3) Ordering the UN Atomic Energy Commission to continue working on international control of atomic energy and instructing the United States, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Canada to jointly draft an atomic energy control convention. (4) Rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal for the four major powers to disarm by one-third within one year and to ban atomic bombs. The General Assembly requested the Disarmament Commission to continue drafting a arms control plan. (5) Adoption of the world's first Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (6) Adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. (7) Condemnation of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for assisting Greek guerrillas, the General Assembly's most forceful action against the Balkan states. (8) Adoption of Mexico's request that the four major powers negotiate directly and resolve the Berlin dispute as soon as possible. The President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, sent letters to the leaders of the four powers based on this resolution, appealing for peace.

### Eighty-Two Days of Meetings: Many Speeches Filled with Indignation; All Kinds of Meeting Affairs Statistics Break Records

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The speeches delivered during this session of the General Assembly totaled 10 million words, but no one can accurately estimate how much of it was filled with indignation.

### Yugoslavia Asks the United Nations to Save Greek Political Prisoners

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Yugoslav delegation sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, tonight, requesting the saving of 620 criminals sentenced to death by Greek military tribunals for participating in the Greek Communist movement three years ago.

### UN General Assembly Representatives Invited to a Banquet by the French President

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] French President Auriol hosted a banquet for the representatives of the countries attending the current General Assembly at the Presidential Palace today.

During the banquet, the President of the General Assembly, Evatt, expressed his sincere gratitude to France on behalf of the countries for their hospitality. He said, "Although France has various difficulties, the whole country is still full of confidence, harmony, and a calm atmosphere. Future history will definitely point out that the current General Assembly has made a great contribution to the establishment of world peace. France's great spirit has made the United Nations even stronger." In his reply, President Auriol praised the representatives of the countries as the bearers of great hope and the workers of noble and arduous tasks. When referring to France's domestic problems, the President said, "Our country is striving to recover. Our country's fatal wound is the depletion of resources, which makes it impossible to cope with the heavy responsibility of reconstruction."

### US, France, and Turkey Form a Three-Person Committee to Mediate Peace in Palestine; UN General Assembly Overturns Partition Plan and Bernadotte Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Five-Power Committee has elected France, the United States, and Turkey to form a Palestine Conciliation Committee by a vote of four to one. The Soviet Union suggested that Poland replace Turkey. Subsequently, the General Assembly approved it by a vote of 40 to 7 (Guatemala and the Slavic countries) with four abstentions.

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The General Assembly passed a resolution tonight by a vote of 35 to 15, with 8 abstentions, to establish a three-person Palestine Conciliation Committee to restore peace in the Holy Land as soon as possible. The countries that voted against it were Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries, and the six countries of the Soviet bloc. When the President of the General Assembly, Evatt, submitted the case for a vote, he appealed to the General Assembly to pass it by a majority of more than two-thirds, which won the General Assembly warm applause at the time. Earlier, the General Assembly passed a resolution by a vote of 44 to 0, with 9 abstentions, to abolish the UN General Assembly's partition plan for the Holy Land and the Bernadotte Report. The three-person conciliation resolution stipulates: (1) The General Assembly may establish a three-person conciliation committee, headquartered in Jerusalem.

### Representatives' Farewell Statements: Deep Fear that the Cold War May Lead to a Hot War

[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The current General Assembly is nearing its end, but the Cold War between East and West is still raging, and the Berlin crisis has not been resolved. As the representatives pack their bags to prepare to meet again in New York on April 1 next year, they have issued statements and documents, all of which express fear of a new war breaking out. The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, broadcast on the United Nations radio station that the West has fallen into a war mood. The United States, on the other hand, is surrounding the Soviet Union with military bases. The acting head of the US delegation, Dulles, declared that the majority of countries in the United Nations are becoming more united and can prevent war from happening. He appealed to all parties not to speculate on another world war. Evatt blamed the great powers for plunging the world into chaos. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, called on the great powers to end the Cold War before the General Assembly reconvenes.

Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Military and Political Leaders of This City Were Invited to Attend and Provide Guidance; Support the Head of State in Achieving the Goal of Saving the Nation

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Zhongzheng Road yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Over 1,000 members attended. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, and directors of various bureaus of this city were all invited to attend and provide guidance. Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiliang, Qian Yongming, Chen Qicai, Zhang Yi, Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Cheng Zhongxing, Tao Baichuan, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Dihua, Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, Qin Runxiang, Yang Hu and other 21 people were elected as the presidium, and Du Yuesheng was elected as the chairman to preside over the opening ceremony. The meeting opened at 10:30 AM, beginning with an address by Chairman Du Yuesheng, who briefly stated: Since the government's military suppression has progressed to the Xuzhou-Bengbu area, the battlefront is getting closer to Shanghai, and people in all circles of this city are becoming increasingly nervous. Under this tense atmosphere, although a very small number of people are thinking of escaping, the majority of people are considering how to contribute their strength to protect Shanghai, where we live and work, and to keep it forever complete and prosperous. Shanghai is a key financial and economic center of the country, with a population of more than five million. It is the transportation hub of the country and a major world city. Its importance to China and the world, whether in the past, present, or future, is self-evident. Therefore, loving and protecting Shanghai is not only the responsibility of the people of Shanghai but also the common obligation of people throughout China and the world. To accomplish this arduous task, we must unite the human and material resources of all circles in Shanghai, and under the leadership of the Head of State, launch the work of saving Shanghai and saving the nation. We must also start this movement of self-salvation and national salvation, and even saving the world, in this city, and encourage the compatriots throughout the country to promote it, to win the sympathy and assistance of people who love freedom and peace around the world. The motivation for the organization of this association lies here. Its organizational methods and work program have been carefully formulated. Today, this association is established, and the number of participants is unprecedented. We are infinitely grateful for the presence and guidance of the military and political leaders of this city. Historically, although Shanghai has experienced major disasters, it has always been safe and sound because we were brave in self-help. We hope that this self-salvation and national salvation movement can also inherit our past glory. Let us all muster courage to support the Head of State, quickly achieve the goal of saving the nation and saving the world, and make Shanghai forever a fortress of justice, a beacon of civilization, standing in the Far East.

Pooling Efforts to Seek More Happiness; Concentrating Contributions of Human and Material Resources; Assisting the Government in Reforming Politics

Next, Chairman Pan, as the representative of the preparatory committee, reported on the initiation and preparation process. He stated: Since the National Army withdrew from the Northeast Changpan due to strategic considerations, and Jinan was also lost, and the Xuzhou-Bengbu battle began, people in Nanjing and Shanghai were uneasy, and society was turbulent. A small number of government officials, some local wealthy people, even took their families elsewhere to escape reality. Fortunately, our highest authorities have remained firm and the national policy of suppressing the rebellion has remained unshaken. The soldiers on the front lines shed blood to kill the enemy and defend the territory, and the people in the rear gradually became stable. People from all social organizations in Shanghai who were concerned about national affairs exchanged opinions and agreed that under the current critical situation, strengthening people's hearts, self-salvation, and national salvation is the only way to assist the government in saving the country, hence the establishment of this association. Many people are asking about the situation on the front lines? How about the aid? But no one asks how about themselves? This is a big mistake. If foreigners ask you, what are Chinese people doing themselves? If the soldiers on the front lines ask the compatriots in the rear, how can they contribute to the country, what will we say? Shanghai is an international city, and all actions can play a leading role. We believe that to protect Shanghai, we must concentrate all the strength of the citizens of Shanghai and contribute this entire strength to the country. If the country is saved, Shanghai will also be saved, and we will save ourselves. Mr. Pan said that the cruelty and inhuman practices of the communists can be confirmed by the compatriots who fled to Shanghai from the communist areas. The people's war tactics used by the communists are to force all compatriots in the communist areas, from the ages of eighteen to forty-five, in batches to the front lines of combat, serving as cannon fodder in the first line. Some people in Shanghai are planning to leave Shanghai. This method is a dead end. Their own lives and property must be protected with their own strength in order to be saved. The initiators of this association have held several meetings, and after nearly a month of preparation, drafted an outline of the organization for discussion at the conference. Its members will include all Shanghai legal entities and their directors and supervisors who are determined to save the country, as well as all volunteers who wish to join the association, working together. The purpose of the establishment of this association is to work hard with the goal of supporting the Head of State, assisting the government, and strengthening confidence, hoping to achieve: (1) concentrate and contribute human and material resources to the country and local areas, (2) assist the government in reforming politics, use the strength of the people to urge the government to work hard and govern with the people, and strengthen our foreign policy, so that the anti-aggression camp is more clear, and the political situation is completely new, and then we can gain the attention of international allies and strengthen their assistance to us. As the ancient saying goes, "God helps those who help themselves." Today, the citizens of Shanghai must pool their efforts to support the Head of State and eliminate the communists in the roar of 5 million citizens, which is our responsibility to save ourselves and save the country.

Everyone Must Think from a Distance to Save the Country and Shanghai

Next, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, Mayor Wu Guozhen, and Commander Chen Daqing delivered training speeches separately. Commander-in-Chief Tang said: (1) Saving the country is saving oneself. I hope everyone will think from a distance and think big to save the country and Shanghai. (2) Shanghai's market is related to the country and the world. Please concentrate your strength and exert your strength to save the current crisis. I also hope that the Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association will maintain order and security in Shanghai, assist the government, and launch national salvation work. (3) We should strengthen our confidence and support the government in order to save ourselves and save the country. At present, the government has inherent shortcomings, and there are also shortcomings in the local area, resulting in such a difficult situation. Therefore, politics must be reformed, and the local area should also be reformed. Moreover, it must be comprehensively reformed to create a new atmosphere and generate new strength in order to save the country and Shanghai.

General Huang Baitao Died for the Country; Shipowner Zhang Hanting's Courage and Righteousness; Soldiers on the Front Lines and People in the Rear Should Emulate Self-Salvation and National Salvation

Mayor Wu said: "Today, the All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation United Association of this city is holding its inaugural meeting. I am very excited to be invited to participate in the meeting. This time, all circles in Shanghai are organizing a 'Self-Salvation and National Salvation' group. I am deeply moved by the fact that Shipowner Zhang Hanting of the Jiangya Wheel was able to act bravely and save more than 500 passengers in distress. This chivalrous spirit is enough to influence the world. If each and every one of us is like a courageous and righteous shipowner, we can save ourselves. I recall that since the Battle of Xuzhou-Bengbu, General Huang Baitao wiped out 100,000 communist troops with 50,000 soldiers, defeating the many with the few. In the end, in order to show that he would live and die with his soldiers, he sacrificed himself for the country. This spirit of regarding death as home can serve as a model for military officers in our country. If every soldier on the front line can be like General Huang, our country will be saved. I hope that the soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear should emulate General Huang, who sacrificed himself for the country, and Mr. Zhang Hanting, who rescued people with courage and righteousness, and work together to save themselves and save the country. Secondly, to defend Shanghai, we must first stabilize Shanghai. To stabilize Shanghai, we must first stabilize people's hearts and respond calmly. The Communist Party is accustomed to using rumors. For example, my wife has been ill for four months, and she is still being treated. The communists spread rumors that my family has moved away. This has little impact on me personally, but it greatly shakes people's hearts. I hope everyone will be safe in their own businesses, not easily believe rumors, concentrate their efforts, save themselves and save the country, and complete the mission.
