### False Report of Stalin's Death Briefly Draws Attention from All Circles in Nanjing and Shanghai; Reuters Has Voluntarily Corrected and Apologized

[Our Dispatch] The news of Stalin's death, which originated from Berne, the capital of free Switzerland, has attracted global attention, but has not yet been confirmed, and Moscow has remained silent. The local English-language Free Tribune published the news of "Stalin is Dead" on the front page yesterday morning with a large headline. The source of the news was Reuters, which stated: "According to Reuters, Moscow Radio announced Stalin's death at 2:30 AM on Saturday." As soon as the news was published, it immediately attracted attention from all circles. As a result, after various investigations, the news was not accurate, and Reuters authorities were the first to voluntarily deny it. According to the agency's explanation, the issuance of the news was due to a misunderstanding, which was caused by a reporter of the agency misreading a torn wireless telegram and notifying the newspaper office by telephone. The original telegram stated: "American newspapers published telegrams from abroad stating that it is widely rumored that Marshal Stalin has died in Moscow." However, a report denying the news was subsequently received.

Reuters expressed its sincere apologies for the incorrect report. The local Soviet authorities made no comment on this matter, believing that the denial of the news could be made by Reuters itself. After the "News of Stalin's Death" was published yesterday, many "comedic" things almost happened. After reading the newspaper, a diplomat from a certain country was about to go to the Soviet consulate to offer condolences, but gave up after a colleague inquired with the newspaper office and found it to be inaccurate.

[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] The "New China Daily" in Nanjing published an extra edition at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, reporting the news of Stalin's death. Almost the entire first page of the extra edition was filled with reports about Stalin, including a detailed biography of his life. It also stated that rumors of Stalin's illness had been circulating for several months. The newspaper claimed that Stalin passed away at 2:30 AM on the 10th (Moscow time). The source of the news was "Shanghai Telegrams," but details about the death and how Shanghai received the news were omitted.

Listening to Moscow Radio broadcasts at 3:00 PM this afternoon, there was no news about Stalin.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Qi Hezhen, the Soviet Deputy Consul General in Beiping, denied the rumors that Stalin was suffering from right hemiplegia, saying that this was malicious slander, and said: Stalin sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Chiang on New Year's Day this year, which can serve as proof to the contrary.

### The Designation of Beiping as the Auxiliary Capital Inspires the People of the North; He Siyuan Says He is Determined to Work Hard for Construction

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] After the Executive Yuan officially designated Beiping as the auxiliary capital, Mayor He Siyuan issued a statement saying: Beiping is a military, political, and economic hub, and especially the cultural center of the Far East. The government's official designation of Beiping as the auxiliary capital demonstrates the great importance it attaches to the North. I believe that the people of North China will also feel the same excitement upon hearing this news. During this time of suppression of the rebellion, Beiping's mission is particularly important. We should unite more, work harder, and be more vigilant to complete the tasks that Beiping should fulfill. The city's urban plan has always aimed at building Beiping into a modern capital. In the future, we will strive to advance towards this goal, so that Beiping can advance from being the auxiliary capital to becoming the capital. According to the facts of modern Chinese history, all times when Beiping was the capital were after major turmoil. I believe that the government's designation of Beiping as the auxiliary capital this time will also be a sign that the country will soon achieve unification. I am willing to encourage this with my fellow countrymen in North China.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping City Council, said: The passage of the Executive Yuan's decision to designate Beiping as the auxiliary capital makes the people of the North feel grateful. Although it may seem empty, the impact is very good. Beiping should now be renamed Beijing. The council has decided to telegraph the central government tomorrow to make this suggestion.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Hu Shi said that he was very happy to hear that the Executive Yuan had passed the decision to designate Beiping as the auxiliary capital, and he hoped that in the future, at least when Nanjing is hot in the summer, the political center could be moved to Beiping for three or four months each year.

### Key Points of the Draft Implementation Measures for the Industrial Part of the Economic Program

Expand existing factories and establish new factories. 3. Establish agricultural tool manufacturing plants in various counties across the country and encourage private operation. 4. Launch private factories to manufacture small trains, ships, and other vehicles to develop rural transportation.

Original Program: The Focus of Industrial Development. Implementation Measures: (A) 1. Solid fuels: Encourage people to open their own coal mines, strengthen production in the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and Taiwan, and develop coal production in Central China, South China, and Southwest China.

Focus on increasing the production of minerals that can be exported and precious metals that can be used as a currency fund. Encourage private operation and adjust government procurement methods. 3. For mines with existing foundations such as copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, and magnesium, production should be promoted, and the aluminum smelting and aluminum manufacturing industries in Taiwan should be advanced. 4. Supervise the increase in production of mineral products such as iron, manganese, aluminum, and magnesium related to copper and iron industries, and basic industrial raw materials such as pyrite. 5. Radioactive minerals are entirely operated by the government, and their sales and transportation are strictly controlled. (C) For copper and iron production, efforts must be made to meet half of the national needs within three years. Special convenience should be given to the turnover of funds, the supply of raw materials, and the transportation of finished products. 2. Supervise the increase in cement production and pay attention to exports. (D) Establish machinery manufacturing plants in major industrial zones to manufacture in large quantities. (E) Essential industrial raw materials and equipment that cannot be produced domestically should be imported and stored from abroad.

Cotton textile industry: Use existing spindles to complete a production capacity of 4.5 million spindles, add new factories in cotton-producing areas, increase by 3 million spindles within five years, and increase to 12.5 million spindles within ten years. The wool textile industry currently has 110,000 spindles and should increase by 100,000 spindles within five years and 200,000 spindles within the second five years. The ramie textile industry should establish machine textile factories in ramie-producing areas. The ramie cloth should be increased to 40,000 spindles in the first five years and 120,000 spindles in the second five years. The existing 6,400 ramie bag textile machines should be increased by 10,000 spindles in the first five years and 20,000 spindles in the second five years. The existing 26,000 silk spindles should be increased by 100,000 spindles within ten years. In terms of technology, the competent authorities will guide improvements, set product standards, encourage the manufacture of new textile machines, and the competent authorities will coordinate the rational allocation of raw material substitution and finished product sales. 2. The flour and oil manufacturing industries should be expanded and improved, sugar production should be increased, canneries, refrigeration, drying, pickling, and sweetening industries should be established, and chemical industries related to food should also be established to manufacture their own products. 3. The salt production industry should improve the refining methods and expand the production of by-products. 4. The paper industry should be rewarded and assisted, mechanical pulp mills should be promoted, and the government should promote the manufacture of copper wire cloth and blankets for paper making. 5. The printing industry should be mechanized, and efforts should be made to manufacture and supply raw materials domestically. 6. For the wood needed for the construction industry, the government should encourage private companies to manufacture it in large quantities. 7. Local governments should handle or support private operation as much as possible for the construction of short-distance transportation.

Original Program: Scope of State-Owned and Private Operation. Implementation Measures: The scope of state-owned and private operation should be re-determined with reference to the Industrial Construction Conference and the Five-Year Material Construction Plan, based on the actual damage to industries in the recovered areas and the available reparation goods, so as to achieve proper coordination and achieve the highest efficiency.

Original Program: Areas for Industrial Construction. Implementation Measures: The division of construction areas should still refer to the agricultural, industrial, mining, transportation, resources, natural environment, customs, habits, and social conditions of various places, and refer to the research results of various agencies in the past, which will be studied in detail by the relevant ministries and commissions before a decision is made.

Original Program: Supporting Small-Scale Industries. Implementation Measures: Small industries and handicrafts should be earnestly supported and improved according to local conditions. The supply of raw materials and the sale of finished products should be centrally managed, and special handicrafts should be rewarded for establishing export organizations. In terms of technology, the government should set standards to improve quality and provide loan facilities.

Original Program: Increasing International Exports. Implementation Measures: Exported products should emphasize processed products from an industrial standpoint, and replace semi-finished products and raw materials with finished product exports as much as possible. (Continued on page two)

### Difficult to Reduce Expenditures During the Suppression of the Rebellion; The Government Decides to Focus on Increasing Revenue; Xu Baiyuan Discusses Measures to Rectify Tax Collection

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan said: The government is determined to balance revenue and expenditure, but because it is difficult to reduce expenditures on military affairs for suppressing the rebellion and the destruction by the communist bandits, it focuses on increasing revenue, mainly by rectifying tax collection. There are four strategies for rectifying tax collection: 1. Collect taxes according to changes in prices. For example, the commodity tax, which used to be adjusted every three months, is now adjusted every month. 2. Implement pre-collection measures. For example, income tax will follow the British pre-collection method, which will be settled later. 3. Adjust tariffs. Except for the regular tax, which is limited by international tariff agreements and cannot be changed, the surtax will be increased from 5% to 50%. In addition, wartime tax exemptions for gasoline, diesel, and kerosene will also be restored. 4. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will authorize the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to adjust tax rates at any time according to price increases. Regarding local finances, there have been many difficulties in the past, with subsidies from the central government reaching more than 82%. Starting this year, efforts will be stepped up to rectify the land tax, of which the original central government portion (30%) will be reallocated to the provinces to enrich local financial resources. At the same time, local tax collection will be rectified. For example, the collection of business tax has been poor after being allocated to local governments. In the future, it should be earnestly rectified to increase revenue. In this way, the financial situation of local governments will improve, and the central government will no longer need to subsidize them. In short, regardless of whether there is foreign aid, the rectification of tax collection is an urgent task at present. If tax collection is successful and finances can be put on track, otherwise, even if the currency system is reformed, and revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, finances will not be stable after the issuance of the new currency.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The issue of land tax revenue being allocated to the provinces and counties has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It is understood that the implementation period will be after the start of constitutional government, because the grain year is from September of each year to the end of August of the following year. The current collection is still of last year's land tax, so the implementation of this measure will be after the implementation of constitutional government. In addition, after the land tax is allocated to local governments, the duties of the Ministry of Food will still include the important tasks of regulating food for the people and coordinating military grain, so there will be no changes in the organizational structure.

### Expanded Food Rationing in Five Cities Can Begin in March

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The plan formulated by the Ministry of Food to implement expanded rationing in the five major cities of Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and to raise food sources, has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and is being reviewed by Premier Zhang Qun. It is understood that the main point is to purchase foreign rice to make up for the insufficient food supply. The amount listed in the plan is 50 tons, which is the amount needed for eight months. In addition to the grain purchased by the China Grain Corporation and the grain purchased by the China Trust Bureau from the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the existing public education grain, there is still a shortage of 250,000 tons. The government originally allocated 200,000 tons of foreign rice to the Ministry of Food for purchase, and the remaining 50,000 tons can be purchased domestically. However, the purchase of foreign rice requires a huge amount of foreign exchange, so a report has been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, and discussions are underway with Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank. Zhang said that it can be purchased in batches, but the Executive Yuan has not yet approved it, and the Ministry of Food has no way to comply. It is now working on preparations for the rationing procedures. Once the Executive Yuan approves it and sends it to the ministry, it can begin. A spokesman for the Ministry of Food said: The authorities are determined to implement it as soon as possible, so it may begin in March.

### Detailed Rules for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering Are Formulated

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Executive Yuan decided to hand over the drafting of the detailed rules for the implementation of the measures to suppress hoarding and profiteering to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian on the 10th, they have been drafted and will be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. Chen also left for Shanghai by night train on the 10th.

### Relevant Information on Salary Calculation Based on Civil Servant Index Is Being Reviewed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] After the Executive Yuan passed the measures to adjust the treatment of civil and military public educators, the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government has submitted various indexes and related information to the Executive Yuan for review. It is heard that the zoning measures and the indexes for each zone will be discussed and decided at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 13th.

### The Ministry of Finance Is Considering Opening Up Industrial and Commercial Loans; The Four Joint Offices Will Submit for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Ministry of Finance has recently ordered the national banks to draft opinions on the issue of opening up industrial and commercial loans, which may be submitted for discussion at the meeting of the Four Joint Offices next Thursday. According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices are considering this carefully. It is also heard that the meeting of the Four Joint Offices next Thursday will be presided over by Chairman Chiang himself. It is also learned that regarding the management of domestic exchange, the Ministry of Finance does not intend to formulate separate measures, but will continue to order the national banks to adjust and regulate them at any time according to the actual situation.

### The Executive Yuan Plans Six Measures for Raising Funds for Various Agencies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Yuan believes that the 37th year general budget has not yet completed the drafting and review process, and the approval still requires a considerable amount of time. In order to prepare for the transfer of funds from the national treasury as soon as possible, so as not to affect the implementation of government affairs, it has referred to past precedents and formulated six measures for the transfer of funds for various expenses of various agencies before the 37th year general budget is approved and implemented. These measures have been submitted to the National Government for approval and reported to the State Council meeting on the 9th.

### Kowloon City House Demolition Issue: Hong Kong Government Offers One-Sided Explanation; Yeh Kung-ch'ao Discussed Matter with Hong Kong Governor Yesterday

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 10th] The Hong Kong government issued a statement today explaining that the demolition of wooden houses in the old Kowloon City area is to safeguard the health and lives of residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon. For more than a year, the Hong Kong government has been pursuing a policy of removing residents occupying crown land in various areas, because they are detrimental to public health. The procedure adopted this time in Kowloon is based on this policy. Before implementation, the Hong Kong authorities gave the occupants adequate notice and informed them of relocation options, encouraging them to apply for new housing. No force was used during the execution of the removal order, and only one person was slightly injured when a house collapsed.

The Hong Kong government's statement did not mention Kuo Teh-hua, Special Commissioner for Kwangtung and Kwangsi of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated that the Chinese government would hold the Hong Kong government responsible for the demolition of the houses and reserve the right to demand compensation. It is generally believed that the Hong Kong government's statement is a rejection of Kuo's demands.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 10th] After being dispatched to Rangoon to attend the Burmese Independence Day celebrations, Vice Minister Yeh Kung-ch'ao suddenly visited here today, met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham for an hour to discuss the matter. Before the meeting he declared to representatives of the Kowloon City residents that the Chinese and Hong Kong governments would cooperate to resolve the house demolition issue. Upon hearing this, the residents' emotions have calmed down. At the same time, the Hong Kong government issued a statement today denying the existence of jurisdictional rights in Kowloon City.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] Vice Minister Yeh Kung-ch'ao arrived in Guangzhou at 5:00 PM on the 10th from Hong Kong on a special plane, accompanied by Kuo Teh-hua, Special Commissioner for Kwangtung and Kwangsi. According to Yeh, he has never given up sovereignty over Kowloon City.

### Currency Reform Plan Finalized: Divided into Exchange Standard and Silver Standard, Pei Tsu-yi to Discuss and Decide with Americans

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Rumors of currency reform have been circulating for a long time, but have only recently become concrete. According to highly reliable sources, the Ministry of Finance has finalized a concrete plan for currency reform and submitted it to President Chiang for review. This plan will be taken to the United States by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi to be studied in detail with American financial figures and monetary experts, because if the currency reform is decided to be implemented, it cannot succeed without American assistance. Observers point out that among the personnel accompanying Mr. Pei to the United States is currency expert Chu Pao-chen, which proves that Mr. Pei's trip carries the task of studying with the Americans, and even negotiating for American assistance in currency reform. Government officials here feel that in order to remedy the current problem of constantly rising prices and the continuous devaluation of legal tender, the only way is currency reform, so all parties hope that Mr. Pei's trip will achieve success in the area of currency.

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Qualified figures in the financial community recently discussed the currency reform issue, stating: The government's plan for currency reform can be roughly divided into two parts: exchange standard and silver standard, but which method will ultimately be used to reform the currency will depend on American aid. The plan that Mr. Pei is taking to the United States this time includes both methods. After arriving in the United States, the decision will be made based on which method the Americans adopt. If an exchange standard is adopted, the United States will lend us more than 300 million US dollars to serve as a foreign exchange fund. If it is a silver standard, it also seems possible that the Americans will adopt it, because the United States has a silver surplus. At the same time, the national treasury has a lot of silver reserves, and if we continue to use silver coins in the future, we can restore the credit of silver dollars. If the United States adopts a silver standard, then it will lend us silver equivalent to 300 million US dollars, so which method will be adopted in the future depends on the reality of American aid to China.

[This Newspaper, Nanking, 10th] Pei Tsu-yi, head of the technical delegation to the United States, has decided to fly to the United States from Shanghai on the 14th. He has been in Nanking for several days, contacting the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and other agencies, and the collection of necessary information has been completed. He took the night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the 10th, and after a brief preparation, he will depart for the United States. When this newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Pei before his departure, Mr. Pei only said: He decided to fly to the United States on the 14th. He avoided answering the reporter's questions about American aid. When the reporter asked whether Mr. Pei's trip was to contact the Americans about currency reform, Mr. Pei smiled and said: "You know more about this issue than I do." Mr. Pei said: Most of the information he is taking this time is related to finance, economy, and transportation, and is very comprehensive. Regarding the length of his stay in the United States, Mr. Pei said: It is difficult to predict at this time, and everything will be done according to the government's instructions. When Mr. Pei left Nanking, Foreign Minister Wang, represented by Liu Shih-shun, and China Bank Manager Peng Hu, all went to the station to see him off.

### Details of American Aid to China Nearing Completion; Marshall Awaits Meeting with Yu and Pei; Monetary Issues Awaiting Final Decision

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall announced at a press conference today: I intend to personally meet with the Chinese technical representatives Yu Ta-wei and Pei Tsu-yi to consult on American aid to China. The State Department said: Yu and Pei are expected to arrive in Washington this week, but the Chinese Embassy said that it may be delayed somewhat, and it is difficult to predict when they will arrive. Marshall also said: The American government's aid to China plan may require approximately 300 million yuan in expenses over fifteen months starting in April. The details have been drafted and are now awaiting final decision. The final decision is related to other government departments and is a complex monetary issue. When asked whether the aid to China plan could be submitted to Congress for discussion within a few weeks, Marshall replied: I am afraid that there will not be such a long delay.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 9th] The Saturday Evening Post editorial stated: "Our policy toward China is still unclear." The Republican Party has its reasons for being anxious about China. All efforts to unite President Chiang and the Communists have failed, "but we do not seem to have begun another lesson." But if the United States delays and decides to contact Moscow, what will happen? Four hundred and fifty million Chinese people will be armed, industrialized, and ruled for the historical benefit of the war.

### A Study of the True Value of Legal Tender

— Chang Pai-yi

Since the late period of the War of Resistance to the present, the value of Chinese legal tender has gradually fallen into a long-term decline. Moreover, the existence of speculative markets in major cities, the existence of a small number of treacherous individuals intentionally hoarding and speculating, and the existence of the behavior of the majority of the people unintentionally speculating and vying to purchase unnecessary or non-urgent materials, have caused the issue of the value of legal tender to fall into chaos.

Until recently, prices have increased by an average of 120,000 to 130,000 times compared to pre-war levels. In other words, one pre-war yuan of legal tender is roughly equivalent to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan of legal tender today. Is this standard reasonable? This is a big question.

If we use the Quantity Theory of Money to study the true value of legal tender today, the conclusion we reach will inevitably negate today's value standard for legal tender. Because although legal tender today is in a state of inflation and its value is gradually depreciating, the degree of its depreciation is definitely not as low as today's market standard.

Economist Huang Yuan-bin recently gave a speech in Guangzhou, stating that since around October of last year, every time the amount of legal tender issued doubles, prices rise tenfold. Therefore, the reason for the high rise in prices is, generally speaking, one-tenth due to the increased issuance of legal tender, and nine-tenths due to the people's lack of faith in legal tender. Indeed, according to my research, the reason why the market value of legal tender is so low today is due to the national psychology of excessively suppressing legal tender. If the national psychology towards legal tender could be changed, then the value of legal tender would definitely not fall to such a low level.

If we now study the Real Value of legal tender, we must first understand the following two figures:

1.  The cumulative amount of national fiscal deficits of the National Government since the War of Resistance, and the total amount of legal tender issued estimated from this.

2.  The amount of currency in circulation in various countries before and after World War II—especially those countries with closer economic ties to China—and the true standard for measuring today's exchange rate of Chinese legal tender.

If we can obtain the above two main real figures, then we can immediately measure the true value of legal tender today.

First, let's look at the amount of national fiscal deficits of the National Government since the War of Resistance. According to statistics from various sources, the figures are as follows:

(Unit: millions of legal tender)

Republic Year 26 (1937): 495.936

Republic Year 27 (1938) (Half Year): 395.650

Republic Year 28 (1939): 1,383.180

Republic Year 29 (1940): 4,007.156

Republic Year 30 (1941): 9,013.599

Republic Year 31 (1942): 19,777.034

Republic Year 32 (1943): 12,994.045

Republic Year 33 (1944): 53,896.156

Republic Year 34 (1945): 72,245.711

Republic Year 35 (1946): 939,113.443

Republic Year 36 (1947): 22,600,000.000

(Note: The figures for Republic Year 26 to Republic Year 32 are based on the Ministry of Finance's actual receipts and expenditures. The figures for Republic Year 33 to Republic Year 35 are based on the Financial Daily. The figure for Republic Year 36 is based on recent reports).

According to the table above, from Republic Year 26 to Republic Year 36, the cumulative amount of fiscal deficits in the past eleven years is 23,713,321,910,000 yuan. (Note: Wan Yi Ri Zhao). This amount is the accumulated amount of national fiscal deficits over the years. Although a portion of it has been made up by public bonds, the amount is not large. For the sake of simple calculation, we can take this number as the cumulative amount of Central Bank treasury withdrawals in the past eleven years, and it can also be taken as the cumulative amount of legal tender issued by the Central Bank in the past eleven years.

The amount of legal tender issued before the War of Resistance was 1.4 billion yuan. Adding the accumulated amount issued over the years, we can estimate that the amount of legal tender in circulation in Republic Year 36 is approximately 23,713,321,470,000 yuan.

The amount of legal tender issued before the war was 1.4 billion yuan, as mentioned earlier. Today it is 23,713,321,470,000 yuan, an increase of approximately 17,000 times. Assuming that we use the quantity of currency to convert the true value of legal tender before the war, then 17,000 yuan of legal tender today should be equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. But according to today's special prices, the increase is about 120,000 to 130,000 times compared to pre-war levels, which means that one yuan of legal tender before the war will be equal to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan of legal tender today. The great distance between them proves this, and it can also point out the impropriety of the people's excessive underestimation of the value of legal tender today.

Second, let's look at the currency circulation figures of major countries before and after World War II. According to the United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States was approximately 6 billion US dollars in 1937, and approximately 27.1 billion US dollars in August 1947. In the United Kingdom, the figure increased from 505 million pounds to 1.393 billion pounds during the same period. In India, the figure increased from 1.8 billion rupees to 11.8 billion rupees during the same period. In France, the figure increased from 94 billion francs to 832 billion francs during the same period. In Canada, the figure increased from 207 million Canadian dollars to 1.008 billion Canadian dollars during the same period. In Australia, the figure increased from 54 million Australian pounds to 206 million Australian pounds during the same period. This means that in the recent past compared to 1937 before the war, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States has increased by approximately 3.5 times. In the United Kingdom, the figure has increased by approximately 1 and 3/4 times. In India, the figure has increased by approximately 5.5 times. In France, the figure has increased by approximately 8 times. In Canada, the figure has increased by approximately 4 times. In Australia, the figure has increased by approximately 3 times.

Of particular note is the amount of currency in circulation in the United States, because the economic relationship between the United States and China is currently the closest, and it is also the world's economic leader. During and after the war, the trend of Chinese people vying to purchase US dollars was very strong, and our foreign exchange often used US exchange rates as a standard. However, the actual purchasing power of US currency has decreased due to the increase in circulation, and this fact does not seem to have been noticed by the general public in China. The detailed statistics on the amount of currency in circulation in the United States reported by the Federal Reserve Bulletin (September 1947) are listed below:

Statistics on the amount of US Coin and Small Denomination Currency in Circulation (Unit: millions of US dollars)

Statistics on the amount of US Large Denomination Currency in Circulation (Unit: millions of US dollars)

(This table is based on the Federal Reserve Bulletin, September 1947)

According to the table above, it can be seen that the amount of currency in circulation in the United States at the end of August 1947 was 28,149 million US dollars, an increase of approximately 3 and 1/3 times compared to the 6,550 million US dollars at the end of 1937. If coins are removed, the figure increases from 6,001.3 million US dollars to 26,793 million US dollars, an increase of approximately 3.5 times. Of particular note is that the rate of increase of large denomination notes is greater than that of small denomination notes. Comparing the end of August 1947 with the end of 1937, the increase in US dollar notes of 1 yuan, 2 yuan, and 5 yuan is approximately 1 time, but the 10 yuan note has increased 3 times, the 20 yuan note has increased 5 times, the 50 yuan note has increased approximately 5.5 times, the 100 yuan note has increased approximately 6 times, the 500 yuan note has increased approximately 2 times, and the 1,000 yuan note has increased approximately 2 times. That is, the increase rate from 10 yuan to 1,000 yuan is approximately 4 times greater than the average increase rate from 1 yuan to 5 yuan. In 1947, the past circulation amount of 10 yuan to 1,000 yuan notes totaled 23,676 million US dollars, an increase of more than 4 times compared to the circulation amount of the above-mentioned notes in 1937 of 4,554 million US dollars. The fact that there is inflation in the United States can be proven by this.

As a result of inflation in the United States, the US price and cost of living index have naturally risen accordingly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, the US cost of living index increased from 100.8 in 1937 to 157.1 in June 1947. Among them, food increased from 105.3 to 193.2 in July 1947, and clothing increased from 102.8 to 185.7 during the same period. (Using the average of 1937-39 as 100) At the same time, according to the US Federal Reserve Bulletin, the US wholesale price index in July 1947 compared to 1937 showed that agricultural products increased from 86 to 181, food increased from 86 to 162, and other commodities increased from 85 to 134. (1926 was 100)

Therefore, if we estimate based on the quantity of currency in circulation in the United States, one US dollar today should only be equal to 25 cents of US currency before the war. If we estimate based on prices, one US dollar today is only equal to 50 cents before the war. According to my compromise estimate, one US dollar today is approximately equal to 33 cents of US currency before the war. Before the war, 3 yuan of Chinese legal tender could be exchanged for one US dollar, so one US dollar today is approximately equal to one yuan of Chinese legal tender before the war. The true value of Chinese legal tender today should be 17,000 yuan, which is approximately equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. Therefore, 17,000 yuan of legal tender today is actually equivalent to one US dollar today.

From this, it can be seen that measuring the true value of legal tender based on the amount of legal tender issued in China will result in 17,000 yuan of legal tender today being equal to one yuan of legal tender before the war. Measuring the true value of legal tender based on the amount of currency in circulation in the United States will result in 17,000 yuan of legal tender today being equal to one US dollar today. That is, 3 US dollars today are equal to one US dollar before the war, because before the war, 3 yuan of Chinese legal tender was equivalent to one US dollar. Therefore, one US dollar today is actually equal to one yuan of Chinese legal tender before the war.

However, why is the exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar set as high as 90,000 legal tender to one US dollar by the Exchange Stabilization Fund? And why is the black market exchange rate even higher than this number? At the same time, why has the multiple by which prices have increased in China reached as high as 120,000 to 130,000 times?

According to my research, the factor that is promoting this unreasonable phenomenon is not Chinese legal tender itself, but rather the lack of trust in legal tender by the people. This is truly a fatal injury to the national economy! Because most people do not believe that legal tender can be stabilized, they cannot maintain the habit of saving before the war and deposit their surplus income in banks. Therefore, it can be said that all of the legal tender in circulation is roaming the market, and the speed of circulation is much faster than usual. The result of legal tender roaming the market is inevitably a gradual decrease in the amount of goods existing in the market. Due to the great distance between the amount of legal tender in circulation and the amount of goods existing in the market, prices rise every moment and fluctuate all the time, causing the purchasing power of legal tender to decrease day by day and step by step fall into the deep abyss of vicious inflation!

The fact is this: Before the war, the amount of legal tender in circulation was 1.4 billion yuan, while bank deposits consistently remained around 2.6 billion yuan. But today, the amount of legal tender in circulation is 23 trillion, but commercial bank deposits are instead low at only 2-3 trillion yuan. Even including the four major banks, it is probably no more than 10 trillion yuan; and most of it is short-term deposits. In fact, it can be said that there are no time deposits or savings deposits.

At the same time, US dollars themselves have gradually devalued by two-thirds due to inflation, but US dollars circulating in China have instead assisted the American currency in its special advantageous position in China due to the Chinese people's purchases and savings. According to the Central Bank's announcement, the total number of US dollars held by people in Shanghai has increased tenfold compared to before the war. But the ten times the amount of US dollars actually only increases its actual value by 3.5 times compared to before the war, because US dollars today are devalued by two-thirds compared to US dollars before the war.

In addition, what is even more noteworthy is that the Chinese wealthy class is converting legal tender into foreign currency and fleeing overseas, to the United States in the distant, and to Hong Kong in the near, which is also a major reason for weakening the value of legal tender. These people are all traitors to the country!

It is actually not difficult for us to maintain the stability of legal tender and restore its value. I suggest a few methods as follows:

1.  The government must immediately announce the principle of balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure. From now on, it must heavily tax the wealthy and solicit public bonds, and never rely on issuance to make up for its deficits. At the same time, it must vigorously implement this principle. Finally, it must re-enforce the Central Bank's issuance inspection system, with the participation of social legal entities, and make public reports at any time.

2.  The government should actively encourage people to save, and order national banks and treasuries to use various methods to absorb a large number of time deposits.

3.  The government should vigorously implement foreign exchange control, absolutely prohibit the trading of US dollars and other foreign currencies, and announce that foreign exchange is returned to state ownership, including all overseas deposits. (During the war, the United Kingdom announced the nationalization of foreign exchange.)

4.  The government should declare that international trade is entirely state-owned when necessary.

5.  The government should set up a price evaluation committee, and the prices should be uniformly approved and not changed for at least one month.

6.  The people must absolutely obey the government's orders, and use their surplus income not to purchase unnecessary or non-urgent materials or US dollars and gold, but to deposit all their surplus funds in national banks.

7.  The people must absolutely obey the government's orders, and all foreign currencies and gold that can be exchanged for foreign exchange must be settled and retained by the government at the official price. (The United Kingdom announced this system during the war).

8.  The people must not freely change the prices stipulated by the government.

If the government and the people truly cooperate, if the government does not view the people as all treacherous merchants, and the people do not view officials as all corrupt, and they trust and cooperate with each other, then prices will definitely be stable. After prices are stable, the government can prepare for currency reform. The government must give special preference to depositors of time deposits and savings deposits in national banks for the exchange rate of the new currency for legal tender. For example: Assuming that every 100,000 legal tender is combined into one new currency, then it may be possible to combine 50,000 legal tender into one new currency for depositors of savings deposits (the Soviet Union recently used this method to reform the currency). This would further encourage people to save enthusiastically before currency reform and accelerate the stabilization of legal tender.

In short, although our country's internal turmoil has not been settled at present, our country's productivity has increased greatly compared to before the war. At the same time, since the recovery of the resource-rich Northeast and Taiwan, our country's material storage has also increased more than tenfold compared to before the war. At the same time, our country has a population of about 500 million, of which at least 125 million are the main labor force. If the industrial technology problem is solved, China will definitely not have the concern of poverty. Human and material resources are the basic source of national wealth and vitality. China has such huge human and material resources, why worry about poverty? Therefore, I hope that the government will first have enlightened fiscal and economic policies, and that the loyal and patriotic people will sincerely cooperate and implement them earnestly. Chinese legal tender can be saved, and China's economic prospects are not necessarily pessimistic.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Expedite the Provision of Military Grain

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] Since the bandit troubles have not subsided and the mobilization to suppress the rebellion is the established national policy, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considers that having sufficient food and soldiers is a prerequisite. It has recently telegraphed to the governments of all counties (cities) that, in the future, for the military grain to be allocated, regardless of whether it is provincial, county, or central government grain taxes, they should expedite the handling and allocation to meet military needs.

### Jiangsu Grain Merchants Hold Meeting in Wuxi to Request Exemption from Grain Business Tax Again

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Representatives of grain merchants from various counties in Jiangsu Province held an emergency meeting at the Wuxi Grain Association at 2:00 PM today to discuss the issue of exemption from grain business tax. Twenty-four representatives from twenty-one units including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Nantong, Qingpu, and Xuzhou attended. They decided to jointly recommend representatives from nine counties including Suxi and Chang to go to Shanghai on the 16th to meet with representatives of the National Grain Merchants Association and submit a petition to the capital for the second time, requesting exemption from grain business tax. A preparatory committee was formed to organize the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Merchants Federation, and Zhao Zhijie and 14 others were appointed as preparatory members.

### Reports on Grain Prices

At the same time, the representatives reported the price situation in various counties as follows:

Jiangyin white japonica rice 1.45 million, Jiangyan glutinous rice 1.1 million, Yangzhou late rice 1.24 million, Nanjing white rice 1.12 million, Lishui indica rice 1 million, Changshu limited price 1.18 million, Suzhou limited price 1.18 million, Wuxi limited price 1.18 million, Changzhou limited price 1.18 million, Nantong indica rice 1.5 million, Xinghua indica rice 980,000, Jinshan white japonica rice 1.25 million, Qingpu white japonica rice 1.37 million, Gaoyou indica rice 410,000, Songjiang white millet 1.4 million, Taizhou indica rice 440,000, Danyang medium-ripe rice 1.25 million, Baoying white japonica rice 1.15 million, Jingjiang indica rice 1.2 million, Jintan white indica rice 1.1 million, Xuzhou wheat 1.4 million,

[This Newspaper, Yangzhou, 10th] The price of rice has reached 1.26 million. Because grain taxes are urgent, supply cannot meet demand, and it is impossible to lower prices. The Interim Council closed today and decided to ask the county government to sell 10,000 stones of tax grain to regulate prices and suppress rising prices.

[This Newspaper, Wuhu, 10th] The price of rice in Wuhu has risen to 1.3 million yuan per stone.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] The Suzhou rice situation has been tense for several days. Market transactions have become sporadic. Top-quality white rice has disappeared. The number of transactions in various stalls on the 10th was only over 200 stones. Most transactions flowed to the off-market black market, for private transactions. The listed price of white rice on the 10th still remained at 1.15 million, but the actual black market price was around 1.4 million. County Magistrate Wang Jiefo went to the market in plain clothes in the morning to inspect secretly, and strictly instructed the police bureau to pay attention to price-gouging merchants and strive to crack down on the black market.

### Overseas Chinese Marriage Problems Are Serious: Chen Qingyun Discusses His Observations

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch dated the 10th] The marriage problems of overseas Chinese are extremely serious. It is hoped that the government can negotiate with various countries to allow overseas Chinese dependents to enter the country. This is what Overseas Minister Chen Qingyun said to reporters after inspecting and comforting overseas Chinese in the United States, Canada, and North and South America after returning to the country. Minister Chen said: Due to the restrictions on Chinese people entering various countries in North and South America, it is even more difficult for overseas Chinese dependents to enter. Overseas Chinese individuals are far away from their motherland and often reside for more than ten years without being able to bring their families, which is not in line with human nature. Therefore, the majority of overseas Chinese have no choice but to marry local indigenous women. This situation is most prevalent in Central and South America. It is hoped that the government will negotiate with various countries to allow the entry of overseas Chinese dependents.

Original Plan: Standardization of Product Manufacturing. Implementation Method: Strengthen the promotion of various standards in accordance with the Standards Law, and supervise and prevent manufacturers from complying with and implementing them. As for the various standards that should be formulated, the Central Bureau of Standards should formulate and promote them as soon as possible.

Original Plan: Advocating Investment in Industry and Mining. Implementation Method: 1. The government should set up an industrial and mining transportation investment company, designate special funds or publicly owned assets as government equity investment, raise business equity, issue stocks, and circulate them in the market. This company can set up subsidiaries. Once the business foundation of the subsidiaries is stable, they will gradually increase business equity and reduce the parent company's shares to absorb floating capital. 2. Support industrial, mining, and transportation businesses that have achieved results and legitimate investment companies, and allow them to invest in government-run companies or factories. Those who use overseas Chinese awards and foreign exchange assets as investors may be given preferential equity rights or special sales rights and profits, etc., depending on the actual situation, to encourage them.

Original Plan: Guiding Floating Capital into the Right Track. Implementation Method: 1. The government should instruct the competent authorities to formulate detailed measures for industrial and mining companies to issue stocks and bonds. The repayment of principal and interest shall be supervised by the government. In order to prevent price fluctuations from affecting the value of bonds, the government may allow the company bonds issued to calculate the repayment of principal and interest according to the local special price index. 2. Stock exchanges should allow the stocks and bonds of industrial, mining, and transportation businesses to be listed.

Original Plan: Supervising Industrial and Mining Loans. Implementation Method: In addition to ordinary industrial loans, the required loans for each factory should also be carried out in the form of purchasing and ordering. The scope of collateral should be appropriately relaxed in accordance with current regulations, and the review and supervision of the use of loans can be participated by the competent authorities.

Original Plan: Revaluation of Industrial and Mining Assets. Implementation Method: Revise the method of revaluing the value of fixed assets of industrial and mining transportation businesses, adjusting capital methods, and supplementing estimation methods. The formula is as follows:

Original Plan: Encouraging Foreign Investment and Cooperation. Implementation Method: 1. The competent authorities should earnestly formulate the scope and implementation rules for foreign investment, and formulate remittance measures to protect their legitimate business rights and interests. 2. Regarding international investment and cooperation, the patent rights of foreign inventions should be given priority protection within the provisions of our country's patents. New industrial technology methods that are suitable for our country's needs should be given special encouragement, and foreign industrial technology experts should be hired to participate in the work.

Original Plan: Striving for Reasonable Wages. Implementation Method: The method of paying wages should be determined by the competent authorities in conjunction with the relevant agencies, in accordance with the work efficiency of the workers, the production capacity of the factory, the sales of products, and the calculation of the cost of living index of employees. The types of goods should be adopted, and the calculation standards should be re-determined, and the wage and adjustment methods should be re-determined.

Draft Implementation Plan for the Industrial Sector Related to Increasing Production of Materials and Stabilizing Prices

Original Plan: Providing Raw Materials to Manufacturers on Behalf. Implementation Method: The competent authorities should discuss with the relevant lending banks, designate funds, purchase raw materials or equipment, and deliver them to manufacturers. They should order finished products and then sell the finished products and recover the funds to purchase raw materials and equipment for continued use, in order to achieve the purpose of promoting production.

Original Plan: Negotiating Loans for Foreign Machinery and Raw Materials. Implementation Method: The competent authorities should formulate plans in accordance with actual needs, make overall arrangements, and negotiate with foreign countries for loans for machinery and raw materials to facilitate production.

Original Plan: Selling Enemy Assets and Compensation Materials. Implementation Method: The enemy and puppet equipment and compensation materials should be sold or leased by the competent authorities to qualified private manufacturers that do not need and cannot afford to use them in state-owned enterprises, and production should be limited to a limited time. The equipment and materials should be disposed of within the specified period.

### Multiple U.S. Warships Transferred to Turkey to Strengthen Defense of the Dardanelles Strait and Prevent Communist Forces from Extending into the Mediterranean Sea

[United Press Washington dispatch dated the 9th] The United States today supported the defense of the Dardanelles Strait by transferring four fleet-type submarines to Turkey, plus eleven other warships, especially suitable for the mission in this Middle Eastern strategic area. Fleet-type warships are giant new-type submarines with extremely long underwater endurance. They have ten torpedo tubes and can carry a crew of 65 people. This week, the old warships that the United States has supplied to the Turkish and Greek fleets have reached 33. The Navy Department's announcement today is the culmination of a series of diplomatic actions to let the Soviet Union and its Balkan satellite countries know that any action that would change the balance of power in this historically "powder keg" area would inevitably have serious consequences. Rear Admiral Denfeld, the new head of the Navy Department, recently said that the U.S. fleet is the backing of the country's foreign policy. A U.S. Marine Corps team of 1,000 men, carrying full landing equipment, is heading to the Mediterranean to reinforce it. Vice Admiral Hewitt, former Chief of Staff of the Navy, will take office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet next month, stationed on the powerful aircraft carrier "Midway." The submarines supplied to Turkey today will be sailed to Turkish ports by U.S. Navy personnel. The other warships, including eight minesweepers and one net-laying ship, oil tanker, and repair ship, will be sailed by Turkish sailors trained in the country. Greece also received six artillery pieces today. Earlier, the State Department announced that it had sold eleven minesweepers to Greece. The transfer of the warships is included in the $450 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey passed by Congress last year. After Turkey receives four new submarines, its submarine strength will only be 14, which is still insignificant compared to the Soviet Union's 215. The actual deployment of the Soviet fleet is kept secret, but experts say that its main force is concentrated in Vladivostok, and there are also powerful fleets in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The U.S. and Turkish submarines do not have long-term diving equipment, but the distance between the Dardanelles and the Black Sea is very short, so this equipment is not necessary. U.S. Navy experts told reporters that the main purpose of the submarines, in addition to showing off to the Soviet Union, is to further train Turkish sailors. These submarines can hinder enemy transport, and can travel long distances, so they are suitable for patrol work.

### The United States Is Concerned About the Situation in Greece; The Mediterranean Fleet Conducts a Ten-Day Exercise

[Reuters Athens dispatch dated the 10th] The U.S. Embassy announced yesterday that the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet, including the 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Midway," three light cruisers, and several destroyers, will begin routine training exercises in the eastern Mediterranean and the Ionian Sea southwest of Greece from Wednesday until January 16. The 1,000 marines who departed from the United States on Sunday will soon be assigned to serve on these ships.

According to U.S. reports, these actions by the United States are actually a warning to Greece's neighbors, instructing them not to recognize Markos' "Free Greek Government." According to diplomatic reporters from this agency, the dispatch of the marine corps is a traditional signal from Washington that it will not hesitate to use force when necessary. Two days ago, the U.S. Department of State instructed its representatives in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to warn the two governments not to recognize Markos' government, stating that such actions would be considered a violation of the principles of the UN Charter. According to information received by the Greek government yesterday, the Comintern Intelligence Bureau recently discussed inviting the Greek Communist Party to join the bureau to replace the immediate recognition of the Markos government, presumably due to the firm attitude of the British and Americans and the failure of the Greek guerrillas to occupy considerable land.

### The United States Denies Requesting to Send Troops to the Holy Land

[Reuters Washington dispatch dated the 9th] The State Department stated that U.S. officials had informally discussed with the Palestinian government the possibility of sending U.S. Marines to Jerusalem to protect the U.S. Consulate there, but no resolution had been established. The State Department's official statement said: "The United States government has never requested the Palestinian government or the British government to allow the United States to send Marines to Palestine. This report from London may be due to informal discussions between the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem and the Palestinian government on the need to take measures to protect the safety of personnel and property of the consulate. During these discussions, the issue of sending U.S. guards was raised, but no resolution was established." The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem was recently bombed.

[Reuters Jerusalem dispatch dated the 9th] Although the U.S. Consulate General here has officially denied the claim that the U.S. Marines will be transferred to Palestine, reliable sources here still insist that 300 U.S. Marines will be transferred to Palestine to serve as guards for the U.S. Consulate and to protect other U.S. buildings in Jerusalem and U.S. expatriates traveling on Palestinian highways. Other consulates here have also requested similar protection.

### Palestine Committee Drafting Early Partition Schedule

### UN Committee Announces Mission to Korea

### Small General Assembly Extends Debate on Veto Power

[United Press Lake Success dispatch dated the 10th] The UN Small General Assembly met on the 10th, and at the suggestion of Luxembourg, the debate on the veto power of the five permanent members was postponed to March 15. The Small General Assembly finally passed it by a vote of 39 to 1. The United States won its first battle. During the meeting, U.S. Representative Austin and Peruvian Representative Beloya verbally argued fiercely, and the Peruvian representative questioned the purpose of the U.S. motion. The resolution stipulates that UN member states should submit any proposals related to the reform of the veto party of major powers in the Security Council before March 15. Four countries abstained during the vote. The Small General Assembly was initiated by the United States, and the six countries of the Soviet Union bloc boycotted and did not participate.

### Arab Troops Briefly Invade the Holy Land; Britain Protests to Syria; The Situation in Northern Xinjiang Has Basically Returned to Normal

[Reuters London dispatch dated the 10th] The British Foreign Office has instructed its minister to Damascus, Broughter-Miter, to lodge a serious protest with the Syrian government regarding the invasion of Palestine by Arab armed forces from Syria. A Foreign Office spokesman said that Broughter-Miter had either acted on his own initiative or at the request of the Palestinian government to protest to the Syrian government. Diplomatic circles here are deeply concerned about yesterday's events in Palestine, fearing that the conflict in Palestine will become more widespread as a result. A recent dispatch from the Holy Land said that all 600 Arab troops who invaded Palestine from Syria yesterday had retreated into Syria, and the Palestinian government announced that the situation in Northern Xinjiang had returned to normal.

[United Press Jerusalem dispatch dated the 10th] Soldiers of the British Royal Commando Regiment, famous for their daring, began armed patrols on the banks of the Jordan River on the northern border of Palestine today, seemingly trying to stop the Arabs from invading the Holy Land, showing that British policy is gradually becoming tougher. The volunteer troops from Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon are now being trained in southern Syria, and the partition conflict is likely to develop into an international incident. At the same time, 600 Arabs crossed the border and attacked Palestine yesterday, and were finally repelled by British troops and jet fighter squadrons. This attack may be the prelude to a general offensive launched by the Arabs, but Arab officials here say that it is not yet time to launch an offensive.

### Regarding the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute: Opinions in The Hague

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this newspaper

[Special Correspondent’s Airmail from The Hague] At this time when the Indonesian question is extremely thorny, the government and public in The Hague express extraordinary concern about protecting the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The spokesman of the Dutch government's Colonial Department (now renamed the Overseas Department), Mr. Vlasman, with fourteen years of experience living in Indonesia, told the reporter about the profound friendship of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia towards him. He said, "The Chinese residents have made the greatest contribution to the development of the islands of Southeast Asia, and the Dutch government cannot ignore them." Mr. Vlasman's assistant, Mr. Heijningen, showed photographs of Indonesian Republican thugs killing overseas Chinese and a letter from the Chinese General Association of Batavia to the Dutch government, proving the various undisciplined states of the Indonesian Republic. Mr. Heijningen said, "The Dutch government sent troops to the East Indies purely to maintain law and order and protect the safety of good people." He firmly denied that there was any so-called war. "The Netherlands only has 100,000 troops in Indonesia, and this small number is definitely not capable of fighting a war to subdue Indonesia, which is the truth."

However, Mr. Heijningen still said: The Dutch government is confident of advancing into Yogyakarta (the capital of the Republic of Indonesia) within two weeks, but the Dutch government is reluctant to do so, because "even if we advance into Yogyakarta, the problem cannot be solved as a result." He told the reporter in detail about the past collusion between the Indonesian Republic and the Japanese fascists, and the secret relationship with Soviet Russia today. Mr. Heijningen also followed the unified propaganda policy of the Dutch government, dividing the former Dutch East Indies into three parts, namely: The Republic of Indonesia, including Sumatra and Java. Borneo. Celebes and the Federation of Small Islands in Eastern Indonesia. He said: The current disturbances in Sumatra and Java are only the barbaric behavior of the Republic of Indonesia, and have nothing to do with Borneo and the small islands in eastern Indonesia, "because the political views of the latter two are completely in line with the Dutch government." This kind of proposition is: the three separate parts jointly organize the "United States of Indonesia." This United States of Indonesia has diplomatic and national defense powers, and has an independent and autonomous government. The reporter asked: What will be the relationship between this ideal United States and the Netherlands itself in the future? Mr. Heijningen said that the Dutch government currently has no plan, but he firmly believes that it may be like Canada's relationship with Britain.

The reporter of this newspaper arrived in The Hague from Paris on Christmas Eve. At that time, Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Beel and the Minister of Colonial Affairs and the Minister of Labor flew to the East Indies together. The Dutch government and public all believe that if the Indonesian dispute is not resolved one day, the economic situation in the Netherlands will not improve one day. At present, in addition to the almost complete suspension of trade between the East Indies and the Netherlands itself, according to non-official estimates, the Dutch government spends 3.5 million guilders (Dutch currency) a day on the state of war in Indonesia. The Dutch are very envious of Belgium owning the vast African Congo, which is peaceful and without incident. The two sister countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, after being washed by this war, have a disparity in wealth that is definitely unimaginable before the war.

However, the spokesman of the Dutch Colonial Department is unwilling to talk deeply about the Dutch government's difficult situation caused by the Indonesian issue. Mr. Heijningen pointed to the maps hanging all over the walls, saying that the Dutch government officials' trip to Indonesia was purely to promote a satisfactory solution to the Indonesian issue before April next year (ie this year), because in April next year, the Netherlands will amend the Party Law, especially amending the article on territory in the current constitution, deleting the so-called directly-administered territories, including Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes and other words. "If the political structure of the East Indies is not stabilized one day, the amendment of the constitution will still be difficult." The opinions of a part of the non-official people in The Hague believe that Prime Minister Beel may adopt a tougher policy towards Indonesia after returning from this trip. Another group of Dutch intellectuals believes that as long as the Netherlands and Indonesia sign a more permanent economic mutual assistance treaty, so that Indonesia's abundant resources can help the Netherlands' economic hardship, then any other political disputes may be greatly conceded.

As for the official opinion of The Hague, it is between these two extremes. The reporter of this newspaper talked with Mr. Mulder, the director of the Press Department of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his assistant Mr. Heer, about the attitude of the various political parties towards the Indonesian disturbances. Mr. Mulder, who was a reporter for "The New York Times" for many years, believes that the Dutch government's so-called Indonesian policy has been jointly decided by the two major parties in the past, namely the left wing of the Catholic Party and the right wing of the Labor Party. Because their position is moderate, their so-called policies are also prone to being passive and even showing hesitation. He believes that Prime Minister Beel will have changes after returning from his trip to the East. He told reporters: The Dutch Labor Party, that is, the incarnation of the Social Democratic Party, changed its name to the current name in order to meet the British Atlee's Labor Party. The left wing of the party advocates concessions to Indonesia. The Dutch Communist Party, which has ten seats in the parliament, advocates unconditional withdrawal from Indonesia, but the right wing of the Catholic Party (the largest party) firmly advocates maintaining the traditional colonial policy.

The reporter of this newspaper also visited Dr. Weitzhaus, the director of the Press Department of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Dr. Wei strongly stated that the Indonesian dispute must be resolved as soon as possible. However, he said: The current economic hardship in the Netherlands is not entirely caused by the Indonesian issue. A separate report will be made on the current economic situation in the Netherlands. (Sent from The Hague on December 29)

(Long Distance) 1.660 yuan (per person nautical mile)

Director Zhao told reporters yesterday that the new prices after the above adjustments have not exceeded the old prices by one time, nor have they reached 80%. Among them, the subway and tram increased the most, by 70%, the municipal ferry increased by 66%, and the bus increased by 60%. The municipal authorities, in order to be considerate of the burden on citizens, do not want to increase them too much. If calculated according to the automatic adjustment formula approved by the Economic Council, the bus should increase by 83%, the tram should increase by 94%, and the ferry should increase by 117%.

### Government Agrees to Restore Industrial Loans

Wu returned to Shanghai with Governor Zhang of the National Bank yesterday. According to his statement to reporters, the government has agreed in principle to immediately open industrial loans, but the detailed rules for lending, such as how to ensure that the loans are actually used for production, still need to be discussed in detail. The Industrial Association has sent a telegram to the national industrial community seeking opinions, so as to gather and provide them to the government for reference. Wu said that the Industrial Association hopes that in the future, industrial trade associations can participate in the review work when loans are granted, because the trade associations will definitely be clearer about the situation in their industry than the government, and the trade associations can be responsible for supervision to prevent abuses from happening again.

### Russian Ship Runs Aground Outside Wusong Estuary

[Report from this newspaper] A Russian ship, the Podoesk, ran aground at a location 48 nautical miles outside the Wusong Estuary yesterday. The ship was on its way to Vladivostok to add coal in Shanghai, and it was not carrying passengers or cargo. After leaving Shanghai the morning before, it ran aground outside the Wusong Estuary. The ship immediately sent out a distress signal, which was intercepted by the US Navy signal station here, and it notified the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Soviet Consulate sent another Soviet ship, the Smolny, and two tugboats to tow it. It is reported that the second cabin of the grounded Podoesk has been flooded, but there is no immediate danger of sinking.

### President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, Concerned About Dispute at the District Court

[Report from this newspaper] Since the District Court added civil and criminal courts and promoted judges to serve as court presidents, causing dissatisfaction among the other 32 judges, who jointly submitted a signed report to Guo Yunguan, President of the High Court, and Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, expressing their opinions. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, has also paid close attention to this matter. After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before, he immediately summoned Judge Xie Huai to inquire about the situation yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Cha Liangjian also rushed to President Ju's residence to report on the occurrence of the incident. At that time, Ju instructed Cha to handle it properly to avoid escalating the dispute. Also, yesterday morning, Feng Qun, the registrar of the High Court, summoned all the judges of the District Court on the order of President Guo Yunguan, and responded to the previous signed report, generally meaning that after the judges are promoted to court presidents, the original number of judges will be reduced, and there may be a backlog of cases. There is no need to worry about this point, because the judges who are promoted to court presidents will still handle cases, and the number of cases they handle will not be reduced as a result. As for the question of qualifications, whether it is appropriate for those who have served as judges for less than three years to be promoted to court presidents, the High Court has no right to interpret and will forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for verification.

### Pre-arranged Traps and Densely Woven Nets: Unscrupulous Merchants Like Moths to a Flame; Effective Plan of Setting Bait to Catch Birds; Gold and Foreign Currency Black Market Immediately Disappears

Those Arrested Will be Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on Monday for Prosecution

The Shanghai financial management and economic inspection authorities used the clever plan of "setting bait to catch birds" and began to take action on the 9th to crack down on the gold and foreign currency black market, and have already achieved the expected results. This clever plan began to be arranged three months ago and was only recently completed. The gold and foreign currency black market began to rise sharply from the 7th, reaching its peak on the 8th. The authorities decided to implement this clever plan from the 9th and make a thunderous blow with lightning speed. On the evening of the 9th, six major gold and foreign currency black market organizations in this city were seized, and eight principal offenders were arrested. Action continued on the 10th to expand the effect, and the gold and foreign currency black market has disappeared. It is expected that this can be maintained for a considerable period of time. This shocking measure was carried out on the morning of the 9th by personnel from the Financial Administration Bureau together with the economic police of the Public Security Bureau. Traps had already been pre-arranged in certain locations, and densely woven nets were set up. When the action began, those engaged in gold and foreign currency speculation were like moths to a flame, falling into the net one by one. By the evening of the 9th, dozens of people had been arrested. In addition to those who were released on bail, eight principal offenders are currently detained in the Public Security Bureau Detention Center. Their names are: Shen Zhengyang, Liu Jixin, Wang Jiasen, Wu Youren, Zhang Yongnian, Zhuang Shanbing, Yuan Boqing, Wang Zisheng. According to the clues obtained, the six gold and foreign currency black market organizations in this city were seized one by one, namely: Futai Tobacco Store on North Chenjing Road, Sichuan Road, Shunda Tobacco Store on Sichuan Road, Ningbo Road, No. 216 in the Securities Building, Daquan Store at No. 2, Ningbo Road, Bin County Tobacco Store at No. 206, Nanjing Road, No. 4 Yuan Shangli, Dong Zilaihuo Street, Jinling East Road. The total amount of gold and foreign currency seized on the 9th: More than 200 large bars of 10 taels of gold, More than 20,000 US dollars, 20,400 Northeast circulation notes, 1,002,251,000 yuan in legal currency, More than 24 billion yuan in checks. On the 10th, the economic police continued to launch an attack on the gold and foreign currency black market and pursued those who were definitely suspected of being involved in the black market based on the prior investigation. By the evening, more than 20 people, including Li Mingyue, Zhou Guiying, Chen Shihua, Li Wenhai, Huang Linxiang, and Shi Guangyou, had been arrested, and a number of black market organizations, such as Zhengyu Tobacco Company and Yufeng Company, had been broken up. The details are being sorted out. Ruan Guanglu, Director of the Administrative Department of the Public Security Bureau, who presided over this operation, told reporters on the afternoon of the 10th: The actions of the past two days have achieved the expected results in suppressing the gold and foreign currency black market. The main task now is to pursue the checks that have been seized. It is believed that the giants engaged in the gold and foreign currency black market will not be difficult to obtain. The criminals who have been arrested will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 12th for handling in accordance with the "Regulations on the Punishment of Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency."

### Financial Giant Li Lixia Discusses the Process of Uncovering the Black Market, Involving 100-200 People, Continuing the Chase

[Report from our newspaper] Li Lixia, the Director of the Financial Management Bureau, met with reporters at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. to discuss the gold and currency case. According to him, the case involves as many as 100 to 200 people, and dozens have already been arrested. The pursuit is still ongoing, so a specific number cannot be given. Those arrested yesterday were either one side of the transaction or currency speculators. Today, the other side of the transaction is being pursued, or individuals are being arrested based on confessions. When implementing the arrests, the authorities relied on four clues: gold, U.S. dollars, checks, and legal tender. In addition to the daily investigation records of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank and the Financial Management Bureau, special attention was paid to the transaction behavior at the time. The arrests implemented yesterday were all at the transaction locations, making it impossible for them to deny.

20 Billion in Check Funds Confirmed to Be Frozen

As of today (the 10th), the evidence seized includes over 120 gold bars, over 15,000 U.S. dollars, approximately 1 billion in legal tender, and approximately 25 billion in checks. After working through the night, the Financial Bureau has confirmed that 20 billion yuan in check funds have been frozen. In addition to freezing and confiscating the check accounts, the courts will impose penalties according to the law. The largest transaction location broken up yesterday was at No. 10 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road in this city, where over 90 gold bars were found. Currently, the arrests implemented are only a small portion of those engaged in this type of transaction. However, detailed investigation records are available for the majority of the others, and they will be arrested if they are found to have engaged in transactions in the future. Also, in this major case, the checks were indeed printed by the banks themselves, but it is not easy to determine whether the banks themselves were engaged in this type of black market transaction. It can only be said that some of their employees were involved. Foreign merchants engaged in currency speculation will be treated "equally" and handled fairly according to the law.

Hundreds of Suspicious Phone Calls Secretly Recorded

Mr. Li further pointed out that after the Auditing Department of the Central Bank began to take charge of investigating the black market for currency speculation, many independent agencies were established and mixed in with the locations of the black market currency speculation transactions in order to achieve the objective, so as to monitor their telephone and telegraph communications. After several months of effort, hundreds of suspicious phone calls have been recorded in detail, and any codes or secret languages have been translated by specialists. To cite an example, Yongshunli Company (No. 960 Zhongzheng East Road) in this case, which specialized in large-scale illegal remittances to Hong Kong, had four secret radio stations. On average, they sent and received 30 to 40 secret messages per day, which were secretly recorded by staff on a daily basis. After the case was broken, the secret messages seized were completely consistent with the daily investigation records of the Auditing Department, demonstrating the efficiency of the operation. Mr. Li also said that the gold bars, cash, and checks in this case have now been mostly sent to the Central Bank for safekeeping. The crackdown on the black market for currency speculation in Shanghai will likely result in no black market prices for a period of time. Given the large amount of gold and currency stored in this city, it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no small-scale transactions in the future, but every effort will be made to ensure that the price of gold and currency does not fluctuate greatly and affect others. The staff involved in the crackdown will be rewarded for their contributions. After the currency case is brought to a close, a report will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

The office officially completed the handover procedures yesterday, and all 200 commercial vehicles, 50,000 gallons of gasoline, and property and equipment were inventoried. The office is scheduled to officially commence operations tomorrow. It is also heard that Mr. Yu is vigorously attempting to reduce the staff, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Transportation. To date, over 100 redundant personnel have been dismissed.

### Voting Procedures for the Election of Legislators - Different Methods for Occupational and Regional Elections, Strictly Enforced to Prevent Abuses

The election of legislators is scheduled to be held from the 21st to the 23rd of this month, as reported in this newspaper. However, the election methods for legislators in this city have been slightly revised compared to the election of National Assembly delegates. To thoroughly understand the voting procedures, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Municipal Election Office, who provided the following detailed information: Regarding the acquisition of voting rights by voters, it is necessary to meet the essential conditions of being 20 years of age or older, residing in this city for more than six months, or having a domicile for more than one year, and being registered on the voter list. Voters participating in regional elections, in addition to meeting the above essential conditions, must also bring their National Identification Card and the legislator's voting certificate to be issued, and go to the designated polling station to vote. It is a common misconception that anyone who has obtained a National Identification Card has the right to vote, which is incorrect. Regional legislator voting certificates will be issued starting on the 12th of this month and ending on the 18th. According to the law, elections are a right of citizens, and all citizens with the right to vote should collect their voting certificates from their respective baojia (neighborhood administrative units), otherwise, they will be deemed to have automatically waived their right. However, in order to take into account the facts and encourage voters to vote enthusiastically, the Municipal Election Office has notified all districts and baojia to make every effort to deliver the certificates. However, the personnel of the baojia are limited and their duties are numerous, so if voters are not at home when the certificates are delivered, it will not be possible to make a second or third delivery. In such cases, the personnel of the baojia cannot be held responsible. Therefore, voters are urged to value their own rights and, if they have not received their legislator's voting certificate by mid-month, they should go to the office of the baojia to claim it. If the personnel of the baojia obstruct or withhold the certificates, the Municipal Election Office will severely punish them according to the law upon discovery. The main purpose of using both the National Identification Card and the voting certificate in the regional legislator elections in this city is to prevent impersonation. Voters must personally go to the polls to vote, and no cheating will be allowed. As for occupational elections, since the headquarters has ordered that it is not necessary to also use the National Identification Card, this city will continue to comply with the order. Soldiers residing in this city for more than six months are legally entitled to participate in regional voting in this city, but they must still obtain a household registration in this city, be registered as voters, and obtain both a National Identification Card and a voting certificate before being allowed to vote. As for officers and soldiers living inside military camps, according to the household registration law, they are not allowed to apply for a National Identification Card. The Election Office has notified all district offices to instruct them to affix photos to the voting certificates so that they can participate in voting. In order to accurately verify the number of ballots received, the number of ballots issued, and the number of remaining ballots in each polling station, the Municipal Election Office has stipulated that each polling station must immediately report a list to the district office on the day of the completion of voting. The district offices must, on the day after the completion of voting, report a list to the Municipal Election Office of the total number of ballots received, the total number of ballots issued, and the number of remaining ballots in the entire district, and submit the remaining ballots and the voter list sealed together. At the same time, the supervisors of the polling stations must report to the Election Office on the afternoon of the completion of voting for verification, in order to prevent abuses.

### Former Instructor of the Puppet Aviation School Dies of Illness After Sentencing

Li Zeci Assisted in Securing the Coffin

[Report from our newspaper] Wen Shisong, a traitorous prisoner at the High Court Detention Center, was a former instructor at the puppet aviation school. He was from Guangdong and was sentenced to three years in prison. Earlier, due to his fondness for women, he developed nephritis in prison. When he became seriously ill, the prison ordered him to post bail. However, Wen had no friends in Shanghai, and he was also ordered to pay cash bail. However, Wen was destitute and unable to post bail. Later, the prison sent him to Heji Hospital for treatment, where he died yesterday. Because he had no estate, there was no way to collect his body after his death. Li Ze, a fellow prisoner from Guangdong, contacted a funeral home on his behalf, and Li was responsible for the costs, so that the body could be collected.

### Red and Green, Durable and Beautiful - Xinjiang Hetian Carpets on Public Display Starting Today

[Report from our newspaper] The Xinjiang Hetian Carpet Exhibition, sponsored by the Northwest Minsheng Industrial Company, is scheduled to be held from the 11th to the 13th at No. 9 Shaoxing Road for three days. A preview was held yesterday, and Pan Gongzhan, Tang Guanyu, Chen Guokang, Qian Xinzhi, Jin Run, and other celebrities from home and abroad attended the event and made purchases. The company has shipped 500 carpets to Shanghai for the exhibition, and more than half of them have already been purchased by various sectors.

Purely Handmade

Hetian, the carpet production area, is located southwest of the Xinjiang Taklamakan Desert and is a new and unique handicrafts center. In addition to carpets, the area's specialties also include mutton fat jade, leather suitcases, and mulberry paper, commonly known as the "Four Treasures of Hetian." The raw materials for making carpets are wool produced locally in Xinjiang. After washing, coloring, and weaving, because they are purely handmade, only about one foot can be woven in a week. A carpet one zhang (approximately 10 feet) long takes at least two months to make. The patterns and designs are bright red and green, fully blending the artistic colors of India, Persia, Greece, and Arabia. In addition, the quality is particularly durable. Europeans and Americans passing through Xinjiang all compete to buy them, so Hetian carpets have become one of Xinjiang's diplomatic gifts over the years.

Quality Still Needs to Be Thickened

The Chinese and foreign visitors who came to the exhibition and made purchases yesterday all agreed that the quality and colors of the carpets were good, but the sizes were insufficient and the quality still needed to be thickened. The Northwest Company is considering making improvements in the future. According to the company, Hetian is far from Shanghai. Normally, transportation can be arranged from Hetian to Dihua, then to Lanzhou, and then to Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) via Xi'an and the Longhai Line. Since the Longhai Railway was interrupted, it is only possible to detour through Chongqing, so the transportation distance is about 8,000 kilometers, and it takes three months to reach Shanghai from the western border. However, the company is working to streamline transportation, so that the exchange of goods between the border areas and the interior will be more ideal in the future.

### Gold Found in the Fire - Two Large Gold Bars - Original Owner Determined

[Report from our newspaper] At 0:30 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at No. 2, Lane 07, Ninghai East Road. A tenant, Mr. Chen, in a panic, failed to retrieve two large gold bars stored in his safe. He requested Zhu Zhifeng, the captain of the Songshan Squadron of the Fire Department, to rescue them on his behalf. When the fire was slightly subdued, Zhu accompanied Chen up the stairs on a ladder. When the safe was opened, only some scattered gold jewelry was found, but no gold bars. Later, Captain Zhu re-entered another room and found them in a wooden box. Because Chen's statement was inconsistent, and there may have been other reasons, they were taken back to the headquarters for filing. After investigation yesterday, Chen was allowed to bail them out.

### Re-Investigation of the Assassination Case of Chou Lianhuan, Ye Guangde

[Report from our newspaper] In the case of Chou Lianhuan being assassinated, Chou's widow, Chen, expressed dissatisfaction with the District Prosecutor's Office's decision not to prosecute the defendant, Ye Guangde, claiming that Ye was suspected of instigating others to murder Chou Lianhuan and requested a review. Yesterday, the High Prosecutor's Office ordered the District Prosecutor's Office to re-investigate. The District Prosecutor's Office's reason for not prosecuting Ye Guangde was that Ye was a friend of Chou Lianhuan, and that Chou Lianhuan did not mention Ye Guangde when he was dying, so there was insufficient evidence. However, Ye had remitted 1.8 million yuan for Chou to misappropriate, which caused him to harbor resentment. In addition, Ye had fled to Ningbo to stay temporarily after Chou was murdered, which made the situation suspicious. After receiving the order, the District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled to summon Chen, Huang Zhensheng, Wang Hengsun, Chen Youqin, Jiang Rongfa, Kong Rongsheng, Luo Zude, Shen Genfu, Gu Ajin, Zhang Guangxiang, and the sister of Mao Qingyu, Qi Fudeng, and others for questioning on the afternoon of the 13th of this month.

### Lament for Kowloon Walled City

"Our newspaper's Guangzhou airmail report on the 8th" Writing about the so-called "incident" in Kowloon Walled City always brings to mind the heartbreaking scenes of national affairs 50 years ago. It's hard to say whether it's sadness or hatred. After eight years of arduous war, we shed all the shackles of imperialism and joined the ranks of the five powers. However, at the beginning of the new year, amidst the strong sounds and laughter of diplomatic gatherings and banquets, an allied nation that fought alongside us against the enemy actually took the form of an invading army, demolishing the houses built and inhabited by our compatriots in Kowloon for generations, and arresting compatriots who stood on our national territory. The word "friendship" has become a self-deceiving explanation. The negotiations and signatures and near-stoppage signify a feeling that is truly more tragic than can be expressed! At exactly 5:00 a.m. on the 5th of January, the Hong Kong side mobilized

fully armed police, wearing anti-riot masks, carrying riot shields, tear gas, and armored vehicles, as if facing a formidable enemy. They advanced menacingly straight to Kowloon Walled City. At a single order, iron hammers were raised and axes were swung, bricks and tiles and furniture flew around. Kowloon Walled City, a Chinese territory that stood neatly, was flattened within twelve hours, turning into a wasteland and complete desolation. The residents were unarmed, and their heavy hearts had already made them forget that this was still the territory of their motherland. The solemn national flag was torn to the ground, and the residents' own slogans of "Defending Territorial Sovereignty" were reduced to ashes along with the rubble.

Resident representatives Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu were also arrested and detained by the Hong Kong side for "resisting demolition." During the massive demolition, two young men uttered words of disapproval on the sidelines and were immediately put on prison cars by Hong Kong police, handcuffed, and sent back to the Hong Kong Police Station. The sound of collapsing houses, the cries of women and children, and the sighs on the roads were all mixed together, simply creating a scene as if a city had fallen! It is reported that a total of 74 houses were demolished this time, leaving 686 residents homeless, and the loss of property was valued at no less than 5.6 billion national currency, and the entire city was almost completely destroyed.

On the 7th, the Kwangtung and Kwangsi Diplomatic Commissioner's Office had already received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a

strong protest, declaring that the Hong Kong side should be fully responsible for all consequences arising from this matter. Mr. Guo also stated: "This is only the beginning of the incident." As for how it will "end," we must wait and see the wise decisions of our government. The matter has evolved to this point, the houses have been demolished, and more than 2,000 compatriots are being displaced. Who is responsible for our own responsibility is our own business, but the British side suddenly crossed the border to demolish houses and arrest people while the incident was still under negotiation and no results had been achieved. This responsibility naturally lies entirely with the British side. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will truly regard this as "the beginning of the incident." (Our reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### Jiangsu Province Intensifies Grain Collection

[Report from our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 8th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government stated that the central government's purchase of 1.2 million shi of provincial and county tax grain in this province for the 36th year of the Republic has been approved by the Executive Yuan.

Although the reasons given are not without merit, the matter concerns a finalized plan, and military grain is urgently needed during this time of suppression of the rebellion. At this difficult time, it is imperative to abandon local selfish views and support national policies, so that the great plan of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be achieved as soon as possible. It recently issued a circular to all counties and cities stating that they must not request exemption or reduction of quotas for any reason in the future, so as not to change the finalized plan and affect military supplies, and must still mobilize all efforts to collect the full amount without delay.

### New Year Scene in Hangzhou

[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 9th] The calamitous and difficult year of 1947 has quietly passed, ushering in the new appearance of 1948. Right at the start, we are about to encounter the Spring Festival (i.e., the Lunar New Year). This makes the new year, still in its infancy, feel incredibly bitter.

In this severe winter weather, thinking of the displaced victims of war, those living in this paradise of Hangzhou should be enjoying happiness. However, the war has brought fear, and opportunistic profiteers have raised all prices, making the Spring Festival bleak and frightening. Most poor people in Hangzhou find this "hurdle" difficult to overcome.

Soaring Prices

In the market, cotton yarn, cloth, and flour are all rising in price. The government-allocated price of Wufu cloth is 1,375,000 yuan, and the market price has risen to 1,430,000 yuan. The price of cotton yarn has surged due to the sudden increase in the price of raw cotton. For example, Lingbao cotton is now priced at 7 million yuan, an increase of 1.6 million yuan. Therefore, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn is now 65 million yuan, an increase of 5.5 million yuan.

In the jewelry alley area of Qingtai Road, the black market for gold ornaments is rampant. According to reports on the 9th, the selling price reached 11.18 million yuan per tael, and the purchase price was 11.15 million yuan. The rise in rice prices is even more frightening. The listed price for Grade 1 rice is 1.05 million yuan, Grade 2 rice is 1.03 million yuan, and Grade 3 rice is 960,000 yuan, but there is no stock available. Transactions in the black market are as high as 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan per dan.

Easing of Credit

The main reason for this drastic fluctuation in prices is the excessive easing of credit, with too many loans being issued, causing idle funds to be used for hoarding. We hope that the Central Bank will tighten credit. Although this may lead to the bankruptcy of many speculators, it can force them to release their hoarded goods, suppressing these soaring prices and bringing much happiness to the majority of the people.

The Hangzhou market before the Spring Festival is not as prosperous as it was at this time last year. Every shop is open, but business is not necessarily good. However, they are holding onto good goods, which have already tripled in price. Moreover, due to the easing of credit, they still have surplus funds to purchase goods.

Suffering in the Agricultural Sector

However, the industrial, mining, and agricultural sectors appear to be in poor condition. The industrial and mining sectors find it easier to profit from hoarding raw materials due to rising costs, especially the issue of year-end bonuses, which is causing headaches for those in charge of industrial and mining enterprises. Farmers generally experienced prosperity after the autumn harvest because grain prices were very high at that time. However, rice prices have been steadily rising ever since, never going down, and have now reached nearly 2 million yuan as the Spring Festival approaches. Farmers have already sold their rice and now have to spend money to buy it back from the traders. As for the vegetables produced in the fields, intelligent speculators know that they cannot be hoarded. Moreover, because the weather is cool, people can buy more vegetables and eat them over several days. Therefore, amidst the soaring prices, the prices of agricultural products remain relatively stable. However, farmers who want to sell their vegetables and buy some daily necessities for the Spring Festival are greatly disappointed. Therefore, among the relatively depressed industrial, mining, and agricultural sectors, the agricultural sector is suffering the most.

Civil Servants

However, there are those who are even more miserable than farmers, and that is civil servants who live on salaries. They receive 700,000 to 800,000 yuan a month, and they have elderly and children to support. How can 700,000 to 800,000 yuan support their families today?

Last year's New Year scene in paradise was characterized by a sluggish commercial sector and a "collapse" of businesses. This year's New Year scene in paradise sees the commercial situation better than last year, but workers, miners, and civil servants are all weeping silently, wondering how to get through this Spring Festival.

Improvement in City Appearance

However, although paradise is so difficult, the appearance of the city seems to be much better than last year. Last year, under the eaves of shops along the lakeside, there were piles of miserable people everywhere. This year, they were seen in early winter but have since disappeared. Last year, on Yingshi Street, Yanling Road, and Hubin Road, some miserable girls were standing in the cold wind soliciting customers in dark corners. This year, these miserable girls are gone. Last year, the fortune tellers on Chenghuang Mountain, the boatmen on West Lake, and the monks in the temples all felt that they were struggling to make ends meet when reporters met them. This year, when reporters met them, they did not have this feeling. Because this year's incense offerings in Hangzhou are unprecedented in the past forty years, these people have had their difficulties solved by the donations of worshippers.

So where have the miserable beggars and girls of paradise gone? Have they found a way to make a living? Or has the government driven them to secluded streets in order to clean up the city's appearance? I have my doubts. (Special Correspondent: Chu Yusheng)

### Three Female Corpses Found Floating in Shengang District, Jiangyin

Original Plan (4) Expand and improve rural cooperative organizations to truly facilitate agricultural trade procedures to reduce the burden on farmers.

Implementation method:

1. Select and cultivate You Qiao Agricultural Counsellors to join agricultural associations or cooperatives, so as to become cadres of these organizations and exert leadership.

2. Impart knowledge and skills to them at any time to strengthen the organization.

3. Rural cooperative organizations in various places should be widely organized and established, and various businesses should be conducted according to the circumstances, distinguishing between urgency and slowness. Those with better results may be given priority loans by agricultural loan agencies to reward them.

Original Plan (5) The Changpingcang system urgently needs to be established. Important locations in the Yangtze River Basin must complete the initial warehouse construction and storage plan as soon as possible. Local grain storage should also be strengthened, promoted and universally implemented to increase reserves.

Establishment of Changpingcang

1. Based on national defense and economic perspectives, select the areas in the Yangtze River Basin and Tianjin with grain shortages and grain producing areas, based on grain production and sales, and transportation costs, and set them up in stages.

2. Fundraising method:

1. Adopt the principle of unified warehouse administration and division of labor. Changpingcang and agricultural warehouses are integrated into a unified system to connect and cooperate with each other.

Two. Fully utilize the existing warehouses in various places, set up Changpingcang separately, and use the newly built gathering point warehouses, as well as civilian warehouses and commercial warehouses that are available for rent and have better equipment.

Three. Build new warehouses with a capacity of 10 million city stones.

3. The quantity of grain purchased and stored is estimated to be 40 million stones of rice and wheat (equivalent to more than 200 tons). The quantity of grain purchased and stored shall be determined annually based on the grain production situation. However, the quantity of grain purchased and stored in the first phase is set at 15 million stones of grain.

4. The business policy is to maintain production, regulate surpluses, and stabilize prices. The policy is described as follows:

1. Purchase: Before purchasing, the following points should be considered: (1) The general situation of local harvests, (2) The past grain price situation, (3) The estimated production cost per stone or per mu, (4) The estimated local general price. Appropriate and fair standard prices should be set separately.

Two. Transportation: Changpingcang does not provide transportation tools and completely adopts the consignment system. However, insurance must be provided based on the value to avoid losses along the way. Transportation agencies should give priority to the supply of transportation tools as military transport as much as possible, or negotiate for transportation on their behalf.

Three. Sales: When grain prices in the sales area are high, Changpingcang should immediately sell the purchased and stored grain to regulate the grain. The allocation work should be handled by the local competent grain administration agency.

Promotion of local grain storage

1. Clear grain storage: The quantity of grain stored in each province and city in the past and the distribution of warehouses shall be cleared by the grain department of each province and city within a limited time, and the list shall be submitted.

2. Fundraising method: In the next two years, 70% of the fundraising will still be based on the amount of land income, and 30% will be based on business tax, house tax, and other property interest, and will be collected on a progressive basis. The starting point for fundraising should also be determined based on the actual situation, and small households should be exempt from fundraising. After the investigation of rental income and income is completed, the fundraising standard will be re-formulated.

3. Construction of warehouses: In the next two years, the construction of new warehouses will be limited to the construction of county and city grain storage warehouses. The repair of existing warehouses or the conversion of public houses and temples will be the main focus for township grain storage warehouses. New warehouses will be built after each township has harvested more than 50 million stones. County and city warehouses must be located in places with convenient water and land transportation. Township warehouses should be located in the townships where government offices are located. All new warehouses and repairs to existing warehouses must be handled according to the reasonable construction design drawings issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Food to prevent rodent damage, insect damage, and mold smoke damage.

4. Scope of use: The scope of use of stored grain shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations:

1. Loans: The county and city grain storage management committee shall submit the report to the county and city government to be submitted to the provincial government for approval.

Two. Leveling: The county and city grain storage management committee shall submit the report to the county and city government and forward it to the provincial government for approval, and return the grain to the warehouse after the new grain is harvested.

Three. Relief: The county and city government, together with relevant agencies, shall report to the provincial government and request the Ministry of Food to verify and handle the evidence.

Four. The county and city government shall formulate a plan for the construction of warehouses and submit it to the provincial government for approval and transfer to the Ministry of Food for approval.

Five. Stored grain may not be used without authorization unless approved by the competent authorities at all levels and the county government issues a grain allocation order. Violators will be charged with theft and sale. In emergencies, the local people's authority may decide to act first and then report to the competent authorities at all levels for record.

He met with reporters at the North Station and announced: After the amendment and approval of the financial part of the implementation measures for economic reform, the plan is to seek permanent financial stability. After the integration, the Central Bank's business will develop more steadily. The issue of restoring loans from national banks is still awaiting detailed study at the quarterly meeting of the Four Banks Joint Office this Thursday before there are any clues. The rumors that the current regulations on the entry and exit of combatants and the organization of the Foreign Exchange Balance Committee will be changed are completely untrue. I have been approved to resign from the position of Chairman of the Import and Export Association. As soon as the new Chairman, Mr. Huo Bian, returns to Shanghai, the handover can be carried out. Regarding US aid to China, the US side announced that they are waiting for the technical delegation dispatched by the Chinese government to the US to negotiate. Mr. Bei Zuyi is scheduled to depart on the 14th. Foreign relief supplies are now being shipped to China in succession. The Sino-American Material Handling Committee, which is responsible for its handling and distribution, has formulated a concrete plan, which will be implemented on February 1. Recently, the financial authorities are closely monitoring the price fluctuations, coordinating with all parties, and strengthening the efforts to stabilize prices, so as to avoid sacrificing the interests of the majority due to the speculation of a few people.

After the Ministry of Finance received the order from the Executive Yuan regarding the measures to strengthen financial control, it was distributed to various financial control bureaus. The local Financial Control Bureau has already received the order and has instructed the national banks, commercial banks, trust companies, and insurance companies to implement it conscientiously. In order to understand the flow of funds in the market, the bureau attaches special importance to the loans and remittances of various financial industries. It is reported that the bureau has also sent the reporting form format formulated by the Ministry of Finance to various banks and companies to be filled out on a daily basis. The loan form is more detailed, and the loan type, borrower's name, address, quantity, purpose, etc. are all noted in detail. The remittance form only needs to fill in the remittance location, recipient, quantity, and purpose columns. Various banks and companies have followed the report form separately. The bureau will conduct a general survey once a week and will conduct a special new investigation on the current situation of various banks and companies. The time of establishment of various banks and companies, the names of the responsible persons, the amount of capital, and the type of business must be investigated in detail. The investigation form was issued on the 9th and various banks and companies are required to fill it out within a week. According to the person in charge of the bureau, this investigation is to facilitate the implementation of the general survey work, that is, the preparation for the general survey work. After mid-month, the review will begin, so that the private funds of banks and companies can be transferred to production purposes. The purpose is to stop speculation, guide funds into the right track, support legitimate businesses, and actively increase production.

### Major Players Desire to Capture and Release, Chinese Stocks Tend to Fluctuate

Chinese stocks initially showed weakness yesterday, followed by a fluctuating situation. Midway, buyers had some reserves, leading to a brief upswing. Yongsha was the first to see rising winds, but it was difficult to maintain until the closing. Various small stocks and miscellaneous stocks also gradually stabilized their positions, and the trend was mostly composed of a rotating pattern.

In the early morning, the rumor of Stalin's death shook people's hearts, causing the already weak situation to appear even more fragile. The opening was low, and Sino-French stocks continued to fall to the limit. Yongsha debuted at 740 yuan and 741 yuan, and after the opening, it was forced down to low prices of 718 yuan and 727 yuan. There were many supply sales of No. 137. Because the trading desk saw that major players were aggressively selling off-market the previous day, they were not optimistic about the strength of No. 137 at this time. They hoped to initiate small transactions immediately. It was generally believed that the major players intended to offset off-market, so people's hearts were better. Soon, off-market quotations were indeed high, and some people also bought in the market, so they rose to 738 yuan and 756 yuan. Interest prices opened high to 2.4 and 2.85 jiao, then retreated to 720 yuan and 730 yuan. Nos. 207, 65, 73, 155, 30, and 23 bought and delivered successively, while No. 152 and others delivered immediately after entering. Although Nos. 117, 98, and 54 were sold, they were still raised to high prices of 750 yuan and 765 yuan. Various small stocks also reported potential profits. There was a conclusion of many floating shares near the closing, and the noon closing price was 724 yuan and 743 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, the immediately tradable shares of Sino-French stocks had a rebound after falling to the limit, still down 10%. Domestic underwear, matches, Huaxin, and Yongye fell by 5%, while Xinguang, Jingfu, and Wuhe rose slightly. Zhabei, Datong, and China Silk were flat, and the rest generally reported declines. The immediately tradable shares of Meiya fell by 5%, Dongxing was still flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Hua Ti rose slightly, while Yongsha and Xinhe fell slightly. Various old stocks off-market were quite stable.

### Government Bonds Rose and Fell Intermittently, Foreign Stocks Changed from Weak to Stable

Government bonds yesterday were mixed, with Class C falling and miscellaneous ones rising, so the price difference narrowed slightly. The detection trend in the middle of the journey is also difficult to maintain for a long time. Tongbing opened at 52,000 yuan in the morning, rose to 57,000 yuan, fell to 50,500 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. The transaction was about 6 million. Compared with the previous closing, Classes A and B rose by 700 yuan, Class C fell by 700 yuan, and Classes D and E rose by 1,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks yesterday changed from weak to stable, and Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Power narrowed to 2.7 yuan, and it was easy to revive in the middle of the journey. Yisha started from 56,000 yuan and rose to 625,000 yuan at the end. Securities firms advanced first and then exited, Guangbang slightly paid, and foreign firms exited. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the paper version rose by 5%, Yeguang fell by 10%, and Ken Zhihuache remained flat, and the rise and fall of the remaining shares were visible.

### Silk All Show Weakness

The artificial silk market continued to decline yesterday. In the morning, No. 120 Xuzi Yuguang opened a price of 10 million yuan for the first week. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, and the market conditions of various materials, they were all reported to be small, resulting in frequent price drops. The spot price was at least 99.5 million yuan, and the noon closing price was 100 million yuan. The first week was 2 million yuan, and in the afternoon, it slightly improved, once reaching 7.8 million yuan, but it fell again to 5 million yuan. As a result, it fell 7 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory Silk

The market was very quiet yesterday, and all parties held a wait-and-see attitude, so only bidding was heard in the market without any transactions. Yesterday morning, only Grade D was sold for 14 million yuan, but with an eight-day term. There were no transactions in the afternoon due to Saturday, and the bidding prices for various grades of factory silk and Qianjing were similar to the previous day.

Silk Fabrics

The market was flat and weak yesterday. The opening transaction price of Zhang Zhen silk quilt cover was around 670,000 yuan. The shorts took advantage of the low to buy in, rising to 1 million yuan. However, due to the softness of people's hearts, it fell again to around 700,000 yuan. At 9:30, it rose again to 1.2 million yuan for a transaction, and the closing price fell to 900,000 yuan for the spot price, and 1.45 million yuan for the first week. There was a transaction of 70,000 yuan for Huajin. Minsheng Pingduan and factory stocks were 150,000 yuan. The transaction of other goods was very rare, and the market conditions did not change much.

### Taiwan Sugar's Rising Trend Slightly Subdued

The sugar market yesterday was slightly subdued due to the collapse of some speculators in recent days, and the industry was quite wary. The association's market was relatively stable, with spot prices fluctuating slightly, and futures warehouse receipts as small as 670,000 yuan. Spot 4.5 white bags were 1.86 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan, 24 coarse white was 1.89 million yuan, down 10,000 yuan, and 20 medium sand white was out of stock, and the original price remained unchanged. Native sugar remained firm, with Shantou Qing opening at 1.7 million yuan at the original price. Diaoging was out of stock, up 70,000 yuan to 1.67 million yuan. Xinghua white bags were 1.865 million yuan to 1.89 million yuan, up 60,000 yuan, and Zhuang was 1.8 million yuan to 1.84 million yuan, up 20,000 to 60,000 yuan. Yu Chi was 1.61 million yuan to 1.7 million yuan, up 450,000 yuan, and the rest lacked pairs.

### Yarn and Cloth Selling Prices Continue to Decline

The cotton yarn market was low at the opening yesterday. Customers were shifting away, and local merchants' intentions were also weak. Favorable news spread in the market, and many floating shares were cashed in. 42-count Jinfeng yarn was once as low as 60.5 million yuan. Near the closing, local replica manufacturers saw a small increase and returned to 61.5 million yuan, down 2.9 million yuan from the previous day. In addition, various counts of coarse and fine yarn also declined, ranging from 800,000 to 1.23 million.

Due to the decline in gold and banknote black markets, tighter silver roots, and the authorities' thorough investigation of households, the financial pressure was severe, and people's hearts were empty in the cotton cloth market. Similar products were sold endlessly, and many floating shares competed to escape. The supply and sales period for spinning construction arrived, and the chips were abundant, so the market conditions gradually deteriorated. As a result, 12-pound tou and other grades of silk cloth continued to fall by 5670,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the trend was that Shilin cloth and colored cloth factories were generally high, and the selling price was uniquely brisk. The markets for other bleached cloth, twill serge, and trade record cloth were all sluggish. Also, it was reported that the Spinning Construction Company supplied and sold trumpet children's fine cloth, with a listed price of 1.31 million yuan, Jinlian Miaowu Yuanbi 1.48 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen Zhigong 1.58 million yuan. A total of 27,120 pieces of cloth were sold, and 711 application forms were received. There were 18 domestic manufacturers, purchasing 780 pieces of cloth, and 693 cloth numbers, distributing 26,340 pieces of cloth.

### Spot Cotton Market Turns Active

Yesterday's spot cotton market was active due to the expansion of factory absorption, and the industry traded with each other. The Spinning and Weaving Corporation's registration for purchasing flower clothing also began at the same time, and the opening price was also higher than generally expected, so people's hearts were firm, and 1,150 bales were traded. The price delivered to the factory was 6.035 million for Lingbin, 6.448 million for Hankou fine velvet 5.291 million, and the spinning construction purchased registered flower clothing for 5.9 million for Mo fine and 6.5 million for German cotton. The industry traded at a warehouse delivery price of 4.96 million for Han fine, 5 million to 5.512 million, 4.96 million for Chongsha city, 5.952 million for Shandong wooden racks, and 1.23 million for Zhoupu seed flowers.

### Customers and Goods Compete to Sell, People's Hearts Tend to be Empty, and Rice Prices Fall Across the Board

Rice Stores Must Mark Selling Prices or Be Punished

[Our newspaper] Due to the authorities' large supply of silk in the market, people's hearts are softening, and the rice market is sluggish. Customers and goods compete to sell, and rice prices fall across the board. A total of 23,944 shi of goods were registered in the market. The Market Management Committee supplied 9,000 shi each in the North and South markets, a total of 18,000 shi, an increase of 3,000 shi from the previous day, and it was still distributed at a price of 1.35 million yuan. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, said yesterday that the authorities' policy of supplying rice in the market will continue until the rice price stabilizes. Director Wu affirmed that the rice price will fall back and will definitely be lower than 1.35 million next week.

According to Director Wu's analysis of the reasons for the rise in rice prices, the average daily arrival of rice in the city in January was more than 15,000 shi, which is sufficient to declare that the source is not exhausted. If it is certain that merchants are to blame, then the high prices in the producing areas are also the truth, so the main reason is still the issuance of large banknotes. The large batch of rice purchased by Shanghai grain merchants was previously detained in Nanjing, and after investigation, it was released and is on its way to Shanghai. The aforementioned municipal food will not form a problem of availability. At present, the authorities supply rice in large quantities in the market at a price of 1.35 million per day. After adding profit and transportation costs, the retail price should not exceed 1.5 million, otherwise it will be a windfall profit, and social avoidance will be given to the ban. Director Wu also said: The Social Bureau previously ordered each retail rice store to mark the price in real terms, but this has been the case for a long time, and most rice stores no longer do it. During this period of rice price fluctuations, in order to avoid unscrupulous merchants from auctioning prices, the rice stores have been ordered by the industry association to instruct the rice stores to restore the pricing method, and must mark the rice and the price per stone on the rice, otherwise they will be punished regardless of whether they exceed the limit price or not.

### Mixed Grains Rose and Fell Intermittently, Oil Fell Sharply

Yesterday, a total of more than 14,600 shi of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets, and the supply of rice and grain increased. A total of 17,545 shi were sold in the North and South markets. The supply and demand were appropriate, and the market conditions stabilized. The price of Xian rice softened in the middle and second roads, but Baiyuan Yinyuan rose by 340,000 yuan due to the strong winter sales hall.

Flour was oversupplied and undersold, and the rise stopped and the fall started, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Bean skin sales were also sluggish, losing 78,000 yuan. There were few soybean cake payers, and many wanted to get rid of it, cutting 20,000 yuan sharply. Huangdou Kebang and Hua were about to move, and the street heard of dispersal. The oil factory reduced the price of finished products, and the intention was to. Early set noon tired, closing voice soft. Black-eyed peas had weak transactions in both the North and South Oceans, forming a sluggish rise. Black-eyed peas were adopted in the North Ocean, soaring, rising by 340,000 yuan. Lentils were another aroma, and the steps were built up by 340,000 yuan. Under the fierce purchase of red beans in South China, they galloped by 450,000 yuan.

Red sorghum was lightly traded and had few gentlemen, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Corn in the north, first, then cake. Raw peanuts turned and fell sharply by more than 100,000 yuan. Sesame digestion was light, falling back by 350,000 yuan. Xunma was also lacking in spirit.

The oil market was oversupplied and plunged into fatigue. The factory supplied a large amount of soybean oil, which fell sharply by more than 100,000 yuan. Raw oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil all fell by 560,000 yuan, and there were still few recipients near the closing. Wheat was slightly strong by 120,000 yuan.

### Purchase of Stored Cotton, 366 Market Loads Traded

[Our newspaper] China Spinning and Weaving Corporation yesterday began to purchase registered cotton stored by cotton merchants on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee. Chief of the Procurement Department of the Yarn Management Committee also personally presided over the acceptance. As a result, a total of about 366 market loads were traded, all of which were the raw materials for 41-count spinning at 142.5 hours. The purchase price was 6.5 million yuan per market load, and 7.87 million yuan per sima load yun.

[Also, it was reported] China Spinning and Weaving Corporation yesterday announced three points that customers should pay attention to when selling cotton: Huai Warehouse: Send the goods to the warehouse designated by the Yarn Management Committee for delivery. Cash Collection: After the company sends personnel to take large samples and they match the original small samples, weigh them immediately and take 80% of the payment according to the weighing code sheet (with a stamp indicating that the large and small samples match). Inspection: If the moisture content exceeds 12% and the impurities exceed 2%, deduct according to the standard, fill in a formal receipt, and settle the payment with the company.

### The Yarn Management Committee Yesterday Set a Deadline to Vigorously Manage the Registration of Yarn, Cloth, and Replication Industries

[Our newspaper] The Yarn Management Committee yesterday (10th) notified the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Commercial Association to inform manufacturers engaged in yarn and cloth and replication industries that those who meet the following conditions should apply to the committee for registration before the 15th of this month. (A) Those who have joined the local industry association, obtained a membership certificate, and registered with the competent authority and obtained a certificate.

According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday: This matter is in the interests of the manufacturers in each industry, and it is hoped that members of each industry will handle it as scheduled, and fortunately do not make any mistakes.

### Full Text of the Agricultural Part of the Implementation Plan of the Economic Plan

(Continued from page 5)

Original Plan (6) The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote the agricultural warehouse storage, agricultural product mortgage, and agricultural product marketing business, so as to use financial power to assist the government, support production, and control the source of food, so as to prepare for emergencies.

Implementation Measures. A. Regarding the agricultural product marketing loan business: In order to cooperate with the current agricultural loan policy, marketing loans should select large-volume products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, guide civilian organizations, and provide loans to assist their marketing business. The government encourages and guides farmers to organize their own processing and marketing institutions, and the Farmers Bank of China provides loans to assist their operations. Improve inspection and grading, improve the quality of agricultural products, so as to meet the needs of manufacturers and restore market reputation. The inspection of rice and wheat should be carried out only by Mang (hosted by the Agricultural and Forestry Department). The government formulates methods for protecting and encouraging the marketing of agricultural products, and provides convenience in transportation and reduces or exempts taxes. B. Regarding the agricultural product storage mortgage loan awards: In order to regulate the agricultural product surplus and stabilize agricultural product prices, the Farmers Bank of China selects appropriate locations in the agricultural product distribution areas of each province to actively set up agricultural warehouses at all levels to carry out storage mortgage loan business. For the types of warehouses, agricultural warehouses are set up in conjunction with Changping warehouses. (1) Simple agricultural warehouses - guided by the Farmers Bank of China for farmers' groups to set up on their own, and provide loans to assist them. (2) Agricultural warehouses - set up by the Farmers Bank of China in convenient locations for agricultural production and transportation to handle storage mortgage storage transfer business

Original Plan (7) Widely set up nurseries, promote afforestation, and effective methods must be used to maintain their growth. The natural forest security forest should be owned and operated by the state, and other suitable wasteland and barren land should be supervised by private enterprises, and attention should be paid to the operation and encouragement of fuel wood forests.

Implementation Measures: Supervise the provinces, cities, and counties to increase the area of nurseries, set up cup yards, and implement afforestation in accordance with the method of strengthening afforestation. Divide the national civil forest supervision area, imitate the US Forest Service Commissioner system, supervise people's afforestation and handle forestry loans, technical guidance, and assist people in leading afforestation. Enrich the management office of state-owned forest areas, and legally delineate state-owned forest areas in important natural forest areas across the country to implement forest resource protection and utilization. Actively develop soil and water conservation in the three major river basins of the country, and sand prevention on the coast of the Yellow River Flood Area in the Northwest and border fortress national defense security forests, so as to protect the territory and improve the natural environment. Conscientiously follow the Chairman's instructions and instructions to handle the greening of the capital and national scenic spots, scenic forests, roadside trees, and the development of park forests. Quickly conduct a survey and survey of suitable afforestation areas across the country, and engage in demonstration operations of water source forests and special economic forests. For other suitable wasteland and barren land, focus on military industrial afforestation and encourage private enterprises, focusing on agricultural tool timber and fuel wood forests. All large-scale nursery and forest farms should set up forest police in accordance with the forest police rules to strengthen management and protection matters. Issue an order to all cities and counties to organize forest protection associations, cultivate people's habits of protecting forests, strictly prohibit burning mountains and indiscriminate logging, and divide firewood collection areas and close mountains to cultivate forests, and earnestly handle forest protection.

Original Plan (8) Use agricultural slack to train farmers in civil engineering and stone work skills, and develop rural side businesses to improve farmers' lives.

Implementation Measures: Supervise local agricultural authorities and other engineering-related authorities to use agricultural slack to train farmers to build farmland water conservancy and repair roads and build houses, and civil engineering and stone work skills such as manufacturing agricultural tools, so as to build new rural areas on their own. Advocate and assist farmers in setting up or improving agricultural product processing and other various side businesses to increase farmers' income and enrich the agricultural promotion institutes in each county and the agricultural associations in various places, so as to become the main driving force for the universal training of farmers and the advocacy of side businesses.

Original Plan (9) For the livestock industry, attention should be paid to the prevention and control of animal diseases, the improvement of livestock quality, the increase of livestock types, and the encouragement of increased livestock production. Feed crops should be increased in agricultural areas, and wasteland should be used to expand livestock breeding. In natural nomadic areas, the development of livestock breeding should still be the main focus, and the management of pastoral areas should be strengthened, grasslands should be cultivated, and improved feed should be planted in order to stabilize and improve livestock production and improve the livelihood of herdsmen.

Implementation Measures. A. Prevention and control of animal diseases: Supervise the provinces to "prevent epidemics" rather than "cure epidemics" and pay attention to the combined implementation of political epidemic prevention and technical epidemic prevention. Mass production of serum vaccines for routine epidemic prevention and emergency epidemic treatment. Train epidemic prevention personnel to enrich epidemic prevention equipment, and set up epidemic prevention information networks to improve the epidemic prevention organization. Divide the country into ten major epidemic prevention areas, each with a veterinary epidemic prevention office to assist in the universal promotion of epidemic prevention work in various places. In addition to the seven epidemic prevention offices that have been established in the Northwest, Qinghai, Southwest, Huaxi, Southeast, North China, and Jin Sui, the Northeast epidemic prevention office should be formally established in 77 years, and a new epidemic prevention office should be planned, and finally a Tibet epidemic prevention office should be established. B. Change the quality of livestock, strengthen the improvement of breeding livestock. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has set up two cattle farms, one livestock farm, five sheep breeding farms, and four pig breeding farms in Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guizhou, Gansu, Sui, and Ning provinces to engage in breeding and promote profits. Universally set up good seed breeding stations to facilitate the improvement of civil livestock (each livestock farm has set up breeding stations and has been breeding with civil livestock).

### Completion of the Luo Hui Canal

—Photographed by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan

Central Shaanxi Province, formerly known as Guanzhong, Shangshu "Its soil is yellow and bad, its fields are the best" is extremely beneficial to agriculture, but the land is highly high, and rain is rare. Every time there is a disaster, people are displaced and die of hunger. Those who cannot be counted will revitalize water conservancy, and write a fundamental plan for famine relief. The Luo Hui Canal is one of the eight Hui water conservancy plans ordered by the Chinese water conservancy pioneer Mr. Yishe. It draws the Luo River to irrigate the plains south of Dali and Chaoyi counties, with an area of 1,335 square miles, which can irrigate 500,000 mu of land. The scale of the project is the crown of the eight Hui. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Shaanxi Provincial Government set up the Yinluo Engineering Office and began surveying. The design was completed in the 23rd year. Due to the huge engineering cost, which could not be borne by local financial resources, it was approved by the central government to set up the Jingluo Engineering Bureau, which was established in May and actively carried out according to the plan. By June of the 26th year, the Nazang was counted as 521 kilometers, and the total length of the main canals was 80 kilometers. Major buildings such as dams, canal gates, aqueducts, culverts, bridges, and the first, second, third, and fourth tunnels have been completed successively.

The fifth tunnel, which passes through the Tielian Mountain, encountered gushing springs and quicksand, making progress extremely difficult. Between the 27th and 34th years, various methods were tried, but due to the wartime, the material and financial resources were insufficient, and the effect was minimal. By September of the 30th year, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan was established, and Chinese and foreign experts were selected to go to the project area to jointly discuss and improve the methods. In September of the following year, Chairman Jiang ordered that the project be completed within a time limit, and the Water Conservancy Commission sent senior technicians to the project to supervise. After all kinds of hardships, manpower finally overcame the difficulties, and the entire tunnel was penetrated on November 26 of the 35th year. Together with the old tunnel in the north section, it is 3,377 meters long. It was officially waterproofed on December 12. The canal is more than 30 kilometers long. The surveying and excavation took 15 years, and the total engineering cost as of the end of September of this year, according to the annual price index of Shaanxi Province, converted into pre-war French currency, totaled 3015,093 yuan.

According to the approved irrigation plan, after the Water Conservancy Bureau urges the people to dig the bucket canal, the annual increase in wheat production can be 100,000 market loads, bean valley miscellaneous grains 75,000 market stones, and cotton 7.5 million market stones. The entire land itself can be increased in value by 225 billion yuan.

There are five culverts of the main canal to drain the slope water on the left side of the canal, this is one of them.

The terrain is measured from the diversion gate to the three main canals in the middle, east, and west. The canal slope is from 15/10,000 to 25/10,000, depending on the slope of the terrain. The purpose is to ensure that no water is wasted, the fields can be universally irrigated, and a considerable flow rate is maintained to avoid the disadvantages of erosion or siltation. The picture shows the canal water flowing down after the water is released.

The main canal of the Luo Hui Canal starts from the Shishi Waterfall of the Luo River in Laozhen Village, Chengcheng County, Shaanxi Province, and a rolling dam is built to draw the canal. The dam is 16.20 meters high and the dam top is 177.00 meters long. The dam surface is of the渥奇 type, and the dam axis is arc-shaped. The total dam volume is 20.525 cubic meters. Construction started in March of the 23rd year, and the entire dam was successful in January of the 24th year.

The diversion gate is located at the main canal in Yijing Village, east of the village, where it is divided into three main canals in the middle, east, and west. Each gate has one hole, which is 2.6 meters wide and 2.3 meters high. It is opened and closed by a winch.

There are two large aqueducts on the main canal, one in the Quli River, which is 116 meters long, the slot is 3.31 meters wide, the section is 6.72 square meters, the slope is one thousandth, and the slot water is 2 meters deep.

The canal gate and the flood discharge gate, the distance between the two gates is 250 meters from the inlet, which is the control mechanism of the entire canal. The canal gate has two holes, and the flood discharge gate is on the right side of the canal gate, forming a 90-degree right angle, with three holes. During the flood season, the muddy water entering the canal is discharged into the river from here, and the opening and closing of the gates are controlled by a winch.

There are five holes in the main canal, and the fifth hole is the most difficult to construct. It is 3,377 meters long and 3 meters wide, with a slope of one thousandth. In October of the 22nd year, engineer Zhang Pingzhi died in the fall under the high cliff of the No. 5 hole when he went to measure upstream, so it was named "Pingzhi Hole" to commemorate him.

### On Peepshows

— Jie Ding

When I was young, peepshows had their own world. As long as a "peepshow" arrived in the streets and alleys, people would immediately rush to occupy the viewing holes (I don't know what they should be called). The operator would constantly change the animated pictures, chanting descriptive words for each picture. The viewer would squint one eye and look into the peepshow box with the other. Through the action of the lenses and the box, ordinary pictures became extraordinary. Magnified, they emitted an illusory light, seeming much more animated. Amidst the cries of the peepshow "sellers," such as "forest of fair legs," "spectacle of bombings," and "hand-to-hand combat," the viewing became even more enjoyable. The peepshow became a precious treasure for those in the countryside who had never seen a movie.

There was also another advantage to watching peepshows. The viewers all lowered their heads, one eye aligned with the viewing hole, their faces hidden in front of the box, and their bodies hunched over. Others couldn't see the expressions on the viewers' faces, much less the pictures inside the box. Therefore, whether the viewer was happy, ashamed, sneering, amazed, or laughing and scolding, it was all up to them. Others would just assume that you had seen something "moving" enough to elicit such reactions, and wouldn't ridicule your ignorance or being surprised by little things, nor would they guess what you were actually seeing. Even if people hurled a few curses, they would only blame themselves for not seeing the world inside the peepshow box, and would be deemed shallow.

However, as soon as the peepshow was taken apart, all the wonderful scenes disappeared, leaving only a few ordinary, commonly seen, gaudy pictures. This would not only disappoint the viewers, but also cause them to be scolded as worthless, which would be a great letdown.

Originally, the peepshow relied solely on the small lenses, box, and viewing hole. First, the pictures were enclosed in a dark little box, and then viewed through the "viewpoint" hole, becoming vivid "scenes." Therefore, the peepshow sellers could only shout loudly: "Without viewing through my lens, there is no magic." At the same time, they paid attention to controlling the lens: concave lenses, convex lenses, refracting glass, triangular prisms, and the addition of concave-convex reflecting mirrors on the sides. They also painted the lenses with red, yellow, blue, and white colors. Through refraction, light separation, total reflection, and other effects, the scenes finally came to life. As for the pictures being viewed, they could be picked up anywhere; as long as they passed through the lens, it didn't matter what they were.

It seems that movies are more "public," but they also go through several "lens filters," as well as makeup, directing, and editing. The reality obtained is actually limited, and the peepshow has been eliminated.

However, I prefer simple natural scenery or crude song and dance dramas, because the dazzling variety of peepshows and the like can only make people's eyes blur.

### Perseverance

After Holcomb's watch was stolen by a pickpocket, he asked people everywhere, "What time is it now?" After asking for more than two years and catching sight of thousands of watches, he finally caught the pickpocket. Holcomb is from Memphis, USA.

After Mrs. Lees of Hollywood had her first child, she desperately tried to get her child on the screen, but she failed. Her children came one after another, but Mrs. Lees' ambition remained unchanged. When her eighth child, Ni, grew up to be twelve years old, he finally jumped onto the screen.

Recently, the owner of a plumbing store in Oklahoma, USA, received 356 silver coins, each worth fifty cents, when collecting a debt. It turned out that the customer had called the plumbing store to repair his bathtub. According to the customer himself, every time he took a bath, he would drop a fifty-cent silver coin into a small container next to the bathtub, accumulating it little by little and using it to repair the bathtub, which was an excessive amount.

Mrs. Baker from Minnesota, USA, sent her husband the same knee-bending greeting card for twenty-five consecutive years!

### Talking About Sleeves

— Ren Weiyin

When the weather is cold, sleeves show their special function. A long robe with warm sleeves, both hands tucked inside, is quite interesting.

Speaking of sleeves, it's a long story. Since childhood, they have been used to wipe noses and tears, in both China and the West. It is said that the buttons on the cuffs of Western suits were originally sewn on the surface to prevent wiping noses with the sleeves. Later, the bad habit was changed, and the buttons were moved to the lower part of the cuffs, becoming decorations. Even a small object has its evolutionary history. And the function of sleeves is not limited to this: Traveling to Sichuan, I saw in a small town that the villagers all covered their hands when they met, which was deeply confusing. Why was the European style so thoroughly implemented! Later, I learned that it was a business custom, not to speak but to use fingers as numbers, "discussing prices in the sleeves." I couldn't help but suddenly realize that the function of sleeves was even more admirable. As for the ancient saying "sweating like rain, spreading sleeves forming shade," it was probably not boasting. The Taoist "universe in the sleeves," although mysterious, is like the ping-pong ball-sized atomic bomb that can destroy Hiroshima. With a wave of a large sleeve, how could Sun Wukong, who made a scene in the Heavenly Palace, not be captured!

Those who appreciate elegance like to talk about "red sleeves adding fragrance," but "thin emerald sleeves in the cold weather" inevitably bring shivers, losing that fresh flavor. Sleeves also have expressions. In opera, a shake of the sleeve can win a huge round of applause. When friends fall out, they "fling their sleeves and leave." The weapon hidden in the sleeve is called a "sleeve blade." If they disagree, our heroes would shout "swoosh!" and release a "sleeve arrow," sealing the throat with blood, guaranteeing a visit to the King of Hell in no time.

The use of sleeves is both wonderful and broad. No wonder elegant people all want to "dance well with long sleeves," seeking the art of sleeves. Since sleeves can be used to negotiate prices, hide mechanisms, flip buckets, and lift monkeys, what can't be done in this world? No wonder gentle breezes blow, sleeves dance, money pollutes the fields, starving people fill the roads, and even the country is shaken and the nation is in danger.

As for the pedantic scholars in the village, the poor talents, inevitably experiencing a cold pillow and clean sleeves, it is all because they have sleeves but do not know how to dance well. Su Dongpo's "don't lightly value the sowing of seeds with sleeves" is just self-mockery. Yuan Haowen's "now the world is watched with sleeves folded" is A Q spirit. Everything is born with its purpose. Oh sleeves, those who use them well will soar to success and become rich, those who do not use them well will only wipe their noses and tears. With sighs, I call out "Amen" three times, wishing that those in the world who do not understand the philosophy of sleeves deeply will promptly awaken!

### Qualifications

In the December issue of the Chinese Education Circle, there is an article by Mr. Dong Weichuan, discussing the uselessness of diplomas. It uses a dialogue format to tell two stories of people who became college presidents without obtaining university diplomas, which makes me feel a lot of emotion. I remember that after graduating from university, I didn't want to receive that piece of paper at all. Unemployment couldn't turn it into a meal ticket, working couldn't turn it into a guarantee, and finding a job couldn't turn it into a matchmaker. What was it for? However, the school at that time hoarded the diplomas, partly because they had a headache about the difficulty of storing them, and partly because they couldn't easily distribute them, because the tuition fees owed for four years were all relied upon on this piece of paper as collateral, like a ransom ticket. Knowing that it wasn't worth much money, they still couldn't break the rules.

I finally had to go and collect this glorious piece of paper that "entitles me to a Bachelor of Arts," because I had to teach "civics." Civics cannot be taught privately, but must be inspected, province-level, central-level, presented layer by layer as if narrating qualifications, and a diploma is required. I had no choice but to spend twenty-six yuan (for a supplementary fee) to take it out from the bottom of the registration office's box, three years and six months after graduation. When I received it, Registrar Mr. Kong lectured me in a voice like a broken gong: "Why didn't you collect it earlier? Why are you causing trouble now!" I stuck out my tongue: "Sorry, if I wasn't in a hurry, I would have asked you to keep it for a few more years." Thanks to this collection, when the July 7th Incident occurred, just these kinds of unclaimed certificates filled several large boxes, and followed the maps and instruments through thousands of mountains and rivers to escape to the interior. Maybe some were lost.

The certificate was only used this once—but I think the less it's used, the better, at least indicating that your profession is stable, and you don't have to be like the curfew in the concession in the past, checking your citizen's card back and forth. But recently it seems to have changed a bit. To be a middle school teacher requires inspection, and elementary school requires even more inspection, which means that you have to present the facts at any time. One day, maybe you have to carry it with you like a passport, in case of questioning. Then, I hope to reprint the certificate as big as a monthly tram ticket, so that it doesn't take up too much space in my pocket.

I have many classmates, all nicknamed "Half Year," such as "Zhang Half Year," "Pi Half Year," and so on. Why? Because when they teach, they must make a conclusion in half a year, either being driven away by the students or being dismissed by the authorities, hence this name. These rice buckets often put "BA from XX University" on their business cards. If it is a national university, they have to hang this golden signboard even more grandly. Thinking about it carefully, is the Bachelor of Arts and so on specially set up for this kind of people? Are diplomas also specially issued for this kind of people? For example, he also studied at a normal school and has accumulated more than ten "half-year" experiences. Now he has a dozen employment certificates and diplomas to be inspected, then he will definitely pass without objection—and he is a first-class teacher in terms of experience, so abundant, is it possible that he is a good teacher who just talks the talk? From now on, there will be no more "half year"? Heaven knows!

This is really a difficult problem. Those in charge of administration can say: "According to you, can any Tom, Dick, or Harry be a public educator? No need for inspection, no need for qualification?" I dare not say that. I just feel that those with certificates are not necessarily Tom, Dick, or Harry, and those without certificates may be talented. Wang Anshi's "Biography of Lord Mengchang of Redemption" says it well: "The appearance of crowing chickens and thieving dogs in his door is why scholars do not come!" China's talents and people with special skills sometimes prefer to be buried rather than be in the same trough as ordinary horses, of course, this is too individualistic and is not worth learning, but the fact is that losing ten talents because of this is something that cannot be helped.

From a historical point of view, this method of emphasizing qualifications is also out of necessity. In ancient times, elections were the norm, with filial piety and integrity, and those who understood the classics and practiced virtue... In the Han Dynasty, each county and state would elect one person for every 200,000 people. Whether democratic or not, it generally paid more attention to public opinion, which was a rational path. After the Yellow Turban Rebellion, the population migrated, and the election administration was interrupted. War is the source of all evils. From then on, the method of investigation and recommendation was equivalent to being abolished. During Cao Cao's time, Chen Qun suggested the Nine-Rank System, although "the upper ranks have no poor families, and the lower ranks have no aristocratic families," it still couldn't completely abandon public justice. Xu Shao of Runan was a specialist in upholding justice. When the "stopping-year system" came, it officially moved towards the path of qualification, which used the length of service as the standard for qualification. Talent and intelligence were not considered, which was criticized by many people in the past. After the imperial examination system arose, the stopping-year system was no longer in effect, but it was still embedded in the imperial examination, because those who had already served all had to look at their seniority to be promoted.

In reality, this is not comparable to today. Although the method of imperial examination has flaws, its greatest feature is that it provides equal opportunities for the general public. Now, clerks and secretaries need to take exams and have qualifications, middle school teachers need qualifications, and elementary school teachers need qualifications: but how many department heads and university presidents have come from being clerks and secretaries! Only state officials are allowed to set fires, what's the point?

### Strange Turtle

— Shi Shi

The Central Zoo in New York City, USA, recently received a pair of rare turtles donated by explorer York. Their flesh is pale, their shells are scarlet, and one eye is pale blue while the other is black. The audience was amazed.

### Remembering Xiong Binghuang

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

Xiong Binghuang, also known as Taixi, passed away in Hong Kong at the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China, which is now the tenth anniversary. Dr. Hu Shi, a famous figure in Macau, wrote a commemorative article, and Madam Xiong, Ms. Mao, wrote a long article describing the process of avoiding the plague and dying from overwork. Xiong was from Fenghuang Hall in Hunan Province, a tribute student in the Ren Chen year, and was selected as a Jinshi in the Jia Wu year, becoming a Shuchang in the Hanlin Academy. In the Wu Xu year, he participated in the Reform Movement in his hometown with Chen Sanli Boyan and others. Several years later, with the help of Zhao Erxun and Zhan Ze, he was appointed as a Supervisory Officer in the three eastern provinces, and was granted the title of Salt Transport Commissioner. In the second year of the Republic of China, he became the Prime Minister of the State Council. He resigned in the third year and devoted himself to social undertakings, founding a charitable orphanage in Xiangshan, Pingxi, to educate poor children, which was a great merit. In the 25th year, he married Mao Yanwen at Moore Hall in Shanghai. Taixi was sixty-six years old, and Mao was thirty-three years old, totaling ninety-nine. White hair and rosy cheeks were praised as a good match. Xiong's late wife, Zhu, had passed away. Mao had a long-standing friendship with the family and was a younger generation. Zhu Tingqi, the Director of the Guanwu Department, and the three families all had kinship relations, so it was arranged. The Beijing press commissioned me to write a wedding couplet that would include all of the above points, so I embellished it as follows: "At the age of near antiquity, playing a song of phoenix seeking phoenix, ninety-nine elixirs are completed, just as thirty-three lines are fulfilled, ascending to the court of Zhu Tingqi, seeing the appearance of Mao Yanwen, a double fulfillment of wishes, who says that sixty-six is incapable." The Shanghai newspapers carried Mrs. Feng's saying, "Old classmates become new aunts," and "Old uncle becomes big brother-in-law," clarifying the generations, which was amusing.

After the "September 18th" Incident, followed by the "January 28th" Incident, the government convened the "National Crisis Conference," and Xiong was invited. At that time, Wang Jingwei mentioned during the weekly memorial service in Luoyang that "the Twenty-One Demands to Japan in 1915 were signed by Yuan Shikai and co-signed by Xiong Binghuang, a member of today's National Crisis Conference. This person is still in Shanghai. If he comes here, we will kill him!" Xiong saw the report, angry and laughing, and immediately wrote two letters to Wang, saying: "1915 was the fourth year of the Republic of China. I had already resigned as Prime Minister of the State Council in March of the third year of the Republic of China, more than a year apart. Who co-signed this? If you check the government gazette, you will know the mistake. This matter is really a joke, not just an ordinary 'misattribution.' According to the historical record, the one who signed the treaty with the Japanese envoy, Ijuin Hikokichi, in the fourth year of the Republic of China was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lu Zhengxiang, and the one who co-signed the order to announce the treaty was the Secretary of State, Xu Shichang, which has nothing to do with Xiong. Wang's words were frivolous, so absurd, and his attitude was excited, seemingly patriotic and anti-Japanese, with boiling blood, reaching the extreme. Who would have expected that during the occupation period, he would become the leader of the puppet government, a traitor who flattered Japan, while the Xiong he wanted to kill preserved his integrity and never changed his principles until death. Human feelings are unpredictable, truly hard to say in one word.

### Idle Talk about Cigarettes

— Jing Wen

Looking at the Ruby Queen cigarette held between my fingers, I feel that the burden of life is getting heavier and heavier. From "Good Luck," "Marquis," "Great Front Gate" to today's "British Brand," I can't help but sigh at the sadness of life. In a few days, I may only be able to "enjoy" "Hartmann's" or "Old Knife Brand."

Saying that smoking cigarettes is a kind of "enjoyment" in life may not win the sympathy of some people, because even opium can be quit, let alone a few cigarettes. However, for those who know what a wonderfully indescribable thing a cigarette is, they must also know that quitting opium is even more difficult—difficult because cigarettes do not have a real "addiction," difficult because they have a kind of unforgettable pleasure. For those who do not yet have the habit of smoking cigarettes, I will never move them to try, because this is a personal habit and cannot be forced. Conversely, for those who have already experienced the pleasure, I will never advise them to quit, because not only am I a failed trier myself, but I have also seen countless enthusiasts return to their original "positions." Now I have already suppressed myself with the determination of unwavering resolve, vowing to become a lifelong comrade of the "cigarette smokers."

After smoking, if one suddenly has the intention to quit, it generally stems from three motivations. The first is economic, the second is illness, and the third is spiritual self-reflection. Let's not talk about the first two reasons for now. The so-called spiritual self-reflection often arises from those who have been smoking for a long time. Many young people who usually keep themselves clean and dislike smoking and drinking later unconsciously develop the habit of smoking on accidental occasions, and sometimes they can't help but feel guilty, thinking that they have lost the identity of a good young person, and even secretly worrying that smoking may be the beginning of their degenerate lives.

However, this is unnecessary worry. Because smoking cigarettes is different from smoking opium after all. The anesthetic power of opium can make a person's life indulge in it and sink into the black sea, no longer hoping for anything else. Although the nicotine contained in cigarettes also has some anesthetic effect, for example, the Maya people who first discovered tobacco regarded the anesthetic effect in tobacco as a kind of divinity, and the first European to smoke cigarettes, Rochelic Cartier de Hares, was even tried by the religious court for this reason, but the anesthetic effect of cigarettes is only a slight stimulus. The effect it gives people is a faint excitement. If you think that even this faint excitement should be rejected, then I dare say that you have taken the meaning of life too seriously.

People who like to drink or taste tea feel comfortable with a cup in hand. But drinking and drinking tea are only suitable for leisure, because holding a cup in hand is not suitable for many occasions, and it is not suitable to carry it around everywhere. Cigarettes are different. You feel something unusual when you hold this small thing with its fine thickness and suitable length in your hand. When you strike a match with a snap and exhale the first wisp of green smoke, you immediately experience an indescribable comfort. If you are idle, holding a cup in one hand (whether it is tea or wine) and a cigarette in the other, looking at the white clouds floating in the sky, then you only feel relaxed and happy, and only you can understand the momentary pleasure.

This is not an exaggeration, because although not every cigarette can bring about such a state, such a state does exist for those who know how to smoke. I am not against quitting smoking for economic or health reasons, but it is unnecessary to want to quit smoking because of puritanical ideas. In this era of difficult living, some light stimulation and excitement should be said to be a necessity of life, because what you get from it is not anesthesia, but clarity and invigoration.

However, the habit of smoking cigarettes, like everything that belongs to the category of habits, should not be indulged in excessively. I have seen many people who are addicted to smoking to the point of never letting go of the "roll" (rolled cigarette) all day long, causing them to cough and choke, harming their health, which seems not to understand the function of cigarettes. In my opinion, a limit of about ten cigarettes a day, and enjoying them at the time you feel most suitable, is the only way to truly enjoy the pleasure of smoking.

### Cat Catches Fish

— Mao Yi

Cats are cunning animals, and there are many stories about the methods they use to catch fish.

Someone saw a cat poking its head next to a small pond and thought it was drinking water, but upon closer inspection, they realized that their observation was wrong. It turned out that it was using its tongue as bait to lure the fish to the surface of the water. When the fish really were lured to the surface, it quickly opened its mouth wide and bit those foolish fish.

Cats can also reverse this method, putting their tails below the surface of the water, and when a fish swims up to see what the furry thing is, the cat swiftly turns around and uses its sharp claws to hook the fish alive, its "hand" speed making fishermen admire it.

However, the most agile cat's fishing technique was discovered next to a goldfish pond. In this case, it was two cats working together to complete their stealing. Because the goldfish were constantly disappearing, the fish owner became suspicious, so one night, he quietly hid by the pond and waited. Soon, the fish thieves came, but they were not people, but two cats. They approached the fish pond, lowered their heads, almost touching the surface of the water, their pupils dilated eyes shining in the moonlight. They waited motionless for a while, then, with a sudden pounce, a leaping goldfish was brought out. The only explanation for this is that the cats used their shining eyes to bewitch and lure the poor fish to the surface of the water, and then captured them.

Although the stealing of cats is annoying, the stealing behavior also shows a kind of cunning.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (38)

Qi Wan, feeling greatly humiliated by this song, went backstage and burst into tears, repeatedly saying she couldn't bear it, wouldn't sing anymore, and was willing to return the contracted fee. The garden owner repeatedly apologized and pleaded, but Qi Wan kept saying that she couldn't endure such humiliation and insisted on leaving. Later, her brother He Zhou repeatedly tried to persuade her, saying, "Tonight's incident was just a rowdy affair, and you can't entirely blame them. The flyers were printed that way. If you leave in anger and break the contract with the garden, that's fine, but causing such a spectacle in Jinan will make it difficult to face people back home, and Father wouldn't approve either! Now, the most important thing is to restore your reputation. I think very few people here understand real art; most are just here for the name. Their goal isn't the performance, but the novelty. Like last time, when Wu Hongfang performed spinning cotton here, it was packed every day. Wu Hongfang built his big house by spinning cotton, which shows the level of appreciation here. Now that we're at this crucial juncture, we can't afford to be petty; we need to be flexible and adapt. If you agree to perform spinning cotton, I'm sure we can sell out every show, not only restoring your reputation but also increasing our contracted fee. I'll explain it to Father later, and he'll surely understand. Success or failure depends on this one move; you need to be brave and do it, don't back down." After He Zhou's persuasion, Qi Wan thought it over and felt that this was the only way to go. She discussed it with the garden management and agreed to perform spinning cotton. On her first day on stage, Qi Wan added extra novelty, imitating her father's rough voice and singing a section of "Dingjun Mountain," which won the audience's applause. The next day, when she performed spinning cotton, even more spectators came eagerly, and the garden was packed. Adding stools and selling extra tickets, it became a sensation. For seven days, she performed spinning cotton every day, and it was always sold out. The locals seemed to have a never-ending fascination with this play. Seeing that her reputation had been restored and the contract was about to expire, Qi Wan wanted to stop while she was ahead, but the garden owner refused, repeatedly begging her to renew the contract, increase the fee, and extend it for another two weeks. Qi Wan, compelled by the crowd's enthusiasm, had no choice but to agree. Qi Wan was very clever. Seeing the audience's psychology, she always added a new gimmick to each performance of spinning cotton, making the locals want to see more. Everyone talked about spinning cotton, predicting what the new gimmick would be tonight, and the play became a craze. Qi Wan, having achieved both fame and fortune, was at the peak of her popularity when a urgent telegram arrived from Beijing: "Gu Hezhou of Beiyang Theater, father critically ill, return immediately, He Shan." He Zhou received the telegram at eleven o'clock at night. Qi Wan was still on stage performing spinning cotton and hadn't finished the show. Although He Zhou was anxious, he didn't dare to disturb her. He waited until she finished the show, took off her makeup, and returned to the hotel before showing her the telegram. Qi Wan, upon seeing the words "critically ill" in the telegram, burst into tears, saying, "Let's go back quickly, I won't sing anymore!" He Zhou said, "It's not that simple. You have a contractual relationship with the garden, and you can't leave. I'll go back first thing in the morning. If you need to come back, you can come back then." Qi Wan cried, "What if something unexpected happens? How can I face Father?" He Zhou said, "Even if you go back, it won't help. Besides, He Shan has always been timid and loves to exaggerate. Perhaps Father's condition isn't that serious. I'll go back and see first."

### Telegraph Q&A

(Question from Gu Qifeng of Weihaiwei Road) I plan to send a telegram to congratulate a friend in Beiping on their wedding. I heard that your bureau offers a social telegram service and can attach gift certificates. What is the procedure? (Answer) Social telegrams are used for congratulations and condolences. Special telegram paper is used, and there are special "idioms" for the sender to choose from. The text is divided into "self-composed" and "ready-made" types. Chinese is charged at 1,000 yuan per character, with a minimum of twenty characters; English is charged at 1,000 yuan per character, with a minimum of ten characters. If there is no "self-composed" text, you can choose any sentence from the ready-made sentences on the back of the newspaper as the text, regardless of length, and it will be calculated as eight characters. The recipient's name and address, and the sender's signature are calculated on a per-character basis. The word "social" should be written at the beginning of the telegram as a label, which is counted as one character. For the procedure to attach gift certificates, first obtain a "Gift Certificate Application Form" from this bureau, fill it out according to the instructions, and deliver it together with the gift money and handling fee (3,000 yuan). This bureau will issue a receipt as proof. The amount of the gift certificate is set from 10,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, divided into scarlet and plain colors, specified by the sender.
