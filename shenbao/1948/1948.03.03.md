### Northeast Petition Delegation Arrives in Nanjing, Stating That Increased Support and Currency Reform Are Most Urgent, Date for Audience with Chairman Jiang Awaits Scheduling

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 2nd] Wang Huayi, Zhang Baozi, Li Zhonghua, and Tian Yushi, representatives of the Northeast People's Petition Delegation, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd. Mo Dehui and others welcomed them at the station. Wang and others then went to the official residence of President Yu Youren to present the current situation in the Northeast, which lasted for more than two hours. They emerged at eleven o'clock and then visited Liu Zhe, a fellow Northeasterner living in Nanjing. At half-past twelve, they attended a luncheon hosted by Mo Dehui and Yu Bin, with Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin also in attendance. In the afternoon at three o'clock, Wang and others visited Minister Chen Lifu. Wang Huayi and Li Zhonghua also requested to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting to be held on the 3rd to report on the purpose of their petition and the various crises in the Northeast. The date for an audience with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has yet to be scheduled. Wang Huayi told reporters in the evening: "There are two most important issues currently facing the Northeast: one is the issue of increased support, and the other is the issue of currency reform." According to Wang, "We hope that the Central Government's support for the Northeast will come as soon as possible, the more the better. We must seize the time to be effective." Secondly, regarding the issue of Northeast circulating currency, Wang and others believe that Zhang Jia'ao cannot shirk his responsibility. He failed to rectify it in the past, and it is even more serious now. Currently, the amount of circulating currency issued each month reaches 180 billion, and the total amount has reached 5 trillion yuan. In the small number of areas that the National Army can control, there is such a huge amount of paper money. How can the people not suffer? Regarding the above two issues, Wang and others will go to the Executive Yuan on the 3rd to meet with President Zhang Qun, submit written opinions, and conduct thorough discussions with Chief Secretary Gan and others to find a proper solution. In particular, they hope to meet with Zhang Jia'ao within days to discuss good strategies. Regarding the food issue, Wang believes that it is extremely difficult to transport food before the Beining Railway is opened. However, Jinzhou can be used as a concentration point first, and then airlifted from Jinzhou. It is also learned that after Wang and others arrived in Nanjing, they reached a consensus with Zhang Zuoxiang and other Northeast officials, as well as Northeast residents in Nanjing such as Mo Dehui and Yu Bin, on ways to save the crisis in the Northeast.

The delegation also issued the following written statement: (Continued on the 2nd page, 3rd column)

### US Congress Invites MacArthur and Chennault to Provide Opinions on Aid to China, Telegraphs Chen to Return to Washington Within the Week

[Reuters Dispatch from Washington, 1st] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today invited General MacArthur and General Chennault to personally or in writing present their opinions on the aid to China bill to the committee. The House Foreign Affairs Committee asked General MacArthur to present his opinions on the proposal to aid China and other important areas in the Far East. The Foreign Affairs Committee also asked General MacArthur to specifically present his opinions on the following two points: (1) The importance of maintaining a free, independent, friendly China for world peace and the United States' position and interests in the Western Pacific; (2) What economic or other measures should be taken to accomplish this goal. The House Foreign Affairs Committee also asked Chennault to provide similar opinions and instructed him to return to the United States within a week or ten days, if possible.

[This City News] General Chennault received two urgent telegrams from the US Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee on the morning of the 2nd, urging him to return to the United States as soon as possible to report on the general situation in China and his opinions on the current situation to the Washington authorities. Chen has not yet made any statement. The telegram also stated that it hopes Chen will arrive in Washington within a week. The US believes that Chen has been in China for many years and has made great contributions during the war, so he has a clear observation of the current situation.

[Associated Press Dispatch from Washington, 1st] Well-informed sources say that if MacArthur agrees to the request of the House Foreign Relations Committee to submit his opinion on aid to China, it is expected that MacArthur will request effective US military assistance to the Chinese government. They said that MacArthur's invitation to the committee was prompted by those who advocated giving the Republic of China much more aid. MacArthur will support their demands for direct military assistance to the Chinese regime. Official reports stated that Commander MacArthur agrees to provide China with appropriate military assistance to suppress the Communist Party. MacArthur believes that the China problem is fundamentally a military problem and that economic means without military assistance to China are useless.

[Associated Press Vice President Fang En Telegram from Tokyo, 2nd] Generally speaking, MacArthur believes that the situation in China is quite serious. MacArthur informally stated in mid-December that, in terms of the interests of the United States, he felt that the China problem was mainly a military one. The United States should immediately provide the National Government with a large amount of military assistance to prevent the Northeast, North China, or Korea from falling into the Soviet orbit. Military experts in the United States in Tokyo have long felt that if the United States decides to provide China with a large amount of military assistance, it will not be a major problem to suppress the Chinese Communist army. They pointed out that the US military under MacArthur's command in the Western Pacific currently has sufficient ammunition, air force, and other supplies to equip at least fifteen divisions of the National Army.

### Bullitt Urges to Purchase Munitions for $100 million to Aid China

[This Newspaper News] New York 2nd Broadcast: Washington News, former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt, today attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee to testify, urging Congress to quickly take action on the China Aid Plan, advocating that in addition to the government's proposed $570 million in economic aid to China, $100 million be supplied to purchase munitions for the use of the Chinese government. Bullitt said: "The American taxpayers can pay a considerable amount of money to temporarily let the Japanese live and maintain a large number of troops in Japan to prevent the rise of communism, but this method cannot last long. China is the key to the Far East and must not be ignored. Since the summer of 1946, except for the small amount of munitions left in China by the US Navy and Marines, the Chinese army has not received a single bullet from the United States. After the efforts of　會,Half of the munitions are now on their way. On the other hand, since the Soviet Union occupied Manchuria, it has supplied the Chinese Communist Party with weapons seized from the Japanese and new munitions manufactured in Korea and Siberia from Japanese machinery transported from Manchuria. We refuse to give munitions to our friends, but the Soviet Union is arming our enemies on a large scale."

Foreign Committee Republican member Voris asked Bullitt whether he had evidence that the Soviet Union was arming the Chinese Communist Party? It is said that the CCP has nothing to do with Moscow. Bullitt replied that China's past history is the best evidence: "As early as 1934, when I was the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union issued booklets entitled "The Revolutionary Strategy of the Chinese Communist Party". Time is limited, and there is no room to list various facts". He引歸 　德迈 General said: "The Chinese government has kept its promise to us, and we have failed to keep our promise to China."

### Sun Ke Talks About Currency Reform, Which Will Inevitably Be Implemented Sooner or Later, and Has Not Heard of the Postponement of the National Assembly

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Taipei, 1st] Vice President Sun Ke held a press conference here on the 1st to answer reporters' questions. The main points are as follows:

Regarding the issue of foreign exchange required for industry, mining, and medicine in Taiwan Province, Sun said: "Taiwan Province does not require much foreign exchange. As long as there are about 100 million US dollars within one or two years, all kinds of industries in Taiwan can be restored. The initial supplement for the Taiwan-Hong Kong Power Company only requires a few million US dollars, and the railway only requires a few million. Of course, the current power and railway transportation capacity is still not enough, but if we want to expand further, even if we can't do it ourselves, we can borrow from the US Export-Import Bank. This is not an expenditure, and we can repay it within five to seven years. Taiwan also earns a lot of foreign exchange from the export of local products, and a portion can be used for Taiwan, which can help the industry in Taiwan." Regarding the date of the National Assembly and currency reform, he replied: "The order to convene the National Assembly has been issued, and so far, I have not heard of any postponement. Currency reform must be carried out sooner or later, but currency reform requires full preparation, and I have not heard when it will be implemented."

Explain the issue of National Assembly representatives giving way

Vice President made the following explanation on the issue of National Assembly representatives giving way: This problem occurred entirely because the nomination procedure was not well prepared. Originally, there were regulations in the election law: one is signed nomination, and the other is party nomination, but the scope between the two was not explained. Therefore, some Kuomintang members were nominated by signatures as candidates, and they often won the majority of votes and were elected. Now, asking them to give way to candidates nominated by friendly parties or the party's nomination, the elected candidates themselves say that the election is legal, and asking them to give way is somewhat unfair; however, in terms of party discipline, they should give way. Later, the central government set a compromise, that is, they must give way to friendly parties. This is to accommodate friendly parties, because they cannot be elected otherwise. As for candidates nominated by this party, whether or not to give way is up to them to choose.

### The List of National Assembly Representatives Will Be Announced Soon, It Is Reported That It Has Been Submitted to the National Government by the Election Headquarters, and the List of Kuomintang Members Who Should Give Way Has Also Been Decided

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 2nd] According to reliable sources: The list of National Assembly representatives has been submitted to　the Government by the Election Headquarters on the 2nd, and will be announced by the National Government.

According to a responsible person: the list of National Assembly representatives will be announced by the National Government soon, and the National Assembly will be convened as scheduled on March 29.

[This Newspaper News] The Central Nomination Elected Candidates Union of the National Assembly Representatives held an emergency meeting in Nanjing on February 29 and resolved many important cases, hoping that members of the association would report to Nanjing before March 19 to collectively attend the National Assembly.

Editorial

### The Rise of New Aggression

It has been two months since the U.S. Congress reconvened on January 7 to discuss foreign aid issues. We have only heard senators and representatives debating endlessly without ever touching the actual core of the problem. However, during these two months, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, and the division of the world into two camps has become increasingly blatant, making it impossible for American legislators to continue to debate without reaching a decision. Therefore, Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, loudly appealed in the meeting, demanding that the Senate quickly pass the European Recovery Program and advocating that the nation's strength be concentrated to prevent the outbreak of a third world war. He stated: "Soviet obstruction is sufficient to create obstacles to the future of the aid to Europe plan, but the United States must do everything possible to save the world from danger." Mr. Vandenberg's remarks not only fully demonstrate the seriousness of the current world situation, but also illustrate the urgency of American aid. It is truly worthy of our attention. In particular, his warning to the world that a new aggressive force is rising, although not explicitly naming the Soviet Union, the so-called new aggressive force is self-evident.

A few days ago, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee also issued a report, requesting the United States to lead all countries in defending the "non-communist world," otherwise the United States would face a "violent revolution" worldwide. It also put forward ten conclusions: (1) The Communist Party has one goal, which is "world revolution"; (2) The Communist Party believes that revolution must come from violence; (3) The Communist Party has no concept of maintaining peace and expects a third world war to break out soon; (4) The Communist Party believes that the Soviet Union is the main force of the revolution; (5) The Communist Party is most afraid of the union between countries that are against the Soviet Union; (6) The Communist Party is also afraid of the revival or union of the non-communist world; (7) The Communist Party adopts a cold war approach to enhance its own strength and weaken the strength of all other countries; (8) Communist parties other than the Soviet Union are backward partners or auxiliary members; (9) The Communist Party's strategy is based on a definite theory, and its central proposition remains unchanged; (10) The division of Europe and Asia by the victorious countries of World War II will be resolved by power politics rather than negotiation.

Regardless of whether these ten views on communist theory and strategy are accurate, the fact that the Communist Party attempts to launch a violent revolution and that the Soviet Union is currently leading all countries in implementing a world revolution is undeniably true. American political and cultural figures have a deep understanding of the danger of the communist movement. Logically, communism is a doctrinal belief that does not disrupt the order of society, but it has now become a threat to world peace. I remember that thirty years ago, at the beginning of the success of the Soviet social revolution, although it also shouted out the slogan of leading the weak and small nations of the world to carry out world revolution, this policy was soon abandoned by the Soviet Union, and a peaceful diplomatic policy was adopted. The communist threat to world peace began to ease. However, thirty years later, the communist forces have made a comeback. Although the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy is still based on "peace" and "security," it has changed its pre-war style. Not only has it erected an "iron curtain" in Eastern Europe and the Far East, but it also wants to go a step further and turn the neighbors surrounding the Soviet Union into its vassal states. The implementation of this aggressive policy has gone from "subtle" to "obvious."

We certainly do not want to place the responsibility for the division of the world entirely on the Soviet Union, but the creation of the division of the world cannot but be said to be due to the Soviet Union's leadership of the Eastern European countries in organizing the new Communist International and proclaiming that it would withdraw from the United Nations organization if necessary, which led to this. Since September of last year, the division of the world has become increasingly clear, and the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly fierce. On the American side, they want to help European countries revive their economies in order to maintain the freedom and independence of their people; on the Soviet side, they are doing everything possible to prevent the implementation of the American aid to Europe plan. Because the United States is a democratic country, all political facilities and diplomatic actions must be approved by Congress before they can be implemented. Therefore, although President Truman or Secretary of State Marshall loudly shouted the slogan of aiding Europe until their lips were parched and their tongues were dry, the aid to Europe plan is still in the discussion stage. It can be said that "the flute sounds loud, but the rain is light." This is the traditional style of democratic countries. However, on the other hand, the Soviet Union is a centralized country that does what it says and can act quickly without being subject to any restrictions. To oppose the realization of the American aid to Europe plan, not only did it organize the new Communist International and order the Eastern European countries to reject American aid in a commanding manner, but it also exerted pressure on countries that needed and welcomed American aid, preventing them from participating in the European Economic Recovery Conference. Czechoslovakia is a good example. Because Czechoslovakia needed funds from Western countries, it was originally one of the countries that supported the Marshall Plan, but after Soviet intervention, it also announced its withdrawal.

The Soviet Union's diplomatic war against the United States does not stop there, and it will further take the offensive. On February 5, the Soviet-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed, followed by the Soviet-Hungarian Mutual Assistance Treaty on the 18th. After this coup in Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Communist Party seized power and completely fell into the arms of the Soviet Union. Recently, the Soviet Union forced Finland to sign a mutual assistance treaty. Although Finland is an emerging democratic country, and its people love freedom and independence, it is feared that it will not be able to escape the palm of the Soviet Union due to the general trend. This series of facts is really enough to stimulate the nerves of the world, especially in the eyes of Americans, it is like a thorn in the back, and they will naturally feel deeply threatened. Some observers say that the Soviet Union's outward development has reached a saturation point and will "stop at the right time," but in the eyes of another group of people, if Western countries still adopt a "policy of appeasement" towards the expansion of Soviet power, then the Soviet Union will inevitably take an inch and continue to expand outward. According to a United Press reporter's report, the Soviet Union may take the following three steps in the future: (1) Make the neutral small countries of Northern Europe, namely Norway and Sweden, also become vassals of the Soviet Union; (2) Break through the defense lines of Iran, Turkey, and Greece in order to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean; (3) Attack the positions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Germany and Austria from the side, so that France and Italy will also be ruled by the Communist Party. Although this is the prediction of a United Press reporter, its possibility is very high and worthy of our attention.

The Soviet Union in Europe has of course been acting freely there, and it will also let go and do it in Asia. We dare say that the Soviet Union has been taking the lead in the diplomatic war against the United States, while the United States has been failing. If the current policy of the United States is not changed in time, then the prospects for peace in Europe and Asia and even the entire world are very bleak. Vandenberg's urgent appeal should be given extra attention by the American government and people, especially the senators and representatives of the two houses, who should no longer debate endlessly and be unable to reach a consensus on the aid to Europe plan, but should make a decisive and wise decision in a timely manner.

### Dr. Washburn Reports to Reporters That the Plan to Explore Mount Amnye Machin Has Been Agreed Upon with Our Academia Sinica

[Our Dispatch] Dr. Washburn, head of the scientific group of the Sino-American Amnye Machin Expedition, came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to discuss the distribution of oil and other technical issues during the expedition with Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and China National Aviation Corporation. Mr. Washburn was originally the director of the Boston Museum of Science. He came to China specifically for the exploration of Mount Amnye Machin. He has been in Nanjing for five weeks and has agreed with our government and Academia Sinica on relevant exploration matters. He expressed his appreciation for the spirit of cooperation between China and the United States.

At 3:00 PM yesterday, Dr. Washburn met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the Broadway Mansions to report on the technical issues of the exploration of Mount Amnye Machin. After a brief introduction by Wei Jingmeng, director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, he began his report, which stated:

Sino-American Cooperation

Since arriving in China six weeks ago, I have learned more than when I first arrived due to the assistance of Academia Sinica and the Geological Survey. This exploration is a Sino-American cooperation. The American side only provides equipment and personnel that China cannot have immediately. For example, radar is the most important and reliable equipment for measuring altitude. The American side has expert McKay participating. The American side has expert Gussow participating in the geography and glacier departments. Chinese experts, due to environmental reasons, cannot have frequent contact with glacier exploration in the Alaskan region like American experts. Therefore, this type of personnel is also the responsibility of the United States. For anything that China can provide, the American side will not repeat it. In the past two months, a committee has been formed jointly with the Central Research Institute, with a total of 18 members, including Chinese scientists and military representatives, and chaired by Dr. Saponte Tung, to decide that when the expedition team sets out in the future, China will have three or four scientists and officers participating.

Measurement Method

The initial purpose of this trip was to measure the height of Mount Amnye Machin, but now it has been decided to expand to glaciers and terrain. In the past, geographers only knew how to measure from the land. This time, it is planned to measure from the air. Gussow has a wealth of experience in aerial surveying. The measurement method can be briefly described as follows: An aircraft in the expedition team is equipped with six altimeters to allow the aircraft to fly at a certain altitude (this trip is about 30,000 feet). There is a temple 80 miles near Mount Amnye Machin, whose altitude has already been accurately measured by Chinese scientists. The aircraft uses radar waves to measure its altitude above this target, and then maintains the same altitude to fly over the main peak of Mount Amnye Machin, and then uses radio waves to detect it. The difference in height between the two is the height of the main peak of Mount Amnye Machin. The error rate of radar measurement is only 1% to 1.5%. Based on this calculation, the possible measurement difference in the future will also be only three to four hundred feet. As for the climate, it has no impact on the measurement work. Because there is no radio station nearby, the precise longitude and latitude of the main peak cannot be calculated. The rough estimate is calculated by using the direction, speed, and time of flight, and the difference from the correct position should not exceed ten miles. What our team is currently focusing on is aerial surveying. As for the precise ground survey, it requires years of hard work, which remains to be carried out by Chinese scientists.

Denial of Uranium Exploration

At this point, reporters asked whether it was true that the expedition team had a mission to explore uranium mines. Washburn laughed and said: Whether in China or the United States, almost someone asks this question every week. I remember that the first person to ask this question was a reporter from Chicago. At that time, geologist Gussow replied: If an aircraft is equipped with special electromagnetic computing equipment, it can detect whether there are metal ores on the ground, but it cannot determine what kind of metal it is. This type of instrument is too bulky. Once installed on the aircraft, the team will not be able to fit in. Therefore, it was decided not to install it in this exploration aircraft.

Wind and Science Relations

Some reporters also asked why they chose to travel at this time. Washburn replied: The first reason is that Renault and Washburn currently have five months of free time. After this, they will not have time. The second is that March and April to September are ideal periods for exploring Mount Amnye Machin, so it was decided to travel at this time. Some asked whether the snow covering the peaks would hinder the exploration. He replied: No, the wind is very important. If the wind blows from the northwest, it will blow away the snow on the top of the mountain, and we will be able to freely explore and photograph from the northwest, which will facilitate a lot. Washburn also pointed out that the reason why no one has explored Mount Amnye Machin in person in the past is entirely due to the inconvenience of the terrain and transportation.

Rebuttal of Invasion Theory

Regarding the communist officials' claim that the Renault expedition team is an American military invasion of the West, Washburn dismissed it as absurd and said: This trip is entirely scientific in nature. In fact, each flight will be attended by a Chinese military officer to avoid approaching or photographing military targets during the flight. I really can't imagine that our findings and photos have any military value to either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese government and scientists.

Departure Time

Also, Renault himself has already flown to China from Oakland, California, in a giant C87 aircraft yesterday. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this week. The driver is Odom, who broke the round-the-world flight record by driving an atomic plane. One week after Renault's plane arrives in Shanghai, it will fly to Nanjing and then to Lanzhou to prepare for departure. At that time, if the weather is good, it can depart in two weeks, otherwise it may be extended to one month. The list of Chinese personnel has now been decided to be four people, and the remaining four are still to be discussed. Also, this aerial exploration is unprecedented, and many Chinese and foreign journalists have requested to accompany it. Everything remains to be decided after Renault and Saponte Tung discuss it. According to Dr. Washburn yesterday: The number of people will be limited, the only reason being that the oxygen supply is not easy. This oxygen must be airlifted from the United States to Tokyo, then to Shanghai, and then to remote Lanzhou.

### Renault Exploration Plane Rescheduled to Fly to China Today

[United Press, Oakland, California, Dispatch of the 2nd] Round-the-world flyer Odom decided on the 3rd to take off on the morning of the 3rd, carrying a scientific expedition team to China. The departure date has been postponed twice due to mechanical problems. Odom said: The aircraft is a modified Liberator bomber, carrying a total of 30 tons of scientific equipment. The aircraft may be hit by strong tailwinds between California and Honolulu on the 3rd. "We may reschedule the departure date again due to the weather." Among the sixteen passengers, there are Gu Weijun's son and Mrs. Gu, the chief secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, both of whom are going to Shanghai.

### Amnye Machin Photography Exhibition to Be Held in Shanghai Starting on the 6th

[This City Dispatch] Zhuang Xueben, an advisor to the Xikang Provincial Government, went to the Mount Amnye Machin area in southern Qinghai in 1934 and engaged in investigation work for several months. He took many photos of Mount Amnye Machin and the sources of the Yellow River and Yangtze River. This time, American Renault is coming to China and will explore the mountain from the air. He has formed a Sino-American Amnye Machin exploration team jointly with our Academia Sinica, which is about to start work. In order to introduce the actual situation on the ground in the area, Mr. Zhuang has released his old works from more than ten years ago to hold an Amnye Machin area photography exhibition. It was exhibited for three days at the Nanjing Frontier Culture and Education Museum on February 20, 21, and 22. Mr. Zhuang has returned to Shanghai last week and is scheduled to hold a public exhibition at the French Literature Association at the entrance of Fuxing Park on the 6th and 7th of this month.

### Chairman Summons Zheng Lie and Zhao Chen

Inquired About the Trial of Traitor Cases

[Our Nanking dispatch of the 2nd] Chairman Chiang summoned Zheng Lie, Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court, and Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, at around 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd to inquire about the recent work of the two courts and the trial of traitor cases.

### Northeast People's Petition Delegation's Written Statement in Nanking

[Continued from page 1] "The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast has almost aroused the concern of the whole country. Chairman Chiang's expression of firm adherence to the Northeast further represents the common will of the military and civilians of the whole country. Our delegation was entrusted by the entire people of the Northeast to come to Nanjing to petition. Upon hearing this, we are deeply encouraged." However, the deteriorating situation in the Northeast is an undeniable fact. What the people of the Northeast demand from the government today is to quickly reinforce the army and reverse the situation. The fate of survival is imminent. The government must properly plan solutions to how to supply food and improve the economy. At this time when the country is suffering, the people of the Northeast deeply know the government's difficult situation. We do not need to pursue the responsibility for the gains and losses in the reception process in the past two years. However, from the painful lessons of the past, we must learn from the past and be careful in the future, and find a way to save the situation. It is necessary to implement the government's determination to firmly defend the Northeast with resolute and wise policies. Therefore, in military affairs, we should immediately deploy elite troops to the Northeast, at least to ensure the supply lines of Shenyang and Yingkou, and the strongholds of Jilin and Changchun, so as to actively carry out the reception of the Northeast. Economically, we should immediately rectify the financial situation in the Northeast and make reasonable adjustments in order to smoothly supply the military and civilian needs. If this cannot be effectively and quickly implemented, then the Northeast will encounter a fate more serious than the September 18th Incident, and this delegation dares to assert that it is not far away, and its impact on our entire country and nation is even greater than imagined. Based on this, our delegation plans to pay a visit to the Chairman and government authorities to petition for assistance, and especially wishes to urge the people of the country to work together to save the Northeast, which is also to save ourselves and save the country. We hope that this trip will have results to comfort the people of the Northeast."

Amidst severe credit tightening, inflationary pressures have eased slightly.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 2nd] Commodity prices here have recently soared, leading to increasingly tight credit conditions. Additionally, authorities will strictly investigate hoarding and stabilize prices. At the same time, due to high prices in this city, goods from other areas are being shipped in to take advantage of the higher prices. As a result, starting from the 2nd, prices for various commodities in this city have weakened across the board. The price for top-grade flour from mills has fallen from 1.58 million per bag to 1.5 million, and 20-count "Spider" yarn has fallen from 80 million per piece to 76.3 million. The black market price of gold has also fallen from 22 million to 21 million per tael.

### Full Text of Minister of Defense Bai's Report on Recent Bandit Suppression Military Affairs

(Continued from yesterday's first page) We know that the communist bandits have theory, organization, twenty years of fighting experience, and even international background, cannot be compared to ordinary bandits, or individual forces in the war of resistance against past warlords. Because in the areas where the communist bandits are now running rampant, the people are coerced by them and completely banditized. Therefore, the current bandit suppression is not only a military and political struggle, but also an ideological struggle. We must use the Three Principles of the People to combat communism, and use the power of organization to combat the organization of the communist bandits. More specifically, we must use military power to cover up politics, and use political power to [blank] the entire foundation, to cooperate with the military. We must unite the power of the party, government, and military into a strong [blank] combat body, and actively organize and train the people, enhance the people's self-defense capabilities, cooperate with the army, develop comprehensive tactics, and strive for [blank]. Bandit suppression should focus on three parts military and seven parts political, with the primary focus of politics being to win people's hearts and unleash people's power to adapt to bandit suppression military affairs and stabilize the local area. In terms of economy, we must stabilize people's livelihoods in order to eliminate the root of unrest. Since the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Manchu Qing autocracy, it was to realize the Principle of Democracy. The defeat of the warlords during the Northern Expedition was also to realize the Principle of Democracy. The eight-year war of resistance against Japan was to realize the Principle of Nationalism. The current bandit suppression is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, in addition to using political and military power to suppress bandits, we must also suppress bandits economically. Economically, we must thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, equalize land ownership, and restrict capital. I remember that in 1924, the first National Congress of our party had a resolution to reduce rent by 25%, but it was not implemented immediately. The communist bandits, however, implemented their "land reform" in their occupied areas, exaggeratedly promoting it internationally, and even used brutal methods of liquidation and struggle to forcibly distribute land. Their distribution method is to allocate land equally according to the number of farmers and the total area of land in a certain area, regardless of the interests of a few landlords and capitalists, sacrificing the minority to win over the majority of farmers. Regarding the land illegally distributed by the communist bandits in the pacified areas, the central government had previously promulgated the "Measures for the Handling of Land in the Pacified Areas," the main principle of which is to vigorously implement the 25% rent reduction, strictly prohibit landlords from evicting tenants, and recover old debts. Land that has been illegally distributed by the communist bandits, and whose landlords are missing, will be confiscated by the county government. Eighty percent of the country's population is farmers, and our economic foundation should not be based on cities, but on the vast countryside. Therefore, we must thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and the land policy to achieve the ideal of "land to the tiller," so that the majority of farmers are not threatened or lured by bandits. The entire problem of people's livelihood must be solved before we are oppressed by livelihood, incited by bandits, and take risks. At the same time, it is enough to promote self-defense, cultivate their self-defense capabilities, protect their homeland, and stabilize society, which is also the fundamental way to eliminate the communist bandits. We know that the development of international communism came after the First World War. The opposition between labor and capital and the disparity between the rich and the poor led to class struggle. After this war, in Europe, such as Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and other countries, they also became vassals of the Third International. Therefore, from the perspective of the international situation today, if we still use capitalism to implement anti-communism, the working masses of all countries will still inevitably have class consciousness more important than national consciousness, class concepts more important than national concepts, and class interests more important than national interests, creating opportunities for communists to incite class struggle, and failing to eliminate labor-capital disputes and opposition. After this war, in order to overcome economic difficulties, Britain vigorously implemented frugality. From the King of England to the general public, they all absolutely followed the national policy with a spirit of law-abiding. At the same time, what is more active is to nationalize large-scale mines, industries, railways, and banks, and use political power to implement social policies, making a more active anti-communism [blank]. Therefore, from the perspective of the international situation, we want to implement economic suppression of communism, stabilize people's livelihoods [blank], and seek the early realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, while strengthening the people's self-defense capabilities and cooperating with military suppression, which is the fundamental strategy to curb the development of communist bandits and weaken the bandit scourge. The above is what Chongxi felt and contributed a little meaning, please give me your advice. (End)

### The Five-Nation Alliance of Britain, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg May Be Realized in Mid-Month: Political, Military and Economic Ties Are Tightened, Premiers of Five Nations Will Meet in Brussels to Draft Treaty Details

[United Press, London, 2nd] Diplomatic circles expect that within two weeks, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and other countries will be able to form a military and economic alliance agreement. Western Europe is strengthening its fortress to prevent the continued intrusion of communism. It is said that Belgium and the Netherlands are adopting measures to control communist activities. The powerful Labor Party in the Netherlands has identified the Communist Party as the fifth column and refused to continue cooperation with it. The Belgian Labor Federation [blank] and other agencies have also purged all communist elements.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The French government has notified the Belgian government, expressing its support for starting negotiations with Britain and the Benelux countries as soon as possible to conclude a five-power alliance treaty. The Belgian government will decide on the date and location of these negotiations. According to unofficial reports from Belgium, the five-power conference to discuss the establishment of a Western European alliance will be held in Belgium on Friday. A preparatory meeting of the three Benelux countries is scheduled to be held on Wednesday. At the five-power conference on Friday, the representatives will draft the general principles of the treaty, which will be approved by the leaders of the five countries at the next meeting. This convention will focus on the economy, but will also include political, military and cultural elements. Some people even expect this convention to be signed before March 15. After signing, an expert committee will be set up to supervise the implementation of the articles. The statement that the five-power meeting will be held in Brussels on Friday and the preparatory meeting convened by the Benelux countries on the 30th has not yet been officially confirmed.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the five-power talks are scheduled to be held in Brussels this Thursday to discuss the implementation plan for the Western countries alliance proposed by Foreign Secretary Bevin. At that time, the British and French governments will appoint ambassadors to Belgium to participate. It is generally believed that the Belgian government is willing to hold the trial in Brussels on Friday. In addition to its ambassador, the United Kingdom and France will continue to send representatives to attend. Bevin announced in the House of Commons on January 22 that the Western European alliance would be formed to deal with the Soviet Union's control of Europe, and the United States expressed its approval the next day.

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 1st] Experts from the three Benelux countries will make final revisions to the three countries' proposals in Belgium on Wednesday. The outline of the proposal has been formulated yesterday.

### French Communist Party Establishes Action Committee, Ministry of Interior Confirms Conspiracy to Launch a Similar Event to the Czech Coup

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] "Paris Evening News" claims that the Belgrade Communist Information Bureau announced that a Communist Defense Committee similar to the Czech Communist Party Action Committee has been established in France. The Bureau's communique stated that the activities of the Communist Party in France include the establishment of defense federations and defense committees in all branches of the national economy and among all levels of people, including workers, farmers, and merchants. The purpose of these organizations is to defend the economic and political independence of France in the context of the gradual expansion of the forces of Anglo-American imperialism. Communist Defense Committees have been set up in 70 French aircraft factories, and Defense Committees are also being organized in the automobile manufacturing and power industries.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] A spokesman for the French Ministry of the Interior recently confirmed the above news reported in "Paris Evening News." The spokesperson said that we have previously learned about the establishment of Defense Committees by the French Communist Party throughout the country. These committees are very similar to the Czech Action Committee, which is the institution that helped the Czech Communist Party gain control. The French police and security forces have sufficient intelligence on the activities of these Defense Committees in France. The spokesperson also said that we know when the French Communist Party will launch its plan, and the government is fully prepared for it, but we do not believe that the Communist Party's plan has been solemnly launched.

### Molotov Claims There Will Be No War in Five Years

[United Press, London, 1st] Labor MP Captain Braben said in the House of Commons on the 1st that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had told those attending his banquet in London less than three months ago that there would be no new war for at least five years. Mr. Bo said that a friend of his had attended the last banquet held by Molotov and his deputy Vyshinsky "in London" at the end of the last meeting of foreign ministers. Mr. Bo said: "Molotov predicted everything one by one, and then they happened one by one." Mr. Bo reported this on the first day of the debate on the government's defense policy.

### London Conference Discusses Merger of Three Occupation Zones

[Reuters, London, 1st] Reliable sources say that the London conference on the German issue had the most successful meeting today. A related person said that the result of today's meeting can be regarded as definitely useful. Today's meeting was still a secret meeting, and there was no press release afterwards, but it is understood that the issue of merging the three occupation zones of West Germany was the main topic of discussion. In addition, the conference has established an expert committee to study the international control regime in the Ruhr area, which was discussed at the plenary meeting last week.

### Soviet Union Accuses Britain and the United States of Obstructing Universal Disarmament

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] Soviet representative Gromyko spoke for an hour at a closed-door meeting of the United Nations Universal Disarmament Committee today, accusing Britain and the United States of obstructing universal disarmament and completely opposing Britain's proposal to restore international trust and plant the seeds. Mr. Ge said that Britain obviously has no intention of disarming, and representatives of the committee are wasting the United Nations' paper and membership fees. Mr. Ge also pointed out that Britain and the United States are obstructing the international control of atomic energy and the establishment of the United Nations guard army, saying that if the representatives take an attitude that violates the United Nations Charter one day, the International Army will not be established one day.

### British House of Commons Passes Defense White Paper

Conservative Amendment Rejected

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British government's proposed defense policy for the United Kingdom was passed by the House of Commons today with a vote of 243 to 121. The Conservative amendment was rejected. At the end of the debate, Prime Minister Attlee, amid cheers, declared that the government's policy aims to prevent Germany from aggression again. It will cooperate with other allies and friendly nations, so that it can participate in the unity of Europe on an equal footing. The UK and its dominions have achieved close cooperation on defense issues, unprecedented before. However, we are still insufficient and willing to seek change. He then discussed the general anxiety felt by Europeans, stating that it was due to the extreme expansion of the dictatorial system. Finally, Attlee said he was unwilling for Britain to unilaterally disclose military information first and hoped that countries behind the iron curtain could publish this information. At the beginning of the debate, Defense Minister Alexander spoke, emphasizing that Britain must express its determination to maintain its strength. If we cannot accept this simple and basic truth, it will be detrimental to ourselves and all of humanity.

### Three Japanese Ruling Parties Reach Agreement

Obstacles to Cabinet Formation Removed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] After the three Japanese ruling parties reached an agreement on government policy this afternoon, the biggest obstacle encountered by Ashida in his cabinet formation process has been removed.

### Strack Suggests to U.S. Army Department to Retain Japanese Industrial Equipment; Most of the Listed Compensation Items are Retained

[United Press, Washington, 1st] America's major industrial engineering and consulting firm has advised the Army Department not to remove Japanese production equipment from Japan. The Overseas Consultants, Inc., which conducted a study on Japan's industrial potential and the conditions required for Japan's economic recovery and stability, released its 175-page report today, advising the Army Department that removing all Japanese production equipment except for basic war industry equipment would hinder global production and reduce Japan's possibility of achieving self-sufficiency. In any case, this would increase the time required to complete this goal. This would be a waste of American taxpayers' money and not the most advantageous thing to do when facing countries demanding compensation.

Overseas Consultants, Inc. is headed by Mr. Strack, Chairman of McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. The group began studying Japanese issues in Tokyo last July and completed its on-site investigation in December. The Strack Committee issued a list of factories and industrial conveniences that Japan should retain and those that could be used for compensation, so that Japan could retain certain industrial capacities deemed necessary for Japan's self-sufficient economy, which have been tentatively determined by the US State, Army, and Navy Coordinating Committee. This list includes: (1) Pig iron: Japan retains 2 million metric tons, with 1.6 million tons for compensation. (2) Steel plates: Japan retains 3.5 million metric tons, with 2.9 million tons for compensation. (3) Steel bars: Japan retains 2.65 million metric tons, with 1.55 million tons for compensation. (4) Sulfuric acid: Japan retains 3.51675 million metric tons, with 1.140575 million tons for compensation. (5) Caustic soda: Japan retains 4.193 million tons, with none for compensation. (6) Synthetic rubber: Japan retains none, with 900 tons for compensation. (7) Bearing manufacturing industry: Japan retains a value of 59.318 billion yen. The report suggests that Japan should retain virtually all hydroelectric power and 1.2405 million gross tons of shipping, of which only 59,500 tons are for compensation. The committee stated that US Army and Navy officials will require the retention of Japan's entire oil refining industry, which produces 9.80775 million barrels of oil annually, and its storage capacity of 7.293 million barrels.

### Hull's Memoirs (38)

— North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright, Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department

Last Task Before Health Collapse

Secretary Morgenthau returned to Washington from Quebec, while the President went to Hyde Park first, where Prime Minister Churchill visited him. Morgenthau was extremely excited about the work he had completed, and he rushed to find Secretary of War Stimson and me, along with others, with his latest copy of the plan (referring to the plan to turn Germany into a primarily agricultural country - Editor's News Service).

On September 20, 1944, I convened a cabinet subcommittee meeting in my office, attended by Morgenthau, Stimson, White from the Treasury Department, McCloy, Under Secretary of War, and Matthews from the State Department, to review these developments. I did not hide my shock at what the President and Mr. Churchill had agreed upon at Quebec at Morgenthau's insistence. I thought it was a tragedy in every respect. I emphasized that I did not consider this a done deal.

Morgenthau said that the President's invitation for him to go to Quebec was completely unexpected, and he didn't want people to think he had orchestrated it. Then, he gave a lengthy explanation of the Quebec Conference. He said that Mr. Churchill initially strongly opposed Morgenthau's proposed policy toward Germany. The Prime Minister bluntly asked if he had been invited to Quebec to discuss a plan to "feed Britain on the corpse (of Germany)."

Morgenthau turned to Stimson and said, "Harley, he was even more upset than you." Stimson and I were equally annoyed by Morgenthau's high-handed approach to the Quebec negotiations. Because this was primarily a matter for the State Department and the War Department, he did not consult us beforehand, and he made no secret of this.

Morgenthau said that he later discussed the matter with Sir Cherwell, the Prime Minister's personal assistant, and apparently persuaded him. Cherwell discussed it with Churchill and won his agreement. This suggestion apparently moved the Prime Minister on the grounds that Britain could from then on obtain many of Germany's former steel markets, eliminating a dangerous competitor. Morgenthau said they tried many times to put this understanding into writing, but the Prime Minister was never satisfied. So he called in his own secretary and dictated his understanding of the agreement. This is the document that the President and the Prime Minister signed and sent to me on September 15. Morgenthau said that it was all drafted by Mr. Churchill.

Stimson frankly asked Morgenthau if there was any connection between Churchill's acceptance of this policy and his eagerness to obtain the loan that Morgenthau had promised him. Morgenthau denied it, but he said that the loan was obviously the Prime Minister's main goal in Quebec besides military matters.

Morgenthau said that the next day, Foreign Secretary Eden came to Quebec and was very surprised at the President and Prime Minister's agreement on Germany. Eden and Mr. Churchill had a heated discussion, and Prime Minister Churchill told Eden not to raise it in the War Cabinet until he himself returned to England, because he intended to work hard to get it passed.

Morgenthau said that Eden's opposition came as a surprise to him, because he had gotten the opposite impression when he discussed it with Eden in London not long ago. This statement told us that even before Quebec, the Secretary of Treasury had discussed this matter, which was primarily under the purview of the State Department and the War Department, with British officials.

Regarding the loan, Morgenthau said that he knew the President was prepared to fully accept the Prime Minister's opinion. But he, Morgenthau, insisted on establishing a committee to draft the plan. He didn't seem to think that this committee could obtain British cooperation to implement a free economic policy, but he felt that this would at least give the United States a foothold. He said that the President did not raise any questions about what economic policies Britain should adopt in return for our assistance. I said without hesitation that I was extremely surprised that such an important issue was decided without prior consultation with the appropriate experts in our government and without regard to the policies we had promoted in the past. Shortly after the President returned to Washington, I went to see him at the White House. I brought with me the memorandum he gave me on September 15 and Morgenthau's plan. (The September 15 memorandum stated that the President and Mr. Churchill had reached an agreement on the contents of the Morgenthau Plan - Editor's News Service.)

I frankly told the President that Morgenthau's plan made no sense and that no experts, no relevant officials in our government, nor the President, nor other governments had participated in preparing this plan. I also said that Morgenthau's plan would eliminate everything in Germany except the land. The Germans would have to live off the land. This meant that only 60% of the Germans could survive off the land, and the remaining 40% would die.

I said that I would keep two points in mind when dealing with the post-war German issue. First, Germany must be under military occupation for 25 or 50 years, depending on the need, until they have completely eliminated all Nazi theories and ideas, as well as the absurd notion that Germany is a superior nation with the right to rule other nations. Second, the living standards of the German people should be below the average living standards of the people of the countries they had invaded, but should gradually increase to the extent that they change from Nazism, a sense of national superiority, to human rights, individual freedom, and peaceful thought.

I finally said that I was shocked to discover that the British had also agreed to this extreme starvation policy in Quebec, simply in order to obtain Morgenthau's assistance and the $6.5 billion loan recommended by the Treasury Department. I specifically criticized this loan.

The first reason, I said, was that negotiations with Britain should be primarily conducted by the State Department, because it is the agency used by the government to conduct negotiations with foreign governments. Second, because Morgenthau's plan was not attached with conditions. There are many issues outstanding between us and Britain, and we should seek to resolve or act on them, and the loan can be used as part of our bargaining power against the British. Morgenthau set aside or ignored these issues and promised a $6.5 billion loan without conditions, without prior consultation with the State Department or relevant government officials in Congress.

I finally said that, aside from other major reasons for opposing this plan, if Morgenthau's plan were to leak out and the President were to endorse the plan, it would be a great damage to his political position when he was conducting the 1944 presidential election.

During this conversation, the President said very little, except to point out that he actually had not completely believed in Morgenthau's plan, in fact, he had not realized that the September 15 memorandum he had signed, "O.K. F.D.R.", was of such great adverse nature.

At this time, I asked my State Department colleagues to help me prepare another memorandum for the President. This memorandum was dated September 29, and I personally handed it to the President on October 1 and discussed its main points with him.

The next day, I received the President's memorandum to me, written on September 29. This was written before my conversation with him on October 1. This memorandum fully showed that he had not realized the extent to which he was implicated in Quebec under Morgenthau's instigation.

He wrote: "The main crux of the situation is to prevent Britain from going completely bankrupt at the end of the war." He put special emphasis on the last sentence, underlining it twice in ink.

In the past week, several articles in the newspapers have pointed out the severe nature of the post-war German treatment discussed in Quebec. This became a powerful weapon for the Nazi propaganda machine, motivating the Germans to fight to the end.

The President said in his memorandum, "Someone not only told the press too early, but said (as is) that it was fundamentally untrue."

"There is no need to make Germany a completely superior country again, but someone told the press, and I hope we can find this person and punish him."

(Secretary Stimson later told me that the President believed that the news was leaked by the State Department. Stimson said that the first syndicated columnist to discuss this matter wrote an article and that this writer had close ties with some officials in the Treasury Department, which made the President believe that the news was not leaked by the State Department or the War Department).

The President continued, "You know that pre-war Germany not only established a war industry, but also established sufficient foreign trade, enabling it to have sufficient financial resources to rearm, while still maintaining international credit, and not going bankrupt in the international economy."

"I cannot agree with the idea of watching the British Empire collapse financially while allowing Germany to form a potential rearmament industry, making it possible to launch another war in twenty years. Merely inspecting factories will not prevent this."

"But no one wants to "completely eliminate German industrial production capacity in the Ruhr and Saar regions."

"But we may implement comprehensive control in those two special areas. At the same time, it should also be remembered that besides the Ruhr and the Saar, Germany has many other (he underlined "other") areas and equipment capable of producing large quantities of export goods."

Speaking of the Soviet Union, regarding my insistence that any plan regarding Germany must be discussed with the Soviet government, he said:

"Regarding the Soviet government, we still don't know what ideas they have in mind, but we should remember that within their occupation zone, they will always do what they want, and we will only be able to protest from time to time, unless some protests are heeded." "I am not trying to stop or delay negotiations with the Soviet government on the Lend-Lease Act on the basis of full supervision or on the basis of the proposed Fourth Draft, but this is not directly related to the future of German industry."

My conversation with the President on October 1 made it unnecessary for me to take any further action on his memorandum. But this memorandum helped me understand the line of thought that the President was exploring. In his mind, Britain's future was related to the success or failure of Germany's future. After the war, Britain had to restore its export trade, but he felt that if Germany was allowed to develop a strong export trade competition, Britain's export trade could not recover. So he adopted Morgenthau's plan. But he forgot that although Churchill signed the agreement, Britain was the least willing to turn Germany into a most desolate country, because if bankrupt German steel caused the European economy to collapse, it would harm Britain's livelihood.

The President's memorandum also clearly showed that he did not understand the significance of what he had agreed to in Quebec. At this time, Secretary Stimson had a conversation with the President, and Stimson came to the same conclusion. He told me that he had read a few sentences from the President's September 15 memorandum to him, concluding with: "Prepare to turn Germany into a primarily agricultural and pastoral country."

Stimson told me that the President, upon hearing these sentences, frankly expressed doubt and said that he did not know how he could have signed this memorandum. He had obviously signed it without much thought.

In short, after my conversation with him, the President no longer adopted Morgenthau's views on Germany. Three weeks after receiving my September 29 memorandum, on October 20, he gave me a reply. He began by saying: "I think it is appropriate for us to make all preparations for dealing with Germany, but some things about this treatment make me feel that there is no urgent need to deal with them at present. This may be in a week, maybe in a month, maybe in a few months, I do not want to draw up a detailed plan for a country we have not yet occupied."

He said that he agreed with our plan to disarm Germany and suggested that everything related to aircraft should be included. He wholeheartedly agreed with our plan to dissolve the Nazi Party and its related organizations, as well as extensively control transportation, newspapers, and propaganda. He agreed with our suggestion that there should be no decision on the possible division of Germany in the future. Regarding economic objectives, he said: "I would like to discuss some of the wording with the State Department again. In principle, I agree, but I do not know the meaning of some parts. Most of this part of the problem will depend on the actual situation we encounter after we and the Allies enter Germany--but we have not yet arrived in Germany."

The opinions of me and my colleagues in the September 4 and 29 memoranda were generally agreed upon by the War Department, and later agreed to by Britain and the Soviet Union, and roughly became the policy implemented after the occupation of Germany. Morgenthau continued to support the theory of crushing Germany, and his views had the opposite effect on the Allied plan for Germany, resulting in a more severe plan than we had envisioned in the State Department before I resigned. However, years of experience in occupying Germany, coupled with the fact that what we called the close relationship between the German economy and the European economy was correct, resulted in the British and American governments abandoning that theory.

My conversation with the President on October 1 was the last important task I did during his term. At that time, my health was on the verge of collapse, and I had to submit my resignation.

### Menon and Hu Shih-Tze Fly to Seoul to Supervise South Korean Elections; Student Demonstrations in Seoul Clash

[Central News Agency, Gongju Lake, 1st] Menon, Chairman of the United Nations Delegation to Korea, accompanied by Hu Shih-Tze, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, flew from New York to Seoul tonight. Before his departure, Menon told a reporter from the Central News Agency, "We will do our best to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the Korean issue." Menon and Hu are carrying the emergency powers granted by the UN General Assembly to supervise elections in South Korea and establish a Korean national government, because the delegation to Korea has been refused entry into Soviet-controlled North Korea.

Menon hopes that the delegation's work will be successful. He said: "This will show "great progress" towards achieving an independent and free Korea." Menon revealed: The date of the Korean elections on May 9 was suggested by him to General Hodge, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, during a long-distance telephone call across the Pacific. He explained that the May 9 date would facilitate the participation of Korean farmers in the vote and allow sufficient time for preparation.

### Effective Measures to Stabilize Prices: Three Suggestions Passed by the City Council to Set Up a Public Utilities Investigation Committee After Economic Debate

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon and continued to discuss proposals. The meeting first discussed how to stabilize prices (including four items: temporary motions and other proposals). After review by the Special Review Committee, the revised resolutions are as follows:

(1) Regarding foreign exchange allocation and listing: (2) It is recommended to the central government that the government increase the amount of foreign exchange for imported grains, cotton, machinery, industrial raw materials, public utilities, and transportation fuel, and properly formulate measures to fully utilize private foreign exchange and private foreign deposits to import the above-mentioned materials. (2) It is recommended to the central government to avoid raising foreign exchange rates at any time as much as possible. (3) It is recommended to the central government that overseas remittances should be given appropriate subsidies in addition to the exchange rate settlement. (4) It is recommended to the central government to encourage the export of materials as much as possible to increase foreign exchange income. (5) It is recommended to the central government to adopt an import and export linkage system as soon as possible.

(2) Regarding government control of materials and sales prices: It is recommended to the central government that the central government agencies and public utilities in Shanghai that control materials should appoint personnel familiar with the actual situation of industry and commerce to preside over the handling, and try to purchase daily necessities made by domestic factories to facilitate the production and sales of domestic goods and the turnover of funds. The purpose should not be solely for profit. When coordinating with the current national policy of suppressing the rebellion, the allocation and supply of materials should stabilize prices. If it is absolutely necessary to moderately adjust the selling price of its supplied materials, it should be implemented after obtaining the consent of the local government in advance.

(3) Regarding how to stabilize the prices of public utilities and transportation: It is recommended to the central government to restore the subsidy system for public utilities and transportation, at least for the materials and fuels (such as coal, firewood, oil, and gasoline) necessary for each of these industries. The government is requested to stipulate a reasonably stable allocation or settlement price within three months to reduce the factors of price increases in public utilities and transportation.

In addition, Councilor Wang Guoxian proposed the restoration of industrial loans, which will be discussed after a separate proposal is made.

### Zhai Cheng Opposes Retaining the Investigation of Public Utilities

In addition to the above proposal, the conference also discussed a total of nine proposals regarding public utilities: (1) Regarding the case of "requesting the conference to organize a public utilities investigation committee to review the actual costs of various public utilities to reduce the burden on citizens," the debate was the most intense. The review opinion of the Public Utilities Committee on the case was temporarily reserved. The reason is that for this specialized issue, it is feared that the councilors will not get results by sending representatives to investigate. At the same time, the council trusts the government and should be responsible for handling it. However, Qu Yue firmly opposed the reservation, believing that the councilors should not be afraid of taking responsibility, nor should they fail to investigate because they are not experts. Taking judges as an example, they are not necessarily experts in every kind of issue, but they still have the responsibility to try cases. At the same time, the council should also share the difficulties encountered by the government. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also stood up and said: I hope the council will consider establishing an investigation committee so that the citizens' representatives can truly understand the actual costs and prices of public utilities.

### One Faction Believes It May Not Be Effective

On the other hand, there are also many who agree to retain it. Lu Yinchu said that the competent authority is clearer about the cost situation and investigation technology of public utilities than the council. It should be handled by the government. At the same time, the government should be able to exert its ability. If there is dereliction of duty, the council should strengthen its supervision. Zhang Zhihan ridiculed that the municipal government should send representatives or hire personnel to organize it, and the council does not need to "carry a pole." Li Wenjie also said: There are many things for the council to do, and each councilor also has many things to do. If a lot of time is spent, and it is still an outsider, the investigation will not be effective, so it is not advocated that the council be responsible.

### The People's Food Adjustment Committee Asks the Central Government Whether the Price of Rice Can Be Reduced; Citizens in Many Districts Have Not Yet Received Distribution Certificates

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's comprehensive rice distribution is actively underway. Some citizens in Yangshupu and Yulin districts have begun to purchase rice with certificates since the day before yesterday. Zhabei District also started yesterday. Mayor Wu previously set a deadline for each district to issue the rice distribution certificates to every household before March 3rd, but so far, citizens in many districts have not yet received the rice distribution certificates. The People's Food Adjustment Committee has separately supervised. According to the Director of the Adjustment Committee, Ren Xianqun, the biggest difficulty encountered at the beginning of rice distribution is the delay in issuing certificates in various districts, which has a profound impact on the progress of the work. As of yesterday, more than 10,000 tons of US relief rice have arrived in Shanghai, and more than 1,000 tons will arrive within the day. The relief rice distributed and sold in Shanghai this month can obtain approximately 1 trillion legal currency.

[Another Report] Ren Xianqun, Director of the People's Food Adjustment Committee, urgently requested instructions from the central government last night on whether the price of 2.4 million yuan for distributed rice could be reduced. The distributed rice is indica rice, and the market price of Du Indica is 2.52 million yuan. Adding a 6% profit for retail sales should be 2.67 million yuan. However, each stone of Du Indica rice actually weighs 156 city catties, and the government calculates it based on 150 catties per stone, which should be a 96% discount, only 2.56 million yuan. However, the profit of rice shops is actually not 6%, so yesterday the retail price of Du Indica rice was sold for 2.4 million yuan. Therefore, the People's Food Adjustment Committee had to request instructions from the central government on whether to follow the price reduction.

### Memorial Service for Shen Tiezheng at Guoen Temple

Shen Tiezheng, a member of the Tongmenghui, was killed by bandits last winter when he returned to his hometown. The Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association specially initiated a memorial service at Guoen Temple on Puan Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, and Zhang Daofan, heads of various ministries and commissions of the central government, all sent elegies. Party and government leaders Fang Zhi, Wu Guozhen (represented by Wang Guanqing), Zhu Ping, and more than 300 old comrades of the Xinhai Revolution attended. Fang Zhi presided over the ceremony, and Yuan Xiluo, Ji Qiyun, Hong Chengdian, and Wang Zhaolin accompanied the ceremony. After playing music and performing the ceremony, Wang Zhen reported on the revolutionary deeds of Martyr Shen and the situation of being killed by the Communist bandits. Then Fang Zhi, Yuan Xiluo, and others delivered speeches, encouraging comrades to carry forward the spirit of the martyrs. The ceremony ended at 5:00 PM.

### Mayor's Compromise Passed by Majority Vote

Under the deadlock, Mayor Wu expressed his opinion, saying: For half a year last year, foreign exchange and coal prices did not rise, which made the prices of public utilities very stable. The citizens all said that the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau handled the business best, but Director Zhao was very modest and did not recognize his achievements. The current situation is different. Foreign exchange and coal prices have risen, so how can the prices of public utilities not rise? It is not appropriate for me to agree that Director Zhao is at fault. However, the council's criticism of the municipal government is a very good phenomenon, because it can improve municipal administration. Therefore, I suggest a compromise plan for this case, that is, this investigation committee can be organized by the Public Utilities Bureau and be fully responsible for it. Councilors do not need to be responsible, because they cannot criticize it after being responsible. Councilors can participate in the capacity of observers, can speak and ask questions, and can also understand the situation. After the Mayor finished speaking, Tao Baichuan still agreed that the council should investigate various issues related to public utilities. Finally, the Speaker put it to a vote, and the result was that a small number of people agreed to retain it. As a result, Shao Yongsheng's suggestion was adopted, and the organization of the investigation committee was passed. The methods are as follows: (1) The conference shall establish a public utilities investigation committee, authorize it to review whether the cost calculation of various public utilities is correct and reasonable, and study fair standard calculation methods, and send it to the municipal government for reference. (2) The investigation committee shall be jointly organized by 25 people publicly elected by the conference and representatives from each subcommittee, with the Speaker and Deputy Speaker as ex-officio members, and convened by the Speaker. (3) The investigation work shall be carried out in groups. After the investigation report is passed by the entire committee, it shall be sent to the municipal government for reference by the council.

The Motor Tricycle Case is Sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for Research

(2) Regarding the case of "canceling the quota allocation of gasoline for automobiles to eliminate the black market," the subcommittee's review opinion is to recommend that the central government cancel the quota allocation of gasoline for automobiles and allow the transfer of automobiles, and strictly prohibit the import of small passenger cars. However, some people opposed the cancellation in the conference, such as Zhang Zhihan and Fei Shusheng, who believed that there should be restrictions to save foreign exchange. Zhou Xiangsheng and Chu Shun and others said that the gasoline quota is not related to foreign exchange and should still be canceled. After a vote, this case was retained and handled according to the current method. However, according to Zhao, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, if agencies and groups have special needs and need to increase their gasoline consumption, they can explain the reasons and apply.

(3) "In order to facilitate transportation and meet economy, please the conference discuss the newly manufactured motor tricycle for operation in this city." The review opinion is temporarily reserved. There are two reasons: (1) Because Shanghai is already full of various vehicles, traffic will be more difficult to maintain after adding new vehicles; (2) The safety issue is worth studying, so it is advocated to postpone it. However, most councilors such as Shao Yongsheng and Qu Yue expressed that the new invention of the people should be encouraged, and at least a trial opportunity should be given. As a result, it was decided that "this case will be sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for research and experimentation."

Regulations State That a Public Telephone Should Be Installed Within One Li

(4) The cases concerning the installation of tap water faucets were all merged and decided: Please the Public Utilities Bureau quickly handle the resolutions on supplying tap water to the civilian areas according to the resolutions of the previous conferences of the council, and hope to complete 30 water supply stations in the short term. (5) "Please the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau install public telephones in Zhabei and the four suburbs to benefit the citizens and consolidate security." The conference decided: The council will send a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation to forward it to expedite the handling, and ask the Shanghai Municipal Government to send a letter to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. Method: It is proposed that the Telecommunications Bureau accept the requests of citizens to install public telephones as much as possible. If it is considered necessary after investigation, it shall not be used as an excuse that there are no empty lines, and it is stipulated that a public telephone shall be installed within one li. (6) The Telephone Company of this city often delays or does not respond to the application of telephone users to add extensions, resulting in prolonged call time and affecting user convenience. Resolution: Please the Telephone Company of this city make every effort to facilitate the installation of extensions for users in the future, and allow users to freely install extensions with their own suitable telephone sets. (7) The Bund Wharf in the Central District prohibits the berthing of cargo ships to improve the city's appearance and facilitate transportation. Resolution: Send a request to the municipal government to build wharfs and warehouses No. 10 to No. 18, move them within a time limit, and order motorized sailing ships to change their berthing to the Nanshi Wharf first. Method: Please the municipal government order the Public Utilities Bureau to re-stipulate from today that the wharfs on the Bund in the Central District are exclusively for public transportation, strictly prohibiting the berthing of cargo ships and the loading and unloading of goods, and stipulate that all ships loaded with fruits, chickens, ducks, fish, and fresh goods must change their berthing to the wharfs in the Shiliupu area for unloading.

### The Rabbit Dies, the Fox Grieves: Finance Bureau Staff Member Commits Suicide by Jumping into the River; Colleagues from Both Bureaus Donate to Help the Bereaved Family

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Hao, a staff member of the Finance Bureau, committed suicide by jumping into the river because his wife had been ill for more than two months and he saw that there was no hope of saving her. He could not afford to pay for her treatment, and he could not bear to witness the tragic scene of her taking her last breath.

The newspaper also reported that his wife's condition worsened because she had not seen her husband for days and was unable to speak. She had no one to take care of her, and it was difficult to even get a glass of water. When Yang Jusong, a specialist from the Social Bureau, read this tragic news, he was deeply moved and initiated a donation to the families of the victims. This proposal was immediately responded to by all colleagues in the Social Bureau. Director Wu Kaixian first donated one million yuan to show his approval, and all other colleagues also helped. The declaration drafted by the staff welfare society of the Social Bureau for this donation movement was quite painful: "We are all civil servants and have a sense of grief for the death of a rabbit, just like the death of a fox. Although we are as poor as Mr. Lu Hao, we are still struggling and can still struggle! We should give sympathy in spirit and assistance in material." The staff welfare society of the Social Bureau will collect this donation within days and send it to the families of the victims.

[Another Report] Lu was from Wu County, and his brother's name is Lu Ye. After Lu's death, the Finance Bureau sent personnel to handle the funeral with his brother, and the Finance Bureau colleagues initiated a fundraising. More than 37 million yuan has been raised and given to Lu's family, and fundraising is still underway.

### Zhan Wenhun, National Assembly Representative, Transfers Qualification to Friendly Party Song Yimian; President Chiang Sends a Telegram to Commend Him

Zhan Wenhun, General Manager of Xinwen Bao, was elected as the National Assembly Representative of professional journalists. Following the telegram from President Chiang of the Kuomintang, he has transferred the qualification of representative to Mr. Song Yiqing of the Youth Party. According to Zhan, colleagues from all over the country enthusiastically supported him in the election of the National Assembly Representative last year. As a result of the vote count, he was officially elected. However, in order to adapt to the political environment and smoothly promote constitutional government, the central government has decided to assist friendly parties in generating a certain number of seats, and journalists are also among the agreed-upon assisted seats. Zhan received a telegram from President Chiang of the Kuomintang on February 29 yesterday, instructing him to transfer the qualification of representative to Mr. Song Yiqing of the Youth Party, who was elected as an alternate representative, and to retreat to the alternate position. President Chiang's telegram stated: "I hope that with your personal grace, you can demonstrate the sincerity and trustworthiness of our party. It is not only the virtue of concession that can be admirable, but also the benefits to the country. I deeply believe that comrades will be able to carry out the established policies of our party with the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice in the past, and serve the party and the country in the future. I hope you cherish it." Zhan replied that he would obey the order to concede, stating in the telegram: "The central government has decided to assist journalist Song Yiqing, a member of the friendly party, in being elected as the National Assembly Representative of professional journalist groups through the party-to-party transfer method. Wenhun, as a member of the party, should obey the order to give way to the virtuous, so as to show the sincerity and trustworthiness of our party. In the future, I will continue to adhere to my position and strive to develop China's journalism, to repay the attention of His Excellency and to live up to the enthusiasm of colleagues."

[Report from Our Newspaper] A dispute arose during the rehearsal of the lawyers' association on the evening of the 29th of last month.

Lawyer Fei Xizhen sang "The Sale of Horses," which was scheduled for the last performance. Because Wang performed with special enthusiasm, with various tunes and many items, Fei was worried that the time for "Picking Up Gold" would be too long, and the audience would be tired, affecting "The Sale of Horses." Fei was so anxious in the backstage that he was jumping up and down. Yu Zhongluo and Zhang Danping, two lawyers, signaled on stage to ask Wang to end it earlier.

### Conscription Decided to Adopt Indirect Lottery System, Military District Announces Handling Measures

[Report from this newspaper] It was previously decided that this year's conscription in Shanghai would be conducted through a lottery system. After consultation between the various military service authorities, it was decided to adopt an indirect lottery system. The Shanghai Military District has recently announced the indirect lottery measures to ensure public understanding. The key points of the measures are as follows:

Key Points of the Measures

(1) If direct lottery is not permitted due to circumstances, a report may be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval to adopt an indirect lottery. (2) Indirect lottery methods are divided into two types: 1. If a small number of eligible men currently serving in the military are unable to attend the lottery in person, the district chief (保長) may draw the lottery on their behalf. 2. If a majority of eligible men currently serving in the military are unwilling to participate in direct lottery, or if they are indeed unable to attend the lottery in person due to circumstances, a representative of the Military Service Association may draw the lottery on their behalf (the indirect lottery referred to in these measures belongs to the latter). (3) In adopting an indirect lottery, the order of conscription procedures may be changed as follows: 1. Background investigation, 2. Lottery, 3. Physical examination, 4. Conscription into the association. (4) The indirect lottery shall be presided over by the mayor. (5) Before the lottery, the municipal government shall allocate the number of soldiers assigned for the year to each district and neighborhood unit (保) according to the population ratio, for the purpose of the lottery. (6) At the time of the lottery, the register of all eligible men in the city for military service, except for those who are exempt or deferred, shall be compiled by neighborhood unit, regardless of physical fitness level, and a roster of lottery numbers for eligible men currently serving in the military in each neighborhood unit shall be created for this year, numbered consecutively from the first number, with each number corresponding to a lottery ticket. The lottery tickets shall be supervised and sealed by the Military Service Association, and representatives shall affix their seals to them, and then hand them over to the mayor for safekeeping. (7) A register of the selected order (牌) of eligible men currently serving in the military in each neighborhood unit shall be compiled separately, and an equal number of bamboo lottery tickets shall be prepared. During the lottery, the Military Service Association shall draw the lottery on behalf of the individuals, and each ticket drawn shall be recorded in the register and displayed on the sequential plate, and sealed as before. (8) At the time of conscription, the mayor, together with a representative of the Military Service Association, shall open the roster of lottery numbers, and select one to two times the quota for each neighborhood unit in order to supplement those who fail the physical examination, which shall be counted as the number to be conscripted. Then, according to the roster of the selected names from each neighborhood unit, the first ticket drawn shall be the first selected person in each neighborhood unit, the second ticket drawn shall be the second selected person, and so on until the required number of conscripts for that neighborhood unit is reached. All names shall be transferred to the roster of conscripted men in each neighborhood unit. If a lottery number exceeds the number of people in that neighborhood unit, the sequentially recorded lottery numbers in the roster shall be used to fill the vacancies. (9) In addition to forwarding the roster of conscripted men to the districts to which the neighborhoods belong along with the conscription notices, a copy shall be submitted to the regimental headquarters for reference.

### United Power Plant Project, Agreement between Ministry of Economic Affairs and Municipal Government

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 2nd] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian recently went to Shanghai and discussed the Shanghai United Power Plant with Mayor Wu. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government have no disagreement in principle, and only technical discussions are needed before the project can begin.

### Winners of Charity Houses Gradually Revealed, Ferry Driver Dares Not Believe It, Apprentice in Cotton Mill Working for Others

[Report from this newspaper] After the lottery for the Class B Charity House tickets, the names and identities of the fifty lucky winners have been gradually revealed since yesterday.

A driver from the city ferry company named Zhou Xincheng won a prize. Yesterday, when he saw the numbers published in the newspaper, he was hesitant to believe it. Early in the morning, he specially went to the housing charity sales group of the Winter Relief Association to check, and was delighted to find that it was indeed correct. His number is Di (帝) 01994.

Huang Guozhen, the Spinning Department director of Rongfeng Cotton Mill on Yidingpan Road, some time ago asked a young apprentice in the factory to buy several lottery tickets at a cigarette and paper store on Yidingpan Road. One of them, Wenzi (文字) 02841, actually won. The director of Rongfeng Cotton Mill felt that the young apprentice was lucky, so yesterday he specially sent him again to the housing charity sales group of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to buy a large number of Tianshi (田種) lottery tickets. When this young apprentice was buying the tickets, he talked about this matter, and another customer buying tickets next to him was greatly moved and also entrusted him to choose some numbers for him.

Xinxin Company held a big sale last winter and gave away housing charity sales tickets. Anyone who purchased goods worth 200,000 yuan could receive a ticket, and 20 giveaway tickets could be exchanged for one charity sales ticket. Fang Chengzhou, Zhu Rongzhuang, and Hong Wenda, three employees of the socks department, unintentionally accumulated 20 giveaway tickets and jointly exchanged them for a Yu (　) 01118 charity sales ticket. Unexpectedly, they actually won the prize, and they are already discussing how to divide it.

In addition, it has been confirmed that the winners also include Cao Fengtai, an employee of the China Culture Service Agency, seven employees of Lixin Accounting Firm (jointly purchased one ticket), and a Mr. Zhuang, an employee of the Land Administration Bureau, etc. All the employees of the housing charity sales group of the Winter Relief Association collectively bought more than 240 tickets, but none of them won. Among them, the tickets Zhong (重) 10269 and 10271 were both bought by them, but the winning ticket, 10270, was missing. It is said that this ticket, 10270, was bought by a woman on the morning of the lottery.

As for whether there are any winning tickets among the more than 90,000 unsold tickets, it was still unknown yesterday. This mystery will be revealed only after the remaining tickets are unsealed tomorrow.

### Three Steps to Claiming Prizes, Receiving Houses by the End of April

Regarding the procedures for claiming prizes for Class B housing tickets, according to the person in charge of the housing charity sales department of the Winter Relief Association yesterday: For winners of Class B housing tickets, the first step is to personally bring the winning ticket to the housing charity sales department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification. The department will send personnel to verify the ticket against the stub and the perforation seal. After verification, if it is confirmed that the ticket was issued by the department, the association will issue a certificate. The second step is for the winner to present the certificate issued by the association and the winning ticket to the Winter Relief Association on the third floor of the Municipal Council on Tangshan Road from the 5th of this month to exchange for a house receipt certificate. This house receipt certificate has already been printed and is very beautiful and elegant. The third step is that the Class B houses will all be completed by the end of April. The locations are distributed in four places: 7 buildings at No. 1503 Zhongzheng West Road, 16 buildings on Linsen West Road, 11 buildings at No. 70 Wuyi Road, and 16 buildings at No. 7 Wuyi Road, totaling 50 buildings. The department will convene all the winners at the end of April to draw lots again to determine the houses they will receive.

### Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou Talks About Shaanxi Politics to Our Reporter

[Our Xi'an Bureau Report, February 28th by air] It will be almost four years to the day, until March 3rd, since Shaanxi Province Chairman Zhu Shaozhou has been in charge of Shaanxi's administration. The provincial government's gate is being whitewashed and decorated, and Shaanxi officials will celebrate that day.

This morning, as agreed, we went to visit Chairman Zhu. The meeting place was in the provincial government building, which is also where Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek cautioned young Marshal Zhang eleven years ago during the "Xi'an Incident." Chairman Zhu's current office is where the Generalissimo, who was in distress, slept for several days.

For this interview, although we had prepared some questions in advance, the host had figured out what the reporters wanted to ask. Therefore, we did not need to ask, and he went on in one breath, his tone of voice revealing a very strong Jiangnan Hang County accent, and with confidence and firmness in his modesty and frankness. When he talked about the difficulties, the three wrinkles on his forehead were clearly visible. After all, he is fifty and a half years old, and half of his hair has turned white, but his rosy cheeks, strong muscles, and bright eyes prove that he is healthy and energetic. The topic started like this:

Stability and Finance

In the four years that I have been in charge of Shaanxi, I have always reviewed my gains and losses every anniversary to see how much of the central work has actually been done and how much has not been done. The first two years of the four years were during the Anti-Japanese War, and the last two years were during the suppression of the rebellion. I think the last two years were even more difficult than the first two years. There have been no major achievements in the past four years, but the local area is stable, both publicly and privately, and I can report [to superiors] with peace of mind. I have always believed that we must seek stability in turbulence and progress in hardship. Stability is the basic condition for progress...."

Under the general situation of inflation and austerity in government spending, provincial-level finance is undoubtedly difficult. Talking about the problem of money, Chairman Zhu talked about his methods like a gentle patriarch talking about family affairs: "I have a principle, that is, when money should be used, I will not hesitate to spend billions, and when it should not be used, I will not use even a penny." Saying this, he smiled and gestured before saying, "Let me give you an example. This year's Spring Festival labor army, we originally thought that 1 billion would be enough to distribute, but as a result, 2 billion was issued, and I still gritted my teeth and paid, because I thought it should be done."

"For another example, in the past, the savings of the various departments and offices of the provincial government had their own channels, and the interest rates were different. Later, I ordered them to be concentrated in the provincial bank, and on the other hand, I asked the provincial bank to increase the interest rate on the provincial government's deposits. Currently, we have public funds publicly deposited, income and expenses are open, and the interest that should be public is all turned over to the public..."

Working for the Hometown Next, he talked about the issue of "people":

"In recent years, we have been trying to promote young and outstanding local cadres, trying to let them work for their hometown, and not change because of the departure of superior officials. When I first took office, only one of the ten administrative commissioners in the province was a local person, and the other nine were from other provinces. Now the number of commissioners of local origin has increased to three. Furthermore, in the ninety-odd counties, at that time, there were only 20 county magistrates of [Shaanxi] origin, while now there are 40 or 50, that is, half of the total are of local origin. Now is a time of military affairs, and county magistrates must understand military affairs. Otherwise, the appointment of local people as local county magistrates can still be increased to seventy or eighty percent. Originally, employing people is like planting trees. Only local seedlings planted in local soil are easy to grow. Similarly, only when local cadres take root can all policies have a foundation. Until now, I have not had a single relative or friend in Shaanxi Province as a county magistrate..." As he spoke, he kept writing the character "人" (person) on the table with his finger to emphasize his emphasis on personnel, local cadres, and impartiality.

Satisfactory Government Affairs He replied to us, "The customs and folk customs of Shaanxi Province are very lovely. The farmers' naivety, simplicity, hard work, and endurance are especially rare. In the past, when I was in Hanzhong, I often went to the countryside in plain clothes to chat with the old farmers. The folks there all knew who I was, and we talked to each other as close as family. Now government affairs are a little busier than that time, but I still hope to talk with the Guanzhong farmers more, as I have for four years."

"Then, which aspect of government affairs has the chairman been most satisfied with in the past four years?" We asked.

"The first is water conservancy, and the second is anti-opium. If we had not worked hard to ban opium in the past few years, I am afraid that many people in Shaanxi would have already become opium addicts."

Next, we talked about the public security in various parts of the province, from Yulin, Yan'an, Guanzhong, and Southern Shaanxi to the borders of Sichuan and Hubei, because in addition to being the chairman of the province, he also serves as the commander of the province's security forces and the commander-in-chief of martial law. Unfortunately, another reporter from a certain newspaper happened to be there, taking notes of our conversation. The host seemed to have some concerns about this, and we did not want to raise other pre-planned questions. This interview came to an end. Here, we would like to add some statistical figures on construction aspects in the province over the past four years, because numbers are the most objective witnesses.

Ten Water Conservancy Channels First, we note the water conservancy. There are currently ten water conservancy channels in the province, with a total length of 885 kilometers of main canals, irrigating 1.34 million mu of land. Cotton production in the beneficiary area increased by 350,000 dan in the past year, with a total of 1.83 million dan in the past four years. Grain production in the beneficiary area increased by 2.4 million shi in the past year, with a total of 11.65 million shi in the past four years. Among the above-mentioned ten channels, the entire project of the Nonghui Canal and the [　]hui Canal, and most of the projects of the Hanhui Canal, Baohui Canal, Xuhui Canal, and Jinghui Canal, were completed in the most recent four years. In addition to irrigation canals, water conservancy and power generation projects and reservoir construction are being started or have been surveyed and planned. After four years of continuous exploration, they have attracted the attention of the whole country and the authorities, and are being gradually implemented. The most important ones are: (1) The Heihe Reservoir, all of which has been surveyed. In the future, the plan is to irrigate 400,000 mu of land and generate more than 50,000 horsepower of electricity, transmitting electricity as far as 100 kilometers. (2) The second Weihui Canal has been specially applied for construction funds by the Ministry of Water Resources and can be implemented immediately. (3) The Jinghe River upstream reservoir, which can irrigate 1 million mu of land, has been approved by the central government. (4) The Weihuo Baoji Gorge (Taibingu) Reservoir has more than 60,000 horsepower and irrigates 400,000 mu of land. (5) The Yumengkou Reservoir has 350,000 horsepower and can irrigate 2.5 million mu of land.

In addition, there are small-scale water conservancy projects. In the past four years, the cumulative total of benefited farmland has reached 2.5 million mu.

In terms of increased agricultural production: In the past four years, the promotion of improved wheat varieties has covered 2 million mu, increasing grain production by more than 18 million dan. During the same period, the promotion of improved cotton varieties has covered 8.18 million mu, increasing cotton production by 2.5 million dan. This has made an important contribution to the rural economy of the province and the domestic textile industry in recent years. (Our reporters Ma Ye and Zhang Xianzhou)

### Conscription in Jiangsu Province is Mainly by Lottery

[Report from our Zhenjiang Bureau on the 1st] The Jiangsu Military Region Headquarters recently issued an order to the military service associations of various counties, stating: "In the past, the military service associations in various places requested that Jiangsu be a region where culture is concentrated, personnel changes are extremely complicated, and transportation is developed, and it is not easy to ascertain the changes in eligible men. Therefore, we specially requested to change this year's conscription method. After submitting it to the Ministry of National Defense for review and approval, it has been approved that the lottery must still be the main method, and voluntary participation may be used as a supplement when necessary." In addition to ordering the military service associations of various counties, the headquarters also notified the military service agencies at all levels.

(2) Use Cyberban, text or sex-linked [　], and conduct hybridization experiments. (3) Conduct resistance tests on hybrid varieties. (4) Use colchicine drugs for breeding experiments.

### American Navy Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai - First Game Unfavorable - Loses to Qingbai by One Point

Second Game Tonight Against

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qingdao US Marine Corps McKinley basketball team, at the invitation of the Shanghai Basketball Committee, arrived in Shanghai by US Navy plane yesterday afternoon. That evening, they played their first game against Qingbai at the City Gymnasium, and the result was unfavorable, losing to Qingbai by a half-ball difference of 48 to 47. In the first half, Qingbai was behind 26 to 30. The game was quite tense, but the number of fans in the gymnasium was not crowded. McKinley's second game is tonight, starting at 8:30 PM, against the city champion Hualian, and there will be a fierce battle.

McKinley's Strength - Judging from last night's game, McKinley's strength is not that great, about the same as Qingbai. Some basic moves are very good, such as throwing under the basket and passing the ball, which are unique, but they are somewhat stiff and unfamiliar, and the defense is too sparse, which was also the reason for last night's failure. Tonight's game is unlikely to defeat Hualian. The best players in the team are forward Deng Bo and guard Lauterbach, who often have wonderful performances. Although last night's game was not very fast, it was clean and refreshing, without any procrastination, which was quite enjoyable.

Yesterday's Game - The game was very tense in the second half. It adopted a four-quarter system. In the first quarter, Qingbai took the lead with 4 to 1, and the US military chased to 15 to 14, a difference of one point. In the second quarter, the score was tied twice, and the competition was fierce. The US military gradually surpassed, and finally took the lead with 30 to 26 in the first half. In the second half, McKinley was always in the lead, but the difference was not far. Qingbai chased hard, and in the third quarter, the score was 36 to 35, with Qingbai only one point behind. The last deciding quarter was extremely tense, with each team scoring one point alternately. In the last two minutes, Nan Zhenhu scored, making the score 44 to 43, with Qingbai one point ahead. Unexpectedly, the US military made a free throw, and Ah Cai scored miraculously, putting Qingbai ahead again. With 12 seconds left, Lauterbach made a free throw, and McKinley still lost by one point.

Second Game Against Hualian - The US military McKinley team will play its second game tonight, starting at 8:30 PM, still at the gymnasium, against the city champion Hualian. Tickets are 30,000 yuan upstairs, 60,000 yuan downstairs, and 100,000 yuan for reserved seats in the venue. Reserved seats will be pre-sold starting at 10:00 AM in the gymnasium accounting office, and ordinary seats will be sold starting at 5:00 PM. Due to the badminton competition, the gate will open at 7:30 PM, and reserved seats will enter the barbed wire fence at 8:00 PM. At that time, the Siwei Boy Scouts will still be present to maintain order, and the referee will be Jin Botao.

(McKinley) Lauterbach, Fowler Stott, Hague, Deng Bo, Cress, Norris.

### Another Reunion: A Movie Script (4)

— Zhang Daoluo

28. The Zheng Family's Shanghai Residence

Outside the Door (October, Year 35)

In front of the Zheng family's old Shanghai residence at 918 Ferguson Road. A car carrying Jingye, Xiuzhen, and their luggage (a small leather suitcase, a cloth travel bag) arrives at the gate of Jingye's old Shanghai home. Jingye directs the car to stop. He gets out first to check the house number and looks around. It seems the same as before. Only then does he press the doorbell without hesitation. A woman of about fifty comes to open the door. This woman is Jingye's sister-in-law, Mrs. Zheng (Mrs. Zheng is now about forty-seven or forty-eight years old.)

Mrs. Zheng: (Initially only opens the door a small crack, looking out and asking) Who are you?

Jingye: Is this the Zheng residence?

Mrs. Zheng: Yes, who are you looking for?

Jingye: (Now seeing clearly that it is his sister-in-law.) Aren't you my sister-in-law?

Mrs. Zheng: (Suddenly opens the door wide.) Ah! Sister, it's you!

Jingye: Hey! None of you came to pick me up at the airport. The place names in Shanghai have changed so much, I almost couldn't find my way home.

Mrs. Zheng: Who knew you were arriving today!

Jingye: Didn't you receive my telegram?

Mrs. Zheng: No! Come in quickly, the servants can take care of the luggage.

Jingye: (Smiling at his sister-in-law.) I have another piece of "living" luggage! (Mrs. Zheng looks puzzled. Jingye walks to the car and opens the door.) Xiuzhen, get out!

(Xiuzhen, holding a coat, gets out of the car, looking a little shy as she sees Mrs. Zheng. Everyone goes inside together, closing the door behind them. They arrive in the living room.)

29. The Zheng Family's Living Room

The living room of Zheng Jingye's old Shanghai residence. The furnishings are quite elaborate. There are lifelike portraits, exquisite old-fashioned rosewood carved furniture, as well as modern sofas and chairs. The walls are hung with works by famous calligraphers and painters. Although eight years of war have passed, it seems the family has not suffered any upheaval or loss.

Mrs. Zheng: Sister, is this your...?

Jingye: Xiuzhen, this is my sister-in-law, Mrs. Zheng, you can call her Aunt.

Mrs. Zheng: (Saying jokingly) I thought she should call me Auntie!

Jingye: (Looks at his sister-in-law with a smile, but a hint of anger.) Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense!

This is an orphan I adopted in Guiyang. Her parents originally lived in Shanghai. I hope she can find her parents here, so she can have a home to return to.

Mrs. Zheng: Ah! Sister, why did you only come back a year after the victory?

Jingye: There are many people in the rear, who knows when they will return!

Mrs. Zheng: Sister, you haven't changed at all, you are even more beautiful than before.

Jingye: You haven't aged either.

Mrs. Zheng: My hair is already streaked with white, how can I not be old!

Jingye: Oh! Where is my brother?

Mrs. Zheng: I was just about to tell you, he went to Tianjin in May.

Jingye: What did he go to Tianjin for?

Mrs. Zheng: Friends invited him to handle a railway project. Sister, are you tired?

Take Xiuzhen upstairs to wash your face and rest for a while. I'll prepare some tea and snacks, and we can have a good chat. (Continued from the previous installment of this publication, issue 12.) 36. In Front of the Zheng Residence

The day after Xiuzhen returned home, Canyun and Xiuzhen brought many gifts to Jingye's house to express their gratitude.

Mrs. Zheng: (After opening the door) Ah, Xiuzhen, Mrs. He, it's you! Please come in. (Everyone walks into the living room together.)

37. The Zheng Family's Living Room

Mrs. Zheng: Mrs. He, please sit down.

Canyun: (Places the gifts on the table, saying to Mrs. Zheng) These small gifts are from Xiuzhen to Mrs. Zheng and your sister.

Mrs. Zheng: Oh! You are too kind. Xiuzhen, you actually give gifts!

Xiuzhen: Aunt, where is Mr. Zheng?

Mrs. Zheng: He is upstairs, not feeling very well.

Xiuzhen: I'll go ask him to come down. (Runs upstairs.)

Mrs. Zheng: Mrs. He, your daughter is truly lovely. My sister has taken care of her for two years, so naturally, she has developed feelings for her. Now that she has returned home, my sister can't help but feel sad.

Canyun: Oh! I am truly sorry to your sister. I will often send Xiuzhen to visit her in the future. From everything Xiuzhen told me last night, I also know that your sister truly loves Xiuzhen. Without your sister adopting her, I'm afraid this child would have died long ago. Mrs. Zheng, is your sister not married yet?

Mrs. Zheng: No.

Canyun: Let me introduce someone to her. I think she can definitely be a good wife and mother. When she has her own children, she will have a spiritual anchor.

Mrs. Zheng: My sister is a bit different from other women. All day long, she only talks about academics and careers, but I never hear her talk about marriage.

(Xiuzhen pulls Jingye into the living room. Jingye greets Canyun. After everyone sits down.)

Canyun: Mr. Zheng, Xiuzhen has told me how you saved her, how you treated her wounds, how you cared for her, and educated her. We can never repay your kindness. (Laughs to herself first)

Now that I think about wanting to send you a reward yesterday, it was really ridiculous. I hope you will forgive me.

Jingye: (A kind of proud smile.) It's nothing.

Canyun: Xiuzhen, what are you doing? Have you forgotten?

Xiuzhen: Mr. Zheng, my mother wants to invite you and Aunt to our house for dinner tomorrow.

Jingye: Mrs. He, you don't have to be so polite, I have something to do tomorrow evening and cannot go.

Canyun: Xiuzhen's father has gone to Hong Kong, otherwise, he would have come together today to thank you and invite you. If you have something to do tomorrow, how about changing it to the day after tomorrow?

Jingye: Please don't be so polite, I never really like social engagements.

Xiuzhen: Mr. Zheng, you said you would definitely come to my house to see me.

Mrs. Zheng: Sister, just agree!

Jingye: (Smiles at Xiuzhen.) Just once! (To Canyun.) Alright, Mrs. He, let it be the day after tomorrow.

Canyun: I am extremely happy that you are willing to grace us with your presence. (To Mrs. Zheng.) Mrs. Zheng, you can't not come the day after tomorrow. Xiuzhen, let's go home. (The He mother and daughter bid farewell.) The He family's living room. It is just after dinner, and all the guests are walking into the living room from the dining room. The hosts are naturally Canyun and Xiuzhen. In addition to Zheng Jingye and Mrs. Zheng, there are also two female guests and five male guests, who are obviously modern figures. After everyone enters the living room one after another, some sit down by themselves, and some stand together in twos and threes talking; Mrs. He pays attention to taking care of the guests.

Canyun: (To Jingye.) Mr. Zheng, please sit down.

### Two Brothers (Middle)

— Lin Ye

— A Story of a Pair Wandering in Annam

The day after disembarking, the eldest brother followed a fellow villager, Ma Zi, who was purchasing local goods, and moved into the inn. He had some money with him, so he was willing to partner with that fellow villager, and at the same time, he hoped to learn some experience from him. Honest eldest brother, he trusts others even more than he trusts himself.

After resting for a few days, they set off again; this time they were going to walk from Saigon to Phnom Penh to purchase goods. Phnom Penh is famous for producing pepper, and they hoped to buy cheap pepper there and then transport it back.

Although Phnom Penh is not as large as Saigon, it is very densely populated, and its products are not only abundant but also a distribution center for goods. The residents believe in ghosts and gods, and their tricks of sorcery are comparable to those of Siam. One can often see teams of natives wearing strange costumes, beating large leather drums, humming crude melodies, swaggering through the streets, and in lively places, they use sharp iron bars to pierce their lips or noses without any concern. This action frightened the eldest brother, but in Ma Zi's eyes it was commonplace.

They first browsed the streets, and at the same time inquired about the market prices of pepper and other spices. Ma Zi liked to drink the local liquor and chew areca nuts with a strong smell, but the eldest brother had no such habits. When entering and exiting restaurants, he only needed a cup or two of coffee and a few local cigarettes. The days passed too quickly, and after a week of meaningless life, the eldest brother began to feel bored. He urged Ma Zi almost every day to hurry up and get the goods ready so he could go back. Ma Zi also became worried, the romantic and unrestrained hobbies had taken away half of his capital, but he could not immediately tell the eldest brother, he only pretended to be careful and said:

"The price of goods is too high, they are simply cheating us merchants from outside. Let's look again, and buy when it is suitable."

An unexpected thing happened: One day, near dusk, they were wandering on the street? A short, thin middle-aged man ran over, seeming very clever, and said:

"Gentlemen, are you buying spices? I'll introduce you, the one across the street is particularly cheap, they have always been known for their honesty."

The eldest brother and Ma Zi did as he said and went to look for it. The spice shop did not have a sign, only half of the storefront was open, and it was gloomy inside, and not a single figure could be seen. They looked around and saw several bags of pepper piled on the floor, as well as various spices scattered on the ground; cobwebs were formed on the roof and corners of the walls, showing that it had not been cleaned for a long time. Ma Zi became impatient and deliberately coughed a few times, at which time there were a few echoes of wooden clogs dragging from inside the shop. A gorgeously dressed lady came out with delicate steps, she impolitely first looked them both up and down, and then spoke in not very proficient Cantonese (Note 1) and asked:

"What do you want to buy?"

So Ma Zi began to discuss the price with her, only the eldest brother stood silently aside, admiring her attire. He had been in Annam for almost two months, but he had never paid attention to the attire of the local ladies, so he looked at her with surprised eyes: She had a slender, black hair that dragged all the way to her knees, and a few white orchids that were not yet in full bloom were inserted into her temples. She wore a pink cheongsam, which was split all the way from the hem to the hips, revealing her soft white long pants. There was also a string of glowing beads around her neck, but her feet were bare, only wearing a pair of wooden clogs... It really felt like a unique sight. The eldest brother seemed to be fascinated by her.

As a result of the discussion, Ma Zi was satisfied, because the price here was indeed one-third cheaper than the market. However, their transaction was not immediately successful, she asked Ma Zi to come again the next afternoon.

The eldest brother followed Ma Zi back, on the road he mentioned that young boss lady to Ma Zi, and his heart could not help but ripple with desire. The next day, the eldest brother was indeed a little impatient to wait, he did not wait until the afternoon and went alone first.

The light in the spice shop was still as dim, and all the equipment was the same as yesterday, the gorgeously dressed boss lady was already waiting at the door of the shop before the eldest brother arrived, she saw the eldest brother and said bluntly:

"I guessed that you would come alone, that Ma Zi is really annoying, otherwise it would save you another trip!"

Later, they chatted very congenially, and the eldest brother simply told some of his experiences, at this time, he was already intoxicated in her coquetry.

It turned out that this girl who understood Cantonese was a widow, she had been living alone since her husband died five years ago; living on her husband's inheritance and selling spices. Her stiff and not fluent Cantonese was learned from her husband; because he was also a Cantonese. The life of a widow made her feel endless pain, she could not continue to waste her youth. Therefore, she took advantage of the darkness to move to the eldest brother's side, knelt down and hugged his leg, crying and asking to live with him. The eldest brother seemed to agree without thinking.

The sudden event made Ma Zi shed a few tears of excessive joy: the eldest brother not only did not demand the money he had invested with him, but he also got a lot of spices from the boss lady. However, the boss lady made a condition, asking him to keep it a secret after returning, and not let the eldest brother's family know his address...

The days passed too quickly, and it had been five years. Ma Zi, who was addicted to tobacco and alcohol and greedy for money, although he constantly traveled back and forth to transport spices, but he did not get rich as a result.

The eldest brother was much more haggard, living like a senseless hermit in the spice shop that was as dark as before. Since living with her, he had not left the narrow door of the shop, he could not see the sky, and lived in the foul air all year round. However, her appearance and demeanor were still as beautiful, but in the rat's nest-like house, her dress looked very discordant. In the dim light, she did not think that her盛裝 would lose its beautiful effect, on the contrary, she thought it would be better that way. Every day, she spent her time on dressing up, steaming and cooking, sleeping... Occasionally, one or two customers would come to the door, but she thought this was annoying. Inside the house, there was an altar, the incense candles never stopped burning morning and night, and she spent most of her time praying and kneeling. The eldest brother never interrupted these things, his mind never had a clear day.

The second brother and his mother still lived in the small village near the sea, they looked forward to news of the eldest brother day and night, every time a sea ship docked, they always went to inquire with a hopeful heart, but every time they always went back with knitted eyebrows and frustration. The elderly mother's hair had turned white waiting, the second brother supported the family with his strong body, gently comforted his mother, and at the same time he secretly made a wish to travel across the ocean to find his brother.

The second brother's determination was finally realized, and as a result of his hard work, the savings in his purse were enough to maintain his mother's living expenses for more than two years.

The old woman with a head full of silver hair gave the second brother even greater hope, she no longer made any more beautiful ideals; as long as their family could be reunited and enjoy family happiness again, she would be satisfied.

Time passed really fast, the second brother had been wandering in Annam for more than half a year inquiring about news of the eldest brother, he had traveled all over several famous big cities, following merchants selling goods to visit along the way, and finally came to Phnom Penh. The hardship of the journey did not discourage him, on the contrary, in every inch of time he always felt that there was a possibility of meeting the eldest brother. He prayed devoutly, asking for the enlightenment of the gods to help him realize his wish. Every time he arrived at a place, he inquired door-to-door along the streets and alleys... With sincerity and courage overflowing, he finally suddenly met the long-hidden Ma Zi. The second brother patiently inquired with him, the cunning Ma Zi thought this was an opportunity that was beneficial to him, so he spoke a long set of ambiguous words in a roundabout way, and as a result, he got a considerable reward as he wished before revealing the news that had been buried for five or six years.

### Zimo's Diary

— Xu Zhimo's posthumous works, compiled by Chen Congzhou

October 11th, 3 am, the armistice news came, at that time the whole country was ecstatic, and the heaven and earth moved, Liming Daohong arranged it to report, so he hurried to the market, and everyone shook hands to celebrate, firecrackers blared, children gathered to raise fire, and some drummed on copper pots to make noise; national flags, large and small, were in the millions, and towards the dawn they were gradually bright and colorful. Several women also beat instruments to help make noise, and some wore paper on their heads and jumped and shouted; colored paper fell like snowflakes, the market town was in front of each other and thunderously, and the road was blocked, and many broken utensils were dragged at the end of the car, making the ground sound. This is what I saw in the morning.

In the afternoon, I took a leave of absence from class and went out with Daohong, but I couldn't find a house. At two o'clock, it began to rain, and by the time it stopped, it was already crowded. There were no men or women at home, and everyone, young and old, went out to watch the meeting. Shoulders were crowded together, like the initial surge of the tide. After that, the guards cleared the way, and public and private groups came in sequence, all ten thousand people, I can't remember; the main ones were the army, the police, the students, the Women's Red Cross, the Relief National Bank, the factory, and even the black slaves, and the Qiao dressed as Indians. Generally, they all competed to show off, thinking it was colorful; uniforms and holding flags were common, and those who were handsome cut paper to make decorations or painted their faces; not only the children were like this, but also the gentry and officials were so playful. There were also those who imitated the German Emperor's war crimes, and falsely called it, and shouted to express the joy of victory and to wish for peace. They blew panpipes and drums to harmonize with the music and songs. The old man with white hair and beard also put on colorful streamers to make fun, and the lame man walked limping, completely forgetting his suffering. The young women all wore their hair loose and danced like demons, doing their best to be charming, and the long procession continued for two miles. At that time, heaven and earth opened up, and the wind and clouds cleared, to frolic and comfort the sincere and brave patriotic spirit. Alas! The eternal lessons of the demons and the infinite boundaries of democracy, the blood of the soldiers will not be in vain!

Jingzhong: (Pulls up a chair and sits down.)

Female A: Mr. Zheng, you have really done a boundless deed of merit. Mr. He and Mrs. He only have this one precious daughter (pointing at Xiuzhen). If you hadn't brought Xiuzhen back to them, they wouldn't know how to live their lives!

Jingye: Things in the world are really coincidental. If it weren't for my sister-in-law accidentally seeing the advertisement in the newspaper, we wouldn't have been able to know where Mrs. He and the others were.

Male A: That's true. I read the newspaper every day, but I didn't see their advertisement.

(Just at that time. He Qi - He Qi is now forty-two or forty-three years old - suddenly ran into the living room, carrying a small suitcase in his hand.)

He Qi: Hello! You're all here! (Jingye had already seen He Qi clearly, but He Qi had not yet noticed her; Jingye immediately stood up and turned around to look at the paintings on the wall, and He Qi had not yet seen his daughter.) Canyun, where's Xiuzhen? Your telegram wasn't lying to me, was it? (At this moment, Xiuzhen is in a corner of the living room. Male guest B is hiding Xiuzhen with his body. Xiuzhen is secretly looking at He Qi behind him.) (To be continued)

### Only After the Cold Season Do We Know the Pine and Cypress Are Last to Wither

— Xiao Xiao

Why bother to compete with flowers and plants for a moment of splendor

Showing off laughter is not worthy of envy

Let it be sunshine or snow, it's the same

Steadfastly seeking purity and self-appreciation

Even without unrestrained singing

Never giving way to fearful frustration

Wind and snow may devastate active life

Facing wind and snow is precisely the forging of an unyielding soul

How many times have you endured sarcasm: ignorant of the times

Inherently difficult to encounter true numbness and stubbornness

Speculation and opportunism cannot withstand the elimination of power

Integrity and standing out from the crowd will exist for a long time beyond time

Let it be sunshine or snow, it's the same

Steadfastly happy to be pure and self-appreciative

Competing for beauty, flowers and plants will be colorful and crazy for a while

Let the wind, rain, frost, and snow still allow the pine and cypress to grow strongly

When the north wind fiercely shakes the earth

When the ice and snow drown out the songs of birds

When the severe cold locks people's thoughts

As long as you and I cannot forget to visit

Let them think that he has already died

Let them drink a glass of bitter wine around the stove

Let them sigh: When will spring come again

As long as you and I cannot forget to visit

Those prosperous and peaceful days have passed early

Let the bustling people return quickly

Today what you and I want to worship is the fighter

When others have all retreated, fallen, and died

Only he stands in the sharp north wind

Using his angular bones to resist the heavy pressure of ice and snow

### Recent World Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

Balchin's New Work

Nigel Balchin of England was a novelist who gained attention during the war. He was born in Wiltshire in 1908. He has written several novels: "No Sky" (1933), "Simple Life" (1934), "Income and Outcome" (1936), "Darkness Falls from the Alr" (1942), "The Small Back Room" (1943), and so on.

But recently he wrote a play, "Lord, I Was Afraid." This is a difficult task. He tried to summarize the life, thoughts, and successes of the entire British era, showing how it went into the world, and explaining its process and end. This is a long script, and it can also be said to be a biographical depiction of the era. He has a first-class mind, is honest, and has very clear observations. The era he wrote about is the era when he was born in 1908, and he used seven different characters to represent it. They came out of school, went through wars, and opposed Hitler. They have the advantages and disadvantages of the era.

The author uses a high degree of imagination to write about the experiences of these seven people through allegorical scenes. This script is almost like poetry. The characters made sacrifices for concepts, almost like puppets, not like living people, but the concepts are very enthusiastic and clear, not only like being illuminated under a microscope, but also like being burned. The script also shines with the brilliance of "wit," with a bit of "irony."

Henry Reed once made some criticisms of Balchin's works in "The Novel Since 1939." He said that war is a nightmare, and reading war novels is just sharing nightmares, but Balchin's novels are not like that. His "Darkness Falls from the Alr" and "The Small Back Room" were both written in the National Service Office during the war. He has the ability to control many characters, the structure is tight, and the dialogue is natural. "The Small Back Room" is the most popular, writing about researchers in a scientific war research laboratory arguing and jealous over trivial matters, resulting in failure, and also writing about their desire to break the secret of the German fool's trap. He wrote it in a tense, interesting, and moving way, but unfortunately it is not original and has no future. But later he wrote "Mine own Executioner" (1945), which did not have this shortcoming. He used all dialogue to say that a psychoanalyst not only faces the difficult problems of patients, but also cannot cure his own failed love.

English Translation of Chinese Literature

I have previously introduced the English translation of Fan Chengda's poems. Recently, I learned that Lin Yutang has written a biography of Su Dongpo, called "The Gay Genius." Su Shi was four hundred years earlier than Da Vinci and seven hundred years earlier than Franklin. This book aroused the interest of Americans, even the most trivial descriptions are included, such as: Su Dongpo snoring, combing his hair a hundred times every morning, using a bamboo brush made of rat bristles to paint, his friends and enemies, his love affair with Chao Yun, and so on.

We know that Giles has translated "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." Now we know that Rose Quong has also newly translated "Chinese Ghost and Love Stories." People who have always compiled "World Short Story Selections" only knew that Liao Zhai was the representative of Chinese short stories, but before and after the victory, Chinese new literature introduced more of the past. A recently published "World Short Story Selection" has taken Lu Xun, Lin Yutang, and others as representatives of Chinese novels. Naturally, there is still a bit of estrangement here, because Lin Yutang does not write short stories very much. He only occasionally writes novels in English. He writes almost only essays in Chinese.

Robert Payne of England selected and translated a "Contemporary Chinese Poetry," which includes Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, He Qifang, Feng Zhi, Bian Zhilin, Zang Kejia, and Tian Jian. Each poet is also attached with a brief biography. Payne had lived in China for many years.

Occasionally flipping through "China of Tomorrow," Volume 4, I learned that Cranmer Bying published "Three Hundred Poems of the Tang Dynasty" in the Oriental Wisdom Series.

Arthur Waley selected and translated a "Chinese Poems," most of which are his old translations, and a small part are new translations. It is from about the tenth century to the seventeenth century.

Payne also co-translated "Chinese Short Stories" with Yuan ChiaHua, which includes works by Lao She, Yang Zhensheng, Shi Zhicun, Shen Congwen, Zhang Tianyi, and Duanmu Hongliang. The preface mentions the Western influence they received, and also includes biographies of each writer, but the reviewer said that these authors' works have good skills and touching power, and they really have their own characteristics.

### A Record of Plum Blossom Viewing at Chao Mountain

— Huang Yanpei

In February of the 37th year of the Republic of China, during the Lantern Festival of the old lunar calendar, Hu, Wang, and the other gentlemen agreed to go to Hangzhou to see the plum blossoms at Chao Mountain. There were eight people in total. They arrived in Hangzhou on that day and first visited Gushan, as the introduction to this short essay. The sparse few plum trees on Gushan were not enough to encourage our interest in traveling. The next morning, we hired a large car, and learned that there were fifty kilometers from Hangzhou to Chao Mountain, heading northeast, out of Hangzhou city, following the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, along Hangzhou Bay, about thirty kilometers, to Qiaosi Station, turning left, and entering the Hangtang Highway. Here, looking west, it leads directly to Tanglou. The terrain gradually changes from plains to "sparse mountainous land" (I have been walking in this area for a long time. I call all mountains that are separated and where the plains are more than the mountainous land as "sparse mountainous land"; if the mountainous land is more than the plains, I call it "dense mountainous land"). We stopped the car at the foot of the mountain six li away from Tanglou (according to the locals). The mountain forms two wings. Walking less than a few dozen steps, there is a sea of ​​plum blossoms, some white, some red, some green, and most of them white. In the middle is an old plum tree, surrounded by a short fence. Two branches extend diagonally, one of which is dead, and one branch is divided into upper and lower branches. The flowers are white and in full bloom. Judging from the bark and bones, it shows a very old age. A wooden sign next to the tree is labeled Song Plum. The petals also have five petals, the same as ordinary ones, but the posture is simple and lovely. Those traveling with us took photos of each other under it.

Next to the vast plum field, there is a pavilion called Song Plum Pavilion, built by Zhou Mengpo in the autumn of the third year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Wuchang Uprising was about to break out, and the people in the mountains probably did not know it. The plum field is behind the Bao'en Temple, and it is the property of the temple. Entering the temple, there are inscriptions by Lin Qin'nan and poems by Kang Youwei on the walls, all about magnifying the Song Plum. I felt that they did not scratch the itch. After asking the locals in detail, I learned that the mountains in this area, close to Tanglou, are all suitable for fruit trees. Tangqi is originally famous for producing sugarcane, and it is said to be the most affluent area in Zhejiang Province. Even in terms of plums, the temple has two hundred plum trees, each of which can harvest fifty catties of plums. In good years, it can harvest more than one hundred dan, which are made into candied plums, half plums, and windy and rainy plums. They can all get high prices in the market. I don't know when the planting of fruit trees in this area began, but since it is suitable for the soil, it must have been very long ago. The monks in the temple even casually pointed to a tree in the courtyard as Tang Plum, but it was not mentioned by the famous scholars, so how could we know that the so-called Song Plum was not casually pointed out by the monks in the temple many years ago? The ancient Tang Plum in Santai, Sichuan, is also unknown based on what, and I am afraid it is similar to this. Monk Hongxiu in the temple asked me to write a poem, so I wrote a seven-character ancient poem.

I once viewed the ancient Tang Plum in Santai, and only today did I come to Chao Mountain, which I have known for a long time. The clear sky wants to be dizzy with a sheet of snow, the single branch is old but still in bloom. This mountain is suitable for plums and the soil is special, and the mountain people make a living and are free from hunger. One or two remain from eight or nine hundred years ago, making tourists think of the Zhao Song dynasty. The Tang Plum and Song Plum have become rare, and the six-petal shape of the legend is gradually becoming non-existent. This flower is simple and ancient and has been saturated with mulberry fields and seas, and outside the mountain today there is a clamor of gold and copper.

Based on my reasoning, the soil is suitable for fruit trees, and the mountain people mostly rely on fruit trees for a living (not only sugarcane and plums, but other fruits are also suitable). This custom must have been passed down from ancient times. I do not doubt that there were no plum blossoms in this area during the Song Dynasty, but I dare not believe that the plum tree labeled Song Plum is definitely a product of the Song Dynasty. After finishing the meal in the temple, we took sedan chairs to visit the Haiyun Cave of the Qianyuan Temple, circling around the mountain from west to south to east. Along the hillside were all plum fields, walking in the winding tens of thousands of flowers, to Baimao Slope, when a guest suddenly shouted loudly that a six-petal plum had been discovered. Sure enough, there were not only six petals, but also seven petals and eight petals. It was definitely single-petal, not double-layered. My nose also told me that I had smelled enough, so I took advantage of the sun before it went down the mountain and returned.

On the third day, we drank tea at the Sizhao Building of the Xiling Seal Society, and suddenly discovered six-petal plums under the Yangxian Pavilion again.

Those who traveled with me were Hu Juewen, Shen Fangcheng, Wang Youben, Zou Kang, Zheng Lingyu, Yao Weijun, and Huang Dangshi.

### New Year's Riddle Guessing

— Sheng Juncai

Two days after the Lantern Festival, as the lights were lit, the auditorium of the Bank of China on the Bund of this city had a unique gathering. It was hosted by the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Friendship Association, and attended by five or six hundred male and female members of the association. The program included Cantonese music, drama, harmonica, dance, and singing, as well as a riddle guessing game sponsored by the Banking and Money Industry Newspaper, which was the most distinctive. In advance, the newspaper invited several experienced riddle makers to make literary riddles for the members to guess, and prepared gifts to add to the fun. It happened to be raining that day, and the writer went there by invitation. I saw dozens of riddles written in red and green paper banners hanging high in front of the "riddle increase," a dazzling array that was pleasing to the eye. The writer toured around and only guessed two riddles: one said "traffic lights," guessing a name from the Three Kingdoms, the answer being "Guan Lu"; the other said "sea," guessing a banking and money industry term, the answer being "exchange rate." In addition, there was a riddle that said "the whole family is in the west wind," guessing two solar terms. The writer wrote "White Dew" and "Lesser Cold," but the revealed answer was "Greater Cold" and "Lesser Cold." The riddle used the words "greater" and "lesser" to highlight the whole family. The writer only thought about the four words "in the west wind," so it was appropriate that only half of it was correct. There was also a riddle that said "two horses assist the father," guessing the name of a store in this city. The writer racked his brains but couldn't figure it out, so I tried to guess "Ma Dunhe" (teaching and making peace is interpreted as encouraging harmony), who knew the answer was "Fengliaoxing." The other riddles were also quite wonderful. Here are a few excerpts from my memory for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts: (1) Paper, ink, brush, and inkstone (guessing a character) sell; (2) Never in pairs at night (guessing a banking and money industry term, word splitting) many singles; (3) Perhaps (guessing the name of a bank, curtain roll style) China; (4) Having a receipt but no conscience (guessing a character) silver; (5) Repeatedly declining (guessing a name from the Three Kingdoms) Lu Xun; (6) One person above, ten people below, two villains embracing left and right (guessing the name of a bank) Da Lai; (7) First write a stroke, then write a horizontal line (guessing a character) pregnant; (8) Banishing the husband outside the door (guessing a place name) Niangziguan; (9) Model Village (guessing a place name) Liangxiang; (10) Saying good things (guessing a character) who; (11) Precious youth (guessing two lines of a Song poem) Mo Di idly wasted his youthful head; (12) If you want to deepen your skills, grind an iron pestle into a needle (guessing the name of a bank) Hengli.

### A Genuine Writer

— Fang Zheng

An American novelist is known for his serious and genuine writing attitude. He always personally experiments with any plot before writing it. Once, in order to describe the feeling of starving to death, he imitated Gandhi and fasted for several days, almost starving to death. One day, he suddenly pondered for a whole day, restless, and ended up shooting himself. His wife examined his unfinished posthumous works and found that the last paragraph was written like this: "The emperor just got out of the car, and suddenly, a bullet pierced his head."

### "School Shop"? "School Temple"?

— Yu Jianhua

Today, people mostly regard schools as school shops, thinking that school authorities only know how to collect tuition fees to fill their own pockets, and their behavior is quite similar to that of immoral merchants, so they are called school shops, and the principals are school shop owners, and schools are places to sell knowledge, not institutions for educating young people. In many schools in big cities, there are inevitably bad behaviors of "seeking profit at the expense of capital" or "misleading young people," and being called shops seems to be their own fault.

Now commerce has the distinction between private, provincial, and state-run, and school shops are no exception, so there are also private, provincial (municipal), and national distinctions. However, people generally call schools school shops, and the purpose is entirely to satirize and condemn the school authorities. In my opinion, if our schools really become genuine and valuable school shops, the results would not be bad. The seriousness of the current situation and the pessimism of the phenomenon lie not in the fact that schools are "school shops," but in the fact that schools are "school temples"!

If it is said that schools are school shops and principals are shopkeepers, then faculty and staff are partners, knowledge is goods, and who are the customers? Naturally, it is the students. In general business situations, employers always want to get a bargain and buy more, and there is absolutely no one who takes money and doesn't buy anything, nor is there anyone who is willing to take more money and buy less. If students are customers, they should want to pay less tuition and get more knowledge. They should not just pay tuition and not want knowledge, or pay more tuition and want less knowledge. Students must have the courage to buy vegetables in the vegetable market, weighing them and then pulling a handful. They must have the courage to buy cloth in the cloth shop, measuring it and then letting go of half a foot. If the goods are not suitable, they must be exchanged. If the goods are insufficient, they must be added. I think if students are really like customers, rushing to be the first, or fighting for more and measuring less, and not relaxing a little about knowledge and not being willing to suffer a loss at all, then the school is a "school shop," and "trading and retreating, each getting what they want," may not be a very reasonable method.

Unfortunately, although schools are now school shops, students are not customers. Parents beg with thousands of words to pay tuition for them, but these young masters and misses are unwilling to study hard. Many people not only don't know the quality of the goods, but often regard inferior goods as treasures, and even don't want any goods at all. When the teacher forces them to take a little, they are very annoyed. Hearing that school is on vacation or the teacher is on leave, there is no class that does not cheer. They never think that vacations and leaves are a loss to the students. Not only that, but they also take leave on their own initiative, talk during class time, read novels, write love letters, play poker, and even strike. Just imagine that there are actually customers in the world who only pay money but are unwilling to take the goods. Isn't it a big joke—isn't it a big fool? Today, this kind of joke and this kind of fool can really be picked up everywhere and are everywhere. This is many times higher than the gentlemen in the Gentleman Country in Flowers in the Mirror.

People generally regard schools as school shops, but I think students regard schools as school temples. A temple is the most solemn and magnificent place in a temple. The principal is the abbot, the staff are ordinary monks, and the teachers are monks who can chant scriptures. Students are pilgrims. The pilgrims carry the book bags of "pilgrimage to the mountain and offering incense," put a handful of incense money into the money box of "returning all good to the same place," listen to the monks "chanting," some even want to get a good fortune stick that will bring good luck in everything, and some just play around in the Buddhist hall for a while, look at the clay statues of the Bodhisattvas, and smell the scent of incense candles, returning empty-handed without gaining anything. Paying tuition is considered almsgiving, registering is like joining the fate book, paying miscellaneous fees is like burning incense candles, listening to chanting is like attending classes, and a good, medium, or bad fortune stick is the report card. Apart from this, there is nothing else. When I was young, I played in small temples, and when I grew up, I played in big temples. If I had more money, I could also go to foreign churches to play. The only wish of burning incense is to hope that the Bodhisattva will bless me and that there will be great benefits in the future. The only wish of entering school is to hope that having a diploma will bring great benefits. Since I hope there will be benefits in the future, I must be generous in almsgiving now. Perhaps the more generous I am now, the greater the hope for the future. "If you want to take it, you must first give it." Why bother so much about immediate gains and losses? Naturally, I cannot learn the "penny-pinching" commercial behavior.

I am an old partner in a school shop for more than thirty years. Do you say that I should like to see customers who only take money and don't want goods, or should I be sad? Should I still stick to my post and force the goods to customers who are unwilling to take the goods? Or should I be smarter and learn from the monks who "chant," so that "everything is empty" and "all three thousand disciples are happy"?

### Random Talk on Using a Brush

— Wang Baili

Chu Henan asked Yu Yongxing: "How does my calligraphy compare to Ouyang Xun?" Yongxing said: "Xun's use of the brush, whether good or bad, is handy, but you don't seem to be able to." Xian Ganbo wrote after the preface to the Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley: "It is very difficult to travel without a good brush. Although I reluctantly finished writing, I have changed the brush three times." (The general meaning is like this) It can be seen that the calligrapher's use of the brush is like a warrior's use of weapons, and those who are good at swords may not be good at guns. Wei Furen's Notes on the Brush Formation says: "The brush should be made of rabbit hair from the high mountains and steep peaks, harvested in August and September. The brush head should be one inch long, and the handle should be five inches long. It is best to have a sharp and strong point." Su Dongpo used Coptis chinensis soup to mix with blue powder to dip the brush, and dried it before putting it away. Huang Shangu used Sichuan pepper soup to grind pine smoke to dye the brush and store it. Zhao Songxue, when he encountered a brush that was smooth and satisfactory, would cut it open, take out its fine hairs, and store them separately. He would gather the essence of three brushes and have the workers bind them into one brush, so that both regular and cursive script, large and small, would be impossible. Liu Shi'an broke the new brush, selected the fine hairs himself, re-bundled them purely, and did not hand them over to the workers. The ancients were so careful about using brushes.

During the Song Dynasty, there were chicken heart brushes, baby hair brushes, orangutan hair brushes, rat tail brushes, and wolf hair brushes. During the Qing Dynasty, there were even more sable hair brushes. In the late Ming Dynasty, Mr. Chen Baisha used reeds to make them, named Mao Long brushes. The ones made by Jie Yuanzhai in Guangzhou City today are very famous. I wrote with one by chance at Mr. Ma Gongyu's place, and I felt that it was quite smooth and satisfactory.

### About Lin Daqin

— Xue Yun

Reading Zheng Guoyi's article in Free Talk on February 24, which records Lin Daqin's ignorance of historical sites, saying that Lin made a record of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock and misused the affairs of Niu and Li, is not true, because what Mr. Zheng saw was not the original work. According to Lin Daqin, whose courtesy name is Jingfu, was from Haiyang, Chaozhou (now Chao'an). He was the number one scholar in the Ming Jiajing Xinmao examination, and the champion in the Ren Chen examination, and was awarded the title of editor, at the age of twenty, and was not yet married. When he was about to be appointed to an official position, he suddenly resigned and shared his ideas with Wang Longxi and Luo Nian'an. His noble character shone on Lingnan. There is a collection of the Eastern Pu Mr. set published. (Ruan Yuntai's Guangdong General History has a biography) There are now two records of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock, both of which are said to be made in the Renyin year. The one using the affairs of Niu and Li has more than 600 characters. According to the Dongpu Collection, there is another record of the reconstruction of Baoyun Rock, which has only more than 400 characters and does not involve the affairs of Niu and Li. At the end, it says: "I will one day resign from office and return to my hometown, and I will be able to spend my days and nights there with my colleagues, forgetting my old age. This is also something that I will do to continue the work of my ancestors." This can be determined to be written before Mr. Lin retired. The one that Mr. Zheng saw was a forgery by later generations, and the publisher mistakenly included it, because there were no two at the same time. There is an essay on the party of Niu and Li in the Collection, listing historical events of the Han and Song dynasties to discuss Niu and Li, and saying: "In the end, the great power of the court fell into the hands of the eunuchs, and the disaster of usurpation and killing was written in the books." He seemed to have foreseen the eunuch disaster in the Ming Dynasty. How could such a person not know about the affairs of Niu and Li? Mr. Zheng grew up in Shanghai, so it is appropriate that he did not see the whole picture. (Que Chou)

### Illness

— Nianhong

A relative contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. Although there is no specific medicine that can take effect immediately or be cured in three days, it is not necessarily impossible to save. As long as the treatment is appropriate, attention is paid to nutrition, environment, and mood, it is not difficult to regain health in a year or so. Although my relative's family is not rich, they can always get by. Unfortunately, he lacks scientific medical common sense and has no decisiveness, so he procrastinates and delays treatment, concealing his illness and avoiding doctors. The condition is getting worse every day. I have thought this more than once, and have also told him this euphemistically, but as soon as he hears someone mention his illness, he feels sad and unhappy, so I dare not say more. Moreover, the relationship between us is not very close. We rarely meet, and when we do, we just exchange a few polite greetings and that's it.

He himself understands that he has pulmonary disease, but although he often consults doctors, when the doctor tells him what to do, such as returning to his hometown, opening his ribs, getting injections, and artificial pneumothorax, he does not seem to believe that he really has pulmonary disease, and begins to doubt the X-ray image. The symptoms of pulmonary disease are numerous, sometimes coughing, sometimes headache, sometimes weakness in the waist and legs, sometimes fever and night sweats, and sometimes poor appetite. Although he does not follow the doctor's advice to rest for a long time, he troubles the doctor whenever he feels uncomfortable. When he coughs, he likes to take cough syrup, and when he has a headache, he swallows aspirin at will. But after taking cough syrup, the cough is better, but the head hurts again. After swallowing a few aspirin, the head seems to be no longer hurting, but the waist and legs feel sore and weak. This cycle continues. Every time I go to his house, the bedside is full of medicine bottles and jars, but the illness still does not improve. Not only does it not improve, but it becomes more serious.

I once had such an experience. The lid of one of my small old wooden boxes for storing books was broken, so I took a hammer and a few nails to repair it myself. It seemed easy, and it would be fine if I nailed it firmly, but when one corner was nailed firmly, the other corner popped up. When I nailed the other corner firmly, the first corner bounced up again. This went on and on, and I was exhausted. It turned out that the lid had been soaked in water, so the wood was uneven. In the end, I asked a carpenter to replace it with a new one.

Some people say how corrupt the current education system is, some say how despicable the current officialdom is, some say how dangerous the current economic situation is, and some say how bad the current people's hearts are... and some people put forward specific proposals on how to reform education, basic methods on how to clarify officialdom, perfect suggestions on how to rectify the economy, and majestic papers on how to restore social customs; but these are just symptoms like coughing, headache, weakness in the waist and legs, fever and night sweats, and poor appetite; and what is used are just proprietary medicines like cough syrup and aspirin. If one is cured, the other cannot be cured; and if this one is cured, the other cannot be cured. In fact, even the root cannot be eradicated, but only slightly alleviates some of the disease.

I recently heard that my relative is in bed with a "cold," headache, and fever. It seems that the "cold" will get better in a week or half a month, but his health will never recover, because he cannot start from the root and from the bottom. If he is willing to start from the bottom, although the pulmonary disease has reached the second stage, there is still hope for recovery, and it has not reached the point of "incurable" or "incurable." There are methods, and they are very common and ordinary, and the patient himself may also know them, so what is terrible is not the "disease," but the "concealment" of the disease. What is lacking is not the "medicine," but the "heart" to take the medicine. Even the best doctors cannot help but be helpless.

### Celebration

— Why Bother

Last time, a friend sent a packet of red eggs and arranged to attend the one-month celebration feast yesterday. To celebrate the friend's newborn and to satisfy my appetite, I went to gorge myself as usual. This reminded me that throughout history, regardless of location, the event of "birth" is taken very seriously. From the moment a person cries into the world, a one-month celebration is held, followed by birthdays at one year old, ten years old, twenty years old, twenty-nine years old, thirty years old... (and so on). Celebrations must be held. Some people even celebrate their birthdays every year, and even small birthdays are celebrated lavishly. Some people constantly send out red envelopes with the message "Your Humble Servant's Thirtieth Grand Celebration," taking advantage of their large following to receive a flood of gifts, which borders on business. Although some people criticize the latter as begging for money, on the other hand, it demonstrates that this person values their "birth." Time flies, how long is a person's life? Since the lost life cannot be brought back, why not celebrate? Moreover, it requires arranging a feast, so it cannot be purely considered begging for money. If it is said to be seeking a small profit, like a business, is it also following the way of loyalty and forgiveness?

Recently, it was reported that someone advocated: "Do not celebrate below sixty years old," which is admirable. Life is only a hundred years. If one sends out invitations every year below sixty, one would only do so sixty times in a lifetime. Using a limited number of years to seek a small number of celebrations is truly sad. Moreover, among the 450 million people in China, how many have the means to celebrate below sixty years old? As for those who have the means to celebrate, even with someone's loud call, I dare to guarantee that they will still ignore it and have a lively celebration behind closed doors. Therefore, someone's appeal has the spirit of "knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway." My admiration is endless, and I believe it will be approved by readers!

Buddhism considers birth, old age, sickness, and death as the four great sufferings of sentient beings, with "birth" being the first because old age, sickness, and death come after "birth." The saying "no birth, no extinction" means that. In today's terms, it means "you only live once," and humanity should respect its "birth." The secular custom of celebrating birthdays should have the meaning of cherishing it. Even failing to cherish it is the footnote to what I mentioned above, "truly sad." Listen to today's radio stations playing "Happy Birthday" songs or "Happy Birthday to You." Although people are tired of hearing it, or hang up the phone, or shout loudly into the phone, some people still request it, and some people still enjoy listening to it. It is nothing more than everyone valuing their lives and having a longing and attachment to their own birthdays.

Today's celebrities mostly have a desire to protect their reputation. When celebrating grandly, they must donate money to help education and relieve refugees. Since the country cannot save the poor, benefiting the lonely and needy through celebrities' celebrations is truly killing several birds with one stone. As for ordinary people's birthdays, eating a few longevity noodles is enough. Originally, they had to eat, but it's just a substitute, presumably related to frugality and has nothing to do with prohibitions. Therefore, if I were the someone mentioned above, I would say: Celebrations are allowed below sixty!

### Strange Pledges

— No Fault

We always thought that the nature of banking business is relatively... but strange things still happen. According to the American Bank, the bank recently received three batches of applications for pledges one after another, and the collateral was: (1) a cart of dried flies; (2) a boat of horse tails; (3) a batch of used dentures. According to the applicant, the flies are for feeding birds, and the hair on the horse tails is used for the sights of guns and cannons. They can be used as the intersecting fine lines on the sight. But, what are the used dentures for? No one can figure it out!

As a result, none of the three pledges were successful. The bank's response was "the collateral is not widely marketable," therefore, they could not agree.

Chapter 11 Suspicion Reappears (86)

Little Wang's mother said, "The boss has already angered Mr. Xu away, what are you still crying for!" Qiwan cried for a while before raising her head and asking, "Mr. Xu left, did he say anything?" Little Wang's mother said, "He didn't say anything, I asked him to come tomorrow, but he didn't agree." Qiwan was clever and cried again on the bed. Little Wang's mother said, "Boss! If you have any grievances in your heart, why not tell Mr. Xu directly and frankly, so as to avoid misunderstandings between you two? Things will be clear once you talk about them." Qiwan shook her head and said, "You don't know, how can I tell Mr. Xu! Let him be angry, I want him to be angry!" Little Wang's mother said, "Boss, aren't you and Mr. Xu very close? Why are you so at odds? I think..." Little Wang's mother was just saying this when they heard a burst of doorbell ringing outside, the sound was very urgent. Qiwan said, "Wang Ma, don't say anymore, go out and see who it is." Little Wang's mother hurried downstairs and ran back upstairs, reporting, "Director Miao is here." Qiwan was anxious and said, "I'm so disheveled, like a ghost, how can I see him! Wang Ma, you hurry out and ask him to sit in the living room first, I'll be there soon." Qiwan sent Little Wang's mother out, hurriedly got out of bed, locked the door first, walked to the dressing table, hurriedly wiped her face, just combed her hair, and was about to reapply makeup when she heard the door being knocked loudly, very urgently, thinking it must be Zhongjie knocking outside, hurriedly patted her face twice with a powder puff, pulled her pajamas, looked in the mirror, and then went over to open the door. Zhongjie squeezed in at once, first looking around, as if looking for someone, then staring at Qiwan, and said with a cold smile, "Sleeping with the door closed in broad daylight, are you afraid of a robber coming in?" Qiwan saw that he was talking impolitely, with an unwilling expression on his face. If it were normal times, with her stubborn temper, she would have chased him out with a few words. Because she needs to use him now, she cannot but try to please him, first patted him on the broad shoulder, and said charmingly with a smile, "That's right, I'm afraid of robbers, afraid of you, the robber, breaking in!" Zhongjie frowned and said, "I'm not kidding with you, I have something to ask you!" Saying that, he pushed Qiwan away.

### Caring for Helpless and Impoverished Compatriots - Hoping for Donations from Enthusiastic Philanthropists for Relief

The twentieth application for the Qingxin Relief Fund, sponsored by this newspaper, will be reviewed on the 6th of this month. There is still a surplus of funds available. Impoverished compatriots who are lonely, unable to make a living, poor and sick, and unable to afford medical treatment can provide detailed information about their background and family circumstances, certified by the head of the field or baozhang, and find a guarantor, then register and send it to this department for review. Those who are found to be true after investigation will be given a living allowance. Due to currency values, this relief fund has been experiencing a shortage of funds in recent months. It is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously so that this good deed will not be interrupted, and helpless and impoverished compatriots will receive unexpected relief, which is a truly good thing.
