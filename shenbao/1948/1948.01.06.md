### Soviet Union Concerned About Peace Conference with Japan; Observer Analyzes that Future Development of Soviet Response to Our Note Depends on Sino-U.S. Attitudes

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's reply to our note of the 5th of last month regarding the proposal for a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan was delivered to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Soviet Embassy in China on the evening of the 2nd of this month. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to announce the official attitude it might take to deal with the stalemate in the future. According to analysis by related parties, there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the preparation work for the peace treaty. In this reply, the Soviet Union did not mention the retention of veto power during the voting at the conference, which clearly still maintains a consistent attitude with our country. It also considered the other countries outside the four major powers, and adopted the method of establishing a small committee to recruit countries to participate, as agreed upon by the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. This proposal shows that the Soviet Union is not completely indifferent to the convening of the peace conference. The future development will still depend on our country's efforts and the United States' patience.

### Former Members of the Democratic League and Others Criticize Feng Yuxiang

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] General Feng Yuxiang went to the United States in the capacity of an official inspection group and publicly attacked the Chinese government. Five Chinese people here, who are by no means "sympathetic to the Kuomintang," have strongly criticized this.

A United Press reporter raised this question to seven Chinese people with prominent anti-Kuomintang views. Among them, everyone condemned Feng, one person refused to comment, and the remaining one defended the "Christian General."

Among the seven people, two were university professors, two were university students, two were professional people, and one was a businessman. One university student, claiming to be by no means pro-communist, believed that in a democratic government, government officials, whether at home or abroad, have the right to speak freely, so he believed that Feng's actions were not inappropriate. One of the professors said that he "neither condemned nor approved" of Feng's anti-Kuomintang speeches and articles.

The other five people, including two former members of the Democratic League and three others who strongly criticized the Kuomintang, unanimously condemned Feng for "lacking patriotism." Everyone believed that Feng lacked personal ethics because he used his inspection group status to attack the government in a foreign country.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th] The Chinese Democratic League held its third plenary session here today and issued a statement denying that the Chinese government's declaration of the Democratic League as illegal was legitimate. It stated: "The order has not been approved by the State Council, nor has it been announced by the Executive Yuan. We will still strive for China's democracy, peace, and unity." The meeting is chaired by Shen Junru and is scheduled to close on the 9th.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] After the Hankou Financial Management Bureau ordered a crackdown on illegal private banks, today is the day to start implementing the suspension of operations and liquidation.

### Food Department Drafts Plans for the Five Cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, Which Can Be Completed Within This Week

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Food is currently drafting a plan for the food supply and demand for the expanded rationing in the five cities of Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, which may be completed within this week and sent to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be announced and implemented. According to sources from the Ministry of Food, the implementation of this rationing method may be delayed until February. According to the investigation and statistics of the Ministry of Food, the total amount of food required by all civil servants, students, professional, industrial, and transport workers, charitable organizations, and newspaper employees in the five cities is 460,000 shi of rice and 500,000 bags of flour per month. Calculated on an annual basis, the total amount of food required will reach more than 550,000 tons, which is beyond the reach of the food currently controlled by the government. In the plan, relief supplies from the United States will account for 50%, and the original public education rations will also be used to supplement it, but it is still insufficient, amounting to about 250,000 shi. The Ministry of Food plans to ask the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of funds by the Ministry of Finance to purchase the shortfall of food, either domestically or abroad. The Ministry of Food is very cautious about this and decided to start processing only after the source of food for the whole year is secured, so as not to be interrupted midway due to various reasons.

### Kuomintang's Weekly Memorial Service for Sun Yat-sen; President Chiang Instructs Party Affairs; The Most Urgent Task This Year is the General Registration of Party Members

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Headquarters held the first weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen of the 37th year of the Republic of China on the morning of the 5th. President Chiang led the ceremony, and after performing the ceremony as usual, he delivered a speech on the spot, making a general review of the party affairs work in the past year and giving a brief instruction on the central work of the party affairs this year. The gist of the original words is as follows: "The greatest achievement of the party affairs work in the past year is the completion of the election of representatives to the National Assembly, because convening the National Assembly to implement constitutional government and return power to the people is the consistent goal of our party's revolution. Comrades in party affairs work in various places have worked hard and diligently, making concerted efforts to complete the election work as scheduled. It is a major event in the process of our party's revolution and the most glorious contribution of our party affairs work comrades to the country. The second is the completion of the unified organization of the party and the group. In January last year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of our party decided to unify the party and group organizations in order to concentrate the strength of the party. All comrades of our party can understand the overall situation and the overall situation. In order to implement the party's decision, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their personal rights and status. This is a concrete manifestation of the revolutionary spirit and is very gratifying. In terms of party affairs this year, the most urgent work is to complete the general registration of party members. Party affairs workers in various places must strictly implement the decisions of the central government, work hard and diligently, break through favoritism, eliminate wavering elements, and absorb excellent party members to rectify the revolutionary ranks and enrich the revolutionary forces. As for the party headquarters itself, it is especially necessary to strive to improve the spirit of work and to strengthen it, and to establish the spirit of "new," "fast," and "real" work, strive for excellence, and seek truth from facts, so as to cooperate with politics and military affairs to thoroughly complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

Elected National Representatives Petition the Central Standing Committee, Requesting Various Points Without Approval

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The National Representative Signed Nomination Candidates Association again sent representatives such as Ma Wenche to petition the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee regular meeting on the morning of the 5th, requesting the revocation of the implementation measures for the supplementary regulations for party nominations passed by the State Council, the party member concession measures, and the election headquarters to promptly announce the list of elected candidates and issue election certificates.

Number of Members of Anhui Reporters Association; The Newspaper Association Department Often Adds a Zero When Writing; Rumors of Blank Ballots are Not True

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The number of members of the Anhui Reporters Association reached more than 6,000 in the newspaper association department. Therefore, during the previous National Congress election, some candidates who participated in the election rushed to Anhui to campaign. When they arrived in Anhui, they learned that the actual number was only over 1,000. As for the widespread rumors of 5,000 blank votes, the reporter recently visited the Workers and Women Election Headquarters to inquire about the handling of these 5,000 blank votes. Chief Secretary Zhai said that he had also heard of 6,000 members before, but because it seemed doubtful compared to the number of members in other places, he immediately telegraphed the Anhui election office to inquire. He has now received a reply from Anhui, informing him that the actual number is 1,059, and the total number of votes cast during the National Congress election is also less than 1,000, so there are no blank votes. The rumors are actually a mistake in previous rumors. According to another reporter's investigation, the mistake of 6,000 lies in the fact that there are more than 500 members of the Revolutionary County Reporters Association in Anhui Province. Due to carelessness when reporting, a zero was added after the number, resulting in more than 5,000, so this error was caused. In fact, there are no 5,000 blank votes.

Food Supply in Nanjing and Shanghai is Abundant; Price Hikes Will Soon Fall Back; Remarks by Senior Officials of the Ministry of Food

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The New Year has just passed, and prices in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas have risen sharply. The reporter specifically visited senior officials of the Ministry of Food to inquire whether effective measures will be taken. They said: "The food supply in Nanjing and Shanghai is not lacking, and the government can control a lot of food. This price hike may be related to the issuance of large bills, and it will definitely fall back in the short term." The reporter also asked about the supply of military food and the composition of requisitioned grain. They replied: "The military food is adequately planned and there is no shortage. The requisitioning is expected to reach 70% by the end of the 36th year of the Republic of China, which is quite optimistic. The issues that the Ministry of Food is considering and researching are still the circulation of food. The Ministry of Food previously sent Deputy Minister Chen Liang and Tian Fu Department Director Zhang Daoming to Wuhan to supervise the requisitioning. They are now studying on-site the method of transporting grain from Central China to North China. In this way, there will be no uneven phenomenon of food greed. At the same time, after overall planning, the Ministry of Food can decide to purchase foreign rice from abroad, and it is reported that some people have suggested that the government ask the American Aid to China Association to allocate funds from its unused Aid to China Relief Fund to purchase grain, but this has not yet been decided by the government.

### After the Partial Implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement

The Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement has been officially announced and implemented as of yesterday. Consultations on this agreement began in July of last year, and it was signed on the 15th of the following month. It was originally scheduled to be announced simultaneously by both parties on August 18th. However, on the 17th, our country promulgated new foreign exchange control measures, using the devaluation of the legal tender to compete for foreign exchange. Hong Kong, therefore, hesitated and repeatedly delayed the implementation. Towards the end of September, the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, visited the capital for discussions, and negotiations were revived. Concrete results were repeatedly reported, and the date of implementation was repeatedly announced. However, apart from Hong Kong's promulgation of new regulations on Hong Kong goods sailing to Chinese ports in early November, stipulating that they would take effect from the 5th of that month, there was no other progress. Therefore, there was much speculation outside, and it was almost assumed that the agreement had been declared stillborn.

The Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement implemented yesterday is only a portion of the original agreement, which was approved by the Governor of Hong Kong in Beijing and implemented first. There are two main points: first, major export goods from our country, such as tungsten, tung oil, rapeseed oil, pig bristles, and cotton yarn, when transported to Hong Kong for transshipment, must prove that the foreign exchange earned has been sold to or is contracted to be sold to designated Chinese banks; second, Hong Kong prohibits the import and export of more than five million legal tender in cash. Although the agreement also stipulates that the bills of lading of all vessels sailing from Hong Kong to China must be stamped by the Hong Kong government, this measure has already been implemented since November 5th of last year, and this is simply a restatement, so in effect only the above two items are new.

However, we cannot underestimate the value of the partial implementation of this agreement. Because for local goods transported to Hong Kong, the foreign exchange earned must be proven to have been sold to or will be sold to designated Chinese banks; this measure will undoubtedly increase our country's foreign exchange income and reduce the amount of smuggling of local goods. The restriction on the import and export of cash, and the strengthening of the management of the banking industry, will certainly be of some help to our country's measures to control finance.

However, partial implementation means that its effectiveness is also only partial. In terms of finance, there are no explicit provisions in this agreement on how to crack down on capital flight or overseas purchases. Moreover, it is estimated that the overseas remittances remaining in Hong Kong in the year before last were worth approximately 400 million Hong Kong dollars. What the figure was last year, however, is unknown. Although this amount of foreign exchange has been discussed many times, the agreement does not mention it. This is clearly far from our country's policy of absorbing overseas remittances and replenishing foreign exchange reserves. Fortunately, the agreement now being implemented is only a part, and it is hoped that in the parts to be implemented subsequently, attention will be paid to this.

In terms of goods, although the so-called "New Regulations on Hong Kong Goods Sailing to Chinese Ports" have long been implemented, Hong Kong is separated from the mainland by only a strip of water, and the coastline is intricate. There are numerous routes for smuggling, whether by land or sea. The method of simply stamping Hong Kong goods seems insufficiently thorough for combating smuggling. Moreover, according to Hong Kong's enforcement methods, the smuggled goods seized and the penalties imposed are all within Hong Kong and not within our territory. There is no clause requiring them to notify our country after discovering a ship carrying smuggled goods. Therefore, our country does not benefit much from this. The smuggled goods confiscated after punishment can still be smuggled in a second or third time. Such anti-smuggling efforts are not thorough enough.

According to initial reports, the so-called Sino-Hong Kong Agreement originally had two parts: an economic agreement and a tariff agreement. What has been announced and implemented this time is only a part of the economic agreement. As for the parts that have not been announced and implemented, because they have not been announced, it is impossible to speculate on their content. If Hong Kong can take a broad view and implement these reserved parts together in advance, it is believed that it will be of greater help in promoting Sino-Hong Kong trade and stabilizing each other's economic foundations.

As for our country, although the partial implementation this time may achieve considerable results in the competition for foreign exchange and the prevention of smuggling, it is doubtful whether the loopholes in smuggling import and export goods can be completely blocked, given the large difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market rate. We believe that the two important tasks of absorbing overseas remittances and strengthening anti-smuggling efforts still need to be emphasized and effectively improved.

The fundamental method, in addition to passive prevention and control, is to actively guide. The import-export linkage method advocated by people is still worth considering. As long as the current import controls continue to be implemented, there is no need to worry about the quantity or type of import goods after the above method is implemented; however, export trade can be promoted from then on, and export foreign exchange can be expected to have a legitimate destination. Overseas remittances and overseas gold can be expected to flow back into the country under the guise of imported foreign goods. If materials are more abundant and raw materials and machinery are supplied, then production enterprises will not gradually shrink, and the general price inflation may be slightly eased. As a result, the burden of the foreign exchange reserves required by the state will be lighter, especially for other matters. Although this has no direct relationship with the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, it has the same effect as competing for foreign exchange and preventing smuggling, so it is mentioned together.

### Zhejiang University Incident Over Public Burial of Yu Zisan

Students Clash with Rickshaw Pullers and Others

[Our Hangzhou Office, 5th Dispatch] Yesterday, Zhejiang University students clashed with night shift rickshaw pullers, trishaw drivers, wonton vendors, porters, and workers from the snack shop workers' mutual aid society inside the school over the public burial of Yu Zisan. There were injuries on both sides. Today, representatives of the workers went to the provincial and municipal authorities to petition and distributed a letter to the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters throughout the country, stating that: During the last Zhejiang University turmoil, Hangzhou was under martial law for a long time, causing their business to be sluggish. They are afraid that another incident will lead to martial law and affect their livelihoods. They sent manual laborers to the school to petition, but they were insulted and beaten, shot with guns and bullets, resulting in more than twenty injuries, some serious. More than ten people were detained and were only released at 7:00 PM. Therefore, they are requesting sympathy from all sectors of society and are lodging four protests with the Zhejiang University Student Union: 1. Hand over the murderers and severely punish them according to the law. 2. Compensate for the damage and issue a public apology in the newspapers. 3. Eliminate their barbarity. 4. Request the government to no longer condone evil. According to Zhejiang University officials: The Zhejiang University Student Union decided to bury Yu Zisan on the 4th. The school authorities had consulted with the provincial government about the funeral route, but no agreement was reached. The school union announced on the 3rd that the event would be postponed. At 9:00 AM yesterday, students gathered on campus to discuss the matter. The president and dean of students were both present to dissuade them. At this time, military police were heavily deployed at the school gates and surrounding routes, prohibiting passage. Suddenly, forty or fifty vagrants, carrying paper flags and wooden sticks, shouting slogans, broke into the school and beat students, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. More than ten students were injured, four seriously injured and have been sent to the local court for examination. The school is questioning the security authorities about the cause of the incident. Also, the Hangzhou General Labor Union convened a meeting to support the killed workers. The Hangzhou Department Store Workers' Union also sympathized and will send people to comfort the workers.

[Another Telegram] According to the Zhejiang News Office: It has recently been learned that there are Communist Party members lurking in a certain university in the capital who have come here to bewitch the Zhejiang University Student Union and have made a decision to publicly bury Yu Zisan and expand the parade and propaganda. The security authorities of the provincial capital and Zhejiang University believe that the public burial of a Communist Party member by students of a national school and the parade and propaganda during this time of turmoil cannot be tolerated. The school was instructed to earnestly dissuade and announce the suspension of the burial. However, the Student Union insisted on not complying, leading to the unfortunate incident.

Extortion and Kidnapping Case Overturned; District Procuratorate Files Appeal

Local Court Dismisses Judge Lin Gan

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 5th] A case is currently attracting attention from local social figures: Ning Wenxuan, manager of Tongfa Chang Bank, filed a lawsuit against Ren Guorui and Wang Yunhua, managers of Lihua Bank, accusing them of colluding with Song Renhao and two demobilized military police officers to extort and kidnap him due to business disputes. The Beiping Local Court concluded the first trial, sentencing Song to death and the other four to life imprisonment. In the past three days, there has been much criticism from the public, pointing out that the plaintiff's aunt is currently a clerk for Lin Gan, the judge in this case, and the plaintiff's younger brother also has a son working as a probationary judge in the court. Lin Gan delayed his appearance in court, and it was not until after work hours that another judge acted on his behalf, acknowledging that the defendants were creditors with substantial assets and not kidnapping bandits. The local court's inspection office deemed the sentence too heavy and filed an appeal, hoping that the High Court and the Inspectorate would thoroughly investigate. Recently, there have been satirical remarks in Beiping, saying there is "reason" with "bars," but no "law" and no "heaven," referring to gold bars and legal tender. It has spread throughout the ancient city. It has also just been learned that Lin Gan has been officially dismissed by the local court.

Political Organization of Tibet

Local Areas Establish Dzongpens and Governors-General

All Under the Command of the Lhasa Government

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the political organization of Tibet, it has recently been learned from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission that the local political organization of Tibet is the "Dzong" (the original Tibetan meaning of "Dzong" is a fortress, because the location of the Tibetan "Dzong" is always on high ground with built fortresses for defense), similar to a county in the interior. The "Dzong" establishes one or two "Dzongpens" (similar to a county magistrate in the interior) to manage local administrative and judicial affairs. Below the "Dzong" are local headmen. When the government has matters to attend to, it summons the headmen and instructs them to carry them out. Since the Republic of China, starting with the 13th Dalai Lama, the two governments have also established governors-general in important border defense areas, similar to administrative inspector commissioners in the interior, to oversee important military and political affairs of several "Dzongs." Tibet currently has four governor-general offices, namely the Chamdo Governor-General, the Heiyin Governor-General, the Shannan Governor-General, and the Zhuomu Governor-General. The "Dzongpens" of the governor-general areas are directly under the of the Lhasa government's command.

### US Congress Reopens Tomorrow: Truman Prepared to Submit Message Urging Curbing Domestic Inflation and Rapidly Aiding Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] President Truman's message to be submitted on Wednesday at the opening of the current Congress is now ready. He will warn Congress that unless it takes the most urgent action to curb domestic inflation and assist in European recovery, the United States will lose its leadership position in the world. According to White House sources, Truman will reiterate the following points: The restoration of wage and price controls and the rationing system is the only way to stop inflation. Failure to curb this trend will inevitably lead to an economic panic within a year; Any attempts to delay the passage of the Marshall Plan until after March 31, drastically reduce the total amount of aid, weaken its management system, or avoid binding the United States for four years, will have the most serious impact on the European aid plan itself and on the US foreign policy that relies on that plan as its main instrument. Since 1948 is a presidential election year, and domestic inflation and European recovery are major issues in the campaign, the President's message to the current Congress will focus on these two issues. Other minor issues to be addressed include requests for legislation to eliminate racial discrimination and to increase the quota of European exiles allowed to enter the United States to 100,000 per year.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman and the Republican-controlled Congress are bracing for a showdown on the three major issues of the day. The rise and fall of the Democratic and Republican parties in this year's presidential election will depend on these. The three major issues are tax cuts, the high cost of living, and the Marshall Plan. Members of both parties have now returned to Washington, preparing to attend the opening of the 80th Congress on the 7th of this month. Each party will blame the other for the high cost of living. The President plans to submit three messages to Congress, starting with the State of the Union address on the 7th, followed by the economic message on the 9th, and then the budget on the 12th. The total may reach as high as 40 billion yuan, breaking the record for peacetime.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] When Congress begins debating the Marshall Plan, the first issue will focus on whether Marshall himself or an independent businessman should control the purse strings. President Truman has asked Congress to place the responsibility for the proposed $17 billion European Recovery Plan on the shoulders of managers directed and controlled by Marshall, but Republican leaders such as House Speaker Martin and Senator Taft have expressed opposition, arguing that all foreign loans should be placed in the hands of a bipartisan government agency. Taft said: President Truman's plan would make the fee agency, in effect, a bureau under the jurisdiction of the State Department. Senator Connally, a Democratic Senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that responsibility should rest entirely with the State Department and that any action to limit the State Department's authority would be unfortunate.

### To Prevent Conflict Between East and West, the European Aid Program Should Be Implemented: Marshall to Testify Before Congress

[United Press, Washington, 4th] US Secretary of State Marshall resumed his duties on the 5th after a sixteen-day leave of absence during the most critical period in US foreign policy history. Marshall's strategy is to take action to prevent the diplomatic and economic conflict between and the United States, which the people hope will not develop into a world war. His main weapon will be the European Recovery Program, also known as the Marshall Plan.

His first battlefield will be the halls of Congress, to decide whether this plan is needed; second, to decide how many billions should be allocated and in what form the United States should provide this aid. Next Wednesday will be the first anniversary of Marshall's departure from China, where he strongly criticized both the Communists and Nationalists. Before he declared his failure to resolve the Chinese Civil War, President Truman appointed him as Secretary of State, replacing Byrnes. This Wednesday, after another failure, Marshall will begin his historically important Marshall Plan in Congress. This time, it is a continuation of the failure to reach a common position with the Soviet Union on the German and Austrian peace treaties. Marshall was forced to decide that the economic reconstruction of the world, especially Western Europe, should precede a peaceful resolution. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin reviewing Marshall's plan to provide $17 billion to Western Europe over four years, starting on April 1st. Marshall will be the first witness to testify before Congress on Wednesday.

### Italian Communist Party Congress Denounces US and the Vatican

Italian Communist leader Togliatti delivered a five-hour speech to 3,000 delegates, stating that the Communist Party will adopt democratic methods in its political struggles, but the Italian Communist Party will never be taken advantage of by other parties. Togliatti also accused the Christian Democratic Party, led by Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, of being "an American party" that is colluding with the Vatican and senior officials of the Italian Catholic Church, as well as American imperialists and war criminals. After criticizing the Marshall Plan, Togliatti pointed out that although Italy's production has increased, the conditions of the working class have not improved. The Socialist and Communist parties have united, and he affirmed that the current government has made it possible to launch economic and political offensives against the working class. In addition to Thorez, foreign Communist Party representatives attending this meeting included British Communist leader Pollitt and representatives from the Communist parties of Southern Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland.

### Balkan Federation Plan Only a Matter of Time: Major Events May Occur in Hungary

[Reuters, Ankara, 4th] Turkish newspapers today published "reliable reports" stating that after Romanian King Michael announced his abdication, the announcement of the establishment of the Balkan Federation is imminent. Moscow has been planning this federation for months. The report also said that Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, under the instructions of Stalin, will be the leader of the Balkan Federation. In addition to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania, the participating countries will also include Hungary. However, Hungary is not currently as completely controlled by the Communist Party as other Balkan countries, so actions to prepare for Hungary's participation in this federation are underway. It is expected that major events will occur in Hungary soon. According to a statement released by TASS after Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Rakosi met with reporters from the Hungarian Communist Party newspaper, the policies of the free and democratic countries in the Danube region are gradually converging, and Hungary's foreign policy will undoubtedly develop in accordance with the principle of improving relations with neighboring countries.

### Small General Assembly Opens Yesterday: Six Soviet Bloc Countries Refuse to Attend

[Our Dispatch] New York, 5th (Radio): The United Nations "Small General Assembly" opened today, boycotted by the Soviet Union and the other five countries in the Soviet bloc, who refused to attend. US Representative Austin delivered a speech, urging the Soviet Union to abandon its prejudices, and said that the United States would not use the "Small General Assembly" to weaken the power of the Security Council. Those who believe in the spirit of the United Nations Charter need not fear the "Small General Assembly." We deeply hope that the countries of the Soviet bloc will soon be able to participate.

[Reuters, Manchester, 5th] The Manchester Guardian reported that the United Nations Small General Assembly is scheduled to be established on the 5th in Lake Success. President Truman has appointed Austin as the chief representative, and Jessup, a professor of international law and diplomacy at Columbia University, as Austin's deputy. It is expected that the main part of the daily work will be handled by Jessup. The Small General Assembly has two tasks: one is to consider issues referred by the General Assembly, and the other is to prepare for the study of issues to be submitted to the plenary session of the General Assembly. The first item on the agenda is to study the use of the veto power in the Security Council, and the second is to review how the General Assembly can complete international political cooperation. The State Department apparently wants to use the Small General Assembly as a hot water bottle to melt the international parliament and the cold war into mutual trust. Therefore, the US delegation will avoid any issues that could increase Soviet suspicion at the beginning of the Small General Assembly's work. The Soviet Union is still wary of these US strategies, so its delegation to the United Nations declared yesterday that the Soviet delegation does not intend to attend the Small General Assembly.

### Swedish Cancer Expert Arrives in Moscow: Tight-Lipped About Purpose of Trip

Belven's actions remain strictly confidential, and even the Swedish embassy does not know the purpose of his trip.

### Legal Council After Intense Debate: Hsu Mo Wins Preliminary Confidence, Widely Believed to Gain Support of the Council

[United Press International, Paris, 5th] On the 5th, after two hours of deliberation, Hsu Mo won his first vote of confidence in the council with 308 votes against 272. He requested five votes of confidence regarding the 105 billion franc emergency anti-inflation plan, and it seems likely that the last four will also win confidence. Hsu Mo's victory came after De Gaulle announced his six-point plan, including the abolition of the traditional trade union system.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The fate of the Hsu Mo cabinet will be decided in the National Assembly on the 5th. Hsu Mo requested five votes of confidence from the parliament regarding the new "Save the Franc" bill proposed by the cabinet, which stipulates the imposition of special taxes or mandatory subscription to public credit. However, parliamentarians expect that Premier Hsu is likely to gain majority support, as the Communist Party and the far-right Republican Liberty Party, which proposed amendments, will find it difficult to take closely coordinated action in this extremely important vote. If this new "Save the Franc" bill is passed by the parliament, the parliament will then consider the suggestion that taxpayers can subscribe to public bonds in lieu of paying taxes.

This final five-year plan is expected to be announced on the 15th.

### Beginning to Apply Automatic Adjustment Formula to Adjust Prices: Four Major Public Utilities Rise: Adjustment Number Averages About 40% of the Price: Streetcars, Ferries, etc. Implemented on the 11th

[Report from this newspaper] The automatic adjustment formula for the prices of public utilities in this city has been decided to be implemented starting today. Electricity, telephone, gas, and tap water are the first four items to be applied, with adjustments ranging from 27% to 71%. Transportation services such as streetcars, buses, ferries, and small trains will increase in price starting on the 11th of this month, with the percentage of the increase being approved by the competent authority. According to Zhao Huiyu, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to reporters yesterday, the characteristic of this adjustment is that the price of industrial electricity is 10% lower than ordinary electricity. The previous additional fee for exceeding 50,000 kilowatt-hours will be cancelled. The three-fold penalty for exceeding the limit for industrial gas has now been reduced to two-fold. Also, the average of the numbers for this adjustment is about 40%, which is slightly lower than the last time. The Public Utilities Bureau is applying the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities for the first time this time. In order to fully inform the citizens, it has decided to invite the conveners of the various groups of the Municipal Council for explanation within days. The adjusted new prices for electricity, telephone, gas, and tap water for this month are recorded below:

### Factors for Automatic Adjustment Calculation

The calculation formula for public utility prices was formulated by the National Economic Commission, and the various constants are approved by the competent departments of the central government. The local government can increase or decrease by 10% based on the calculations made according to the formula. Among them, electricity fees are calculated based on fuel, hardware index, and cost of living index. Water prices are calculated based on fuel, electricity fees, foreign exchange, and cost of living index. Telephone fees are calculated based on hardware index and cost of living index. Gas fees are calculated based on fuel, foreign exchange, and cost of living index.

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Industrial Association held a meeting of executive directors yesterday and reported that the organizational method of the private business delegation to Japan stipulates that the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association should allocate and select representatives.

### Building a Home from Scratch (Part 2): Some Stories of the Xiang-Gui Railway

[Aeronautical dispatch from Hengyang, 3rd] Starting from Guilin, the railway reached Quanzhou in April. After calculating all the mismatched and pieced-together rails and the steel rails dismantled from the Jintan section, it was still 60 kilometers short of reaching Hengyang. The Yuehan Railway was like Liu Bei borrowing Jingzhou, borrowing it and not returning it. After negotiations, it barely managed to scrape together 60 kilometers of old, abandoned rails. So, construction started from both ends. During these months, the construction workers sometimes used electric lights to work day and night. Southern Hunan and northern Guangxi are mountainous regions with much miasma. Furthermore, they suffered from war, and corpses littered the fields, which further aided the spread of epidemics. Also, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, public order became a problem. Therefore, during the construction period of this line, four staff members and thirteen workers died on duty due to epidemics and banditry. During the opening ceremony, Director Yuan Menghong reported the hardships they encountered during the construction, and at one point, overcome with emotion, he burst into tears and could not speak.

### Early Completion: Apart from Hard Work, Nothing Else is Essential

Due to the efforts of the construction workers, the work was completed a month ahead of schedule. The 230 kilometers from Quanzhou to Hengyang were completed in seven months, with an average of more than ten kilometers of track laid per day, which is a miracle in the eyes of the UNRRA personnel. Because this kind of record does not seem possible by human effort. In fact, the reason why the Xiang-Gui Railway was able to lay more than ten kilometers of track per day this time is not because the employees had any special abilities; they were still the same as ordinary people. The reason for this new record is simply that they were willing to endure hardship. They worked day and night, doing four hundred days of work in seven months, which is equivalent to one person doing the work of two people at the same time. There is nothing else that is essential, just being able to endure hardship.

### Self-Reliance: The Most Powerful Expression of Facts

The difficulty of the Xiang-Gui Railway was not just the restoration of the tracks, but also the lack of locomotives and carriages. All the equipment needed did not receive any assistance from foreign transport; they all relied on their own ingenuity and self-reliance. They repaired abandoned locomotives found by the side of the road; they refurbished vehicles that were just empty shells and no longer valued. The special train for the opening ceremony had ten first-class sleeping cars, all new carriages manufactured in November by the Suqiao Machinery Factory of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. According to the factory director Gu Ji, except for the glass, which was purchased from Hong Kong, everything else was made locally. Although the carriage the reporter rode was a low-hook, lacking steel plates, and inevitably a bit bumpy, all other equipment was no less than that of imported carriages. One has to compare goods to know their value. The equipment of the first-class sleeping cars of the Yuehan Railway is inferior. This kind of work performance shows that the Chinese people have the ability to "rely on their own efforts." People from friendly countries criticize us for relying on foreigners for everything. The restoration and opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway is a powerful factual rebuttal to this criticism. In the past, this major artery shouldered the important task of connecting the economy and culture of the southwest, and it made a great contribution to military and economic affairs. In the future, it will continue to undertake this important mission. We wish that in the near future, its right arm will be as active as its left arm, and that it will be able to reach Guiyang by next year. And that one day, its two legs, which are stepping on Zhennanguan and extending into Guangzhou Bay, can also stand up. (Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru)

### Northern Jiangsu Bandit Areas: Few Strong Men, Mostly Women and Children Wearing Mourning

[Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 2nd] Ding Zuobin, the magistrate of Taixian County, came to Zhenjiang on December 30th of last year and reported on the important government affairs of Taixian in detail to the chairman. On the 31st, he hosted reporters from various newspapers in the provincial capital and reported on the situation he personally witnessed in the bandit areas in great detail, which was alarming. Magistrate Ding said: During the eight days of traveling, most of the villages I passed through had no men, only a few elderly women and children, and eight or nine out of ten were wearing mourning clothes, which shows the cruelty of the bandits in killing the people. The poorest in the village are called "The Old Masters", the next is called "The Second Old Masters,". In the bandit areas, eighteen-year-old girls are hung up and asked for gold and silver. This is called "hanging for gold" and "hanging for silver." The bandits say that gold and silver belong to the country and the common people should not have them. After repeated research, I feel that relying on troops to suppress bandits will not work. Suppressing bandits is everyone's business. The people of the entire Taixian County must cheer up and fight the bandits to the death, otherwise there will be no burial place. I hope everyone can see through this. If the bandits can be wiped out, what does it matter if a few more coins are spent, as long as they are spent properly. I do not only hope that the people of Taixian County will do this, but also hope that the people of the entire Jiangsu Province will unite and become alert.

Health Medical Publication

### Before and After "Metrorrhagia"

-- Zhong Li

Metrorrhagia refers to excessive menstruation, like a collapse of a dam, unstoppable, followed by continuous spotting. Therefore, the terms "metrorrhagia and spotting" are often used together. Some may start with spotting and then lead to metrorrhagia. The causes are usually congestion of the uterus, internal tumors, ovarian deterioration, or uterine cancer. After metrorrhagia, one often sees a pale face, dizziness, blurred vision, lower back pain as if broken, weakness of the limbs, insomnia, palpitations, and other symptoms. This disease is more common in middle-aged women. It is occasionally seen in young women, usually caused by strenuous exercise or falls and injuries. Cases around the age of fifty are mostly a sign of uterine tumor or cancer and should not be ignored.

Traditional Chinese medicine treats metrorrhagia by carefully examining the disease and prescribing treatment accordingly, so it is very effective. It can be divided into six points: (1) If the Chong and Ren meridians cannot control blood, symptoms include fear of cold, pale lips and nails, urgently administer ginseng, astragalus, donkey-hide gelatin, mugwort leaves, etc. (2) If the kidneys are weak and cannot contain blood, symptoms include lower back pain, cold feet, palpitations, and confusion. Treatment should warm the kidneys and replenish essence, such as deer antler, human placenta, cynomorium, and purple fluorite. (3) If there is blood deficiency and liver exuberance, symptoms include a pale face, red lips, red cheeks, and a red tongue with cracks, fresh blood with a purple tinge. Medications include raw rehmannia, white peony root, moutan bark, scrophularia, turtle shell, oyster shells, etc. (4) If there is qi deficiency and the body cannot contain blood, use codonopsis, astragalus, eucommia, longan pulp, etc. (5) If there is spleen deficiency and the spleen cannot govern the blood, add atractylodes and costus root to the previous prescription. (6) If there is stagnant blood obstructing internally and new blood cannot return to the meridians, use charred angelica sinensis, charred salvia miltiorrhiza, charred schizonepeta, and charred sophora flavescens. Using medication according to the symptoms will always be effective. After metrorrhagia and spotting have healed, it is especially appropriate to take a tonic formula during this winter season to strengthen the body. It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have strayed.

### Preventing Boils from Warming by the Stove

— Zhu Renkang

As the saying goes, "Although boils are small, their toxicity is extremely potent." Indeed, they are among the most dangerous external conditions. They occur most frequently on the face and hands. Initially, they appear as small sores, sometimes itchy or painful. One must not disregard them due to their small size, especially if a feeling of numbness is present, which indicates a more serious condition.

Boils on the face, such as those on the nose, philtrum, around the mouth, and cheekbones, are particularly dangerous. These types of boils are strongly related to food poisoning, such as from eating diseased dead pork or beef, or from excessive indulgence in wine and meat. These habits easily lead to boils. If, after contracting a boil, one is not careful with their diet, it can easily lead to the danger of "running yellow" (a severe complication). Therefore, treatment as early as possible is best.

Boils on the hands and fingers, such as "snakehead boils," "tray boils," and those in the "tiger's mouth" (webbing between thumb and index finger), are particularly painful due to the dense network of sensory nerves in the hands. Those who use their hands for work, such as butchers, fishers, farmers, washerwomen, tanners, seamstresses, carpenters, and cooks, are more prone to boils. In ordinary people, they are often triggered by finger pricks or crush injuries.

Boils are also greatly related to the climate. When it hasn't rained for a long time, and the weather is dry and hot, boils are more common. When the weather is dry, children tend to lick their lips, which can cause "inverted cicada" boils (a type of facial boil).

During this winter season, many like to gather around stoves to keep warm. Those who are economically minded may use coal briquette stoves or stay close to gas heaters, both of which contain "fire toxins." Consequently, quite a few people develop boils and seek medical treatment. This is something that urgently needs attention.

### Variations of Winter Warm Disease

— Guan Liping

Winter Warm disease is a type of febrile disease, known as such because it aligns with the seasonal climate of winter. The initial symptoms are similar to those of a common cold: aversion to cold, fever, headache, body aches, bone and joint pain, thick phlegm, and subtle chest and rib pain. Due to the underlying dormant factors, it is often not resolved by inducing sweating or a single dose of medication. With proper treatment, mild cases may subside in two to three weeks (each week is called a "候"), while severe cases may take five to six weeks to heal. This type of warm disease cannot be resolved by recklessly inducing sweating. Or, after sweating, the fever may subside slightly, only to rise again after a while.

Winter Warm disease has many variations: (1) Transformation into pneumonia, characterized by coughing with rising phlegm, shortness of breath, pain in the right or left side of the chest, or blood-tinged sputum. Treatment should focus on clearing and moistening with ingredients like Tinglizi (Descurainiae Semen seu Lepidii Semen), gypsum, honeysuckle, forsythia, trichosanthes fruit, glehnia root, and loquat leaf syrup. (2) Transformation into intestinal bleeding, where profuse bleeding is accompanied by impaired consciousness. Rhinoceros horn, fresh rehmannia root, moutan bark, pulsatilla, fraxinus bark, and charred sophora flower should be used to clear the heat and stop the bleeding. If cold limbs, excessive sweating, a thready or submerged pulse, a pale complexion, and weak breathing are observed, it can easily lead to collapse. Ginseng, dragon bone, and oyster shell should be added to fortify the body and rescue it from collapse. If the bleeding is not profuse, the blood is purplish-black, and the patient's mental state remains normal, or if abdominal pain precedes the bleeding, which then subsides, it differs from the above and requires only clearing of the intestines.

(3) Concomitant peritonitis is the most dangerous condition, characterized by severe pain in the lower abdomen, with bowel movements that are either frequent or obstructed. In severe cases, the lower abdomen may be distended. Rhubarb, moutan bark, peach kernel, and patrinia herb should be used to promote blood circulation and resolve stagnation.

(4) Transformation into impaired consciousness, incoherent speech, and delusional talk. Medicines such as Zhizhudan (a traditional Chinese medicine), Chaihudan (another traditional medicine), Shenxidan (a calming medicine), acorus, and aroid should be selected.

(5) Transformation into wind-induced convulsion, with eyes rolled upward and clenched jaws. Antelope horn, abalone shell, and uncaria should be used to treat it.

The above five variations of Winter Warm disease are only general descriptions. The remaining symptoms should be treated according to the judgment of yin syndromes.

Reader's Letter

### A Case of Tetanus Cured with Traditional Chinese Medicine

Previously, I read in the "New Medicine and New Drugs Weekly" an article by Dr. Yang titled "Childbirth and Tetanus," which stated that the mortality rate of tetanus is very high, and that once spasms occur, the effectiveness of serum is limited. This reminded me of a case where my mother contracted this disease and was cured with traditional Chinese medicine. I am recording it here for research purposes. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), my mother accidentally fell headfirst from the second floor, her head hitting the lid of a water tank on the ground. A three-inch gash near her temple bled profusely. She fainted immediately, but was revived after emergency treatment by a doctor, who stitched up the wound. After about ten days, it was mostly healed, but suddenly her eyes appeared to be different sizes. Two or three days later, she couldn't open her jaw, and her back, neck, legs, and knees were all stiff. The doctor diagnosed her with tetanus. Despite daily injections of large amounts of tetanus serum, there was no effect. Sedatives and antispasmodic drugs were also ineffective. At that time, she suffered from spasms and convulsions, screaming in agony, and could only have a few drops of water dripped into her mouth to prolong her life. She was in critical condition. On someone's recommendation, we consulted a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, Zhuang, who prescribed a formula containing arisaema, gastrodia, uncaria, saposhnikovia, notopterygium, cicada slough, angelica dahurica, typhonii rhizoma, areca peel, poria spirit, and antelope horn shavings. After decocting, it was slowly dripped into her mouth through the gaps in her teeth. After several hours, her jaw loosened slightly, and the spasms decreased. Later, the prescription was changed daily, and early in the morning she was out of danger. After a month of recuperation, she fully recovered and remains healthy to this day. The head wound scar is still visible. Therefore, I dare to truthfully present this case for the exploration of the medical community. I would be greatly honored.

The European and American medical communities have long recognized this and have extracted its essence to investigate its main functions. After consumption and absorption into the blood, it accelerates blood oxidation, thereby enhancing metabolism and raising blood pressure. It can also induce hyperemia in the ovaries, thus verifying its effectiveness in breaking down stagnant blood, nourishing new blood, regulating menstruation, and promoting fertility.

Gynecologists invariably use Danggui. This medicine is often combined with white peony root, chuanxiong rhizome, and rehmannia root to form the famous Si Wu Tang (Four-Substance Decoction) for gynecology. When used alone, decocted with aged wine, it is an effective remedy for dysmenorrhea. Danggui also has different parts: the head, body, and tail. The head of Danggui stops bleeding and moves upward; the body of Danggui tonifies blood and stays in the middle; the tail of Danggui breaks blood and moves downward; and the whole Danggui harmonizes blood without dispersing it. These different uses in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions demonstrate its precision and effectiveness, surpassing other methods.

### Vomiting and Esophageal Obstruction

— Cheng Guoshu

Vomiting and esophageal obstruction both belong to digestive system diseases. Vomiting is milder, while esophageal obstruction is more severe. The world calls "madness, consumption, bloating, and esophageal obstruction" the four major syndromes, esophageal obstruction being one of them, indicating its severity.

With "vomiting," the patient can still eat, but the food is vomited out shortly after or some time later. It can be further distinguished into two types: vomiting immediately after eating, and vomiting in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa. Vomiting immediately after eating is caused by spasm, narrowing, or swelling of the upper opening of the stomach (the cardia), preventing food from entering and causing it to be vomited out. Vomiting in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa, is caused by the above-mentioned pathologies occurring at the lower opening of the stomach (the pylorus), preventing food from entering the duodenum, thus remaining in the stomach for a longer period before being vomited out. Although patients with this condition can eat, they cannot absorb the nutrients, resulting in a gradual decline in physical strength. Therefore, it is advisable to feed them liquid foods such as milk, such as chive juice and milk drink (chive juice, milk, with a little ginger juice).

In the early stages, before physical strength has deteriorated, with vomiting immediately after eating, the Da Huang Gan Cao Tang (Rhubarb and Licorice Decoction) (rhubarb, licorice) is suitable. For those who vomit in the evening after eating in the morning, or vice versa, the Wu Zhu Yu Tang (Evodia Decoction) (evodia, ginseng, ginger, jujube) is suitable.

"Esophageal obstruction," commonly known as "gas obstruction," actually has distinctions between "obstruction" and "diaphragm." "Obstruction" refers to the narrowing and thinning of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow food, causing it to be obstructed. "Diaphragm" refers to the presence of an actual obstruction in the esophagus, such as esophageal stricture or cancerous growth, preventing food from passing through.

These conditions are often caused by worry, contemplation, anger, and resentment. Patients can drink liquids, but have difficulty swallowing solids, which differs slightly from vomiting where food is eaten and then vomited out. As for treatment, if it is caused by qi stagnation, the Si Qi Yin (Ginseng, Aucklandia, Betel Nut, Agarwood Decoction) is suitable to promote qi circulation and resolve stagnation. If combined with fluid depletion, the Five Juice Drink (Milk, Chive Juice, Ginger Juice, Lotus Root Juice, Pear Juice) (牛乳，韮汁，姜汁，藕汁，梨汁) is added to generate fluids and nourish the body (or the nourishing enema method can be used). If it is caused by fluid depletion, qi stagnation, and phlegm accumulation, the Da Ban Xia Tang (Pinellia Decoction) (ginseng, pinellia, white honey) is suitable to promote qi circulation, resolve phlegm, and generate fluids. If it is caused by qi stagnation and blood stasis, the Tao Ren Cheng Qi Tang (Peach Kernel Qi-Moving Decoction) (peach kernel, rhubarb, mirabilite, licorice, cinnamon twig) is suitable to dispel stasis and break up stagnation. Although traditional Chinese medicine classics do not mention cancerous growths, using methods to dispel blood stasis to treat cancerous growths is quite consistent.

### Students of Municipal Normal School Demand Increased Public Funding Unsuccessfully, Continue Strike Today

[Our Report] Students of the Shanghai Municipal Normal School are continuing their strike today to demand reasonable treatment and an increase in the amount of public funding. The students argue that prices are soaring uncontrollably, and the current monthly public funding of only 196,000 yuan is insufficient to maintain even the minimum nutrition.

The school authorities promised to respond with a solution yesterday, but as of last night, the school authorities had not given a clear indication. The student body held a general meeting and resolved to continue the strike today to show their protest. At the same time, they demanded that the Bureau of Education reissue the remaining public funding for the months of October, November, and December of last year. According to the person in charge of the student union: the monthly public funding for students at the school was originally 83,000 yuan this semester. In December, it was announced that it would be increased to 196,000 yuan starting from October, but this increased amount has not yet been issued.

### Six-District Cotton Spinning Association Holds Extraordinary Meeting to Review Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, Eager to Cooperate with the Yarn Control Committee to Increase Production, Cotton and Yarn Groups Offer Opinions

[Our Report] Yesterday, the Six-District Cotton Spinning Association convened an extraordinary meeting of its members regarding the implementation of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations. Over a hundred representatives from various factories attended. Chairman Wang Qiyu presided over the meeting, during which the nine articles of the management regulations promulgated by the government were discussed in detail. The main points of the association's opinions are as follows: Under the government's policy of controlling resources and stabilizing prices, the implementation of nationwide cotton yarn and cloth management regulations should be jointly supported by all members of the industry. Chairman Jiang's New Year's Day announcement on stabilizing finance and increasing production is especially admired by all members of the industry. However, the management regulations must consider the survival of businesses to be effectively promoted and achieve the goals of stability and increased production. Issues such as potential disruptions in raw cotton supply leading to factory shutdowns, the calculation of processing fees based on cotton prices, the timing of cotton-for-yarn exchanges, and the varying qualities of equipment are all deeply related to each factory. If these are not carefully considered and implemented, there may be practical difficulties. The general assembly decided to establish separate committees for raw cotton and yarn and cloth to conduct detailed reviews and provide written opinions to the Yarn Control Committee for consideration in the coming days. The meeting lasted for three hours, and many speakers expressed their opinions. All members expressed their sincere willingness to cooperate with the Yarn Control Committee to achieve the goal of increased production.

### Yarn Control Committee to Entrust Textile Construction Company with Cotton Purchase Contract, Soon to Be Signed

[Our Report] The contract between the Yarn Control Committee and the Textile Construction Company for the latter to purchase raw cotton on behalf of the former is reportedly finalized and will be signed soon. Key contents include: The raw cotton collection agencies originally set up in various locations by the Textile Construction Company should be accepted for commissioned procurement. For the raw cotton collection location where Textile Construction Company has not set up collection agencies, the Yarn Control Committee is not bound by the contract and may set up its own agency to process raw cotton. In areas where Textile Construction Company is involved in raw cotton collection, Textile Construction Company can purchase raw cotton in spot trading, forward contract trading, through bookkeeping, or through the standard trading approach of the raw cotton merchant, based on factual requirements. It can also commission the purchase to privately-owned factories, which must comply with the standards and classifications as set by Textile Construction Company.

### Cotton Yarn Trading Robust, Cloth Market Sentiment Strong

Due to the soaring prices in other ports during the closure of customs, the cotton yarn market was filled with excitement. As soon as trading opened, weaving factories and local merchants actively bought, causing prices to rise uniformly. Midway, the opening of yarn sales by Textile Construction Company slightly softened the market, but strong buying interest ultimately led to the closing price of 42-count Lufeng fine yarn at 54 million yuan, a surge of 3.7 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also jumped by 1.56 to 2.45 million yuan. The cloth market opened sharply higher in the morning, with sentiment becoming particularly strong. This was because trading had occurred off-market during the holiday, already raising prices. Consequently, merchants actively sought to cover their positions, and merchants made strong purchases, causing the market to rise in a roundabout way. However, at noon, news spread that cotton purchases would be centrally controlled starting from the 9th, and that the movement of goods would be stopped, with rumors that yarn and cloth would follow suit. Sentiment suddenly softened, with sellers rushing to sell, and Guangbang merchants selling more, causing prices to slightly decline. Nevertheless, the off-market price of the leading fine cloth rose sharply by about 200,000 yuan compared to before the holiday, reaching 1.495 million yuan. Wufu lottery balls and Zhenzhong brands also rose by 120,000 to 167,000 yuan, while jizhi tribute cloth, bleached coarse cloth, twill colored cloth, and local cloth also increased by over 100,000 yuan. [Our Report] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold its allocated cotton yarn as usual, selling 3,144 pieces, totaling 4,065 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 771 applications. The selling price remained unchanged.

### Unified Bonds Stable, Foreign Shares Rise

Government bonds also trended stably yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 30,000 yuan, reached a high of 31,400 yuan, retreated to 29,900 yuan, and finally stood at 31,000 yuan. Compared to before the closure of customs, A, B, D, and E bonds each rose by 900 yuan, and C bonds rose by 1,000 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 5 million. Foreign shares also saw strong buying interest yesterday. However, due to the partial effectiveness of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, Shanghai Electric rebounded to 3.1 yuan, rising but not expanding. Yi Sha and Ying Lian reached new highs of 470,000 and 720,000 respectively. Guangbang and foreign firms took profits, while retail investors and securities firms sold, showing a firm process. As a result, compared to before the closure of customs, Wheelock paper remained stable, while hot stocks such as Yi Sha, Ying Lian, Ye Guang, Yi Hua Shipping, and steel stocks each rose by half a percent.

Tea Market Quiet

Both local and merchant customers inquired about inland tea yesterday. Although large firms tried to push up the opening prices, most holders felt tight on funds and sold, making it difficult for the situation to improve. The closing result was that prices generally held steady. As for the foreign tea market, demand from abroad remained sluggish, so trading remained bleak. However, holders of goods remained inactive, so the process remained quiet and unchanged.

### Money Market Stable

[Our Report] Yesterday, the money market was stable, with overnight interest rates at 2.4%, and Huagu sticking interest at 2.55%. The four banks and two bureaus saw a net inflow of 115.8 billion yuan, with the Central Bank receiving 77.8 billion yuan, the Big Exchange receiving 3.7 billion yuan, foreign firms receiving 16.5 billion yuan, the Small Exchange having a net outflow of 169.3 billion yuan, the Bank of China having an outflow of 17.2 billion yuan, the Central Trust Bureau receiving 30.5 billion yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau receiving 20.3 billion yuan, and other banks and bureaus having no major inflows or outflows.

### All-Round Rise, Most Huagu Stocks Hit Limit Up

Huagu stocks opened red yesterday. Although trading was not active, the available chips were tight. Apart from Yongsha creating a new high of 617 yuan and 627 yuan, the remaining stocks uniformly hit the limit up. Initially, the market was confident, and opened higher. Yongsha opened for immediate delivery at 580 yuan, and for deferred delivery at 595 yuan. After opening, sellers lowered the price of deferred Yongsha to 590 yuan, but it was immediately bought up to 596 yuan and 610 yuan. Midway, it fell to 582 yuan and 595 yuan. At that time, the prices of small stocks were very profitable. Xinyi, Jinglun, Zhongsi, Huameng, Jianhua Underwear and other stocks successively rose to the limit up, and rebounded more easily. Yonggong also reached the limit up. Yongsha rose to 590 yuan and 600 yuan. The market outside offered interest rates of 2.1% and 2.55%, and then retreated to 585 yuan and 597 yuan. Foreign shares remained at higher prices, and Anshan and Ni each hit the limit up. Yongsha then created new highs of 616 yuan and 611 yuan, with limited transactions, and retreated to 586 yuan and 600 yuan by noon. However, the firmness of the small stocks supported the big stocks, and again rose to 591 yuan and 605 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the spot delivery shares at the closure, Xinyi, Jinglun, Yonggong, Underwear, and Lian each hit the limit up. Huameng, Xinhua, Zhongsi, Baini each retreated after hitting the limit up, rising by 10% to 15%. Wuli rose slightly, and the remaining shares all rose by 5% to 15%. The same was true for deferred delivery shares. In the afternoon, in addition to the stocks that hit the limit up in the morning session, Yongye, Qinxing, Huaxin, Zhongfa, Zhongfang, Jingfu, Rongfeng, Match, Zhabei American Distance Business Xinyi and Wuxin Tongyi all reached the limit up after 3:20 PM. Yongsha then advanced to 611 yuan and 623 yuan. National Bank Xiao advanced a lot, retreated to 605 yuan and 616 yuan. Approaching the close, it reached new highs of 617 yuan and 627 yuan, and then closed at prices of 617 yuan and 627 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning session, all stocks except Yongsha, which rose slightly and continued to penetrate, still seeing positive prospects, hit the limit up. All of the old stocks in the informal market were extremely firm, especially Zhonghua, which rose independently by 10%, and Bank of China, which rose by another half a percent, were the most remarkable. Also: Spot delivery arbitrage transactions were cheaper midway yesterday, and the situation was relatively stable. Those with interest rates close to each other could obtain about 1.7 to 2%, internally calculated Yongsha sticking price initially opened at 14 yuan, fell to 12 yuan, and closed at 13.5 yuan. Meiya opened at 22 yuan, reached a high of 30 yuan, and closed at 20 yuan. Xinyi opened at 7 yuan and closed at 8 yuan.

### Rayon Soars, Factory-Made Silk and Cloth Rise

The rayon market soared yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand rayon with luster opened high at 8.5 million yuan, and some transactions were made. It once fell to 3.5 million yuan for next-day delivery, but this was for goods without cases. It then rose again, and by noon it had risen to a selling price of 8 million yuan, with buyers willing to pay 7 million yuan. It continued to be popular in the afternoon. Due to a lack of sellers, it finally rose to 91.5 million yuan, an increase of 13 million yuan compared to last Wednesday.

Factory-Made Silk

Yesterday's market was stimulated by high rayon prices, and sentiment was positive. In the morning, C-grade Chinese-capital goods opened at 89 million yuan, but the asking prices were generally inflated. In the afternoon, prices were even higher than in the morning, and asking prices rose uniformly. High-grade goods were traded for 90 million yuan. Tiger stove silk was around 86 million yuan. 28-point silk was extremely scarce, with asking prices as high as 80 million yuan. Ordinary goods were around 75 million yuan.

Cloth

The market rose yesterday. Real silk quilt covers had been traded for as high as 36.7 million yuan during the closure of customs. On Sunday, it was traded for 6.1 million yuan. Yesterday, it opened at 6.1 million yuan for immediate delivery, and transactions were made. It soon fell to around 5.85 million yuan, and fluctuated. The closing price for immediate delivery was 5.9 million yuan, and for next-day delivery it was 6.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was even better due to high raw material prices. It finally rose to 6.7 million yuan. Other goods, such as crepe satin, Dawei flannel, electric spinning, etc., saw some sales in the market. The afternoon's market rose by 5% to 10% uniformly.

Allocation Price Determined

The Central Trust Bureau recently announced the allocation prices for rayon from January 5 to 10 as follows: 1A Dongyang 65.34 million yuan, Tianqiao 63.46 million yuan, other 63.06 million yuan, 2A Dongyang 64.04 million yuan, Tianqiao 62.2 million yuan, other 61.8 million yuan, 3A Dongyang 62.08 million yuan, Tianqiao 60.28 million yuan, other 59.9 million yuan, 4A Dongyang 58.8 million yuan, Tianqiao 57.72 million yuan, other 56.76 million yuan. High Prices of Rice Fluctuate, Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains Rise

Rice markets operated as usual on January 2nd and 3rd. Ultimately, because various markets were in closure, trading was inevitably oversupplied, resulting in a combined increase of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan over two days. Yesterday, all grains were returned to the market in full. The combined registration of rice grains from the north and south markets reached around 19,000 shi. Market conditions: The south market initially fell and then rose, ultimately being about the same as Saturday. The north market was sluggish and fell back by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Suzhou rice ships were congested, with abundant supply and no concerns. Other oil cakes, miscellaneous grains, and wheat bran all saw increases of 10% to 20%. Flour sharply increased by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and wheat bran inventories were extremely depleted, causing prices to rise wildly by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Soybean cakes rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the high cost of raw materials. Soybean transactions were not smooth. Because supply and demand did not match, merchant confidence was strong, causing prices to rise by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. However, actual sales were flat, and prices weakened again near the close. The supply and demand of rapeseed was low, and holders were firm, causing prices to rise wildly by 100,000 yuan. Red beans came and went quickly, and holders were very firm, causing prices to rise by 10,000 yuan. Adzuki beans similarly rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Broad beans rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in line with other goods. There were no recent shipments of chickpeas, and there were no formal market conditions. Northern sorghum continued to be processed, rising by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but weakening at noon. Northern rice continued to be purchased, rising sharply by 100,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were sold retail briskly, and prices continued to rise, jumping by 200,000 yuan. Sesame seeds and wood were traded actively, rising by a few million yuan. All oil markets were high, and all oils rose in price by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan or more.

### Fuel Management Committee Adjusts Prices for Various Coal Allocations Starting This Month, Efforts to Open Up All Coal Sources Are Underway

[Our Report] The Fuel Management Committee has adjusted coal price allocations starting January of this year. Overall, prices have increased by about 40% compared to the previous period. The prices are as follows (per ton):

(A) Public utilities: 2.18 million yuan for dock delivery, 2.15 million yuan for full ship delivery. (B) Railways, military transport: 2.42 million yuan for dock delivery. (C) Outport power plants, ships, transportation organizations under the jurisdiction of the municipal public utilities bureau, divided into eight levels, ranging from 2.42 million yuan to 2.75 million yuan. (D) Factories, military and government agencies, divided into eight levels, ranging from 3.14 million yuan to 3.47 million yuan. (E) Foreign coal: Public utilities: 3.54 million yuan for coal dust, 3.88 million yuan for coal chunks; factory coal: 3.98 million yuan for coal dust, 4.4 million yuan for coal chunks. (F) White coal: 1.99 million yuan for Great Wall coal dust, 3.97 million yuan for Great Wall coal chunks, 2.88 million yuan for other coal dust, less than 4 million yuan for other coal pieces, 4.91 million yuan for other coal pellets, and 6.03 million yuan for other coal chunks. The above coal prices for items C, D, E, and F are all for delivery at the Pudong dock or the Maigen Road warehouse, with an additional 180,000 yuan per ton. According to a spokesperson for the Fuel Management Committee: Recently, in the northern segment of the rail line, the route inside Customs has been destroyed by bandits three times. The opening of coal transport has been affected, and it has not yet been fully unblocked, affecting demand in the southeast region. This committee, which is responsible for fuel management, should prepare to open up coal sources to meet the demand for coal from public utilities, railways, ships, and other major coal users. Chairman Zhang of this committee flew to Taiwan on the 1st to discuss the shipping of coal from Taiwan to Shanghai. It is expected that monthly transport can increase by 40,000 to 50,000 tons. Furthermore, Director Wu Tao of the Shipping Office was assigned on the 2nd to Qilu Road Xuzhou and Bengbu to procure coal from the Huainan and Huadong Coal Mines. Regarding the increase in coal shipping along Qilu Road, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation have reached an agreement to immediately allocate seven special coal transport trains, which are expected to transport 150,000 tons of coal to Beijing and Shanghai this month for urgent use. In addition to the above two methods of increasing transport, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also approved the purchase of 100,000 tons of foreign coal, which this committee will negotiate with the National Bank regarding foreign exchange limits, and then entrust it to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. Currently, before the increased coal shipment arrives, this committee has received a hand-signed order from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stating: Currently, coal transportation is obstructed, and the Ministry is working to clear it. Before coal shipments are fully unblocked, all coal originally intended for the Fuel Management Committee, except for public utilities, outport power plants, ships, railways, dredging, military transport, and state-owned factories, must be temporarily suspended from allocation." This committee will spare no effort to overcome all difficulties to overcome the current difficulties.

(Another report) The committee also shipped 4,300 tons of coal on the Jiaoda Zhonghua ship from Qinhuangdao to the Qingdao Power Plant. On the 8th, the Fuxiang ship will transport 5,000 tons of coal from Shanghai to Qingdao, with 3,000 tons delivered to the Zhongfang Textile Factory and 2,000 tons delivered to the Coal Transportation Mine Office for distribution to railways, navy, customs, and other major special agencies.

### Clarifying Virtue, Renewing the People, and Abiding in Perfect Goodness

— Junyang

"Clarifying virtue" means clarifying the reason for clarifying virtue. When discussing the worthies, "clarifying virtue" is read twice in succession. Zhu Xi's interpretation of the first "clarifying" is "to clarify," and he says that "clarifying virtue is what people receive from Heaven, and it is vacuous and spiritually bright, possessing all principles and mastering all affairs." This interpretation can be understood. Virtue is clarified through vacuity and spiritual brightness, and this vacuity and spiritual brightness does possess all principles and master all affairs. However, virtue resides within, and its mechanism is limited to vacuity and spiritual brightness. As for the multitude of principles and the myriad of affairs, they lie outside and require the effort of learning, inquiry, deliberation, and discrimination before they can be possessed and responded to. This effort of learning, inquiry, deliberation, and discrimination is what Zhu Xi calls "to clarify." I believe that this so-called "virtue" or "clarifying virtue" is what the Doctrine of the Mean calls "universal virtue" or "virtuous nature." "Universal" means comprehensive, truly encompasses the meaning of "clarifying." "Virtue" means obtaining, what people obtain from Heaven as their nature. What is universal virtue? Knowledge, benevolence, and courage. These three are the vacuous and spiritually bright virtues that people obtain from Heaven, inherent within. When connected to the external world, knowledge possesses all principles, and benevolence and courage respond to all affairs, completing the functions of knowledge and action.

"Renewing the people" was originally "loving the people." Cheng Yi said that "loving" should be "renewing," and Zhu Xi's commentary follows suit. From the beginning of the Great Learning to "never has there been a case of valuing what is unimportant while neglecting what is important," which Zhu Xi calls the "classic," is clearly the outline of the entire text. What Zhu Xi analyzes as the "commentary" always begins with the classic and ends here. There is a section on renewing the people in the text (Zhu Xi's commentary, chapter 2), but the phrase "renewing the people" does not appear in the preceding general section (Zhu Xi's classic). This shows that "loving the people" in the general section is a transcription error due to the similarity in sound and form between "loving" and "renewing." As for Yangming's claim that "the 'renewing' in 'renewing the people' is different from the 'renewing' in 'self-renewal,' how can this be relied upon?" It is not known that the "renewing" in "renewing the people" contains the meaning of self-renewal. "Renewing the people" means that the ruler clarifies his own virtue, then extends it to others, so that his people may also clarify their own virtues. "Clarifying virtue throughout the world" means enabling the people of the world to clarify their own clarifying virtue, hence the citation of the Kang Gao and the Tai Jia (Zhu Xi's commentary, chapter 1), followed by "all are self-clarifying." "Self-clarifying" is the same as self-renewal. Considering the clarifying virtue in the Great Learning, it is a matter of following one's nature, while renewing the people is the work of cultivating the Way. Cultivating the Way means that the ruler enables the people to cultivate their Way, in order to restore the naturalness of their natures and responsibilities. This is the true meaning of teaching. The ruler teaches the people not by imposing from the outside, but by first cultivating himself. Then, what is within him is enriched, and when it emanates outwards, the people are moved by it, all rising up and engaging in self-cultivation. Confucius said, "To govern with virtue is like the North Star, abiding in its place while all the other stars revolve around it" (Analects, Wei Zheng chapter). These words can be used to illuminate this point. Yangming also said, "Below, the sections on governing the state and pacifying the world all speak of the meaning of 'loving' in 'renewing,' such as 'sharing the pleasures and benefits of the people,' 'like caring for infants,' 'loving what the people love, hating what the people hate, this is what it means to be the parents of the people.'" I ask, is governing and pacifying not a matter of renewing the people? It is necessary to cause the people to renew themselves before the state can be governed and the world can be pacified. If the people cannot renew themselves, then even if they are forcibly unified through politics and punishment, even if governance and peace are achieved, it will not last long. As for Yangming's citations of honoring the worthy, loving one's relatives, caring for infants, etc., saying that they all express the meaning of "loving," I say, how can it not be so? Renewing the people is the work of teaching the people, and teaching the people emphasizes moral transformation. The ruler's virtue of transforming the people is only benevolence, and there is no way to practice benevolence other than loving the people. Now, governing and pacifying are matters of renewing the people, and renewing the people is the work of teaching the people. Then, is it not appropriate to emphasize the meaning of loving the people when discussing governing and pacifying? In short, renewing the people is the aim of governing, and loving the people is the method of governing. Loving the people is the means to renew the people, and renewing the people is the effect of loving the people. Therefore, it is said that if we read "loving the people" as "renewing the people" following Cheng Yi, then its meaning is broader, and the meaning of loving the people is also contained within it. Thus, the contention between Zhu and Wang is all about something that is not really there.

Perfect Goodness is the ultimate principle and truth of all things, which the Doctrine of the Mean calls "sincerity." People's thoughts and actions, as seen in their dealings with people and affairs, should all be based on the ultimate principle and truth, without the faults of excess or deficiency. This is what is called "the Mean." The effect of clarifying virtue on knowledge is the recognition of this principle, which is knowledge. On action, it is benevolence that embodies this principle, and courage that promotes this principle. Clarifying virtue means clarifying the virtues of knowledge, benevolence, and courage within one's nature, so that one may recognize the ultimate principle and truth of heaven and earth, and base one's thoughts and actions upon it. Reason leads to the realm where one should abide. This realm where one should abide, though divided into "multitude of principles" and "myriad of affairs," has only one ultimate principle and truth. This one is nothing other than the consistent Way between heaven and earth, which the Doctrine of the Mean calls "not being divided into two things."

### Urban Environment and Criminal Behavior

— Fang Zheng

Most penologists in the past tended towards theories of innate criminality, such as Lombroso's theory of the criminal type, or Tredgold's theory of innate moral deficiency. Recently, sociologists' views have undergone a major shift, and the influence of the environment is gradually being emphasized. This is also due to the gradual rise of human ecology (see Mr. Zhang Qiyun's article in the second issue of this publication) in the history of thought.

Since the publication of Burgess's monograph "The City" in 1925, research in Urban Ecology has flourished. Urban populations are highly mobile. People coming from the countryside may initially be extremely poor and crowded into slums. Through hard work and thrift, their economic status gradually improves, and their living places also change accordingly, perhaps over two or three decades, or one or two generations. Some of these people may even climb from the bottom to the top of the social ladder. As a result, the essence is still these people, but the environment before and after is not the same. This material is most suitable for the study of environmental forces, because under such circumstances, genetic factors can be regarded as constant. Sociologist C.R. Shaw and his school of scholars conducted a study on criminals and the urban environment in Chicago.

They first divided the entire city of Chicago into several districts, and then analyzed the distribution of the backgrounds of 9,243 young offenders based on police court records. The result was that the percentage was highest in slums (close to the city center), lowest in suburban areas, and gradually decreased in a regular manner in intermediate zones. This very regular regional distribution cannot but make people believe that the environment is closely related to criminal behavior. However, possible explanations need not all be environmental determinism. Because this distribution pattern may be innate, that is, those who are psychologically unsound and have low intelligence originally concentrate in slums, the so-called "birds of a feather flock together," and the same unsound types first gather in the lower class areas, rather than the lower class areas making the residents of that area become lower class. Who is the cause and who is the effect must first be studied.

Tulchin, in his 1939 book "Intelligence and Crime," proved that criminals are not necessarily less intelligent than law-abiding people in the same environment, and Dunham further proved that criminals are not necessarily more psychologically unsound than ordinary people. In addition, many research conclusions point to the fact that the psychology of criminals is very close to normal. Furthermore, the same ethnic group has more criminals in slums, and the farther they move out, the smaller the percentage of criminals. This is truly "the spring water is clear in the mountains, but turbid when it leaves the mountains." What does the clarity of the spring water have to do with the water itself?

If we ask why the crime rate is higher in downtown areas and lower in rural areas? The temptations of urban material life are certainly an important reason, but the disintegration of social organization may be a more important crux. In a small town or village, everyone seems to have close ties with the entire community, truly "helping each other in times of trouble and watching out for each other," and personal joys and sorrows are also the joys and sorrows of everyone. After a person enters a big city, he no longer has these connections, and he seems to be an isolated member. Therefore, in the countryside, the power of the community will make his behavior social; in the "uprooted stalk and floating duckweed" metropolis, the power of the community no longer exists intimately, and he dares to act recklessly without any scruples. In other words, in a small place, a person still cares about face and considers social criticism; in a big city, no one respects his face, and he is not afraid of social criticism. Otherwise, the police force in cities is far superior to that in rural areas, so why are there more criminals in cities than in rural areas?

Furthermore, the disintegration of customs and habits in big cities is also an important reason. In large cities, especially in areas where slums are concentrated, people from all directions and all walks of life gather together, and there are different customs and habits. The disparity in standards makes everyone question the traditional morality they are accustomed to. The chaos of morality and the loss of standards of ethics make many people unable to distinguish between right and wrong, and unable to avoid good and evil. This naturally promotes criminal behavior. In addition, criminal behavior is mostly seen and heard, and those who have already lost their opinions are more likely to go astray. Why in this area where dirt and filth are hidden, do some people take advantage of this to make money and organize criminal gangs, systematically educating and promoting these criminal behavior?

This is not an incomprehensible thing either, why the more concentrated the population, the more numb the social consciousness. People living in a small place consider neighborliness a virtue, so neighbors are as concerned as relatives. But a person living in an apartment in New York or Shanghai is also unfamiliar with his neighbors. On the one hand, this is indeed due to the large mobility of the urban population, and on the other hand, it is due to the excessive frequency of social stimulation, which makes social consciousness numb instead. Therefore, from a dense slum to a suburban residential area, the number of people who interact with each other decreases, social stimulation is sparse, and a person is more concerned about the joys and sorrows of his neighbors, the collective consciousness of society increases, and criminal behavior decreases. Therefore, in addition to imitation, social consciousness is a major cause of crime, and all of this can be explained by the environment.

### Hocking on Individualism

— Liren

American philosopher Professor W. E. Hocking has discussed individualism in detail in his book "The Lasting Elements of Individualism." The book gives a fairly detailed account of the pros and cons of individualism. Recently, in his article "Value of the Comparative Study of Philosophy," he has made several remarks involving individualism, which are worthy of our attention. Here, we will selectively introduce his remarks as follows:

Hocking believes that individualism is a slogan in the West. Westerners regard individualism as an ideal, and have more or less incorporated it into the Western legal system. Although Westerners dare not say that they have in fact regarded individuals as sacred, Western law is based on the assumption that individuals have equal rights before the law. At the same time, the system of civil rights and democratic politics is also derived from this point. However, the basis of equal rights of individuals is the equal value of individuals. Does the West in fact attach equal (and "sacred") value to every individual? Hocking believes that this is the problem. The criticism of Western culture by our countrymen takes this as an excuse. Chinese critics have said that Westerners who come to the East often boast of the sacred rights of individuals, but American streetcar companies kill many people every year, and the company authorities refuse to install safety barriers on the streetcars, because the cost of installing such barriers is more than the compensation fees paid by the company every year. It can be seen that in reality, Westerners regard life as a few dollars and cents. What "sacredness" of the individual is just emotion, not principle. Hocking did not refute this criticism, which is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging it.

Secondly, Hocking believes that regarding the individual as the absolute unit of social life, as the source of all rights and powers, is also inconsistent with social facts. In fact, in addition to individual rights, there are also group rights. Failure to recognize group rights is sufficient to weaken the organic life of the country. Therefore, the result of excessive development of individualism actually undermines the unity of collective action and emotion. The demand for individual rights often ignores the sense of public obligation. Hocking believes that this point is also worth considering.

Hocking's above criticism, the first point, points out that Western individualism is not strictly serious, that is, it does not seriously regard everyone as sacred. The second point points out that the drawbacks of individualism are sufficient to destroy the common life of groups or countries. These two criticisms seem to be what people who talk about individualism today should pay attention to.

### The Object of Aesthetic Appreciation

— Han Yuwen

— A Summary of Bosanquet's Aesthetics, Part 3 —

We have said that the simplest aesthetic experience is a pleasant feeling, or the feeling generated for something that is pleasing. In this sense, anything that can evoke pleasant feelings can serve as an object of aesthetic appreciation. From a simple pebble, babbling stream to elegant music, magnificent drama, all can be objects of aesthetic appreciation.

But not all pleasant feelings are aesthetic. Aesthetic feelings must be stable, or permanent; common, or able to be shared and communicated; and related to an object. Pleasure without an object is not an aesthetic feeling. At the same time, aesthetic feeling must arise from or be based on the object itself and cannot be based on anything outside the object. For example, the reason why a stream is an object of aesthetic appreciation is that it is pleasing to the eye and pleasing to the ear. The richness of its shape, color, sound, and reverberation is where the aesthetic mind rests, and where its emotions are entrusted. It is an end in itself, not a means. If you cannot have an aesthetic feeling for the stream itself, but think that it can irrigate fields or bathe in it before you become interested in it, then your pleasure is practical, not aesthetic.

Based on the above three principles to examine the object of aesthetic appreciation, we know that the aesthetic feeling brought by food or taste is the least. Just think, a bowl of rice or a plate of food, when you are full, do you still enjoy eating it? This means that the pleasure of eating and drinking is not stable. Wine is relatively playable, but its emotion is not very stable, and it is too subjective and difficult to communicate. Regarding shape and form, it must be able to convey a surface curve or style, and only when it has a dynamic nature does it have aesthetic feeling, otherwise it is also uninteresting. Generally speaking, aesthetic feeling arises from seeing and hearing, and shape, color, and tone are the main objects of aesthetic appreciation.

The shapes, colors, tones, etc. mentioned here are naturally representations in the aesthetic mind, rather than independent realities or formless nature; because anything that cannot be contemplated or represented is not conducive to the realization of emotions, that is, it cannot become an aesthetic object. At the same time, this representation is a perceptual or imaginative representation, not a knowledge phenomenon. For example, an aesthetic image is not just a spatial image in geometry; aesthetic colors and tones are not just colors and sounds in physics. The object recognized by science is an abstract, mechanical, quantitative relationship, or a dead material trace. For example, the water recognized by science is hydrogen dioxide, clouds are water vapor in the air, and mountains are accumulations of minerals, etc. Although the aesthetic mind does not necessarily reject these traces, it can penetrate these traces and reach their essence; for example, in water, it sees its flowing, dynamic, and lively, and it is condensed without being stagnant; in clouds, it sees its detached, unrestrained, and contented; in mountains, it sees its solemn, majestic, still, and ever-new, etc., every grass and every stone is nothing but a revelation of the secrets of heaven and an expression of life. This is the true object of aesthetic appreciation. It is a still and contemplative representation, but it is realistic, truthful, complete, and integrated. It is a unity of subject and object, a blending of spirit and form, and a manifestation of reason and emotion. It transcends all common and natural or real things. All worldly knowledge, such as historical records, causal explanations, component analyses, and market price estimations, are irrelevant to it.

### From Mathematics to Philosophy

— Xie Youwei

—Russell's Autobiography, Part 2—

The childhood of the British philosopher Bertrand Russell has been described in the previous article (Issue 3 of this publication). This great contemporary thinker first studied mathematics. How he turned from mathematics to philosophy, and the changes in his philosophical thoughts, he himself has a fairly detailed autobiography. Now, we will introduce it again based on his autobiography.

After Russell went to Cambridge University, his life changed greatly. He found many friends who could talk about academics. He and many friends with similar interests often gathered to chat. Every Saturday night, they often talked late into the night. The next day, Sunday, after they had breakfast together, they went for a walk all day. They talked about everything, in addition to what they were studying, poetry, philosophy, politics, and ethics were also topics of conversation. At that time, they felt that "the world seemed solid and hopeful." They were all convinced that the progress of the nineteenth century could continue, and that they themselves could each make valuable contributions. Russell believed that the happiness of that period was unimaginable to the young people after the Great War of 1914. Whitehead (A.N. Whitehead), who wrote "Principia Mathematica". Whitehead was a few years older than Russell. When Russell entered Cambridge, Whitehead was already a researcher and lecturer. The second was McTaggart, who was famous for studying Hegel's philosophy. The third was Moore (G.E. Moore), who was famous for refuting idealism. In addition, the Davasa brothers, who had jointly translated Plato's "Republic", and Charles Sanger, a mathematician, were his close friends.

Russell said that during the four years of painting at Cambridge, he studied mathematics for the first three years. All his energy was spent on mathematics, and he had no time to read philosophy books. It was not until the fourth year that he began to study philosophy. At that time, there were three teachers who taught him philosophy: one was Henry Sidgwick, who was famous for his book "The Methods of Ethics", and he represented the British philosophical point of view. The second was James Ward, who proposed Kant's system and introduced Russell to the books of Lotze and Sigwart. The third was G.F. Stout, who praised F.H. Bradley very much, and believed that Bradley's book "Appearance and Reality" did the work that humans could do on ontology. He studied philosophy for a year, but he did not decide to specialize in philosophy. He left Cambridge in 1894. After leaving Cambridge, he worked as an attache at the British Embassy in Paris for several months. He was not satisfied with this work and soon resigned. After resigning, he got married. After marriage, he lived in Berlin for almost a year, studying economics and German social democratic thought. Later, he traveled to the United States. After returning to China from his trip, he closed the door to read books, reading mathematics and philosophy during the day, and reciting history aloud at night.

Russell became involved with mathematics at the age of eleven, and he spent most of his time studying mathematics at Cambridge. Why did he turn from mathematics to philosophy? According to his autobiography, there seem to be two reasons: one is that he discovered that he had sufficient ability to study philosophy. His thesis for the researcher's scholarship, on the basis of geometry, was highly praised by Walter and Whitehead. He said that without their encouragement, he would have studied economics instead of philosophy. The second is that he first got the opportunity to teach philosophy at the university. In 1998, McTaggart, who was supposed to teach Leibniz's philosophy at Cambridge University, asked Russell to substitute for this course because he was going to New Zealand to visit his relatives. Russell agreed. After the lecture, he wrote a book "Philosophy of Leibniz" (1900). He thought that this book was fortunate for him, otherwise he might not have specialized in philosophy.

Regarding his philosophical views, he initially tended towards idealism. When he was studying at Cambridge, his thoughts were greatly influenced by McTaggart and Stout. McTaggart introduced him to the philosophy of Hegel. He prompted him to believe that British empiricism was superficial, and that the depth of Hegel's philosophy was unmatched by Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Mill. Stout urged him to study Bradley's philosophy. At this time, he can be said to be a follower of the Hegelian school. He read that one day in 1894, he was walking on Trinity Lane at Cambridge University, and suddenly he had a flash of inspiration, and he felt that the "Ontological argument" was correct. He went out to buy a can of tobacco, and when he came back, he threw the tobacco can into the air, caught it, and shouted: "My God! The ontological argument is right." At this time, he was reading Bradley's books very enthusiastically. Among modern philosophers, Bradley was the one he admired the most. This idealistic tendency of his lasted for several years, until it was abandoned in 1898. The main reason why he abandoned idealism was the influence of Moore. Moore, like him, had once been a believer in Hegel's philosophy. Moore was the first to oppose idealism, and Russell followed him. Both of them were dissatisfied with Bradley's theory at that time. Bradley believed that everything that common sense believes is a phenomenon, not reality. The two of them went to the other extreme, believing that everything that common sense assumes to be true is true. They even believed that even if no one saw it, the grass was still green, the sun and stars still existed, and they believed that there was a world of many eternal Platonic ideals. In this way, Russell turned from idealism to the camp of new realism.

We all know that Russell's contribution to philosophy seems to be not in his pure philosophy, but in his mathematical logic. The "Principia Mathematica" co-authored with Whitehead, regardless of its shortcomings, has become the "Bible" for modern researchers of mathematical logic. Almost anyone who studies mathematical logic, without reading this book, is not qualified to talk about this discipline. Why did he have the plan to write this book? According to his autobiography, it was like this: in 1900, he participated in the World Philosophy Conference held in Paris. At the conference, he met the Italian mathematician Peano. He felt that the thoughts and words of Peano and his disciples were extremely accurate. He asked Peano to give him the book. Peano gave it to him. He returned to study it carefully, and after becoming familiar with his symbols, he discovered new symbols about "Relations". He asked Whitehead to cooperate to write the book "Principia Mathematica". Whitehead agreed. The first volume of this book was published in 1910, which laid the foundation for Russell's academic status.

— Winter Clothing Donation Drive

Jing Wen

The winter clothing donation drive recently launched by the Shanghai student community can be said to be the most meaningful event in Shanghai society in 1947.

I have always been most afraid of listening to the sermons of high-minded idealists. In the eyes of these people, the work of relief and charity is meaningless, because relief and charity cannot make up for the deformed relations of the current society, and charity is just a social morbidity. Can you save all the poor people in the world? What's more, many beggars are born with "cheap bones", and giving them alms is just harming them...

Theoretically speaking, their theory is indeed the most thorough, but in terms of human nature, their intentions are the most terrible. Because, without asking whether this theory is entirely correct, to obliterate the facts before one's eyes because of theory, to turn a blind eye to the tragic scenes of human life, and to regard humanitarian behavior as a psychological weakness of certain people, their intentions are unbearable to hear!

One of the noblest characteristics of mankind is compassion. Compassion alone may not solve the root problem, but compared with those who are obsessed with lofty ideals and empty talk and are indifferent to reality, people with compassion are ultimately more beneficial to the well-being of real society.

This time, the winter clothing drive launched by Shanghai students, with thousands and tens of thousands of pieces of old cotton clothing, may not solve the long-term living problems of hundreds of thousands of poor people, but compared with those who sing "behind vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while on the road lie frozen corpses", and only cast a indifferent glance at the human beings who are waiting to die from hunger and cold under the reed mats in the humble alleys, can you bear to say that it is completely meaningless?

The winter clothing drive not only brings some warmth to the bodies of the poor, but also gives them some spiritual warmth. Many people may unconsciously hide a "heart" in themselves that has long been hardened by the tempering of daily life. In the downtown area, we see activities of snatching cold rice almost every day, and from time to time we see abandoned babies or corpses on the deserted roads. Foreigners who come to Shanghai for the first time are all surprised to see this phenomenon, but most Shanghai people have long regarded it as a "routine", because their "hearts" have long been hardened by the environment.

The definition of "heart". Apart from a heart in the physiological sense, it is originally difficult to make a judgment. However, it is probably not wrong to regard compassion as a high manifestation of psychological and spiritual nature. The students in Shanghai, as well as the rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers who helped the students to transport winter clothing for free, showed this valuable compassion in this voluntary action of soliciting winter clothing for their poor compatriots. And what is more commendable is that this act of righteousness not only brought some benefits to the frozen and starving people, but also taught the students themselves a practical sociology course.

A certain Western newspaper said in a feature article that the students in this city discovered a "new world" in this winter clothing drive. This is correct. Although the students in Shanghai also know that there is a large group of poor people in our society, but after all, how poor, how they live their lives, I am afraid they may not have known in the past, thinking that people who eat pancakes and fried dough sticks every day are already extremely poor. But now they have discovered from the "new world" that there are even poorer people who regard pancakes and fried dough sticks as luxury foods, and reed mats and tattered cotton as "golden houses"! Can you say that this is not the most practical sociology course?

Intellectuals often have a common problem, that is, they can talk but cannot act, or they are afraid to act. Especially the intellectuals in our country, who have always been heavily burdened by the hat of "scholars", so they tend to be more extreme in theory and more isolated from real life. Although the student movement in China has tried to contact real society many times since the May Fourth Movement, it has repeatedly been beaten back by disputes over theories and doctrines. Although this student winter clothing drive was not as sensational as previous student movements, it has more real social significance. Because it helped a part of the poor to barely survive the cold winter, and it also helped to awaken the human compassion that was about to be extinguished.

### The Beard of Jin Wuzhu

— Zheng Guoyi

The novel "Yue Zhuan" is the most flawed. Its narratives often fabricate and distort the facts, straying far from the truth. However, the common people love it and regard it as a masterpiece. Consequently, the story of Yue's mother tattooing words on his back has become a popular tale for later generations. Even scholars often mention it in their writings and conversations, which is especially ridiculous! (When visiting the temple of Prince Yue of E, I saw a casual conversation that also touched upon this matter. It is evident that these people only enjoy novels and do not read books. A magnificent temple filled with such folk tales from Qi Dong is something the readers do not perceive, further making people laugh uncontrollably. Unfortunately, as years have passed, the author and the original sentence are no longer remembered.) Reading history books, one has never said that Yue Fei's devotion to the country came from his mother's teachings. Even Yue Ke's "Jin Tuo Cui Bian," which praised his ancestor (Fei) in great detail, does not mention Yue's mother at all. One wonders how Madam Yao (Yue's mother) attained such a great reputation after her death. Furthermore, Song Dynasty scholars have repeatedly stated that Yue Fei was a reincarnation of a pig spirit, which is why he ultimately suffered a violent death. Although this is speculation, it can provide material for conversation. The novel "Yue Zhuan" describes Yue Fei as a Roc bird descending to earth, which corresponds to the names "Fei" and "Peng Ju." This is completely unfounded. As for the story of Jin Wuzhu being the reincarnation of a red-bearded dragon, it lacks even more substance. However, since he is portrayed as a red dragon, he should naturally have a beard. However, the actors who play Wuzhu in various scenes, from Hong'an Zhou to Fengbo Pavilion, never have a beard, as if Wuzhu were beardless. This does not match the image of a "red beard." I recently read "Jin Shi Ji Shi Ben Mo," which quotes Xue Yingqi's "Tong Jian," mentioning that Wuzhu cut off his beard to escape during the battle of Heishiyuan. This not only proves that Wuzhu had a beard, but also that Wuzhu cut it off. Few people know this. Therefore, I present this excerpt to correct the mistaken portrayal of Wuzhu in dramas.

Ping Yingqi's "Tong Jian" states: "Wu Jie carefully assessed the number of soldiers. He repeatedly defeated the Jin soldiers at Heishiyuan, accumulating grain, repairing weapons, and preparing to defend to the death... Wuzhu gathered more than 100,000 soldiers from various tribes, built a pontoon bridge across the Wei River, and set up a fortified camp from Jiji to Yunzhu, building stone walls to confront the official army. Although attacking Heishiyuan, Jie and his younger brother fired arrows in shifts, forming a 'resident team,' with arrows flying continuously. When the enemy retreated slightly, they used surprise attacks from the flanks to cut off their supply lines. Predicting their eventual exhaustion and retreat, they set up an ambush at Shenlei. When the enemy reached the ambush, they were thrown into great confusion. They then launched a night attack, inflicting a great defeat. Wuzhu barely escaped with his life, shaving off his beard and mustache as he fled."

Since Wuzhu started attacking the Song Dynasty, he suffered the greatest losses in Liu Qi's victory at Shunchang and in this battle. Wu Jie's defense of Sichuan was crucial to the survival of the Southern Song Dynasty. The Battle of Heishiyuan was a matter of life and death, with significant consequences. Furthermore, Wuzhu had a desperate moment of cutting off his beard, which could be depicted. However, neither novels nor dramas have taken this into account, which has prevented Wu Jie's name from becoming widely known among the common people. This is the misfortune of Prince Fu (Wu Jie). "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" describes how Emperor Wu of Wei (Cao Cao) also cut off his beard to escape from Ma Chao, which is a fabrication. It is likely based on this story. However, people only know about Cao Cao cutting off his beard, and not about Wuzhu's incident. This study reveals the source of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"'s embellishments. Furthermore, in the portraits of Yue Zhongwu Wang of the Song Dynasty, Yue Wang actually has no beard. However, in dramas, except for the scene of spear-picking Little Prince Liang, all actors portraying Yue Fei have beards (even the statues in the Yue Temple in West Lake have overly long beards. If that's the case in the temple, there's even less to say about the dramas.) Wuzhu should have a beard but doesn't, while Yue Fei shouldn't have a beard but does. This is also an interesting anecdote.

### Remembering "Changdian" (Part 1)

— Ji Yong

Just as the New Year was approaching, I suddenly saw the news of another fire at the Beijing Normal College, and my heart sank again. Although I have been away from the old capital for more than ten years, the feelings are increasingly intimate. Moreover, I had a four-year relationship with this school. People who have lived in Beijing for a long time probably know about the "fires" at the Normal University. In my memory, there have been at least four major fires, each resulting in considerable losses. The most recent one was in the winter of 1933, fifteen years ago. In terms of fires, it seems too frequent. In terms of life and world affairs, it is also a period of continuous change. Over the past fifteen years, it fits Du Fu's words: "Hearing that Chang'an is like a game of chess, a hundred years of world affairs are filled with sadness. The mansions of princes and nobles all have new masters, and the clothes and hats of civil and military officials are different from the past." Moreover, thinking of "classmates who were young and not humble," one will feel even more melancholy. Some people say that the Normal University is located on the old site of the Fire God Temple. Once destroyed, the god will naturally be angry. This cannot be verified, but not far from here is another Fire God Temple, the so-called Cultural Commercial Center. Because of this, one cannot help but think of Changdian, the most lively New Year market in Beijing.

Changdian is the center of Liulichang Cultural Street. There is a small open space there called Haiyu Village Park. It is said that a Liao Dynasty stone carving was unearthed here in the early Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was known as Haiwang Village, probably a suburb. Opposite Haiwang Village is the kiln factory that burned glazed tiles in the Ming Dynasty, which is now the Normal School, the pre-war Normal University. Yan Song's inscription on the Liulichang Kiln Factory has been moved from a dark corner of the wall to the wall of the water tower, shining brightly in the morning sun. In terms of buying books, the Normal University should be the most fortunate. Less than 500 steps south of the school gate are the dazzling "Changsi" (bookstores): Suyi Zhai, Lai Xun Ge, Tou Chi Jian, where you can browse as you please. But don't dislike the boss for being arrogant. They don't even greet you. You must know that they deal with Hu Shi and Zhao Feiyun. The Beijing Library and Song Gongfu (Peking University Library) are their frequent haunts. They can enter the main hall with a blue cloth wrapper, unlike you, who need a rare book reading certificate to open the door to the real treasures. ——Where do the real treasures come from? You have to thank them for their efforts in collecting them. Although the Wanli edition of the "Jin Ping Mei" was bought from a "noble family" in Shanxi for a few dozen yuan and sold to the Beijing Library for a thousand or so, imagine if there were no these guys, wouldn't you still have to treat the Chongzhen edition as your ancestor? As long as your status is high enough, you can ask to see anything——for example, the Sino-Japanese issue. I guarantee that within a week, even materials you wouldn't have thought of will be on the catalog, placed next to your writing desk. Do you think they would take notice of an unknown university student? So I advise you to be patient. Moreover, you really don't have that much money, because the Normal University has always been known for being "poor."

I love reading Li Nanjian's "Records of Liulichang Bookstores." The article was written in the Daoguang and Xianfeng eras. By the time Miao Xiaoshan wrote the preface in the Guangxu era, he was already lamenting the changes in the world. Now, fifty years later, I don't know how much more has changed. We certainly have more reason to sigh than Miao Xiaoshan, but we can't write such a good article. Here, I want to say that Changdian is not just those deep-seated and knowledgeable old men who are familiar with the monthly book lists. Moreover, on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the area near Haiwang Village becomes a temporary market. The ancient people called it "hundred plays are displayed," which is about the same. In the past, it was only on the first day of the Lunar New Year. After the revolution, it was moved to the Gregorian New Year. However, the Lunar New Year is still inevitable and is resurrected under the name of the Spring Festival. When it was first changed to the Gregorian New Year, the vendors opposed it. After several forced attempts, they reluctantly participated. The Lunar New Year was not allowed to be set up again, but it was finally broken through by human relations. From then on, it was like our New Year, with the old and new running in parallel. Changdian then extended from before the Lunar New Year to the twentieth day of the first month of the Lunar New Year.

### Witty People and Witty Things

— Wen Jie

Although General Dwight D. Eisenhower achieved great military feats, he was a peace-loving person. He firmly believed that education was the best weapon against war. In a speech at a graduation ceremony, he said: "Your profession should aim to make us unemployed."

In a physics class at West Point Military Academy, a physics teacher was lecturing on atomic theory. He wrote an equation on the blackboard, saying that this equation was related to the problem of several electron changes. Then he filled the entire blackboard with equations. Finally, he said, "You see, there are five fewer electrons than at the beginning. Where have these five electrons gone?"

No one in the classroom made a sound. The teacher asked loudly again, "Everyone, where have these five electrons gone?" The situation seemed serious. At this time, a student in the back row loudly ordered, "No one is allowed to leave this classroom. We have to search it!"

One day, a famous lawyer was sitting in his office when a woman rushed in and immediately declared that she wanted to divorce her husband.

The lawyer asked, "On what grounds?"

She replied that she believed her husband was unfaithful to her.

"On what evidence do you believe your husband is unfaithful to you?"

The woman replied, "Because I firmly believe that he is not the father of my child."

Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands visited the United States and West Point Military Academy. The school authorities had arranged the welcoming program very carefully beforehand, but they forgot one thing: they had not planned what music the military band should play. So when the Queen arrived, the band conductor ordered to play his favorite song, which was called: "This gray old mare, she is no longer as before."

Once, a charity ball was held, and George Bernard Shaw attended. During the ball, he invited an old maid to dance.

While dancing, the old maid asked Shaw, "Why did you choose me to dance with you?"

Shaw replied, "Isn't this a charity ball?"

A beggar grabbed the sleeve of a kind-faced passerby and pleaded, "Please give me five minutes to have a cup of coffee, sir!"

The passerby turned around and looked him up and down, asking, "Why should I give you money? How did you come to this?"

The beggar replied, "Because of a very unfortunate disaster, sir. Two years ago, I was like you, a very respectable businessman. On my desk was a motto: 'Thinking must be precise, and doing must be decisive!' Business was booming, but then... then..." The beggar's body trembled, "...then the woman who cleaned the room burned my motto."

Two writers rented a house from a landlord for a term of one year. The landlord promised to repaint the house for them.

Later, the two writers saw that the landlord had no intention of fulfilling his promise, so they asked a lawyer to make another contract with the landlord, allowing them to pay for the house to be painted themselves. The landlord naturally signed it happily.

Two days before moving out, they painted the entire house black.

### Short Story

— Mao Yi

The current British taxes are very heavy, so tax evasion is inevitable. The following short story was published in London's "Evening Standard."

A wealthy businessman went to the hospital for surgery. Afterwards, the surgeon presented a bill for $1,680 (four hundred something guineas, each guinea equals twenty-one shillings).

"I'm not trying to deny it," the patient told the doctor, "because I can afford this bill. But, you know, under the current differential tax, I have to earn at least $64,000 to pay your $1,680 bill?"

The doctor admitted this. The patient continued, "You are a first-class doctor. You must also be paying heavy taxes. How much do you estimate you can actually get out of the $1,680?"

The doctor calculated roughly for a moment and announced, "About a hundred and eight dollars."

"So," the patient said, "in order to pay you one hundred and eight dollars, I have to earn sixty-four thousand dollars. How about we settle this bill with a case of whiskey?"

"Deal," the doctor said.

### Money and Culture

— Xuan Xuan

In recent years, in addition to having great respect for compatriots who are fully equipped with American equipment, the author has also been paying attention to the criticisms of American culture by qualified people. However, limited by time and economics, even a superficial understanding is impossible. As far as memory serves, the notable ones are the views of Soviet reportage writer Ilya Ehrenburg, the views of Chen Hengzhe, who represents Chinese intellectuals, and the views of American journalist John Gunther. Although the latter feels magnificent, it is not as subtle as the former two. But regardless, they all have valuable insights and don't simply equate understanding America with knowing which brand of American rayon is the best.

Recently, I also saw the views of a Colombian named Lozano, who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia. After returning from a long trip to the United States, he published his impressions of American culture in a newspaper, which is quite thought-provoking.

The following is Lozano's view:

"Americans are the Romans of today. Material greatness, technological perfection, combined with million-dollar dowagers and beautiful women, are enough to make people ignore their young and simple souls.

"American university education is mediocre because, first, it pays too much attention to sports, and second, the value of academic subjects is not properly distinguished. American law schools that specialize in practical skills only produce lawyers, not jurists. (Note: Hu Shi once criticized Japanese culture, saying that Japan only has professors, not scholars.) Medical schools only focus on laboratories and X-rays, and do not have the European type of clinical research methods.

"After Franklin, when Americans were expanding westward, American culture was declining, except for Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe. (Note: Frank Harris also lamented that the energetic Americans mistreated the geniuses of Whitman and Poe.) Now America is trying to create culture again. American glory, architecture, and books lack the elegance of old cultures, but this is only because Americans are not yet mature, and we cannot demand intellectual penetration. We are older than North Americans, much older... but culture follows wealth... Today's America does not have Goethe, Shakespeare, Kant, or Dostoevsky, but there are millions of people working hard to achieve it."

Although the above words are only partial, the author believes that they are worth pondering. Although Americans are mediocre and superficial, America has vitality, and vitality leads to creation. American flashy newspapers and books certainly cannot represent profound civilization, but having a four-thousand-year history and today's bookstores only printing the "Siku Quanshu Beiyao" for decoration and the "Writing Letters Without Asking Others" for practical use does not count as preserving national essence. Moreover, if this continues, not only will the national essence not be fully preserved, but probably only some national dross will be left.

Lozano is right; culture follows wealth. If a country is poor and the people are poor, there will be no culture. Even if there is historical culture, it is only for wealthy foreign archaeologists to excavate. They can't even take care of themselves. In times of widespread poverty, hearing Lozano's words is especially alarming.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Zhenyan

Chapter Six A Night Such as This (33)

Zhu Zhai was about to thank her when he heard Qi Huan say, "Do you know what this is?" Zhu Zhai said, "Pearl." Qi Huan said, "No, it's 'Change Pearl.' 'Change Pearl' is my nickname. You must remember it." As she spoke, she tilted her head slightly, tossed her beautiful hair back, and smiled with autumn waves in her eyes, extremely charming. In this situation, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but tightly grasp her hand and say, "Thank you. You gave me something precious that you wear close to your body. What can I give you in return? I can only offer you my sincere heart." Qi Huan tightened Zhu Zhai's tightly grasped hand and said, "That's what I've been longing for. I'm so grateful to you! From today onwards, my soul has gained a kind of comfort." She slightly tilted her head to the left and leaned it on Zhu Zhai's shoulder, saying softly, "Zhu, in a few hours, we will be parting. Do you have anything else to tell me?" Zhu Zhai said, "I only hope that you go early and come back early, so that we can meet again soon!" These words didn't seem to be what Qi Huan was hoping for. She shook her head several times while leaning on Zhu Zhai's shoulder and said, "I'm afraid I won't be able to come back in a short period of time, because after the performance in Jinan, the Qingdao Guanglu Theater will definitely invite me. Since I'm coming to Jinan, I can't help but go to Qingdao. In this case, how can I come back in a short period of time? I hope you can send me a letter every two or three days, telling me in detail about the situation here. Can you promise me?" Zhu Zhai said, "Of course I can do that. Besides, there's another important matter that I need you to promise." Qi Huan immediately turned her head, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and listened attentively with a smile. Zhu Zhai said, "I ask you, you——you——don't drink as much as you did today. Alcohol can hurt people. You have to take care of your voice!" Qi Huan frowned and said, "I don't like to drink! Sometimes I feel sad, so I have no choice but to drink, to use the contents of the cup to numb my brain. Now that my heart has found comfort, I won't drink anymore!" After saying that, she pulled Zhu Zhai up and together they went to her bedroom, sitting side by side on the edge of the bed, repeating, "Zhu! In a few hours, I'll be leaving. Do you have anything else to tell me? I have many things to tell you, but I don't know where to start!" Zhu Zhai said, "Isn't that how I feel! In short, we met very late!" Qi Huan said, "No! I don't think it's too late." Zhu Zhai felt that this sentence fully expressed Qi Huan's intention, giving him a special opportunity, but he didn't have the courage himself. Thinking about it, he gradually lowered his head. Qi Huan saw that he didn't answer, looked at him, and also restrained her smile. Just then, the door moved, and Little Wang Ma walked in holding a pair of lacquer tea trays. On the trays were two teacups, a plate of peeled pears, and a plate of olives. She placed the tea and fruit from the tea trays on the tea table and said with a smile, "The boss drank a lot of wine today. I made two cups of Pu'er tea and two plates of fruit to help sober up." Qi Huan said, "I was just thinking of buying some fruit, but you've already prepared it." Zhu Zhai smiled and said to Little Wang Ma, "Like master, like servant." Little Wang Ma said, "Mr. Xu! You're joking. What master! What servant! I don't understand at all." As she spoke, she went out with a laugh.

Social Service

### Overview of the "Social Service" Business of the Central Daily News in the Past Year

— Ji Ping

Now is the beginning of the year 37 of the Republic of China. The earth is returning to spring, and everything is renewed. Everyone feels excited and happy! However, at this New Year, we must review the past, encourage the future, discard all the previous corruption, and gradually unfold all the good things from now on. If everyone can have such a view, society will have the hope of progress. This column has a responsibility to speak out and discuss the "social service" aspect in general terms with readers. This newspaper has always attached great importance to "social service." Usually, all work is not just empty talk on paper, but doing practical things, serving readers, and serving society. In the past year, we have done several meaningful works. Due to limited space, we can only express them in statistical figures as follows:

Free treatment for trachoma, with a total of 617 people treated free of charge throughout the year, in cooperation with the Nanshi Relief Hospital. From early May to the end of June, a total of 9,573 people were examined over two months, in cooperation with eleven major hospitals, including Zhongshan, Zhongmei, Renji, Gongji, Hongren, Guangci, Hongqiao, Nanyang, Municipal Second, Municipal Fourth, and the Tuberculosis Center Clinic. Furthermore, in cooperation with the Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic, 115 people received free or half-price X-rays. Free assisted childbirth, from February to December, a total of 238 poor pregnant women were hospitalized for childbirth, and both mothers and children were safe and sound, in cooperation with four hospitals, including Renhe, Shangxian, Baoli, and the First Hospital of the Red Cross (the Hui Sheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital also joined the cooperation today). A total of more than 32 million yuan was paid. Free dental treatment, from August to December, 252 people applied for treatment, in cooperation with the Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai Dental College. Scholarships: This year, 354 poor college and middle school students were subsidized, with a total of more than 320 million yuan in full subsidies. Relief for the lonely, widowed, poor, and sick: Over the past year, a total of 112 people were approved to receive relief funds, and more than 100 people were given temporary relief funds. A total of more than 20 million yuan in relief funds were distributed. Job introduction: The news of the Shanghai Job Introduction Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the China Vocational Guidance Institute's recruitment of talents is often published, so that people can get their jobs and things can get their people, and the number is considerable. (To be continued)

### Exemption from "Inheritance Tax"

Two readers of this newspaper, Zhao Gongxiong and Zhou Shuzhi, have repeatedly inquired about which items can be exempted from inheritance tax. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau's response is as follows: "According to Article 4 of the Inheritance Tax Law, the following types of inheritance can be exempted from inheritance tax: 1. Estates with a total value of less than one million yuan; 2. Estates of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army, navy, and air force who die in battle or are injured in wartime service, not exceeding five million yuan; 3. Books and articles related to culture, history, and fine arts in the estate, if the heirs declare preservation and registration to the inheritance tax authorities, but the tax must still be paid if the heirs transfer these books and articles; 4. Property donated to government agencies at all levels; 5. Property donated to schools, hospitals, and libraries, not exceeding two million yuan; 6. The copyright of the deceased and the patent rights for academic inventions or self-created works of art. If there is an estate distributed in the occupied areas of the Communist bandits, the levy will be temporarily suspended during the occupation period."
