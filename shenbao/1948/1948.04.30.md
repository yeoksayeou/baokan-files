[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The National Assembly held its fourth vice-presidential election assembly on the morning of the 29th. As a result, Li Zongren was elected as the first vice president of the Republic of China under the Constitution with a larger majority of 1,438 votes. The citizens of the capital were as concerned as ever. From the beginning of the voting, they gathered in front of radio broadcasting machines to listen to the entire election process, calculating the ebb and flow of the votes of the two candidates with tense hearts. Finally, upon hearing that the first vice president had been legally produced, they cheered loudly, national flags fluttered all over the streets, firecrackers could be heard everywhere, and they joyfully celebrated the completion of the final task of this National Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Li Zongren issued a written statement on the 29th after being elected as Vice President, saying: "I am deeply grateful for the strong support of all representatives and the enthusiastic support of people across the country for my election as the first Vice President. The smooth progress of this conference is truly due to the deep understanding of the significance of constitutional government by the people of the country and the spiritual appeal of Chairman Chiang. After being elected, I will naturally adhere to my consistent advocacy, assist the Head of State, reform the administration, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance and supervision at any time so that I can live up to their trust. All the gentlemen who participated in this election are highly respected and admired by the people of the country. Although they were not elected, I firmly believe that after the establishment of the new government, their sincerity in serving the country and their responsibility to share the difficulties will be no less than my own."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] When Li Zongren was in Anle Hall, he gave a speech at the request of reporters, saying: "I am very grateful and very excited that this election has achieved final success. This victory is not only my personal victory, but also the victory of all the representatives. From now on, I am determined to assist the President with sincerity, be loyal to the country, and serve the nation." When Mr. Li returned to his residence, dozens of Chinese and foreign reporters gathered at his residence, all asking Mr. Li to give a speech. Mr. Li replied to the reporters: "From now on, I am determined to absolutely obey the President and walk the same path as the President. Now is a time of suppression of rebellion, and only suppression of rebellion can save the lives of the people." When a reporter asked when he would return to Peiping and whether he would continue to serve as the director of the Parallel Headquarters, Li replied: "It needs to be decided after I pay my respects to Chairman Chiang for instructions."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The Li Zongren Election Committee held a press reception at 8:00 PM on the 29th and invited Mr. and Mrs. Li and Bai Chongxi to attend. In his speech, Mr. Li mentioned that although there were minor setbacks during the election process, they were finally calmed down, and good order was maintained in the midst of tension, so that the meeting could proceed smoothly. He said: "Now that I have been elected, I am determined to assist President Chiang and pay more attention to the welfare of the grassroots of society." He emphasized that politics needs change, and change leads to progress. If politics can be effectively reformed, there will be no problem with suppressing the rebellion. This is the unanimous expectation and confidence of the people of the country. He is willing to assist President Chiang in this effort, and believes that President Chiang will have bold actions in expanding the political base and attracting talents from all over the country. From then on, following the rule of law, clarifying political ethics, and strictly enforcing official discipline will lead to international sympathy and public confidence. The future of suppressing rebellion and building the country will surely be brighter, and success can be achieved sooner." He hoped that the public opinion circle would exert the invincible democratic power, and be the sensitive and correct ears and eyes for the people, so that the public opinion circle's reports would clarify right and wrong, so as to enhance the democratic foundation. Mrs. Li Zongren, Guo Dejie, was exhausted for days, and her voice was lost, so she only made a simple speech. Bai Chongxi also delivered a speech saying: "The victory of Director Li is a victory of democracy. From now on, the people of the country will exert greater democratic power and work together to suppress the rebellion." Then the reporters asked Mr. Li to frequently announce the good news of assisting President Chiang in carrying out political reforms to the people. Finally, Mr. and Mrs. Li were lifted up for photographs again, and the event ended happily at 9:00 PM.

### The Process of Voting and Counting Votes in the Fourth Election

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The National Assembly's fourth vice-presidential election meeting began at 9:37 AM on the 29th. Chairman Yu Bin first had Secretary-General Hong read the Chairman's report, and then Chairman Yu answered two inquiries. Regarding the establishment of the Committee for the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction, it had been approved by the State Council of the National Government, but the person in charge had not yet been determined. As for the problem of invalid votes, Secretary-General Hong was asked to report. At that time, Representative Jia Guoen also made two suggestions: one was that the problem of identifying questionable votes should be solved simultaneously for each ballot box, so as to avoid concentrating the final identification of valid votes, which would affect emotions and order; and the other was that Chairman Yu Bin should participate in the inspection of the ballots to show solemnity. Secretary-General Hong reported that the Secretariat and Chairman Yu had adopted Jia's two suggestions, and then read out the criteria for identifying invalid votes as listed in Article 15 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election Voting and Ballot Counting Methods, and explained the precautions for writing and folding ballots in terms of technology for the conference to refer to. At 10:00 AM, the voting began. Secretary-General Hong and Chairman Yu, due to inquiries from representatives, reiterated the explanation of the difference between the number of representatives present at the meeting and the number of voters, because the number of people at the meeting was the number of people who attended the routine report, to indicate that there were enough to meet the legal quorum. Representatives who arrived after the meeting could vote before the voting was over, so the number of votes must be more than the number of people who attended the meeting. Yu also pointed out that each representative received a ballot with an attendance certificate, and the number was definitely correct. At 10:16 AM, the ballot reception and voting began. At 11:00 AM, all the attendees had voted. After Yu Bin and Zhao Yushi voted successively at 11:04 AM, Chairman Yu announced the end of the voting and a recess. At 11:18 AM, he announced the continuation of the meeting and the counting of votes. At 11:37 AM, Sun Ke's ballot was read out first. In the tense mood of the attendees, the twelve ballot boxes were opened in succession. The counting of the last two ballot boxes was even more tense, and there was more and more private talk in the representative seats. Before the twelfth ballot box had been opened, the situation of Li Zongren's election had been determined, and the supporters of Sun Ke left one after another. At 1:04 PM, the twelfth ballot box was opened, and cheers rang out in the representative seats. Li Zongren's wife, Guo Dejie, was surrounded by reporters. After a while, Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,766 ballots had been issued, 2,761 ballots had been cast, and excluding 28 invalid ballots, there were 2,733 valid ballots. Finally, Chairman Yu announced: "The results of the fourth vice-presidential election meeting on April 29, 37th year of the Republic of China: (1) Mr. Li Zongren received 1,438 votes, (2) Mr. Sun Ke received 1,295 votes, according to Article 5 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law, the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the same law shall apply: 'Select one of the top two candidates with the most votes in the third round, and the one with the most votes shall be elected.' The voting result today is that Mr. Li Zongren received the most votes and is legally elected as the Vice President of the Republic of China." At 1:05 PM, the meeting was adjourned.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] After Li Zongren was elected Vice President, as soon as the news spread, he happened to be at Bai Chongxi's residence. He immediately drove to Bailing Restaurant, Chongqing Anle Hall, Quyuan Restaurant, Central Hotel and other places to thank the National Assembly representatives who supported his election, and accepted the warm cheers of the representatives and the people. Every time he arrived at a place, he heard the sound of firecrackers, and was surrounded by representatives and others, the situation was warm, which formed a direct proportion to the tense situation of the election in recent days. Mr. Li shook hands with each representative to express his gratitude. He then returned to his residence in Dafang Lane with his wife. At that time, those who went to Mr. Li's residence to offer congratulations were in an endless stream. Yu Bin, Chairman of the 29th Assembly, and Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General, went to offer their greetings before Mr. Li returned.

Starting at 5:20 PM, he began to visit the various vice-presidential candidates and friends such as He Yingqin. Mr. and Mrs. Li first visited Yu Youren.

When Li resigned, he said that he would come again to wait for Mr. Sun another day. Mr. and Mrs. Li then visited Cheng Qian. Mr. and Mrs. Li shook hands tightly and repeatedly said thank you, thank you, help, help, and talked for about ten minutes. They then said goodbye. Mr. Li also visited Xu Fulin, Mo Dehui and He Yingqin. He felt slightly unwell and met with Mr. and Mrs. Li despite his illness. He looked very happy. After offering his congratulations, He said to Mrs. Li: "You can rest for two days." Mrs. Li replied: "I haven't had a good rest for a month." Li also said: "It has been more than a month since I came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 22nd of last month." There was a feeling of infinite relief in his words. He then took out a Taiwan watermelon given by a friend to entertain the guests. The three of them talked and ate together. Mr. and Mrs. Li, who had been tense and working hard for months, finally had a chance to cool down their hearts at this time. After talking for 30 minutes, Mr. and Mrs. Li bid farewell.

### National Assembly Representatives Prepare to Organize the "National Reconstruction Association"; Recommend Sun Ke as the Leader; Concentrate Efforts to Complete the Task of Suppressing Rebellion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke has recently been recommended as the leader of the "National Reconstruction Association". The association is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting in Beijing on the 30th to discuss association affairs. The purpose of the association is to promote the spirit of democracy and jointly devote itself to building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. It will broadly solicit members and establish a board of directors and several supervisors. The general association will be located in the capital, and branches will be established in various places. The association is proposed to be organized by a number of National Assembly representatives who support Sun's candidacy for vice president.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke hosted the National Assembly representatives at Longmen Restaurant at 8:00 PM on the 29th to express his gratitude, and gave a speech on the spot, explaining his attitude towards losing the vice-presidential election. He was not negative or pessimistic, and will work hard to overcome difficulties and forge ahead, so that the Republic of China can embark on a path of prosperity and happiness. Sun first said: "I am very grateful for the sympathy and support of everyone in this election. However, our task is not yet completed. The country is still in great difficulty, and everything needs to be rebuilt. The National Reconstruction Association, which has been proposed to be organized by a number of comrades, should concentrate everyone's efforts to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion." The National Assembly representatives and comrades of this party cannot shirk their responsibility. After Sun's speech, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Ni Wenya, Zhong Tianxin and many others also delivered speeches, all of whom believed that Sun's candidacy for vice president was regarded as an obligation, and that those who assisted in the election were even more self-motivated, like volunteers. Although Sun did not win the election, his reputation will become more solid and enhanced. Hundreds of National Assembly representatives who attended the meeting today listened to Sun's speech and the speeches of the representatives, and cheered enthusiastically to express their agreement, and the meeting ended at 9:00 PM.

### Sun Ke Gives a Speech to Reporters in a Relaxed Manner

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Sun Ke participated in the vice-presidential election and lost by 143 votes less than Li Zongren after the second round of voting. Sun did not mind this at all and remained extremely calm. When he met with reporters, he still expressed satisfaction with obtaining more than 1,200 votes in his usual relaxed manner. He said: "I am grateful for the encouragement and support of the National Assembly representatives from home and abroad in this vice-presidential election. I received enthusiastic support in the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of voting, and the number of votes I received in the third and fourth rounds exceeded 1,000, which is enough to show the sincerity of the representatives in caring for me. Although I have not been elected, I will never forget the enthusiasm and friendship of the representatives. I cannot but deeply express my gratitude." Sun said: "I am very happy that Mr. Li Zongren received more votes and was elected Vice President, because Mr. Li has made glorious achievements in the past in the party and the country, and I believe that he will be able to assist the Head of State and assist in the construction of democratic politics in the future. This is something I cannot but take special comfort in." Finally, Sun said: "This conference was finally able to complete its sacred mission in an atmosphere of harmony and smoothness. From now on, our country can enter the democratic stage, but we are still in a period of suppressing rebellion. I sincerely hope that we can achieve the goal as soon as possible to establish a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, by the people, of the people, for the people."

### A Chronicle of the National Assembly: Tense and Enthusiastic Talk of the Fourth Election

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] "Li Zongren received 1,438 votes and is elected as the first Vice President of the Republic of China." After Yu Bin, the chairman of the fourth Vice Presidential election assembly, announced the election results, most people in the assembly hall applauded enthusiastically. When the final results of the votes were not yet out, and Li Zongren's victory was in sight, Mrs. Guo Dejie, Li's wife, was surrounded by some reporters at the scene. After the results were announced, Mrs. Li was also lifted out of the door by the crowd and photographed, in the cheers, as the esteemed wife of our first Vice President.

The news of Li Zongren's election as Vice President was broadcast to all corners of the country by radio at 1:05 PM. At 1:15 PM, upon exiting the assembly hall, what greeted you on the streets was a burst of firecrackers, only slightly less enthusiastic than when the President was elected.

The election of the Vice President can truly be said to have reached a state of enthusiasm and tension, or, to put it a bit excessively, it almost reached a serious stage. Yesterday's third election resulted in Li Zongren and Sun Ke obtaining the qualifications for the final, but the 515 votes of the defeated Cheng Qian became the basic target of today's final. Last night, both candidates Li and Sun put in a lot of work on these 515 votes. Early this morning, Li Zongren, accompanied by his wife, went to the residences of various representatives to greet them and solicit votes. Sun Ke also sent someone to the Xiaguan Railway Station to welcome representatives who had come specifically from Shanghai to vote. Before the meeting, Li Zongren still stood at the first post at the gate, welcoming each representative, with his wife at the second post. Further inside were Sun Ke and his wife. Sun Ke personally attended the meeting today for the first time, shaking hands to try to win the final vote. Although this was a very obvious vote-seeking strategy, who wasn't wearing a smile? Moreover, Mrs. Li's talent for socializing led her to specifically walk over and shake hands with Mrs. Sun, laughing. In reality, the wives of the two vice-presidential candidates were even more nervous than the two candidates themselves. Some people attributed Cheng Qian's defeat to not bringing his wife to serve as a high-level campaign advisor! Otherwise, the rivalry between the three wives' staff would probably have made the campaign even more lively.

Although the atmosphere in the assembly hall could not be described as very warm and peaceful, this tense atmosphere, like an arrow on the string, had obviously transitioned from the arguing of the previous few days to a battle contained within the heart. Therefore, the fourth round of voting proceeded smoothly. During the voting process, those whispering to each other in the assembly hall were actually placing various novel bets, speculating who the final winner would be. Some said that given Li Zongren's "leading advantage, today's victory should still be his"; others said that most of Cheng Qian's 500-plus votes would be cast for Sun Ke; and that with just one vote difference, he could be elected, and the winner might be Sun Ke. However, opinions varied, and betting is never 100% accurate.

During the voting process, there was a touching little episode: female representative Lin Fanwen fell ill due to campaign work, but today she still dragged her body, unable to walk, in order to cast this sacred and important vote, and temporarily asked the meeting staff to help her cast this vote in person. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of the competition and the seriousness of not giving up a single vote.

After the voting was completed, the most tense ballot counting began at 11:37 AM. In the 2,733 tallies, the ballots were divided into twelve ballot boxes. From the twelve sets of statistics, it could be seen that Li Zongren held a two-thirds lead. Moreover, whether the difference was large or small, the distance between Li's leading numbers and the total was greater, while Sun's difference was limited, so when Li Zongren took the lead, after winning the first three boxes, Sun Ke's votes, although 25 more in the fourth round, were still too far from the total. By the time the vote count reached the sixth box, the difference between the two sides was nearly 200 votes, but then the seventh box was opened, and Sun's votes exceeded Li's by 60, which caused a bit of discussion in the hall, because the vote count was exactly halfway, and if there was a change, Sun Ke might catch up. However, after that, he fell into a slump. By the end of the tenth box, Li had 1,159 and Sun had 1,013, not much different from yesterday's third election results. Sun's campaign team was waiting for the advantage of the last two boxes, but the result was that Sun Ke's total votes in the twelve ballot boxes were 1,295, while Li Zongren's total in the eleventh box was 1,295. The 143 votes Li Zongren received in the twelfth ballot box were the victory votes that determined his election. When Sun Ke's trend had declined at the eleventh ballot box, some representatives had already left their seats, and conversely, the atmosphere in another corner became heated. When the final statistics were announced, cheers erupted from that corner.

The position of Vice President is obviously not comparable to that of the President, but because he went through four rounds of fighting, emotionally speaking, his emergence is more enthusiastic than that of the President. (April 29th, Nanjing)

Editorial

### The Announcement of the Vice Presidential Election – Congratulations to General Li Zongren on Being Elected Vice President

Yesterday, the National Assembly held the fourth vote for Vice President. The on-the-spot counting of votes resulted in General Li Zongren being elected as the first Vice President after the implementation of the Constitution with a majority of 1,438 votes against 1,295 votes. When the news spread, the people in Beijing and Shanghai were all deeply gratified to have found the right person. They also congratulated the National Assembly on the successful conclusion of its work with a pleasant mood.

According to Article 49 of our Constitution, "When the President is vacant, the Vice President shall succeed to the presidency until the expiration of the President's term." Although the Vice President has no real power in peacetime, he assumes the powers of the President when the President is vacant. Therefore, the position of Vice President is also very important. There were six candidates participating in this election: Li, Sun, Cheng, Yu, Mo, and Xu, all of whom are virtuous and respected veterans of the Party and the country. They were not only able to conform to public opinion and be what people hoped for, but they were also able to be more than competent for the position of Vice President. However, the results of the first and second votes showed that Li and Sun received the most votes, but neither exceeded half, so neither could be elected. Just as the third vote was about to be held, rumors were rampant inside and outside the meeting, and undercurrents were surging. Coupled with the excessive enthusiasm of the campaign teams, which fueled the flames, misunderstandings arose among the three candidates, who successively issued statements expressing their abandonment of the election, almost causing a political storm. Fortunately, the presidium of the National Assembly handled the matter properly. On the one hand, it decided to adjourn the National Assembly for three days to suppress the false alarm on the scene. On the other hand, patriotic people went around running and dredging. In addition to seeking solutions in the law, the supreme principle of free voting was reiterated. In this way, the hostility in the capital was eliminated, the rumors were clarified, the misunderstandings were resolved, and the meeting could be continued on the 28th to hold the third vote. Under the watchful eyes of the people of the whole country, the order of the meeting and the voting situation were well-organized, which shows that the rumors were all baseless. After this storm, the National Assembly has made considerable progress, which can be said to be "failure is the mother of success". The achievements of the National Assembly are especially worthy of our cherishment. Our country's democratic constitutionalism is still in the learning stage, and we should seek progress from learning, and we should cherish the lessons learned from this election.

First, there should be a limit to election propaganda. In theory, all propaganda that is beneficial to oneself and unfavorable to the other party is allowed, but the content of the propaganda should be limited to expounding one's own political views and attacking the other party's inappropriate policies, and it is best to implement a "propaganda truce" when voting; otherwise, both sides will engage in propaganda warfare, which will become more and more intense, with leaflets and slogans flying all over the streets, and newspapers and magazines attacking each other, which will inevitably lead to emotional behavior and cause misunderstandings between the two sides. Elections are the basis of democratic politics, and cultivating a good habit of attack is especially urgently needed in China, which is still in the class of learning democracy.

Second, anonymous secret voting is the best guarantee of free voting. During the election turmoil, although some candidates accused the assembly of manipulating the election, making it impossible for the National Assembly representatives to vote freely, the facts now prove that this accusation is unfounded, because when the representatives voted anonymously, no one was supervising them, and no one was obstructing them. They could vote freely according to their own conscience. The malpractice of bribery with money will certainly not occur; even the use of force to threaten representatives to vote will not have any effect. Therefore, we hope that the government will implement anonymous secret voting in all future elections to guarantee the supreme principle of free voting.

In short, elections have educational significance. After this vice-presidential election, we have gained many valuable lessons, and we should seek progress from these lessons. Therefore, after learning that General Li Zongren has been elected, we hope that General Li will assist the head of state in reforming politics and military affairs with his spirit of dedicating himself to the revolution for more than ten years, and complete the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible. On the other hand, we also wish our people's livelihood constitutionalism to seek progress in learning, and to have a bright and brilliant future!

### The Flames of War in the Middle East Loom

The war in Palestine, after breaking out in Haifa and Jaffa, has spread like wildfire and is becoming increasingly uncontrollable. On the one hand, the Jews, under the leadership of the radical Irgun, occupied the port of Jaffa on the 28th, directly threatening the holy city of Jerusalem. On the other hand, Arab League countries such as Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt are also preparing to invade Palestine starting on May 1st. In this way, the war in Palestine will also evolve into an international war in the Middle East. The spread and expansion of the Holy Land not only makes the US diplomatic authorities deeply uneasy, but also makes peace-loving people in general have to express their infinite concern about the outbreak of the Middle East powder keg.

Although the Palestinian issue is a religious and ethnic dispute, the conflict between Jews and Arabs has been almost daily since the British mandate of more than 30 years. But if there are no external factors mixed in, the problem is still simple and it is not difficult to find a reasonable solution. Therefore, the deterioration of the Palestinian issue to this point is actually the result of the struggle of power politics. In particular, the policies of Britain and the United States are often hesitant and should bear heavy responsibility. Britain has always adopted a "divide and rule" policy towards Palestine, trying to use the contradictions between the Jews and Arabs to deliberately waver in order to be in an important position. The same is true in the United States. After the end of World War II, the United States' attitude was obviously stiff towards the Jews, advocating the implementation of partition in Palestine and supporting the Zionist movement; but now it advocates trusteeship.

Originally, the Palestinian partition plan was only conducive to the Zionist movement and the solution of the European refugee problem, which would naturally arouse the resentment of the Arab countries in the Middle East. In addition, in fact, whether this partition plan can be realized is also a problem, because the area of Palestine is not large. If it is divided into two countries like India, then neither of these two countries can have the conditions that a modern country should have. Therefore, the United States has to reconsider its attitude. However, what the United States values most is not the difficulty in resolving the Jewish-Arab conflict, but the attitude of the Arab countries. In other words, if the United States insists on its own opinion and insists on implementing partition in the Holy Land, it is very likely to arouse anti-American sentiment among the people of Arab countries. Today's United States is most afraid of Arab countries falling into the arms of the Soviet Union, because the United States invests in the oil business in the Middle East. In terms of equipment alone, it will be nearly 1.6 billion US dollars. If it cannot win the friendship of Arab countries, and there are frequent riots to cut off oil pipelines, then not only will the interests of the United States in the Middle East be hit first, but also the US aid to European reconstruction plan will encounter a major obstacle. Therefore, the Palestinian issue has now become a link in the US-Soviet struggle.

The United Nations Special Session is now discussing how to deal with this issue. Secretary of State Marshall also hopes that the United Nations can promote a truce between Jews and Arabs; however, this issue is difficult to solve clearly in the struggle of power politics. Looking at the situation, the flames of war in the Middle East cannot be extinguished for a while, and there is a danger of spreading and expanding!

### Passengers Who Escaped from the Wanli Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday on the Changcheng - Emerald King Ping Remains Tight-Lipped About Jewelry - Many National Assembly Members and Generals Still in Communist Areas

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Wanli of Fumin Shipping Company, after striking a reef in the waters off Shengshan on the 12th of this month, had all passengers disembark and remain in Communist-controlled territory for half a month. After the company sent the Changcheng to Rongcheng Bay, it brought back 780 passengers, who arrived at the Huangpu Wharf in the city yesterday morning. Special commissioners from military police, security, and public safety agencies were dispatched to inspect and take care of them. When the ship arrived, the company set off firecrackers to welcome them. The passengers' families were overjoyed upon meeting them and rushed forward to greet them.

According to a passenger named Chang, the location where the ship ran aground was in Communist-controlled territory. All passengers disembarked and were arranged by the Communist forces to live near the Longxu Village. Based on each passenger's occupation and identity, they were divided into groups of industry and commerce, public education, and military personnel, and managed accordingly. Two meals a day were provided, barely enough to survive. The Communist army kept a closer watch on public educators and military personnel. Mr. Chang pointed out that some merchants, eager to be released soon, identified many National Assembly representatives and generals among the passengers to the Communist army, which then regarded them as "Nationalist agents." When he boarded the Changcheng to come to Shanghai, he heard the Communists declare that over 70 passengers suspected of being "Nationalist agents" would undergo considerable training before being released. Mr. Chang is an early graduate of the Central Police Academy and currently a reporter for a newspaper in Peiping. He showed a draft news dispatch, criticizing the Wanli for overloading and poor sailing techniques. He said he was "willing to testify in court."

### Mother and Son Commit Suicide by Jumping into the Sea

According to a tea merchant among the passengers, after the ship ran aground, a mother and son who intended to settle in the south with 18 billion yuan obtained from selling all their family property lost everything.

Tie Baoting, the Emerald King of Peiping, another passenger on the Wanli, also arrived in Shanghai on the Changcheng yesterday morning. He remained tight-lipped about rumors that he was carrying multiple boxes of emerald jewelry worth a fortune. He refused to answer reporters' questions. When he disembarked yesterday morning, he only carried a briefcase and showed no expression on his face. It is rumored that the Communist army returned four-tenths of his boxes, but this has not been confirmed by him personally.

Lu Dongsheng, general manager of Fumin Company, and Sha Yunren, captain of the Wanli, gave a report to the press last night at the Lido Garden about the Wanli's accident.

### Fire on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek This Morning - Dachang New Oil Depot Half Destroyed

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At approximately 0:30 this morning, a stack of goods at the rear of the Dachang New Oil Depot at No. 32 Guangfu West Road on the banks of the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West suddenly caught fire. Because the goods stacked there were mostly rapeseed oil cakes and a large amount of cooking oil, they burned intensely. The oil depot was adjacent to the Dingxin Yarn Factory, which had fire-fighting equipment, so it was spared. Although the people in Dingxin assisted in the firefighting, their efforts were ineffective due to their limited strength. The Fire Department's Yichang Road team heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene, but the road was narrow, rugged, and winding, so they did not arrive at the scene until approximately 1:00 AM. After the firefighters bravely fought the fire, they had brought it under control by 2:00 AM this morning. The front warehouse of the Dachang New Oil Depot was preserved. The remaining fire was extinguished at approximately 3:00 AM. The loss is still difficult to estimate. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

### Zhang Pengchun Gives Report on the News Freedom Conference; General Assembly Resolves to Draft Three Convention Drafts

[Our Newspaper] Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the chief representative of China at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information in Geneva and representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, was invited by the United Nations Office in Shanghai to host a press conference yesterday morning to report on the proceedings of the News Freedom Conference. He stated that the most important resolution of the conference was to draft three conventions, namely: (1) Regarding those who collect and transmit international news, any accredited foreign correspondent from any contracting state shall have the right to enter and travel freely in any other contracting state and transmit news. Under normal circumstances, such news should not be censored; if censorship is implemented during peacetime, its work should be as limited as possible in scope. If that is not possible, a deadline should be set for the return of news drafts, and fees should be charged according to the number of telegraph words after censorship. (2) Regarding the establishment of international rights of correction, any contracting state may submit a statement of correction to the government of the country that originally issued the report, and that government shall publish it regardless of its opinion. Otherwise, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may be authorized to make corrections and promote them as much as possible. (3) News Freedom Convention. This convention is broad in scope and stipulates that restrictions may be imposed on freedom of information. If any two contracting states have a dispute due to the agreement, it should be referred to the International Court of Justice for adjudication.

The above three draft conventions must be submitted to the next session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (to be held on July 19 in Lake Success) for amendments, and then submitted to the United Nations General Assembly (to be held in Paris in September) for adoption, and will only become effective after ratification by the contracting states. In addition to the above three resolutions, the News Freedom Conference also passed 43 other resolutions by a majority vote, two of which were proposed by the Chinese delegation. Although these 43 resolutions are not conventions, any country that passes them is responsible for them in principle.

Participating Countries: 57

Dr. Zhang expressed great satisfaction with the outcome of the conference, and specifically pointed out several points that he believed had not been achieved in any previous international conference, namely: (1) There was an unusually large number of participating countries, a total of 57 (including Bolivia, Iran, and Ireland as observers). Each national delegation had two or three people participating in actual journalism work, and others were diplomatic personnel or people engaged in the news industry. (2) The conference had a year of preparation, so it was also the most successful in terms of procedure. At the same time, time was saved, and the general assembly closed two days earlier than expected. In addition to the plenary session, the conference was divided into four subcommittees, namely 1. Discussion of general principles, 2. Collection of international news, 3. Free publication and collection of domestic news, 4. Legal institutions. To avoid wasting time, the general debate, which is usually held in general international conferences, was moved to the first subcommittee, so that the other three subcommittees could proceed simultaneously. Therefore, the meeting, which was originally scheduled to last from March 23 to April 23, was able to close on April 21.

Meaning of Freedom of Information

Dr. Zhang also explained the meaning of "freedom of information," which does not only refer to the freedom of news practitioners, but to the freedom of all people in the world to obtain news.

Finally, a reporter asked what he thought was the failure of this conference. Dr. Zhang replied that it was difficult to draw an absolute line between failure and success at this conference. Some people believed that this conference did not make a significant contribution to the tense atmosphere of international politics, because people generally expect any international conference to help with international politics, but the nature of the news conference is different, and it is not its fault if it does not contribute to international politics. In fact, this conference at least did not increase the tense political atmosphere between countries. But Dr. Zhang also hoped that the next News Freedom Conference should pay more attention to concrete facts, such as the education of news personnel, newspaper printing, machinery, equipment, and technical issues should be discussed in detail.

Dr. Zhang went to Hangzhou for a short trip yesterday afternoon and will go to Nanjing soon to report on his work.

### Treasury Bills Issued Today; Discount Rate Set at 87.3 Percent

[Our Newspaper] Short-term treasury bills will be issued starting today, and today's discount rate has been set at 87.3 percent. That is, a 100-yuan treasury bill can be purchased for 87.3 yuan today, and the principal and interest of 105 yuan can be recovered after one month, which translates to a monthly interest rate of two cents. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank: The official document from the Ministry of Finance was only received yesterday (April 29), and the treasury bills will be issued today. Currently, one-month treasury bills are being issued temporarily. The so-called "one month" is calculated as 30 days, which is similar to a fixed deposit certificate and does not necessarily expire at the end of the month. Treasury bills with a term of two or three months will be discussed later as needed. The discount on treasury bills is posted daily at the Central Bank. At present, the National Bank has established a Treasury Bill Interest Rate Committee, which is composed of the heads of the Treasury Bureau, the Business Bureau, and the Audit Department, and the Director of the Treasury Bureau is the convener. The proposed interest rate discount for treasury bills is reviewed daily by the committee and submitted to the President of the Central Bank for approval and implementation. The issuance of short-term treasury bills will start in Shanghai only for the time being. Whether they will be issued in other places will be discussed after assessing the situation after the issuance. The issuance will be done by posting the rate, and it will be handled temporarily by the National Bank itself. The temporary sales locations are (1) Treasury Bureau, No. 24 East Zhongshan Road, (2) Business Bureau, No. 15 East Zhongshan Road, and (3) Hongkou Branch of the Treasury Bureau, intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wujin Road. Whether short-term treasury bills will be listed on the stock exchange in the future and whether other banks will be entrusted to sell them will depend on actual needs.

### Hua Stocks Still Weak at Closing Despite Midday Rally

Hua stocks wanted to rise but retreated yesterday in the morning session. Foreign stocks had elastic properties, which helped to boost buying sentiment in the middle of the session.

However, the follow-up strength was still weak, and the market remained sideways at closing.

Early in the morning, the sentiment was still showing weakness. Yongsha opened at a low of 2,000 yuan. No. 154 advanced to 2,010 yuan. The intention to sell on the trading floor was still keen.

After 11:30, the price dropped to 1,985 yuan, but the midday close was still maintained by the Guangdong gang No. 202 and the yarn and flower gang No. 104, rising to 2,000 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Yongye rose slightly, Huaxin, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and National Products were all flat, and the remaining stocks all saw small setbacks except for China Silk, which fell by half a percent.

In the afternoon, the vice president was elected, and the market fell to a low of 1,980 yuan. No. 12 sold to 1,975 yuan, and No. 181 and others supplied, and a buying wave suddenly rose.

### High Prices for Foreign Stocks as Government Bonds are Actively Bought

New highs were reached in foreign stocks yesterday. Yisha opened a meeting, and Yinglian will follow. Buyers were very eager. Yisha rose from around 3.3 million, gradually rising to a peak of 3.56 million before falling back. Hong Kong Electric Telegraph was 7.2 cents, and the floor was still popular. Although securities firms sold, foreign merchants and the Guangdong gang competed to absorb it. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha, Yinglian, and paper versions each rose by half a percent, and the remaining stocks rose slightly in unison, and popular stocks all saw new records.

Beverage and Beer Manufacturers Urged to Register

### Cotton Yarn Management Committee Strictly Implements Approved Cotton Purchase Prices

[Our Newspaper] In order to maintain normal cotton prices, the Cotton Yarn Management Committee implements a price negotiation and price limit system for cotton purchases. All standard prices that have been approved and adjusted in the past are determined separately in different regions based on the production costs of local cotton farmers, the transportation costs of merchants, and the market supply and demand conditions. Since its implementation, most regions have been able to comply. However, recently, cotton prices have suddenly risen, especially in Hankou. After receiving the report, the committee believed that it was obvious that someone was manipulating the market. As a result, it specially convened relevant parties yesterday for detailed research. The committee agreed that the purchase prices approved by the committee were based on facts. Any relaxation of the price will affect the livelihood of the people. It is impossible to chase after the black market without standards. Moreover, the US loan has been completed, and US-aid cotton is on its way and will arrive in mid-May. In addition, the Cotton Yarn Management Committee is now purchasing foreign cotton arriving at the port without a permit in order. There is no shortage of cotton for spinning. The commission organizations and self-purchasing manufacturers in all cotton collection and distribution markets should stop purchasing if the selling price exceeds the price approved by the committee. The committee immediately telegraphed the decision to the Textile Construction Company and strictly ordered its subordinate offices, the Sixth District Guild Cotton Merchant Purchasing Joint Office, and the Yingkou Cotton Purchasing Joint Office to comply.

### Initial Registration Deadline for Cotton Yarn Has Expired

[Our Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Management Committee handles cotton yarn registration, and the cotton yarn registration certificate issued is valid for three months and expires after that date.

If it is found that the cotton yarn has not been used after the deadline, it may be disposed of in accordance with Article 11 of the Cotton Yarn Registration Method, in accordance with the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times. It is heard that the validity period for the initial registrants has expired, and the association will conduct a general survey of those who have not submitted the registration certificates within the deadline, and will handle the matter in accordance with the regulations, and will not be tolerant.

### Rayon Rises; Silk Falls

The rayon market was high yesterday. No. 120 Xuzi Youguang opened at 254 million yuan in the morning, and the immediate price rose to 666 million yuan at midday. The progress continued in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 777 million yuan, and finally fell to 730 million yuan, an increase of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The factory's market was soft yesterday morning and rose in the afternoon, eventually similar to the previous day's market. The dismantling price of grade D 5 dan goods was 395 million yuan, and the high zero dan price was 400 million yuan in the afternoon, but transactions were very rare. The situation in the dry market was also stable.

The silk market fell in the morning yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk Quilt opened at around 157 million yuan, and then fell to around 660 to 10 million yuan. Finally, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it continued to decline, and the immediate closing price fell to 520 yuan. The Dacheng Checkered Crepe opened at 540,000 yuan and closed at 535,000 yuan. The raw materials rebounded in the afternoon, and the market was slightly stronger.

### The Market Conditions for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Remain Weak

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was weak because the end of the month was approaching and there was a lack of new purchases. The initial opening price of 42s Blue Phoenix fine yarn was as low as 230 million yuan. Then, scattered households pulled up to 235 million yuan to close, which was a rebound of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. 32s Blue Phoenix and others were reduced by 1 or 2 million yuan due to oversupply. The morning opening of 21s Double Horse yarn also fell. Halfway through, the traders on the trading floor cheered, but the actual sales were still sluggish, and the price rose by 1 million yuan. The other thick and thin yarns had their ups and downs.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was selling due to news and the offer of textile construction. Dyeing factories were all watching. Although the Yangtze Gang had a stomach for medium-grade fine cloth spot goods, peers and powerful people kept selling, and the market was oversupplied. The initial opening price of Longtou fine cloth was as low as 4.95 million, and then it fell to a minimum of 4.88 million yuan due to the unstoppable downward trend. The recent closing price rebounded to 4.9 million yuan, a decrease of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining fine cloths, bi-ge, zhigong fine twill, etc., were also reduced, ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, the colored cloth and Shilin cloth markets remained firm.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was weak, and the price of the floor was falling. Buyers offered slightly higher prices, and transactions became more active. The delivery price of Jingyang fine velvet to the public treasury was 25 million, Donggou 21.5 million to 21.9 million, Haitijian 20.5 million, Nabei 21 million, Huoji 20 million, Yaohua 15.8 million, and Zhoupu seed flower 5 million to 5.08 million.

### Biluochun Market Slightly Strong

Opening at 1.3 Million Yuan Per Catty

Biluochun, produced in Dongting Mountain, is also a valuable domestic tea. Although the new goods of this year have been in Shanghai for many days, the transactions have been quiet because both parties insist on their own prices. As of yesterday, both parties' attitudes have changed slightly, and the official opening price has been obtained, which is 1.3 million yuan per catty, and the market atmosphere is quite prosperous. The new fried green tea from Wenzhou and the mulberry buds from Huzhou are also opening in a stable manner. However, the new Longjing, which has been arriving continuously and is gradually becoming old, is still unable to support the floor, and the closing result is that it has been severely reduced compared to the previous time. As for the old tea, which is about to run out of inventory, it is as potentially popular as ever, and the price of Qimen floral fragrance and tea powder has risen sharply due to the strong absorption of the local market. In addition, the foreign tea market is about the same, and the fluctuations are very narrow.

### Food Rice Sales Stagnant; Flour, Oil, and Grains Weak

The rice market opened in the morning because the production price rebounded, and the holders' minds were very firm, and they were eager to bid up the price. However, because the sales were wooden, although the price was high, it did not go out, so the rise stopped. The market remained flat in the afternoon, and the closing was even weaker. Zao rice in the Nan City market fell by 50,000 yuan, and Zhongguan goods in milled Xian fell by slightly less than 100,000 yuan. The rest were mostly flat. The Bei City market was also flat with fatigue. The special high japonica rice fell by 50,000 yuan to 4.15 million yuan. The amount of goods arriving yesterday increased, with a total of 8,067 shi in the North and South markets.

The price of flour fluctuated slightly. The transaction was quiet. The market was tired at the opening and firm at the end, and the result was slightly better than the previous day. The closing price of the warship powder was the original price. The old car opened lower and then recovered, and the closing price was higher than the previous day by 10,000 yuan. The iron skin fell below 800,000, a decrease of 230,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains were weak and dull. Yellow soybeans were still quiet, and the local market took very little. The price of beans finally fell by 50,000 yuan. The price of corn was slightly lower, but the price of Zhongguan goods was still fixed. Red grains turned down. Green beans were flat. Selected green was slightly firmer. The price of sesame was slightly firm due to the small amount of goods arriving. The high price of raw peanuts was slightly reduced by 50,000 yuan, and the price of medium and inferior goods was flat.

Edible oil fell again. The local sales were weak, and the customers did not inquire. Under the overall downturn of the grain market, people were exhausted and unbearable, so the price fell. Datong and other factories opened soybean oil, and the recycled goods were even more flooded. The lowest Dongfeng soybean oil was 8.45 million yuan, a drop of about 150,000 yuan. Raw oil was still flat, and Xiaojun sesame oil rose by 200,000 yuan alone. The soybean cake market turned lively, and the price rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.

For several months, Mr. Jin has given us his full support, enabling this good deed to proceed smoothly. In order to be responsible to Mr. Jin and to strengthen our service to countless impoverished women, we, as the instigators of the childbirth assistance campaign, must redouble our efforts and constantly encourage ourselves. On the one hand, we must review past shortcomings as a lesson for the future. As an ancient saying goes: "Do not forget the past; it is a guide for the future." That is the meaning of this. Finally, we hope that enthusiastic readers will continue to give us guidance, encouragement, and assistance. The so-called collective wisdom and gathering strength can achieve great things.

### Random Notes on the National Games: Veteran Track and Field Athlete Hao Chunde Trains Diligently; Liang Zhao’an Predicts Men's and Women's Swimming Championships

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Several main roads in the sports field, such as Shuidian Road, Mailu Road, etc., are being rushed day and night by the Public Works Bureau. There are many workers, piles of gravel, asphalt stoves, and rollers along the way. The roads that have been repaired are wide and flat, and cars speeding on them have a taste of skating.

The openings in the sports field are all covered with billboards to conceal them, and it is barely passable at first glance. Decorations are in the final stages everywhere because the electricity has been connected. It is said that the press seats are located on the stands directly opposite the rostrum. During the peak period of the afternoon program, they happen to face the scorching sun in the west, which will greatly affect the visibility.

Around 3:00 PM, several male and female athletes from Shanghai were practicing on the field. In the crowd, I met Hao Chunde, a veteran track and field athlete. He was still heroic, wearing a vest, shorts, and running shoes, supervising the practice of the Shanghai team. When asked what event he was participating in this time, he smiled modestly and said, "It's time for everyone to play, so I didn't participate in the competition this time, but I am serving as the track and field coach of the Shanghai team." It turns out that he is now busy running import and export trade.

The eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, followed by years of war, plunged track and field sports in Shanghai into a low ebb. People began to doubt whether the Shanghai track and field team could still dominate like they did during the Sixth National Games and win the championship. Mr. Hao is still optimistic. He casually cited a few examples, such as Lou Wenao's 10,000 meters, women's sprint, relay, and high jump, all of which are key to the Shanghai team's scoring.

Shen Kunnan, a famous track and field referee, was also at the field yesterday. He said that the reason for the decline of track and field is still based on unstable living conditions. Schools are the hotbed for cultivating athletes, but these days, building even a basic track costs hundreds of millions. How many schools can afford sports and health equipment? How can track and field not decline?

Walking out of the sports field, I ran into Chen Zhongde, a famous volleyball coach. According to his observation, this men's volleyball championship will become a battle between Guangdong and Hong Kong. In women's volleyball, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Guangdong may compete fiercely. He has a high opinion of Taiwan's women's volleyball team. They play Japanese-style volleyball, which is slightly different from the international style generally used in the country. There will definitely be wonderful scenes in the semi-finals and finals.

The floor of the gymnasium is being sanded with an electric sander, and it is said that it will be completed tomorrow. The inner circle of the floor is laid with mahogany, and the outer circle is made of fir. After sanding and polishing, the ten-year-old gymnasium will once again become a good place for basketball teams from all over the country to compete.

The swimming pool has also been renovated and completed. Now, the pool is being cleaned. It can probably be filled with water around the 4th or 5th. It takes 24 hours to fill the pool with water. The pool has a capacity of 420,000 gallons. At night, the wall lamps on both sides of the pool can be lit again. Unfortunately, the disinfection and filtration equipment of the pool has been dismantled by the Japanese enemy.

I met Liang Zhao'an, a senior figure in the swimming world, at the Chinese Youth Association. He is now the swimming instructor of the Shanghai team. According to his prediction, the men's and women's swimming championships in this session will be monopolized by the Hong Kong team. Players from Guangdong, Guangzhou, and Malaysia may pose some threat to Hong Kong. Speaking of Shanghai, he said: "There are a total of 27 swimming representatives. It is estimated that only Wang Zhongcheng's 100-meter backstroke and Wen Jingling's 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle swimming are expected to score points."

The athlete dormitory for the National Games, which was lent by the Zhongxun Corps on Shuidian Road, was moved from Shangchi Lane to Shanglian Lane yesterday. Athletes from Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang have all moved in, all in double-decker beds in shared rooms. Many rooms are being painted. For some reason, no one in charge of managing the dormitory for the National Games was encountered there. Many athletes said: "Probably because the preparation period is not yet mature, they have to take care of everything themselves after moving in. Today, they changed to a new dormitory, and they had to move everything themselves before settling down."

The setting sun on the west hill covered the entire sports field of Zhongzheng Park. A group of male and female athletes from Fujian were actively practicing there. Their coach introduced several outstanding male and female athletes to the reporter. The female athlete Chen Biying's 100-meter sprint is 13.8 seconds, and the long jump is over 5 meters. Guo Zhangde and Chen Wensheng's low hurdles both have a score of 14.67 seconds. Wu Shuying's high jump reaches 1.285 meters. Most of them are students from Putian Middle School, short and capable, with dark skin. It is said that they participated in sports events in Shanghai and Nanjing last year and won awards.

### Ministry of Education Orders National Primary and Secondary Schools to Organize Parents' Associations, Following the Regulations of Various Schools in Taiwan Province

Recently, President Lu Xirong forced Dean Jiang Zaihua to leave the school without the consent of the professors and arbitrarily changed the teaching time, causing time conflicts and making it impossible for the professors to be in two places at once. Moreover, when the professors could not come to the college to teach, he would arbitrarily ask someone to substitute. In addition, the college's newly revised service regulations attempted to dismiss professors at any time. The professors stated that they would never recognize this.

### British Secondary Schools Plan to Implement a Free Examination System

[British Information Service, London, 29th] The British Minister of Education announced today that British secondary schools will implement a new plan in the next three years, in which all students can freely choose the subjects for their graduation examinations. The existing examination system will be discontinued and replaced by a new graduation examination. These examination questions will be divided into three standards: one is the "ordinary" level, which is equivalent to the current school graduation examination standard; one is the "advanced" level, which is higher than the previous level. There is also a "new academic standard" level, which allows children with extraordinary talents to fully develop and can further receive higher education. The new examination system is open in nature, and all boys and girls in schools and self-study students can participate. The Minister of Education pointed out that this new system should not be regarded as fixed and should be revised and adapted at any time. Several professional groups have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the authorities.

### Opening Day of the National Games: A Bright Start; Holding the Torch High and Marching Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road; Relay Race Transmitting the President's Speech; Athletes in Eight Teams Relay Run Over the Entire 380 Kilometers

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Nanjing-Shanghai torch relay long-distance run, which is the most meaningful event of this National Games, has been prepared by Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau of this city, in conjunction with Feng Bingxin, Director of the Sports Department of Jiaotong University. All 66 athletes are students from Jiaotong University, and each person runs an average of 6,000 meters throughout the journey. At 3:00 PM on May 2nd, the run will start in front of the Nanjing National Government Building. The first runner will be Liu Zhenzhong, who will hold the torch and carry the President's speech, which will be passed on to the runners in turn. After noon on May 5th, the torch will arrive in Shanghai. The last runner, Wang Nancun, will hold the torch high and respectfully carry the speech, starting in front of the Fudan University gate and running into the venue during the opening ceremony of the Games. Then, the torch will be used to light the four tripods on the east and west rostrums, and the chairman of the Games will respectfully read the President's speech.

The starting point for the last runner in this city was originally set at Jing'an Temple, then along Nanjing Road and North Sichuan Road, and finally to the venue in a parade. Later, the authorities stated that traffic control would be difficult when passing through the above-mentioned prosperous thoroughfares, so the result was to move the starting point to Fudan University. Now, all the athletes are divided into eight teams. The first and second teams will take a car to Nanjing at 9:00 AM on May 1st. The remaining teams will go to Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, and Taicang on the next day and then go to various places to wait. The highway taken throughout the journey will be from Nanjing to Yixing along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway, from Yixing to Wuxi along the Yixing-Wuxi Highway, and from Wuxi to Shanghai along the Wuxi-Shanghai Highway. Because the relay race will be stopped at night, the athletes will stay overnight in Tangshan, Yixing, and Zhenru.

The funds for this relay race were raised by Li Ximou, Feng Bingxin, and Ji Wenmei from various sources. The sneakers for all the athletes were donated by Hong Nianzu from the Zhongda Zhonghua Factory. The vests and socks were jointly donated by the Xinguang Underwear Factory and the Feilun Sewing Thread Factory for 65 million yuan. The food and accommodation for the athletes along the way will be provided by the alumni of Jiaotong University.

The torch has now been made and is beautiful and magnificent. It is estimated that the entire 380-kilometer journey will require 20 torch core replacements and will take two days. Even in the event of wind and rain, it will not stop.

### Honolulu Overseas Chinese Athletes Li Dihua and Two Others Arrive in Shanghai for the National Games Tennis Competition

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Dihua, Mei Jielin, and Qian Runshan, representatives of the overseas Chinese from Honolulu participating in the National Games, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by Sky King aircraft at 3:45 PM yesterday and immediately checked into the Yangtze Hotel. Among the three, Li is the team leader, and Mei and Qian are participating in the singles and doubles tennis competitions. Li and his party left Honolulu for Hong Kong on April 24th. During their three-day stay in Hong Kong, they held a friendly tennis doubles match with Xu Weipei and Shi Liejin, which ended in a draw.

According to Li, this is the first time that overseas Chinese from Honolulu have participated in the National Games. He hopes to take this opportunity to promote the connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland. Li is the manager of the Pacific Machinery Company and is coming to Shanghai at his own expense. Mei runs a lumber business in Pearl Harbor and is 31 years old. Qian is an employee of the Alexander & Baldwin Insurance Company and is 35 years old. Both have more than 20 years of experience in tennis. Qian and Behrend's doubles team has won the Honolulu Tennis Open Championship every year from 1944 until last year, and they have strong strength. This time to China, there is great hope for the tennis championship. According to Li, the expenses for Mei and Qian to come to Shanghai were raised by the leaders of the Honolulu overseas Chinese business community. As for the expenses after arriving in Shanghai, he intends to ask the government for subsidies. He said that if it were not for financial constraints, Honolulu would have representatives participating in basketball, baseball, and swimming this time. If the government can subsidize, it will increase the interest of overseas Chinese in returning to the country to participate in the National Games. It is also heard that Li and others will move to the Paramount Hotel today for a temporary stay until the end of the National Games.

### The Attitude of Patients Towards Doctors

— Qiu Jingzhou

Looking through the newspapers and various magazines in the valley, there are often news and articles about us doctors. From these, we can see that besides "lawsuits every year," there are many unpleasant things happening between patients and doctors. Even if it doesn't lead to disputes, there's still plenty of sarcastic criticism and abuse.

Do you know what the most common reason for being scolded is? It's charging money! For doctors and hospitals to charge money is simply a sin, a crime. There's a newly released domestic film called "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon." The final scenes show the female protagonist giving birth and being rejected by the hospital because she couldn't pay the fees. According to reports, the Chinese Medical Association petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau to instruct film companies not to shoot similar scenes in the future, arguing that it damaged the reputation of the medical profession. Some people disagreed with this and strongly criticized it, saying:

"A hospital should be a place for treating illnesses and saving lives, as well as a charitable institution. It shouldn't be like other ordinary offices that rigidly adhere to procedures, nor like a store where you have to pay before receiving the goods. The reason is that a patient's time, in the struggle between life and death, is often extremely critical. Missing a few minutes could render a treatable patient incurable. This is true for difficult births, as well as emergencies. Therefore, a doctor, standing from a humanitarian standpoint, naturally can't bear to let patients suffer from delays or even watch a treatable person die. They should act with the heart of a parent, disregarding everything else and prioritizing saving the person first."

However, the reality is not always the case. Many private hospitals, and even public hospitals, are no exception. They often have a strong commercial inclination, opening their mouths to ask for money, as if treatment has become a means of seeking wealth. If faced with a difficult birth or emergency, public hospitals must follow the rules, prioritizing based on registration order. Otherwise, you'll have to pay double the special registration fee, and even then, immediate treatment isn't guaranteed. As for general private hospitals, it's common to see them taking advantage of others' misfortune and even engaging in extortion and intimidation. They seem to think that it's the patient who is dying and the patient's family who is anxious, and that it has nothing to do with the hospital. Without money, nothing can be done, and the patient can only be left to die... During the Anti-Japanese War, Shen Fu wrote the screenplay "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," which also depicted a greedy doctor demanding payment from a poor civil servant's wife before delivering her baby. If literary works can reflect reality to some extent, it shows that such phenomena exist in society, and we can't say that exposing such sinful behavior is wrong (see page 627 of the 74th issue of the Industry and Commerce News Weekly, March 29, 1937)."

I don't want to deny everything outright. And some colleagues have openly exposed and corrected these issues (for example, Wang Huangying in the preface to his Medical Handbook). Besides, within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass; within ten households, there must be faithful people. There are still plenty of good doctors like Dr. Ding in "Sui Han Tu" (written by Chen Baichen) and "Metamorphosis" (written by Cao Yu). These people won't be scolded. Although their title is also "doctor," their actions are beyond reproach.

Actually, what's the use of "scolding"? Human notions of self-interest cannot be compared with moral concepts. Those who are blinded by profit, even if you reprimand them with "morality" and "benevolence," will remain unmoved. "Money" is indeed a sharp weapon. It's best if there's no financial relationship between patients and doctors.

At this point, a friend interrupted, saying: "How is that possible? The relationship between people is purely economic. Doctors treat patients, and patients pay doctors for their services. There's nothing wrong with that. Han Feizi once said, 'Doctors suck the pus from people's wounds and drink their blood. They are not close relatives, but they are motivated by profit (see "Five Vermin").' Since doctors make a living from medicine, it means they rely on treating illnesses to sustain themselves. Rich people spend thousands or tens of thousands a day, it doesn't matter to them, and they won't scold you. But you need to be more lenient with those who don't have money."

I continued, "The problem is that the rich are the minority, and the poor are the majority! No matter how kind-hearted you are and how sincerely you serve your patients, if you charge money, you'll be in trouble. For example, right now, 200,000 units of penicillin cost 1.6 million yuan per bottle (Ningbo price on March 15th of this year). Including distilled water and handling fees, if you only charge 2 million yuan, you're already being generous to the point of disregarding your own well-being. But the average patient still can't afford it. The famous Professor Hong Shen complained like this:

'My three-and-a-half-year-old son has a strange illness. He's been sick for over a month and has been hospitalized since the 13th of last month. Although the doctors have been diligently treating him, there's been no improvement. He needs to be injected with streptomycin and other medications every day, costing about 600,000 yuan, with no guarantee of success. My income from teaching at the Municipal Drama School is over 1.2 million yuan per month, and my writing income is also over 1 million yuan per month. Combined, it's only enough to buy five days' worth of medication... (June 9, 36, postscript to the 47th issue of Ta Kung Pao Drama and Film).'

The poor living conditions of cultural figures are well-known. I really can't bear to charge them money. Also, the fees at Wuling Hospital here are vastly different from those of other hospitals in Ningbo. Inpatient fees are 120,000 yuan per day (adjusted from April of this year, the local price of rice is 4.4 million per stone). It can be said that even the food costs are not covered, let alone other medical expenses and room fees. But if a poor farmer has a chronic surgical condition that requires long-term hospitalization, it will cost 3.6 million yuan per month, or 7.2 million yuan for two months. This is a number that most people will shake their heads at."

Therefore, I hope that when people have physical injuries, they don't also have financial injuries (meaning that people can receive free medical treatment when they are sick). Our livelihood should be the responsibility of the state and have real security. This way, many unpleasant atmospheres between patients and doctors can be eliminated. I always feel that when we doctors worry and work for patients, sometimes we are woken up in the middle of the night and rise from our warm beds, braving the cold, rain, and snow, or under the scorching sun, holding umbrellas, rushing to treat patients on desolate roads ten or twenty li away. What is this for? It's to save those lives on the brink of death! This is precisely to express the supreme spirit and professional virtue of us doctors. We really shouldn't let patients taint this spirit and virtue with money!

However, what is hateful is that the endless war, incompetent politics, and economic panic make it difficult for good people to live. A recent example is Mr. Li Tingguang, the school doctor at Nankai University, who committed suicide out of frustration because his monthly salary of 9 million yuan was not enough to support his family of eight (Ta Kung Pao, April 15th of this year). In such a world, how can one be a doctor with peace of mind, except by preparing to be scolded?

Also, in "Medical Disputes," I mentioned that the trend of patients being litigious is increasing, which means that even good doctors cannot avoid going to court. Turning to my diary from July 1st of last year, I recorded the following: 'The wife and daughter of Ke Peiyao, the director of the business department of Shanghai Cathay Department Store, sued Dr. Guo Zhizong for causing death due to negligence. The attached civil suit demanded a total of 416,884,000 yuan. Fortunately, he was declared innocent. Otherwise, if the case had been established, it would have bankrupted not only this generation but also the next three generations, even if he worked as a cow or horse to repay it.'"

Looking around, how can the cold treatment of patients towards us doctors not make us doctors feel disheartened and discouraged!

### Double Green Building — Medical Notes

(3) The Distress of Being a Doctor

When I have nothing to do after dinner, my children, Hailong and Haishan, always ask me to tell them stories. Although telling stories is the responsibility of a father, it's also a chore. To be honest, I often get anxious about this task. Last night, I picked up a translated copy of Xia Mianzun's "Education of Love" and flipped through it, hoping to find some material to tell the children. After flipping through it, I came across a section about "doctors." I was very moved after reading it, and now I excerpt a few paragraphs:

"Can you sacrifice your own happiness to the point of not having a moment of rest? Can you remain calm in the face of the rude remarks made by ignorant and unaware patients? Can you sustain your enthusiasm for saving people from suffering without being bothered by the trouble? When they need you, they respect you; when they don't need you, no one pays attention to you anymore; can you not be weary of such a profession?..."

"Before becoming a doctor, you have to dissect corpses, dissect the internal organs of decaying bodies, and witness the tragic and desperate scenes of humanity, and hear the mournful groans." "After graduating from medical school, to become a medical doctor, you have to put in a lot of effort, and often continue to do long-term research without gaining anything." "Even if you become a medical doctor, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a good meal." "Doctors are like slaves or servants. When there is a house call, they have to go, whether it's in the deep of winter or the heat of summer."

"The rich will criticize you for not being thorough in your diagnosis, and the poor will resent you for overcharging them. After years of hard work, you can only barely make ends meet."

"Doctors want to live a comfortable life, they must endure many years of hardship. If you are not careful during this period, and you misdiagnose a disease, your reputation will be ruined and no one will ask for your advice. You have to change your profession and start suffering and enduring anew."

"When you have cured many poor patients and gradually spread your reputation to the ears of the wealthy, new doctors will come and open a practice nearby, competing with you for business. Being a doctor is really not an easy profession."

After reading these paragraphs about doctors, we will naturally have a common feeling: that the profession of "being a doctor" is not as perfect as the average person can imagine. Not only is it not perfect, but it can be said to be a kind of hard life that ordinary people simply cannot endure.

Moreover, in this chaotic China, it is especially difficult to be a doctor. Even if you are loyal to your service and have a clear conscience, if you are unlucky enough to encounter a thorny illness, then you will not only suffer a great loss in terms of reputation, but you will also be sued, and even have the possibility of "eating a lawsuit." Recently, several colleagues have been sued for being too loyal to their profession, saying that they neglected their duties and caused manslaughter due to negligence. Although these cases have been declared innocent, the psychological damage to the parties involved is truly impossible to estimate and will never be made up for.

Alas! Who would still say that the profession of being a doctor is enviable? No wonder my eldest son, Haiman, doesn't want to study medicine.

### Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Xu Jin

Currently, there is no direct sterilizing agent for tuberculosis bacteria. All therapies help patients strengthen their body's ability to resist bacteria. At most, it limits the activity of tuberculosis bacteria. Promotes calcification of lesions. Among them, air injection is still an effective method. Because tuberculosis bacteria can build a layer of wax shell in the body. Existing drugs cannot penetrate this shell to kill the bacteria. Excessive toxicity is harmful to human cells. Therefore, there is still no specific medicine for treatment.

In addition to injecting air, ordinary pulmonary tuberculosis patients have been injected with calcium needles, glucose calcium, and vitamin D. According to the China Natural Science Newsletter (Central News Agency, Nanjing): "The compound ERG, which produces vitamin D, is now being tested on pulmonary tuberculosis patients by Dr. Rui Bo, and most of them have shown significant improvement after six months. After examining patients with severe tuberculosis, it was found that the bacteria were greatly reduced or disappeared. This drug is not a direct sterilizing agent, nor is it transformed into vitamin D to exert its effect. It helps patients strengthen their body's resistance to bacteria, so that they can recover sooner."

It can be seen that the so-called new treatment method still does not escape the scope of enhancing resistance. It can be used as evidence that there is still no direct sterilizing agent.

However, there are lung patients who have been injected with countless calcium needles and still have no tendency to harden. In addition to prescribing rest for those who cannot be treated by air injection due to their condition, there is often no way to help. The author encountered two cases, which were ineffective after prolonged calcium injection, and improved after using "Ebasal" (Bayer). Ebasal is a copper preparation produced by Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, mainly used for exudative pulmonary tuberculosis and exudative-cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis, especially for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis with a tendency to harden. This medicine is divided into five doses: 0.01 cm, 0.025 cm, 0.05 cm, 0.075 cm to 0.1 cm. It was originally a dry powder preparation, and when used, it was prepared into a solution with distilled water, and was only limited to intravenous injection, once every two days, increasing in order. After each full dose is used up, it is necessary to rest for two or three months before continuing to use it, and calcium needles and vitamins can still be injected during the interval. One young patient had a significant increase in food intake and stopped coughing after receiving a full dose of "Ebasal" and calcium needles. He is still doing business in Taiwan and still writes letters from time to time to say thank you. There was also a worker who moved from the mainland with the factory. After traveling to Shanghai, he was tired and hard-working, and suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, and also had enlargement of the heart. His appetite was greatly reduced, his appearance was thin, and he was treated with calcium needles for a long time without effect. He was extremely discouraged and almost despaired of life. The author tried to treat him with "Ebasal" and firmly told him to maintain optimism and reduce labor. After three full doses of injection, the condition improved greatly. Now he is physically strong and still works in the factory, and his pessimism and despair have become a thing of the past. The real reward for a doctor is not in the amount of the consultation fee and the prosperity of the reputation, but in the sincere comfort after completing the mission. Therefore, the grateful smile of the patient is the greatest encouragement to the doctor. (To be continued)

Jun Qing notes that although the "Ebasal" recommended by Mr. Xu is effective, its side effects are also very large, so do not use it indiscriminately without the guidance of an expert. Otherwise, this drug has been around for many years, why is there still no sound and color, and no one pays attention to it?

### On benefiting others and oneself

— Wu Yong

Mr. Bai Yong previously wrote an article in this publication entitled "Altruism, Fun, Selfishness," in which he mentioned that some Chinese people regard serious things as child's play, and regard play things as serious; he believes that this phenomenon is due to people valuing self-interest. The author believes that this statement is not only insightful, but also the conclusion is very correct.

Some people in our country often handle very important things in a hasty and lackluster manner. What is the reason for this? The reason is nothing more than that those things have no direct interest to them personally, so although the event is important, they deal with it sloppily. If it involves the inflow and outflow of private money, they will definitely do it vigorously and vividly, and their spirits will appear extraordinarily sufficient.

It is only natural for people to value self-interest; people who sacrifice themselves to feed tigers are rarely seen in history, and it is good enough for one to do so without harming others. However, excessive self-interest often fails to achieve the purpose expected by selfishness, and will produce the opposite effect, such as Confucius's saying "haste makes waste". Let's take an example to clarify it. For example, the purpose of advertisements broadcast on radio in our country is naturally to promote the sales of goods and increase profits, but the audience of radio all knows that according to the current advertising techniques, it is not only insufficient to attract customers, but sometimes it will make the audience hate the goods praised in the advertisements. We must know that the purpose of people listening to the radio is mostly for entertainment, not necessarily to listen to advertisements; but today's radio announcers often put ten or twenty kinds of goods advertisements together to report, like a monk chanting scriptures, reading for ten or twenty minutes in a row, with occasional interruptions such as "Ah yes," "This station's phone number is so-and-so," or "Attention to Mr. So-and-so's residence," and even boasting that if the audience does not buy a certain commodity today, the price will rise tomorrow. What other listeners think, I don't know, but personally, I always feel that advertising has reached this point, it is inevitably a bit of the idiom "exhausting evil," too good, and I can't help but feel disgusted, and secretly made up my mind: even if I want to buy a certain type of commodity, I will never be willing to choose the goods advertised in the advertisement. I guess that there are also a lot of people among the radio audience who feel the same way as I do. This is an example of being too good to achieve the purpose.

On the contrary, the advertisements broadcast on radio by Westerners are mostly simple and clear, and they are finished in a few words, and then they continue with the entertainment program, which makes people feel clean and generous. Some companies and businesses in the United States not only do not adopt the method of self-praise for their products, but also go further and advocate telling the truth; for example, a certain soap factory only said about its own soap: soap is just soap, and this brand of soap is not more exceptional than other brands of soap. For example, Hollywood's "Farmers Market" once said in an advertisement: "Today, the tomatoes in this market are of poor quality, and even feeding pigs feels too bad. It is best to wait until tomorrow to buy them." Such advertisements often leave a good impression in people's minds and are sufficient to promote the sales of goods.

This reminds me that during World War II, there was an announcer on the German Berlin radio station nicknamed "Good Good Jazz." This gentleman was an excellent current affairs commentator; his remarks may have contained toxins, but because his language was humorous, his arguments were incisive, his tone was pleasant, and his words were always thinking of the listeners' current interests, even the radio listeners of the United Nations loved to listen to "Good Good Jazz" program. What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple, because his program is more entertaining than promotional, that is, it is entertaining in a way that is also informative. In other words, "Good Good Jazz" is to achieve the purpose of self-interest by means of benefiting others.

The result of everyone fighting for self-interest is that self-interest is difficult to obtain, but it often creates a chaotic situation. The phrase "everyone acts in their own way" on the one hand means that everyone seeks self-interest, and on the other hand means that there is no order. The author may as well give a "seeing the big from the small" example here. Because public vehicles in this city are not enough, passengers often crowd in a rush; because everyone wants to be the first, the door is blocked, forming a chaotic mess, but it is not as fast as getting on the bus in an orderly manner.

No matter how humble a person is, if he is always selfish, he will never gain people's support; no matter how big or small a thing is, if he only plans for himself when dealing with it, there will be no good results. Westerners do things mostly with a whole plan in advance, because they think carefully and arrange everything perfectly, so even though the special situation is complicated, it is still organized. The secret is nothing more than that the person who is doing things focuses on the things he is doing, not on his own self-interest, so he can promote the completion of the matter. By extension, if we can think for the other person when we treat people and things, we can avoid many unnecessary troubles. The Confucian concept of "repaying resentment with virtue" and Jesus's teaching of "overcoming hatred with love" are intended to benefit others, but in fact they are also self-interest.

### Things happen by chance

— Tiaoying

One day, Hollywood resident Nan Rick suddenly discovered that his car had been stolen, so he borrowed a neighbor's car to report the case, but on the way home, a speeding car came from behind and dented the back of the car Nan Rick was riding in. Nan Rick was furious, thinking that his car had already been stolen, and borrowing someone else's car had caused another problem. How was he going to explain it when he got back! He jumped out of the car in a rage to negotiate with the owner of the car behind, but unexpectedly, the car behind was the very one that had been stolen! The car thief was trying to escape, but Nan Rick would not let him go, and managed to catch the thief with the stolen goods and hand him over to the police.

A woman named McKinney in Washington, D.C., fell from the window of a five-story building, but unexpectedly, someone had a very strong clothesline hanging outside the window on the fourth floor. She fell on the rope and bounced into a bathroom on the third floor - a male guest was taking a bath.

In Riva, France, a man named Tan Lier had almost the same luck as Mrs. McKinney, but even more strange. He fell all the way down from the seventh floor, and when he was about to reach the cement on the sidewalk, there was a baby stroller below, and the mother had just picked up the child. Tan Lier happened to fall into the empty stroller - Tan Lier was unharmed, and the child was not frightened at all, but the mother was so frightened that she fainted and injured her ankle when she fell to the ground.

In Camden, New Jersey, USA, one day a house suddenly filled with thick smoke, as if there was a fire. After the firefighters arrived, it took them an hour to find the source of the smoke. It turned out that there was a swallow's nest under the eaves of the house, and the careless swallow had brought an unextinguished cigarette butt into it.

A pigeon in Washington, D.C., caused the same trouble as the swallow in New Jersey in the previous section, but when the firefighters arrived, they were unable to do anything and watched as an apartment building turned to ashes.

### Turtle Sacrifice

— Chengren

Turtles are abundant in tropical oceans, and each time they lay eggs, they can lay from one hundred to two hundred eggs. The large ones often reach more than six feet, and the small ones are less than two inches. Those that live on the coast are commonly called sea turtles, and those that live on land are called land turtles.

Turtles are also revered as a kind of "totem" among the natives of the South Seas. Turtle sacrifices are also held in places such as the Andaman Islands and Borneo, and there are restrictions on hunting.

The turtle sacrifice held in the Andaman Islands is performed by the elder of the tribe first painting the skin of a young man with mud, decorating his hair with hibiscus, and wrapping his waist with leaves. He sits upright on a straw mat, and the elder vigorously tears the meat of the turtle caught last night into pieces and puts them in a wooden bowl. The meat pieces are dipped in oil and smeared on the young man's body and lips. At this time, the young man is not allowed to speak. Then the elder will make the young man swallow the meat pieces, and his close relatives on his left and right will shake the young man's body from side to side. The young man sits upright all night, not allowed to close his eyes and doze off. In order to prevent him from falling asleep, his family members, brothers and sisters gather around him and tell him strange and wonderful things. The young man is aware of the knowledge of being a strong man, so he will never fall asleep. It is not until the third day that he can lie down, and on the fourth day he can go to the coast to wash off the oil on his hair and skin, and he can still catch fish in the sea.

On the same day, relatives and friends will be invited to hold a grand sacrifice. The young man who has become a strong man will shake the "Bigeas" tree, scattering the leaves, and the villagers will beat drums and clap their hands, dancing wildly all night. After this ritual, the young man is recognized as a formal strong man and can participate in various gatherings and fight with foreign tribes.

### Reminiscences of a Trip to Mount Hua

— Half-Dream

I, Hua Shan, once stayed at the East Peak, exploring Wei Qing's gamble platform, a dangerous place; ascended the South Peak, exited the South Gate, descended the Changkong Plank Road, explored the Chaoyuan Cave and He Zu Cave, two dangerous places; ascended the Great Upper Square, Three Officials Cave, Eight Immortals Cave, Golden Immortal Cave, three dangerous places. At the time, I did not know the dangers, thinking that the Azure Dragon Ridge was a flat and wide road, but I don't know why the banished immortal was so timid, it is really incomprehensible.

Generally, mountain climbing is all about doing it in one go. If the spirit is discouraged, the strength will weaken. Many who travel to Mount Hua stop at the Returning Heart Stone. They can't even climb the Thousand-Foot Cliff and Hundred-Foot Gorge, let alone the Changkong Plank Road and gamble platform? What the ancients called overcoming difficulties, isn't it not only the legs and feet as the vehicle, but also the spirit of moving forward as a major part of it?

When I was at the East Peak, I met a Taoist priest, Wu Yuan Dun, who presented me with poems, and I wrote two poems in response. One said, "On the summit of Chaoyang Peak, the wind is raging, coming from afar to climb makes the excitement even longer, I wish to taste a sip of immortal dew, for hundreds of millions of years to be full of fine wine (Chaoyang Peak is the East Peak, there is an immortal palm on it)." The iron chessboard is in the iron pavilion, climbing dangers and descending into the depths are like being in the void, the world is originally like a game of chess, throwing a pot and laughing breaks the primordial chaos. I left it as a memento, I don't know if it still exists today.

The height of Changkong Plank Road is said to be nine li up and down (according to the Taoist priest). At the beginning of spring that year, a pilgrim fell and was searched for, and his bones were found after three days. The place of falling was no longer under the jurisdiction of Huayin County, but according to the iron chains and wooden boards, they were very strong and not easy to break. If it wasn't for a misstep, he wouldn't have been buried in the wilderness. The place for contemplation (also known as He Lao Stone Chamber), is indeed an excellent training ground. Those with strong will, like immortals Hao Taigu and others, sitting in meditation here, will have considerable assistance. As for those who choose scenic spots and explore curiosities, once they arrive, they will never linger, it is purely a fleeting impression, and no relationship is born.

The West Peak is also known as Lotus Peak. Taoist Liu Yunxia asked me to write a couplet, and I wrote the sentence "Ten thousand mountains surround the beautiful sky, nine yokes soar into the clouds, the Tao proves immortality," leaving it as a memento. Beside it, a Taoist priest named Chen wrote for me

### Jasmine

— Floating Clouds

As spring deepens, jasmine comes on the market. This flower is clear and beautiful, not large, but rich and fragrant, most suitable for women to press on their temples to aid their makeup. Li Yu in Idle Sentiments writes: "The jasmine flower is solely designed to aid makeup, is it born to charm women? All flowers open at dawn, this one alone opens at dusk. Opening at dusk is to prevent people from playing with it, keeping it secret to await dawn makeup. All flowers have no holes on the calyx, this one alone has holes. Having holes is because it cannot be supported without them, born to be a place to stand. If so, women's makeup is a natural creation. Planting other trees is for men, planting this flower is solely for women; since it is for women, then it should be regarded as family. Only Lin Bu takes plum as his wife, those who take jasmine as their wife should be all over the world."

Master Li's argument is quite elegant. In an era with men as the center of society, "planting this flower solely for women" is indeed extremely rare! The jasmine can be said to be a meritorious servant of women. But then he says: "Since it is for women, then it should be regarded as family." In the end, the jasmine is still for men.

Also, in Six Records of a Floating Life, there is also an interesting record about jasmine: "...Yun had already laughed and fell into my arms, unable to make a sound, feeling the strong fragrance of jasmine on her temples, I patted her back and explained it with other words, saying: 'I think the ancients used jasmine's shape and color like pearls, so they used it to aid makeup and press temples, not knowing that this flower must be stained with the air of oily hair and powdered face, its fragrance is even more lovable, the offered Buddha's hand should retreat three houses.' Yun then stopped laughing and said: 'The Buddha's hand is a gentleman among fragrances, only existing intentionally or unintentionally; jasmine is a petty person among fragrances, so it must borrow people's power, its fragrance is like flattering and smiling with shrugged shoulders.' I said: 'Why do you keep away from gentlemen and get close to petty people?' Yun said: 'I laugh at gentlemen loving petty people.'"

Once jasmine is on a beauty's head, its fragrance becomes even more lovable, it is because what is lovable about it is not entirely the fragrance of jasmine, but because there is a beauty's ingredient in it. Flowers and beauties complement each other, and Yunniang's theory of gentlemen and petty people is inevitably vulgar, but her pure happiness in the boudoir is indeed enviable.

According to some, jasmine is also called molli, and Su Dongpo called it hidden musk, its fragrance is known to be strong. The Interpretation of Names says that it originated in Persia, and now it mostly grows in the south. The northern name nai mu shui comes from Fujian and Guangdong, the trunk is thick and the stem is strong, only three or four feet high; the vine comes from Jiangnan, with weak stems growing in clusters, and some are as long as ten feet. The leaves are similar to tea but slightly larger, and the flowers have single and double petals. A kind of pearl jasmine flower is like a small lotus and is the most precious. The buds are like pearls at first, and they only bloom at dusk, filling the room with fragrance. Plucking off the tender branches, allowing the branches to grow again, then the branches will become more luxuriant and the flowers will become denser. He said that behind the West Peak, there is a cave called Black Wind, with steep cliffs up and down, and there is no way to enter. Huang Ziyang (named Guangyao) of Huayin was curious, and used a long rope to bind a giant basket, sat in it, and was lowered from the peak, reaching the cave door and entering it. Holding a torch, he walked for more than a day, and saw several people in strange clothes. They asked Huang where he came from and why he came here. Huang replied that he was seeking the Tao. They all praised his ambition, talked to him for several days, and then gave him a book. Huang took it out, kept it secret, and studied it day and night, gaining a glimpse of the doorway. One day, he was lying in bed and hadn't woken up, and was seen by someone. Suddenly, a fire started in the book, burning it all to ashes. Huang's spirit was confused, and after a long time, he became even more confused, so he became a Taoist priest. After a few months, he returned home again. Feeling a little clearer, he used his insights to teach his disciples, and wrote a book called The Source of Principle and Qi, which was printed and distributed outside. I entrusted Taoist Chen to find this book, but I have not been able to find it yet. It is difficult to determine whether what he said is true or false.

Hao Taigu in Huashan Sheng Cave, seen in the Biography of the Seven Immortals novel, but Huashan also has Hao Zu Cave, I was unable to climb and explore it. Except for the Middle Peak (also known as Jade Maiden Peak), the four peaks of Huashan are all strange, standing upright like lotus flowers, looking at them from afar, white clouds obscure their waists, like tied belts. When going down the mountain, there was a poem saying: "Layered clouds are gloomy, the ancient lotus flower is tied to my heart, having fully seen the strange mountains for fifty li, a clear sun bids farewell to the distant peaks."

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Life must have sound, light, and fragrance.

Shoes that have walked in the swamp, even if they are not broken yet, can only walk in the swamp in the future.

Between people, some become closer because of understanding; others, because of understanding, leave further.

### Night Talk with You Han

— Chen Meng'an

Gradually feeling the spring cold subsiding, the fragrant news by the moon is still faint, let us rest together temporarily under the trees, painstakingly seeking guidance from the scriptures; to know that being ashamed of you is also being ashamed of myself, let people say what is right and what is wrong, pure conversation and expression are mostly affairs, laughing and forgetting words are not mutually contradictory.

Speaking must know not to touch one's tongue, peach and plum trees naturally form a path without words, who taught the monkey to climb trees, I laugh at myself for being like a louse waving its arms; I wish to follow the clouds and dragons up and down, directly discarding the discussion and ignoring morning and dusk. The green lamp has a taste of empty regret, cherish this good night and discuss together.

### Qing Lei Studies Figures

Previously, I wrote a passage about the "Jinshan Temple" Talks (which was published on the 22nd). After reading the advertisement in this newspaper by the temple monk Tai Cang regarding the temple's fundraising and reconstruction, mentioning the words "Jinshan Jiangtian Temple," I remembered that "Jinshan Temple" is not the temple's official name. "Jinshan" is the name of the mountain (actually just a small island in the Yangtze River). The temple is on the mountain, but the mountain is not the temple. It should have a separate temple name. I am not unaware of the name "Jiangtian Temple." The story of the imperial stele of "Jiangda Yilan" was also mentioned in my previous article. However, if I had not read Tai Cang's article, I would have forgotten it for a long time. The reason is that the name "Jinshan Temple" has been circulating for a long time and widely. Not only is it so in plays and novels, but even literati in the era of the imperial examinations used it as a reference. In the eleventh year of Guangxu, the yiyou year of the Qing Dynasty, the main examiner of Zhejiang was Bai Huan, and the associate examiner was Pan Yantong. There was an unsuccessful candidate who made a humorous couplet based on the surnames of Bai and Pan: "Jinshan Temple kicks the literary champion, it is difficult to escape the overturned alms bowl"; "Purple Stone Street curtains pick up the martial sister-in-law, secretly agreeing to tailor clothes." The pairing is extremely skillful, and each word is stable and well-matched. It also uses "Jinshan Temple" as the temple name. I think this author was deeply influenced by the impression of the theater stage. The upper couplet has "flooding," "broken bridge," "producing ten," "closing the alms bowl," and the lower couplet has "provoking," "tailoring clothes." The old capital actor Xiao Cuihua often performed it. "Purple Stone Street" is seen in the Water Margin. Whether there is such a street in Yangyi County, Shandong today is not verifiable.

In the long special article "Vice Presidential Election Runoff" published on the first page of the 25th, there are many witty remarks. A female representative asked Mr. Weng, "Who does your conscience vote for?" Representative Weng smiled and replied, "I vote for conscience." Just slightly changing the position of the words is a good pun. The response is quick and witty, and can be called a wonderfully humorous talent. Could this gentleman write "conscience" as a person's name on the ballot he cast? According to the plays, there are many lines referring to "conscience." For example, in the "Lotus Lantern," in the scene where Pan Xun interrogates the two sons, Liu Yanchang asks his wife Wang Guiying, "You see this up?" His wife replies, "Green heaven." Liu asks again, "Down?" Again she replies, "Spreading earth." Asks again: "Us as parents?" Again, the answer is "Based on the word conscience!" Again, like in "A Ladle of Snow", in the scene of reviewing the head, Lu Bing asks Tang Qin, "You look at this up?" Tang Qin replies, "Blue sky." He asks again, "Down?" Again, the answer is "Spreading earth." Again he asks, "Us officials?" The answer is, "Based on the word conscience." Again he asks: "If a person has no conscience?" Tang Qin paused slightly, answering, "Let big dogs eat them!" (There is often one more question and answer, which is changed according to the plot, and the body language, eyes and techniques are also different, you must experience it in the field to know its wonders. Now I won't go into detail.) I think these two representatives can also imitate the above two examples. The female representative asks, "You look at this up?" (You must point with your hand when saying this.) Representative Weng replies, "Green heaven." (You must look up when answering.) Asks again: "This down?" (You must point to the ground with your finger as you say it.) Again, the answer is "Spreading earth." Ask again, "Us voters?" The answer is, "Based on the word conscience." If you ask again, "If a person has no conscience?" Then what should be the answer below should be changed according to each person's situation and cannot be insisted on one way.
