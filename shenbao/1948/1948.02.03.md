### Developing Taiwan's Resources: US-China Technical Discussions; We Propose New Aid Plan to the US

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] It has been learned that the US and China are in discussions regarding the development of Taiwan Province's resources and the support of Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises. Taiwan Province is rich in mineral resources, and their development would benefit domestic industrial development and the absorption of foreign exchange. The US is very willing to invest and assist in this. The emphasis is on two points: one is economic, namely supporting industrial and mining enterprises; the other is military, where the US will help us complete our naval base plan in the Taiwan Strait. In principle, this investment cooperation is no longer a problem. Currently, technical issues are being studied. If realized, in addition to economic aid, the US will also send a large number of technical personnel to Taiwan to assist in the work.

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] Responsible individuals state that General Wedemeyer, during his on-the-ground investigation of the Chinese situation, proposed a South China Economic Revival Plan. It is said that if South China's politics and economy can be stabilized, the US is willing to provide assistance. Therefore, since Song Ziwen took office as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, he has taken various steps to make the area a national chemical industry center and strive to develop transportation and other industrial and commercial enterprises.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] There has been new development in the issue of US aid loans to China. According to reliable sources, our government has indicated to the US its hope to obtain long-term, annual aid from the US if possible, to replace Secretary of State Marshall's proposed monthly aid plan. Our side's reason for proposing this new plan is that Marshall's 300 million loan, divided into 15 months, provides only 20 million USD per month, which is only used to balance our foreign exchange balance. However, the aid needed for China's current situation is not only to balance foreign exchange balance, but also to tighten currency and increase production, which are all routine matters. The above three aspects cannot be solved by monthly aid of 20 million USD. Therefore, the hope is to change to annual, long-term aid to thoroughly solve China's economic difficulties. This hope has been conveyed to the US State Department by our government. Whether the US agrees is currently unknown. According to informed sources, our country's foreign exchange balance deficit was 250 million USD last year. This year, the situation is better, and the estimated foreign exchange balance deficit will be 210 million USD. Marshall's proposed 300 million USD aid loan to China, to be paid in 15 months, is only sufficient to bring our foreign exchange balance into equilibrium.

US Draft of Aid to China Plan Now in Final Stages

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] Officials here are optimistic about the future of US aid to China. Efforts are now underway in Washington and Nanjing to have Secretary of State Marshall's recommendation submitted to Congress before February 20th. In Washington, Bei Zuyi and Ambassador Gu Weijun are strongly advocating China's need for aid to the US. In Nanjing, Chairman Chiang and President Zhang Qun are constantly discussing ways with Ambassador Stuart to ensure China is eligible for aid. These individuals believe that the US Congress will ultimately pass a loan to China based on the Marshall Plan. The only issues remaining to be negotiated are the amount and timing. Therefore, there is great interest here in the proposal by New York Governor Dewey to provide China with aid of more than 250 million USD annually for the next three to four years.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, United Press] US Secretary of State Marshall will submit a new foreign aid bill to Congress on the 2nd. This bill is designed to prevent unexpected incidents and includes appropriations for aid to China and appropriations for the needs of the occupying forces.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] State Department personnel announced late on the 1st that the drafting of the aid to China plan has reached its final stage. State Department economic experts are also preparing a comprehensive list of the US aid needed by various countries around the world for Marshall to respond to Vandenberg's request, based on various sources of information. This comprehensive report will include the European Recovery Program, the aid to China plan, and other plans that the State Department deems necessary. It will take several days to prepare.

The full text of the measures is as follows:

Article 1: The collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 37th year shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Law and these measures.

After assessing the tax payable in accordance with the tax law, it shall notify the new tax. If there is an overpayment, it shall be refunded.

Article 3: The provisional tax amount shall be estimated in accordance with the following provisions: (1) Refer to the multiple of increase in the comparison between the budget of the 37th year and the 36th year's income and the budget of the profit-seeking enterprise profit tax, and the multiple of increase in the comparison of the 36th year and 35th year's general price index. The total amount of profit-seeking enterprise income tax and profit tax payable by each taxpayer as determined in the 36th year shall be temporarily calculated at six times the amount. (2) For profit-seeking enterprises newly established in the 36th year or established before the end of the 35th year but have not yet paid taxes, the amount shall be temporarily calculated at 12.6% of the actual amount of capital for which they have applied for registration. For the estimated provisional tax amount calculated in accordance with the first paragraph, if the business period in the 35th year is less than one year, or calculated in accordance with the second paragraph, if the business period in the 36th year is less than one year or more than one year, it shall be converted according to the proportion of the actual business period to the whole year.

If the number of firms compiling the standard ratio in the preceding paragraph is less than the number specified in paragraph 3 of Article 8, the firms with more complete account books and documents shall be investigated to make up the difference.

Article 8: The method of compiling the standard ratio is as follows: (1) When compiling, the industry shall be divided in detail. Within one industry, manufacturing and sales, wholesale and retail shall be distinguished. The amount of capital and business (or revenue) shall be divided into large, medium, and small grades.

(1) For sales and manufacturing industries, if the income amount calculated based on sales is higher than the income amount calculated based on capital, the income amount shall be assessed using the sales net profit rate; if the income amount calculated based on capital is higher than the income amount calculated based on sales, the income amount shall be assessed using the capital net profit rate. (2) For industries that provide labor or credit, the income amount shall be assessed using the capital net profit rate. (3) If the sales amount is not accurate, it may be assessed using the capital turnover rate. If the revenue amount is not accurate in industries that provide labor or credit, it may be assessed using the revenue expense rate.

Article 11: Those who should be decided directly in accordance with the law may estimate the income amount by referring to the standard ratio in Article 8 or Article 9 and weighting it heavily.

Article 12: After the competent tax collection authority assesses the tax payable, it shall fill out a payment notice for the amount higher than the provisional tax amount, deliver it to the taxpayer, and pay it within ten days.

### Sun Ke Reports on Constitutional Preparation Work at the National Government; Proposes Improvement Suggestions for Elections

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 2nd] Vice Chairman Sun presided over the National Government's monthly meeting on the morning of the 2nd and reported on the progress of the preparation work for the constitutional implementation process and the review of the elections. Sun first explained the government's preparation work for the implementation of the constitution, such as the revision of the organizational law of the Five Yuans and the drafting of various laws and regulations. Secondly, when reviewing the elections, he believed that because this was the first time in our country, the various laws and regulations were not prepared enough, resulting in countless disputes. Sun put forward the following three points, believing that they should be improved: (1) The register of voters should be fully prepared in advance and handled by the personnel responsible for handling household registration. The election was rushed, resulting in various malpractices. (2) The provisions in the election law regarding party nomination and signature nomination were ambiguous, resulting in today's phenomenon of intra-party competition. Later, the State Council passed supplementary election regulations, which restricted candidates nominated by political parties and signature nominations, but it was too late, making it difficult to remedy. (3) The regulations on preventing election fraud were too imperfect, resulting in disputes after the fact that could not be handled according to law.

### 京滬麵粉存貨過剩　監委主開放北運　公務員待遇應按月依指數調整

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 2nd] The Control Yuan held a routine discussion meeting on the 2nd. Chairman Huang Fengchi discussed the treatment of public servants and educators. The suggestions of Control Committee member Miao Peicheng and others have been forwarded to the National Government by the President of the Yuan. The Yuan is scheduled to hold a monthly meeting on the morning of the 3rd, at which Committee member Yu Shude, who has returned from an investigation in Shanghai, will give an oral report on "The Investigation of the Economic Crisis in North China and Government Measures". Regarding foreign exchange and other points, the Japanese newspaper has already noted them on the 2nd. As for the "permit fee" for the export of flour to the north, Yu stated: "Although there is no such thing as a 'permit fee,' the additional demands and red tape caused by the improper implementation of the permit system are real. The Ministry of Food allocates export quotas for flour to the north to the Flour Industry Association of the Four Regions and the Gongji United Association of the Five Major Factories. These two groups then manage the distribution themselves. Northern grain merchants in Shanghai must purchase grain through these manufacturers in order to obtain export permits. The manufacturers, in order to make more profit, exploit customers, resulting in sales prices higher than the general market price. This price difference varies, with some reaching as high as 150,000. This fact is acknowledged in the price lists reported by the manufacturers, which state that the sales price of flour in Shanghai is too low, so they have to increase profits from the northern transport quota." Yu and others believe that the consequences of the permit system not only threaten the decline of the flour industry in Nanjing and Shanghai, but also shift all the burden to the vast poor consumers in North China. This is unfair and lacks purpose, and they believe that a thorough review is necessary. They have also found that the Ministry of Food's restrictions on the transport of flour to the north are too strict, and that the stock of flour in Nanjing and Shanghai is indeed excessive. In the future, the appropriate storage volume of flour in Nanjing and Shanghai should be determined, and at the same time, all restrictions on the transport to the north should be lifted, achieving two goals at once. Committee members Miao Peicheng and Li Xiaoting, who went to Shanghai with Yu to conduct the investigation, had not yet returned to Nanjing on the 2nd. Yu visited the President of the Yuan on the evening of the 2nd to report on the investigation and prepared his report for the 3rd overnight. Their formal written report will have to wait until Miao and Li return to Nanjing to collect all the materials and draft it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] At a discussion meeting held by the Control Yuan on the morning of the 2nd, the issue of the treatment of civil and military officials was discussed. It was generally agreed that treatment should be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, and the original method of distributing goods in kind should be maintained. Regarding the issue of downsizing various agencies, it was suggested that the government handle it with caution. The meeting also decided to suggest to the Legislative Yuan that it formulate organizational regulations for a National Public Servants and Educators Welfare Promotion Association. He Hanwen was designated to draft the proposal, which is expected to be formally submitted at the Control Yuan discussion meeting on Thursday.

### 省縣自治問題另行起草通則　國府法政聯席審査會議決定

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 2nd] Regarding the implementation procedures for provincial and county autonomy, the Legal and Political Review Committees of the State Council held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd to discuss the issue. It was decided to draft separate general rules for autonomy, the principle being to first implement provincial and county autonomy, and after completing the foundations of local finance and security, to implement popular elections for provincial and county heads. The meeting on the 2nd was presided over by Chen Burei. First, the draft general rules for provincial and county autonomy, drafted by the Ministry of Interior and approved by the Executive Yuan, was submitted for discussion. Some people believed that there were two points in the implementation procedure that should be considered: A. The conditions for implementing county autonomy should be revised, that is, the conditions were too harsh, affecting the deadline for implementation, and could be deleted. B. The issue of the timing of the implementation of autonomy in provinces and counties, which was discussed at length during the meeting. Some people advocated deleting the conditions section. Secondly, regarding the order of implementation of provincial and county autonomy, the original draft stipulated that provincial autonomy would begin after county autonomy was completed. There was considerable debate during the discussion on the 2nd, and the majority advocated completing provincial autonomy first. The drafting of the Provincial Autonomy Law and the County Autonomy Law will have to wait until after the Provincial and County Representatives Conference can begin. Furthermore, this resolution will be submitted to the Review Committee for review, and then sent to the State Council for discussion, and then sent to the popularly elected Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Therefore, it is estimated that the revised general rules will be passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan sometime between June and July of this year, and the popular election of provincial and county heads will be further delayed, possibly between August and September of this year.

### Welcoming the Tibetan Business Delegation's Arrival

The Tibetan business delegation, led by head Ji Guoba, arrived in Shanghai on the 18th via India and Hong Kong. The next day, they paid a visit to Mayor Wu. They entered Beijing yesterday to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang and relevant parties. After a short stay in Beijing, the delegation will return to Shanghai to inspect the city's industries and commerce. This delegation's arrival, undeterred by the long and arduous journey, to tour Beijing and Shanghai, is another new manifestation of the Chinese nation's sincere solidarity. As we bid farewell to the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe, we extend a warm welcome to the Tibetan business delegation.

The Tibetan people are members of the Chinese nation, as close as brothers and sisters. The only reason for distance is Tibet's location on the frontier, with obstructed transportation. This situation is the same as in Xinjiang. As the older brother, we are deeply concerned about the situation in Tibet. Therefore, the central government has sent personnel to Tibet several times, hoping to make the relationship between China and Tibet closer. Secretary-General Shen of the Shanghai Municipal Government was the high official who was sent to Tibet under orders at that time and has contributed greatly to strengthening Sino-Tibetan relations while residing there. However, the relationship between people depends on mutual visits. Only with mutual visits can mutual understanding be enhanced. We have long awaited the arrival of the Tibetan delegation. Now, the arrival of the Tibetan business delegation in Beijing and Shanghai will help to enhance mutual understanding between China and Tibet. We wish the delegation a pleasant and healthy stay!

The Tibetan business delegation's arrival at this time has even deeper meaning. Two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the world remains turbulent, and the reconstruction of a peaceful order is still an unrealized ideal. What is even more worrying is that the current superficial disputes have deeper implications. Some people already believe that the world is divided in two. If the world is really divided in two, we have repeatedly stated that this division is not a confrontation between East and West, but a confrontation between hatred and benevolence, democracy and totalitarianism. Hatred may attract more crowds, just as totalitarianism, disguised as democracy, may also attract more crowds. Although Hitlerism based on hatred and totalitarianism has been overthrown, it has been replaced by another system based on hatred and totalitarianism. We do not believe that history will repeat itself, but we must pay attention to the lessons of history. What are the lessons of history? It is that a system based on hatred and totalitarianism cannot withstand the test of history and will inevitably collapse; although it may be able to dominate for a time, like Hitler and Mussolini in the past. The arrival of the Tibetan business delegation is precisely at a time when this system based on hatred and totalitarianism is attempting to dominate. We want to remind them of historical vigilance and increase their attention. It must be known that the so-called "Shangri-La" is a "utopia" fictionalized by writers. In today's era, characterized by radio, airplanes, rockets, radar, and atomic energy, there is no longer a so-called "Shangri-La". The delegation's flight from India to Beijing and Shanghai must show that the so-called spatial distance has now been completely broken. So, in this era, how should they conduct themselves?

In terms of the historical and geographical relationship between Tibet and China, the relationship between China and Tibet should be even closer in the future. Tibet is surrounded by mountains, and the routes into Tibet are mostly from east to west, either through Yunnan, Qinghai, or Xikang. Therefore, in terms of geographical location, mainland China and Tibet are actually a geographical unit. Since the Xinhai Revolution, we have had the slogan of the Five Races Republic, and the relationship between the Han and Tibetan peoples is like that of brothers. Last year, the National Assembly formulated the Constitution, which stipulates that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People; and the nationalism of the Three Principles of the People is to seek the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation externally, and the freedom and equality of all ethnic groups that constitute the Chinese nation internally. The starting point is benevolence. Now that the delegation has arrived, it is precisely the time when our country is implementing the Constitution. We hope that when the delegation returns to the west in the future, it can bring back our expectations for the Tibetan people, so that the relationship between China and Tibet will become closer, and we can work together to build this republic of the Three Principles of the People.

However, the main purpose of the Tibetan business delegation's arrival this time is to enhance Sino-Tibetan business and economic relations. It is necessary for China and Tibet to exchange what they have for what they need. What Tibet needs from us are tea, silk, and porcelain; and what it can export to us are medicinal materials and woolen goods. The purpose of this economic exchange is not only to facilitate the flow of goods, but also to enhance mutual understanding, which is especially necessary in the current international situation. However, due to the obstructed roads between China and Tibet, this exchange has been difficult to carry out, which is regrettable. What we should do is to focus on developing transportation between China and Tibet, so that future exchanges between China and Tibet can no longer bypass India. Highways and railways should be built between Kang Tibet, Qinghai and Tibet, and Yunnan and Tibet. Even if this construction requires huge amounts of money and is not easy to achieve in a short time, air transportation between China and Tibet should be planned quickly. As for trade with Tibet, the government should especially encourage it. Government trade institutions, such as the barter organization of the Central Trust Bureau, should be promoted first. However, it is said that there are artificial factors involved in the obstructed transportation between China and Tibet. Therefore, we also hope that the Tibetan authorities can understand the necessity of enhancing Sino-Tibetan relations and resolutely eliminate all artificial obstacles, so that contact between China and Tibet can become more frequent, and the feelings between the Han and Tibetan peoples can become deeper.

### 交部儲運處　昨正式成立

[Our city dispatch] The Ministry of Communications Storage and Transportation General Office was formally established at 9 a.m. on the 2nd, after Vice Minister Ling of the Ministry of Communications presided over the handover ceremony. The Executive Yuan headquarters also sent personnel to supervise the handover. The new agency was formed by merging the Executive Yuan Storage and Transportation Bureau, the Executive Yuan Shanghai Automobile Management Office, the Ministry of Communications Materials Storage and Transfer Office, and the Zhanghuabang Wharf Management Office. Chen Guangyuan is the director-general of the new office, and Zhang Yuanlun and Niu Ze are the vice directors. There are eight groups, including reception, warehousing, and transportation. Branch offices are established in Kowloon, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin. Materials factories are set up in Nanjing, Kunming, and Chongqing. The work of the new agency is to manage the loading, unloading, transportation, and storage of materials for government agencies across the country, especially the storage and transportation of foreign materials. The agency is currently entrusted with the storage and transportation of Japanese reparations materials, UNRRA continued transportation materials, U.S. relief materials, and social distribution of relief materials, so its responsibilities are very heavy. In the past, government agencies across the country handled the transportation of materials separately, resulting in a lot of waste of both manpower and materials. After the establishment of the new agency, transportation efficiency can be strengthened and the expenditure of the national treasury can be reduced.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] Zhou Shaozeng, manager of the Taiwan Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, flew to Shanghai on the 2nd to negotiate the export of provincial products.

### Construction of a Reservoir at Hongyanchi, Dihua

The Project is Underway Amidst Snow

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 2nd] The Xinjiang Water Conservancy Bureau is currently undertaking a very large and arduous water conservancy project in the suburbs of Urumqi to open up 70,000 mu of cultivated land in northern Xinjiang. This is the Hongyanchi Reservoir, which began construction last August. The only water source in Dihua is the Urumqi River, which comes from the snow accumulated in the Tianshan Mountains. During the annual dry season, the flow rate is four cubic meters per second. From July to August, when the snow melts, combined with mountain rain, the flow rate can reach as high as 200 cubic meters per second. Therefore, when farmland needs water, the water volume is insufficient, while the winter water volume and the summer and autumn floods are allowed to flow away, which is a great pity. Hongyanchi, on the right bank of the Urumqi River, is a natural reservoir. It was slightly renovated in 1946, and the storage capacity has increased from 6 million cubic meters to 14 million cubic meters. After the current project is completed, it can reach a storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters, enough to irrigate more than double the cultivated land in Dihua. The winter climate in Xinjiang is extremely cold, making the project very difficult. Yesterday, the reporter braved the snow and drove to the construction site to visit. All the construction workers were building sheds for the future sluice tunnel. The sheds were filled with charcoal fires to maintain a temperature above 10 degrees Celsius, and special facilities were used to bake sand, stones, mud, and ash to enhance their bonding effectiveness. Wang Heting, the director of the Xinjiang Water Conservancy Bureau in charge of the project, is a young engineer. In 1936, he was sent by the League of Nations to India to conduct practical investigations of water conservancy and participate in practical work. Wang told the reporter that many water conservancy projects in India are mostly across deserts and Gobi deserts, which is similar to the future water conservancy development in Xinjiang. The Hongyanchi Reservoir being constructed today is one of the first major peaceful construction projects after Zhang Wenbai's arrival. Some of the downstream local projects that have been completed are the result of the joint efforts of the National Army soldiers stationed in Xinjiang.

### US Aircraft Conducts Aerial Patrol in the Yellow Sea, Soviet Union Protests to the US, Alleging the Act Infringes on the Freedom of Soviet Commercial Navigation

[United Press, London, 2nd] Moscow Radio revealed on the 2nd that amidst the Soviet Union's recent intensified anti-US diplomatic battle, it has formally protested against the US military activities in Iran and against the "reconnaissance flights" of US aircraft over Soviet Far East shipping.

The broadcast cited TASS as saying: "The Soviet Foreign Ministry sent a note to the US ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 30th of last month, protesting that US aircraft, including Flying Fortresses, flew low over Soviet merchant ships in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan for reconnaissance, sometimes threatening them with dive-bombing, infringing on the freedom of navigation of merchant ships. Soviet crew members and passengers have expressed their indignation at this. Such flights are a blatant attempt by the United States to establish control in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan, far from its territorial waters. Such aerial activities can only be regarded as a manifestation of unwillingness to consider the legitimate interests of shipping by other countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the responsible authorities in the United States should instruct that there should be no more such violations."

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is expected that the State Department is studying this Soviet protest note and drafting a statement to vehemently refute it. According to a Tokyo report, the Allied Headquarters believes that aerial patrols in the Yellow Sea are within its jurisdiction and does not believe that US aircraft patrols in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan constitute an infringement on the sovereignty of merchant ships.

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Officials of the Far East Air Force refused to make any formal comments on the Soviet claim that US aerial squadrons were flying over Soviet ships in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, pointing out that the reported protest was made to the State Department, so there was no need to make any explanation. They pointed out that the Soviet Union's criticism of the occupying authorities, protesting to Washington or Moscow without notifying the responsible authorities here, has happened more than once. According to the procedure, Washington will ask the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to submit a formal report and then reply to the Kremlin. Previously, the criticism stated that US aircraft flew over the border of the Kuril Islands. An informal explanation was made here, stating that such incidents occurred due to navigation errors or poor weather. The US has never intended to take such actions.

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] According to unofficial opinions here, the US government will reject the Soviet protest against US aircraft reconnoitering Soviet merchant ships over the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. The flights of US aircraft in the above-mentioned areas are part of regular aviation activities, and the Soviet Union has no legal right to protest. Why the Soviet Union made this protest is still not fully understood here, but some parties claim that the Soviet Union may be "guilty." It is recalled that unofficial sources in China have repeatedly asserted that Soviet ships have transported weapons for the Chinese Communists from Soviet-controlled ports in southern Manchuria through the Yellow River to northern Shandong. The Soviet Union's claim that US aircraft "dived" at Soviet ships seems incorrect, as such movements are not only dangerous but also do not help with reconnaissance.

### Soviet Ambassador's Note to Iran Protests US Military Team's Activities in Iran, Saying They Constitute a Threat to the Soviet Border

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] A Truth News reporter in Tehran reported that the Soviet Union recently sent a note to the Iranian government, listing several facts to prove that US military advisors play a decisive role in Iranian military affairs and engage in guidance activities, turning Iran into a US military base. The reporter also said that the Iranian army, under the leadership of US military advisors, has obtained US military equipment, the format of which is the same as that given by the US to the Turkish army. Moreover, the weapons of the Iranian army are given by the US on a credit loan basis. In early 1947, US military advisors drafted a plan to reorganize the Iranian army, which was approved by the Iranian King and became the basis of the Iranian military structure. There is a special committee in the Iranian General Staff Headquarters, including US military advisors, who are drafting the rules of the Iranian army according to the American method. The US advisors are also drafting a plan to reorganize the Iranian Army Department, stipulating that Iranian military industry should be re-equipped according to American technology, so that it can manufacture and repair American weapons.

In addition, under the requirements and leadership of US advisors, a large airfield has been established in Iran, equipped with American equipment. Judging from the area of the airfield and the special interest expressed by the US advisors, it is clear that the airfield is not for Iranian aircraft. The establishment of underground oil depots in southern Iran by US representatives is also not to be ignored. In recent months, US advisors and other US representatives have arrived in Iran one after another. Moreover, US representatives are not only in the Iranian army but also participate in other Iranian institutions, especially the management of the civilian aircraft team of the Iranian Airlines, which is said to be an Iranian state-owned airline, but its main positions are occupied by US officials. It is expected that a large number of American officers and soldiers will soon arrive in Iran. The Truth News reporter also said that the facts listed by the Soviet military prove that the activities of the US aid mission in Iran may pose a danger to the Soviet border. For example, under the guidance of US military officers, fortifications are being built along the Soviet border in northern Iran. Recently, US advisors have frequently passed through areas adjacent to the Soviet Union by land and air, supposedly to inspect the Iranian army and police, but in reality, they are taking photos of the Soviet border and conducting military research. The Soviet note pointed out that the above-mentioned facts are not in line with the principles of promoting good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Iran. Therefore, the Soviet government requested the Iranian government to take necessary measures as soon as possible to eliminate the deteriorating situation that is being created.

### Iran Plans to Continue Borrowing from the United States to Purchase Weapons

[Reuters, Tehran, 2nd] Iranian Army Minister Marshal Binai submitted a bill to the parliament, requesting authorization for the government to apply for a loan of 10 million US dollars from the United States to purchase military equipment and ammunition needed by the Iranian army. The bill has been submitted to the parliament's special committee for research. Last year in June, the United States had already loaned the Iranian government 25 million US dollars to purchase military equipment and uniforms from the US surplus materials, most of which were used to purchase equipment, and only a small portion was used to purchase weapons.

### General Election in Italy Scheduled for April

The Constituent Assembly's Mission is Completed

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 2nd] This agency's reporter learned today that a decree will be drafted at the government meeting on Thursday, stipulating that Italy will hold political elections on April 18. The decree will also determine the date of the simultaneous meeting of the two houses of parliament. According to the new constitution, the parliamentary session must be held within 20 days after the general election, so political figures believe that the date may be set on May 8, which is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the first Italian parliament.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 1st] The mission of the Italian Constituent Assembly has come to an end today. The Constituent Assembly must be convened by the President, Prime Minister, and more than one-third of the members jointly requesting it. This meeting was elected and established on July 2, 1946, and its last discussed case was the issue of Sicilian autonomy, which was passed with a large majority in favor.

### Soviet Military Government in Germany Implements Reform Plan

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] German sources with close contacts with the Soviet military headquarters expect that there will soon be a large-scale change of the main figures in the Soviet military government in Germany, and military personnel will gradually be replaced by civilians. This plan has begun to be implemented. The Soviet authorities have never announced this reform. It is said that it was started after Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Beria came to Germany last autumn. There are two purposes: 1. Gradually replace the military personnel of the Soviet military government with civilians, so as to establish a more satisfactory relationship with German officials and politicians; 2. Strengthen the influence of the Soviet Communist Party within the Soviet military government in Germany.

### The Truth Daily Criticizes the U.S. for Increasing Defense Spending

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] The Soviet Communist Party's "Truth Daily" reported that defense expenditures in the Soviet Union's 1948 budget have decreased, while those in the U.S. budget have increased. It claimed that this contrast demonstrates which country desires peace and which is "planning new aggression." The text published in "Truth Daily," broadcast abroad by Moscow Radio, stated that defense expenditures in the Soviet budget have decreased from 18.4% to 17%, while the U.S. budget allocates 30% for expanding military power, and that "the actual expenses are far greater than this figure."

### U.S. Warships Visit Italian Seaports, U.S. Rejects Soviet Protest, New U.S.-Italy Trade Agreement Signed

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 2nd (Broadcast): The Soviet Union protested the U.S. fleet's visit to various Italian seaports, but the U.S. government formally rejected the protest today. The U.S. note to the Soviet Union stated that the U.S. warships' visit to Italy was approved in advance by the Italian authorities.

Further Dispatch: The U.S. and Italy signed a new trade agreement today, replacing the Treaty of Friendship, Trade, and Navigation concluded between the two countries in 1871.

Further Dispatch: Representatives of the foreign ministers of the U.K., U.S., France, and the Soviet Union are continuing to discuss the future status of Italian colonies in London today.

### Pakistani Foreign Minister Praises Gandhi in the U.S.

[United Press, Chicago, 1st] Pakistani Foreign Minister Chaudhry Zafarullah stated in a broadcast discussion at the University of Chicago today, "It is difficult to predict what the fate of India will be after Gandhi's assassination. The assassination of Gandhi is a signal of riots among the people he devoted his life to uniting. His lifelong aim was to completely prove the correctness of his method of striving for India's political freedom."

### U.S. Plans Defense Program to Cope with Future Atomic Warfare

Anglo-American Military Exercise Simulates Warfare in the South Pacific

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of Defense Forrestal is expected to announce soon a nationwide, permanent civil defense plan against atomic and chemical warfare. This plan may include how to broadly apply radar, how to prevent the spread of large fires, how to evacuate injured people, and whether large industrial areas should be decentralized. However, such actions will be very costly.

[United Press, Sydney, 2nd] The U.S. Navy's Task Force 38 recently arrived in Sydney for a five-day visit and is scheduled to conduct a simulated war exercise with the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Air Force off the coast of New South Wales on the morning of the 4th.

### Differing Opinions Between Parties on U.S. Tax Cut Bill

[United Press, Washington, 1st] U.S. House members will vote on the $650 million tax cut for U.S. taxpayers large and small on the 2nd, but the Senate may seek another path, advocating for a more economical plan. According to predictions from Republican House leaders, the election-year general tax cut bill proposed by the Republican House Ways and Means Committee Chairman in the committee is likely to pass with a two-to-one majority. According to Knudson's bill, personal exemptions would be increased by $100, and taxes would be reduced by 15% to 30%. To thwart the Republican plan, the Democratic Party will request that the House send the bill back to the Ways and Means Committee for redrafting.

### Ahn Jae-hong Expresses Opinions Attending Korean Committee

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] The United Nations Korean Committee and two subcommittees continued their meeting here at 10:30 this morning and invited Civil Administrator Ahn Jae-hong to attend in order to consult on opinions regarding South Korean civil administration.

HULL'S MEMOIRS

### Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance

— Translated by our editorial office

A Harbinger of Doom in the 1930s

In the early years of the Roosevelt administration, Germany was arming, Japan was engaged in war, and Italy was preparing for conflict. The most unfortunate aspect at the time was the many disputes between the three major Western democracies—the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—which negatively impacted their relations. Immediately after entering the State Department, I realized that only by adopting a common stance could the aforementioned three countries restore reason to these belligerent nations. It would have been even better if the Soviet Union could have joined us. But in reality, disagreements and discrimination among us often outweighed coordination, presenting a dismal picture.

In our relations with the U.K., Foreign Secretary Simon was often the source of trouble. Ever since Japan's invasion of Manchuria, I always felt that Simon lacked a firm fundamental stance. Based on all the information received, I believed he was too considerate of the Japanese; I still think so today. When President Chang decided to rebuild our navy immediately after taking office, bringing its strength to the level limited by the treaty, Simon asked us to abandon this plan, fearing that it would trigger a naval arms race. However, he did not propose abandoning the construction of British warships that were already underway. Simon was uncooperative at the London Economic Conference. He was cold and aloof.

In March 1935, Simon expressed opposition to the principle of on-site international inspection of arms production, which greatly angered the President. I agreed with this principle, and Roosevelt shared my opinion. I sent a telegram to the President from Minister Wilson in Geneva on March 8, listing Simon's three reasons for opposition: inspection would reveal the critical state of British armaments to the continental countries; if Britain agreed, they would inevitably abandon their "trump card" to the French, as the French had no intention of taking a step further in this direction to establish an arms limitation treaty; and detailed publication of arms orders would provide a basis for unfair competition, to the detriment of the British arms industry.

The next day, March 9, the President expressed his opinion in a short note to me, considering this "an extremely important telegram. I think you should keep it aside, it may be useful in the future." He continued: "This telegram illustrates two points: first, on the grounds of supposedly weak armaments, the U.K. is unwilling to accept the principle of international public inspection of armaments. Therefore, the one move we consider necessary—applying this principle to Germany—cannot be carried out. In other words, the only practical way to keep German armaments at a mutually agreed level is to inspect Germany's arms supply, but the U.K. itself refuses inspection, essentially shattering that hope. The last section of the telegram is an open admission that the U.K. refuses to accept detailed public arms orders because it would be detrimental to their arms industry."

He then concluded: "The time will come when we can reveal the truth, proving that the current British government has no sincerity in limiting or reducing the current world armaments or the current world arms trade."

"I am frustrated."

In Washington, the then British Ambassador, Sir Ronald Lindsay, was difficult to deal with. His contact with Americans was limited to a small number of high society figures, most of whom opposed the Roosevelt administration. It was extremely difficult for us to make him understand our point of view. I got along much better with his more capable and amiable successors, Lothian and Halifax.

One of the main difficulties in dealing with the U.K. and France was that they themselves were unable to deal with each other well.

The dispute between the U.K. and France originated at the Paris Peace Conference. France hoped to move its strategic border to the Rhine River. It abandoned this intention in exchange for the Anglo-American guarantee treaty, but this treaty never materialized. From that time on, France felt that the U.K. and the U.S. were relying on it to resist Germany while demanding that it reduce the army used to carry out this defense. The U.K. hoped for a stronger and more prosperous Germany. France hoped that Germany's strength would be inferior to its own. Given Germany's superior industrial strength and distrust of any German government (regardless of its composition), France could not agree to any method that would bring its and Germany's armaments closer to parity. On the other hand, the U.K. did not like France occupying a dominant position on the continent, and hoped to create a balance of power in Europe, allowing its own strength to become the decisive factor, playing a pivotal role. However, France, while firmly opposing the U.K.'s view of the continent, constantly sought to establish an unbreakable security pact with the U.K. to defend against Germany.

One of the questions that many people will constantly raise is, given that the strength of the U.K. and France was so superior at the time, and Germany's strength was in such a state of decline, why did they allow Germany to gain the upper hand and threaten their own survival? The reason is that neither the U.K. nor France wanted to take measures to prevent war. In the U.K., isolationist sentiments were almost as strong as in the U.S. When France invaded the Ruhr area in 1923, it had tried to take preventive measures. The result was fierce opposition from the U.K., which led to the downfall of Poincaré. Since then, no French government has been willing to engage in preventive warfare.

Here, we face a fundamental weakness of democratic countries, a weakness that governments with significant public say cannot avoid. They enjoy all of God's abundant blessings in many ways, but unfortunately, when faced with external dangers, whether imminent or already forming a serious threat, they have always acted slowly! Simply too slow. Pure democracy was the contribution of the Athenians to civilization, but when this small country faced a certain threat from abroad, it had to hold a public vote to decide whether Athens should go to war. This lack of leadership to oppose appropriate government officials, the lack of trust, resulted in them falling into the hands of lawless aggressors, whose purpose was none other than to capture and enslave the Athenians. This weakness led to the disintegration and eventual destruction of Athenian democracy.

If in the 1930s, we could have given due respect to the various conflicting opinions of individuals and groups in this country and other peace-loving countries, while simultaneously striving for peaceful countries to take unified action to implement appropriate armament, I am confident that they could have demanded a showdown with the rogue nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan, thereby avoiding the most recent world war.

While striving to improve direct relations with the U.K. and France to increase the chances of peace in Europe, we also constantly sought to enhance the prestige of the League of Nations, converging and coinciding. The President and I were both believers in Wilson and always cherished the League of Nations. Since 1920, the two of us had repeatedly tried to maintain the League and develop its full strength through persuasion and practical action, but without success.

Once, the President said to me that he had considered the possibility of appointing an American ambassador to reside at the League of Nations. But in this regard, there were many obstacles. No other non-member country had such a representative; our country's various tasks at the League were being fully carried out by our minister to Switzerland. In addition, domestic isolationists would seize the opportunity to attack the government relentlessly.

In Europe and Asia, the threats to peace were growing stronger, but the reaction they provoked in the U.S. was the opposite of what one would expect. Logically, this threat should have made a large part of the American public more willing to unite with foreign, ideologically upright countries to apply pressure to countries that were obviously preparing for war. But in fact, they made these Americans panic and shrink back, vowing not to be involved in the affairs of the rest of the world. The beliefs of most of them were sincere, but they blindly failed to see that any major war that occurred anywhere could not but affect us in many important ways.

I myself, and many other officials who worked with me, constantly pointed out to our countrymen and foreign governments that the danger of undermining peace was already great and was still spreading. Even today, many people still show surprised expressions, completely unaware or forgetful of the past, loudly asking those of us who were directly responsible for foreign affairs at the time: "What were you doing in the years after 1933? Why didn't you discover the dangers that were constantly growing abroad? Why didn't you inform the American public of these dangers and the need to prepare ourselves? If isolationist views greatly hindered the discovery and understanding of these dangers and threats by America, then why didn't you bring this extremely important issue to the attention of the public?"

Past records provide sufficient answers to these naive questions and clamors. When the danger of aggression became increasingly apparent, I gave more than twenty speeches and statements in the first two years of my tenure in the State Department alone, issuing strong warnings in every way that the English language could express about the growing danger.

I continued to issue such warnings in the years that followed. I had always been very careful when preparing these public speeches. I knew that they would be widely quoted domestically, and that foreign governments would generally read the full text. They not only represented my own views but also the policies and views of the U.S. government.

Sometimes, it would take several weeks to write a speech. I would call a group of important advisors to my office. I would say to them, "I am scheduled to give a speech in such and such city on such and such day, and this is what I have in mind." Then I would give them an outline of the ideas that had formed in my mind. I might have a few pages of notes in front of me, written in my apartment at some time the previous night. Next, I would ask them to offer opinions and suggestions. Finally, I would select one of my colleagues and ask him to draft a speech based on these ideas. The head of an important department simply does not have the time to draft original manuscripts every day, given the variety of important statements that must be made.

When the first draft of the speech was delivered, I would modify and rewrite it. Then I would distribute the draft to my advisors, asking them to write down their suggestions and additional ideas.

One important speech went through fifteen drafts before I gave it a final "O.K."

Before I gave an important speech on a certain government policy, I always sent the original manuscript to the President for his review, adhering to this principle. I often delivered it to him personally, partly because I did not want it to fall into the hands of others before he had read it, and partly because I wanted to be present while he was reading it so that I could provide explanations at any time and observe his reaction. The President would quietly read my speech, but he would often comment when he found something that particularly interested him. However, he rarely offered suggestions or criticisms, and even when he did, they were not of a fundamental nature.

In addition to these speeches, I continued to speak in the same tone privately with the ambassadors of major countries.

People certainly listened to me, but they did not pay attention. In the 1920s, I had always been a harbinger of doom in Congress, and I unexpectedly replayed that role in diplomacy in the 1930s.

### Indian Government to Issue Proclamation on Governance of the Dominion of India; Nehru Speech Resolves to Stop Violence

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The Indian government will soon issue a proclamation announcing its policy for governing the Dominion of India. The government previously enjoyed popular support, largely because its policies were in line with Gandhi's views. Now that Gandhi has been assassinated, it is necessary to issue a proclamation stating its policies.

Observers believe that the composition and policies of the Indian cabinet will not change temporarily due to Gandhi's death. During the period of national mourning for Gandhi's death, differences of opinion among political leaders are expected to be resolved on their own. Left-wing and right-wing elements will cooperate for Gandhi's death, and the Indian government's upcoming proclamation will help the rapprochement of various factions in India and the improvement of relations with Pakistan. [Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Indian Parliament today, firmly stating, "If the government does not dare to take effective measures to stop violence and hatred, then we are truly unworthy to be in the government. The tragedy of Gandhi's assassination is not the fault of one person; we are all collectively guilty. We must find ways to eliminate the atmosphere of violence and hatred that surrounds us, as this is the root of all evil forces." Representatives of all ethnic groups in Congress, whether Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, or Christian, unanimously condemned the violence against Gandhi and expressed their determination to unite to eliminate the rampant violence. When Congress convened, thousands of people marched outside the meeting hall, chanting slogans to eradicate militarized Hindu groups and overthrow Nehru's enemies. Nehru and many members of Congress participated in the ceremony of pouring Gandhi's ashes into the Ganges River before heading to the parliament.

### Gandhi's Ashes Poured into Ganges River; Thousands of People and Officials Attend Ceremony

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Gandhi's ashes were placed in a copper urn today and poured into the Ganges River. The ceremony was held in accordance with Hindu rites and lasted for over an hour. The area where the ceremony was held was surrounded by armored vehicles, forming a space 200 yards wide. Thousands of people, including several provincial leaders and hundreds of veterans, attended the ceremony. When the ashes were placed in the steel urn, hundreds of people chanted ancient Hindu scriptures. A yellow paper was pasted on the urn, with the words "My Lord" written on it. A small wreath of red and white flowers was wrapped around the top of the urn.

### Sharifuddin Resigns as Head of Indonesian-Dutch Peace Talks Delegation; Hatta Appoints Muslim Leader as Successor

[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] It was announced today that former Prime Minister Sharifuddin of the Indonesian Republic has resigned as head of the Republic's delegation to the peace talks with the United Nations Commission of Good Offices and the Dutch delegation. Prime Minister Hatta announced that he has appointed Muslim Party leader Roem to succeed as head of the peace talks delegation.

### German North Sea Fortress Destroyed; Requires Seventy-Two Hours

[Reuters, Hamburg, 2nd] German news reports state that the British Royal Air Force is scheduled to destroy the former German North Sea fortress Heligoland Island starting at 6:00 PM standard time on Tuesday. The bombing will last for seventy-two hours, and all ships are prohibited from entering within five kilometers of the island to prevent danger.

### World's Largest Telescope; Satisfactory Preliminary Tests

[United Press, Mount Palomar, California, 1st] The world's largest 200-inch telescope, completed after a year and a half of polishing, has undergone satisfactory preliminary tests, but several months of testing are still needed before it is officially put into use in June. The previous 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson could observe stars at a distance of 500 million light-years. The observation range of this new telescope can be doubled, and its application may result in entirely new theories about the universe.

### United Nations Economic and Social Council to Convene Sixth Session; Marshall Plan to Become a Major Topic of Discussion

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council is scheduled to hold its sixth session tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, the Marshall Plan, although not formally included on the agenda, will become a major topic of discussion. The Soviet bloc countries are expected to seize this opportunity to criticize it again, and Western countries are also prepared to respond. Most delegates believe that the result will not be any concrete action.

The election of officers after the opening tomorrow morning is likely to cause controversy. The U.S. supports Lebanese representative Malik to serve as chairman, while Polish representative Lange is backed by the Soviet Union. Lange arrived here yesterday and declared that he would still run for election, but it is reported that Malik has already obtained sufficient votes and will certainly be elected.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] There are 43 issues on the agenda of the Economic and Social Council that need to be discussed, some of which have extremely important implications for the economies of several regions of the world. The committee will seek to adjust the various agencies that distribute food and will decide whether to establish economic and social subcommittees in South America and the Middle East. In addition, the proposal submitted by Yugoslavia, requesting the return of frozen deposits in the U.S., will be discussed. Other issues that need to be discussed are the issue of "forced labor" in various countries' colonies and the issue of wage disparities between male and female workers. During the three-week meeting, the committee will address the issues of rescuing children in various countries, the status of newspapers, the publication of a declaration of human rights, and the holding of an anti-atrocity convention.

### Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory Strike Leads to Bloody Clashes; 77 Officials, Police, and Workers Dead or Injured

Political, Military, and Police Authorities Hold Joint Press Conference to Report the Incident

Any Similar Incidents in the Future Will Be Met with Lethal Force

[Our Report] Over six thousand workers at the Shin Hsin No. 9 Cotton Mill on Macau Road, Shanghai West, went on strike suddenly at 12:40 PM on the 30th, after the factory management failed to meet their nine demands. They refused to send representatives for negotiation and locked the factory doors from the inside and out. By 2:00 PM yesterday, the city's party and government leaders used loudspeakers to persuade the workers to resume work, but to no avail. When police officers attempted to enter to quell the unrest, a large number of workers suddenly threw machine parts and bricks from the high-rise buildings, leading to a major conflict. Subsequently, military and police forces used tear gas and firearms to attack inside for half an hour before gaining entry and suppressing the disturbance. An investigation later revealed that three female workers had died, and thirty-eight male and female workers were injured. Thirty-six officials and police officers were also injured. Over a hundred suspects involved in the incident were arrested on the spot. Except for seventy-five who are being investigated, all other workers had been released by 11:00 PM that night.

At 10:00 PM that evening, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, held a press conference at his residence to address both domestic and foreign reporters. He was accompanied by Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, who reported on the incident. Commander Xuan resolutely stated that if similar incidents were to occur in the future, he would order the military and police to use lethal force. Mayor Wu, attending the press conference last night, had not fully recovered and was still in pain from a waist injury. Therefore, his family placed two cushions behind his chair. During his speech, the mayor frequently held his waist, but his speech remained strong and forceful. Regarding the Shin Hsin incident, he believed that such actions were not those of ordinary workers, but rather a planned conspiracy by rioters. In the future, to protect the peaceful lives of the five million citizens, the government would use lethal force on the spot if similar incidents were to occur. Speaker Pan, representing the five million citizens of Shanghai, requested the government to immediately issue martial law to ensure the safety of life and property. Mayor Wu indicated his acceptance and said that he would, if necessary, jointly request the central government with Commander Xuan to declare Shanghai a martial law area.

The strike began at 12:40 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. The No. 9 factory had over six thousand workers, 90% of whom were female. Originally divided into day and night shifts, the day shift workers were supposed to leave the factory at 5:30 PM that day, but they all remained gathered without leaving. The night shift workers were supposed to start work at 8:30 PM, but around 7:00 PM, they began to clamor and demand to start work. To avoid trouble, the factory allowed them to enter. As a result, the day and night shift workers gathered in the factory. By 2:00 AM on the 31st, they sent out two hundred representatives to negotiate with the factory. Due to the large number of people and the lack of order in their speech, the factory asked the workers' representatives to select five people to be responsible for speaking. At that time, they put forward seven demands: 1. Each worker should be able to borrow two months' salary. 2. The wages deducted on November 12 should be reissued according to the index for that month (the deducted wages were for the construction of the General Labor Union). 3. The year-end bonus should be issued at 60% of last year's amount based on the December index, and 40% of this year's amount based on the January index. 4. There should be no restrictions on the duration of female workers' maternity leave, and their job numbers should not be changed. 5. The distribution of supplies should be reissued once, regardless of whether identity cards have an expiration date. 6. Two pecks of rice should be issued each month, and four pecks of rice should still be issued on behalf of the workers. 7. In the future, the factory's management of workers should be agreed upon by both labor and management. The factory stated that, apart from the distribution of coal briquettes, which was already being handled, the rest of the demands were unacceptable. The negotiations ended without result. All the workers remained in the factory, which by yesterday had lasted for three days. During this period, although the Social Affairs Bureau sent Mediation Section members Zhu Guilin and Gu Lijun, and Workers' Welfare Committee member He Jian to mediate, the workers' attitude was very firm. In addition to the seven demands, they added two more: 1. One day off per week with full pay. 2. Workers dismissed after January of last year should be reinstated. Zhu and others' mediation yielded no results and were even regarded as "running dogs" of the capitalists, and the situation gradually deteriorated. On the 31st, Huang Chaobin, Deputy Director of the Putuo Police Sub-Bureau, entered the factory with two plainclothes police officers to mediate, but they were detained by the workers for a day.

Seditious Slogans Discovered

At the same time, seditious slogans were found on the walls of factories near the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, such as "Welcome university students to help," "All cotton mills act in unison," "Factories in the Shanghai East District have also gone on strike," etc. A portion of the workers also shouted and threw stones at the entrance of the Tongyi Cotton Mill next to the No. 9 factory, inciting them to join the strike. By 6:00 AM yesterday, the authorities believed that the workers' group was too complex, and sent a large number of police officers from the Putuo Road Police Sub-Bureau and motorcycle squads to the factory to be on guard. Upon seeing the arrival of the police, the workers had already retreated behind the third iron gate and locked it. After the police arrived, they persuaded the workers to send representatives to negotiate, but the workers ignored them, resulting in a stalemate. By noon, the Garrison Headquarters also sent the Garrison Brigade to assist. Police Commissioner Yu Shuping and Chief of the Investigation Section of the Garrison Headquarters Tao Yishan personally rushed to the scene, and, along with Social Affairs Bureau representative Gu Lijun, General Labor Union representative Zhang Zhusan, and Workers' Welfare Association representatives Lu Yinchu and Fan Caiqiu, used loudspeakers to broadcast to the workers, persuading them to send representatives to discuss a reasonable solution. However, the workers still showed no indication and had prepared a large amount of bricks, wooden sticks, iron tools, and corrosive liquids on the roof to prevent the police from entering. The stalemate continued until 4:30 PM, when the workers split into two factions. One faction expressed willingness to send representatives out for negotiation. The police immediately tried to pry open the door lock to allow the representatives to go out. Unexpectedly, another faction of workers in the factory rioted and shouted in opposition.

Attacking the Military and Police from Above

At this time, a large amount of bricks, iron rods, and corrosive liquids were thrown down from the factory and canteen rooftops. For a moment, debris flew everywhere, and the order was in chaos. Yan Zi, the Second Company Commander of the Garrison Brigade, and four police officers from the Putuo Sub-Bureau were dragged into the workshop by the workers, who seized their guns, punched, and kicked them, causing them serious injuries. They were later rescued by other police officers who risked their lives to rush in. At this time, about forty workers who did not want to be coerced took the opportunity to escape. Eighteen worker representatives who led the incident were captured and dragged out by the police. Amidst the chaos, the workers on the factory roof continued to throw iron bars, wooden blocks, corrosive liquids, and machine parts down, and sprayed with tap water. The police officers retreated slightly and immediately telegraphed headquarters to send additional security police, armored vehicle teams, flying fortresses, and criminal police to assist.

### Suppressing the Riot, Order to Open Fire; A Large-Scale Attack Under Searchlights

At 5:45 PM, Commander Xuan, Liu Chang, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Chief of the Investigation Section Tao Yishan, accompanied by Commander Xuan, walked to the garrison vehicle parked at the second iron gate and reported the details of the workers occupying the roof, pouring corrosive liquids, and throwing bricks and ironware. At that time, motorcycle squad police officers attempted to use the cover of small armored vehicles. The workers on the roof saw the police action and immediately resisted. Bricks, wooden sticks, circular iron barrels, and long benches flew down. At the same time, they secretly sprayed water. The police officers were unable to advance and had to retreat to their original positions. Commander Xuan was furious at the sight and said to Commissioner Yu, "In this situation, the only option is to open fire. Anyone who resists will be killed without exception. I will take full responsibility." He instructed: first, use tear gas to force the workers to retreat, then rush in to occupy the roof and find a way to surround them.

Commissioner Yu, upon receiving the order, immediately gathered the security police brigade and the motorcycle squad to prepare for the attack. All officers and police held batons in their right hands and guns in their left. Commissioner Yu instructed that they should not open fire unless their lives were in danger. After the preparations were completed, an elderly police officer fired more than a dozen tear gas shells at the roof. In an instant, smoke filled the air, and shadows flickered. Gunshots rang out loudly, and the police officers shouted and charged forward, using the searchlights on the garrison vehicles to attack the platform room directly facing the gate. Commissioner Yu ordered the bugler next to him to blow the charge, and a part of the police officers climbed the roof from the ladders built by the carpenters outside the restaurant that was under construction, stopping the workers from throwing bricks. At that time, gunshots, bugle calls, and shouts intertwined into one.

Arson Attempt Failed

The workers in the factory saw the police entering with overwhelming force and knew that they could not resist. They fled backward in succession. A few thugs attempted to set the factory on fire. Fortunately, fire engines arrived in time and cooperated with the attack, foiling their sinister plan. By 6:30 PM, the initial attack had come to an end, and the roof of the restaurant and platform room was under police control. Commander Xuan saw that the police had rushed in and left in a hurry. Before leaving, he instructed the person in charge, "Rush in and try to concentrate the workers, then surround them, search them, and find a way to deal with them." At 6:37 PM, the charge was sounded again, and gunshots were dense. Commissioner Yu personally commanded and launched another attack. Subsequently, reinforcements from the security police arrived, and the police had an absolute advantage. The garrison vehicles approached step by step with the vanguard. There were no workers in sight where the bright lights shone. However, shouts still came from the factory in the back. It was reported from time to time that the entire factory was under police control, at 6:54 PM.

Commissioner's Speech

Most of the workers were kind-hearted but were being used by a small number of people. After this battle, they were all panicked. The elderly female workers were trembling and unable to walk. Some knelt on the ground and begged, while others covered their faces and shouted grievances, all claiming that they were forced to participate in the strike and knew nothing about the conditions put forward to the capitalists. In order to search for the seized guns, the police ordered male and female workers to raise their hands and form single lines, file out, be inspected one by one, and be escorted to the large lawn in front of the factory. Commissioner Yu gave a speech. Many of those who threw bricks at the police, robbed guns, destroyed machines, and attempted arson were identified and immediately arrested. Commissioner Yu's speech roughly said: "The guns we fired today were aimed at the sky, so no one was killed. You have more than three million yuan in salaries and allowances each month, which is half as much as my commissioner's salary. Yet, you still cause trouble and create a catastrophe. Your violent resistance to the government and beating of the police are completely the actions of rioters. But today I will only deal with the ringleaders, and you can all go home (the workers cheered and thanked the commissioner). I hope that in the future, you will consider the difficulties of the capitalists, maintain the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, and not be used by others again, and work hard." After Commissioner Yu finished speaking, he began to check them one by one, until everyone was released by 11:00 PM. At the same time, the police went to various workshops and platforms to search for male and female workers who were trying to hide, but the five seized handguns were never found.

Commander Xuan arrived at the factory again around 8:00 PM, personally inspected the premises, and instructed factory manager He to investigate the extent of the losses.

Examination of the Three Female Corpses

After 11:00 PM, prosecutors Chen Shoutao and Ding Tongjun from the District Procuratorate, accompanied by forensic doctor Gong Ziwei, went to Shin Hsin to investigate and examine the three female corpses. One of the deceased, Wang Huamei, was a female worker in the small packaging room of the Shin Hsin No. 9 factory. She suffocated to death from being squeezed by the crowd during the chaos. Another, Zhu Yunxian, fell to her death after losing her footing while running at a height. The other died from a gunshot wound, but her name could not be found until late at night.

### Cotton Mill Stock Prices Decline Under the Influence

[Our Report] Yesterday's stock market saw a decline in cotton mill stock prices due to the brewing and uncertain labor unrest at Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, and its tendency to worsen. Generally, those holding cotton mill stocks felt the crisis of the cotton mill's future and sold off their shares, resulting in an overflow of cotton mill stock chips. In the morning, Yongxin briefly saw a low price of 660 yuan. Before the close in the afternoon, it showed a slight recovery due to the loosening of credit.

### Mayor Wu Holds Press Conference for Chinese and Foreign Reporters at His Residence; Top Officials Attend to Report the Incident; Speaker Pan Requests Declaration of Martial Law

Following the Shin Hsin incident, at 10:00 PM that evening, Mayor Wu, despite being ill, convened reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at his residence to make a statement. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping, and Commander Xuan Tiewu reported on the incident. City Councilor Speaker Pan also expressed his opinions. Attendees at the press conference included newspaper publishers, editors-in-chief, Committee Member Fang, Tao Yishan, Lu Jingshi, the manager of Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory, and directors from relevant bureaus and departments, totaling approximately sixty people. The discussions lasted until 11:30 PM. After the meeting, the Mayor continued to hold a meeting with Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, and others to discuss future security issues.

### Social Affairs Bureau Staff Were Detained; Confirmed to Be Communist Agitation

At the beginning of the press conference, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian reported on the causes and developments of the labor unrest. The labor unrest at the factory began on the 30th, with workers suddenly organizing a patrol team to force all workers in the factory to stop working and cut off internal and external transportation. However, no conditions were put forward to the capitalists beforehand. Afterwards, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff member Zhu Guilin to mediate, but he was detained by the workers and confined inside the factory for twenty-four hours. The factory manager was also confined for three days. Workers inside the factory could not leave without the permission of the patrol team. The seven demands put forward by the workers afterwards had many conflicts with laws and regulations. The factory could not accept them, and the government could not recognize them. In November of last year, the government obtained intelligence that the Communist Party had orders to launch a struggle for the year-end bonus in Shanghai, using the issue of the year-end bonus as a tool. Knowing this intention, the government quickly resolved the year-end bonus issues in various factories. To date, more than 90% have been resolved. The Communist Party, knowing that the New Year's bonus struggle at the end of the Gregorian calendar had failed, launched a struggle for wage advances at the end of the Lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year wage advance movement at Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory was confirmed to be Communist agitation. When the situation became serious, realizing that it was not an ordinary labor-capital dispute, the Mayor Wu was reported, and it was necessary to ask the police to assist in the resolution.

### Pre-Planned Steps, Eventually Resorting to Force

Subsequently, Police Commissioner Yu Shuping reported on the riot, stating that nine-tenths of the factory's seven thousand workers were female workers, and the remaining one-tenth were male workers. Most of the workers were unwilling to participate. Many female workers were crying in the factory. Before handling the incident, the military and police discussed and decided on three steps: First, representatives from various agencies broadcasted persuasions. Second, representatives from various agencies entered the last door to persuade them. If the above two steps did not work, then they would try to use force to occupy the last gate. After occupying the last gate, they would broadcast again to persuade the workers who were willing to leave to be allowed to leave the factory. After the steps were decided, they were implemented step by step. After persuasion failed and a stalemate lasted for one or two hours, the workers first requested the military and police to withdraw to the gate before sending two representatives to the last gate and agreeing to cut open the door chain. When the worker representatives walked out after cutting open the door chain, the workers ambushing on the roof, perhaps misunderstanding that the military and police were arresting the representatives, threw down wooden sticks, bricks, glass shards, corrosive liquids, iron cones, oil drums, and other things that had been prepared, and the conflict began. Because the workers occupied high positions and threw down corrosive liquids and other objects, the troops could not advance. Later, Commander Xuan arrived and felt that it was no longer possible to reason, so he decided to send troops to occupy the high rooftops and planned to use minimal weapons to control the crowd. And because the rioters occupied the roof, in order to disperse them, the police were ordered to fire into the sky to intimidate them, and tear gas was used to suppress the workers clamoring on the ground, with armored vehicles rushing in at the front to break through. Only then was it suppressed. During the conflict, more than 30 police officers were injured, and three were seriously injured. Three workers died, two of whom died of suffocation after being trapped inside for three or four days without food, and one had blood on his head and was being examined by a forensic doctor. More than 30 other workers were injured, and five were seriously injured.

Commander Expresses Determination to Eliminate Evil

Commander Xuan followed Commissioner Yu and also reported on the handling of the matter yesterday. Finally, he firmly announced, "If similar incidents occur again in the future, they will be dealt with in the most severe manner. When necessary, military and police will be ordered to open fire to stop them, killing without exception." Xuan said that the military and police repeatedly tried to find a solution through peaceful means yesterday, but were ultimately rejected by the workers, which was utterly unreasonable. He also said: Unfortunate incidents have occurred repeatedly in Shanghai in the past five days, which is a cause for concern about social order. Each time an incident occurs, the authorities have tried to deal with it through peaceful means, but there are too many troublemakers, and riots are unavoidable. Therefore, if today's matter is not resolved, it may spread to other factories, and Shanghai will become an unmanageable situation. I bear the primary responsibility for maintaining security and will not allow a small number of thugs to undermine the safety of five million citizens.

People Have the Right to Demand Government Protection

Speaker Pan said: Standing in the position of a participant in the meeting, I believe that the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau handled the Shin Hsin incident appropriately. In particular, the guidelines announced by Commander Xuan for the future are also necessary. The other day, Mayor Wu was beaten and humiliated by students from Tongji University, but he still showed great restraint and ordered no one to open fire. The Mayor should have done this out of love for the students. But I was worried at the time that an ordinary citizen violated the law and humiliated the mayor. If this situation is not strictly stopped, it is extremely dangerous. Sure enough, the next day there was an incident of the Social Affairs Bureau being vandalized. I was present at the time and did not see any representatives sent to negotiate. And today's matter shows even more the riotous behavior of thugs. If this continues, how can the citizens of Shanghai live and work in peace? Therefore, in the future, strict measures must be used to stop them. I absolutely agree with the warning announced by Commander Xuan.

The Speaker further stated that if the government does not make a decision to maintain local stability, then not only Shanghai but other places will also experience unrest. Shanghai is an international city, an economic center, and China's first port. The Communists are using various methods to destroy it. Why doesn't the government declare martial law here? We have the right to demand government protection. In this situation, if opening fire is still not allowed, then what is the use of the military and police? This is a mistake, and this mistake cannot continue to exist. We want to ask the Mayor and Commander Xuan to request instructions from the central government to declare Shanghai a city under martial law.

### Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe to Leave Shanghai; All Circles Hold Farewell Reception

Shen Zonglian presented medals on behalf of Mayor Wu. The recipients included workers like Yimin and Kang Ba'erhan. Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, and others also presented commemorative medals to all members of the troupe.

### The Three Major Events Are Interrelated; Clearly a Planned Conspiracy

Hope That Citizens Will Not Be Used by the Communist Party

Finally, Mayor Wu, despite his illness, stood up to address the audience, believing that the government had two tasks: one was to care for good citizens and enable them to live and work in peace, and the other was to eliminate violent elements and prevent them from harming the people. In short, it was to eliminate evil and ensure the safety of the people. Recently, three incidents have occurred in Shanghai within five days: on the 29th of last month, I was beaten and humiliated during the student unrest, on the 31st, the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized, and today, there was labor unrest. These three events may seem unrelated on the surface, but they are actually interconnected. Recently, the Communist Party organized a "National Riot Movement Committee," with Zhou Enlai as chairman. There is a command structure in the Yangtze River basin, and Shanghai is of course its central target. During the Tongji student unrest, I can guarantee that most of the students were used, and a few were instructed by the Communist Party to deliberately force the government to open fire. When this goal was not achieved, there were continued incidents of vandalizing the Social Affairs Bureau and causing labor unrest. I myself can be beaten, but I do not want to open fire for no reason and harm innocent citizens. Even with the Social Affairs Bureau being vandalized, Commander Xuan and I still advocated avoiding bloodshed as much as possible. After being beaten and humiliated during the Tongji student unrest, I received many letters from citizens advocating that when similar incidents occur again, they should be suppressed by opening fire. Today, during the Shin Hsin labor unrest, workers wielded corrosive liquids and dismantled machinery, using them as weapons along with stones and iron buckets. Such actions cannot be regarded as ordinary workers and are clearly a planned conspiracy by thugs. Only force can be used against thugs. The government has reached the end of its tolerance, so I fully agree with Commander Xuan's opinion, warning the good citizens of Shanghai not to be used by the Communist Party. In the future, if similar events occur again, lethal force will be used on the spot. In order to protect the peaceful lives of the five million citizens, the government has to use force. Having given a warning in advance, the government will not be responsible if the military and police open fire during future riots. I hope that the citizens understand the government's suffering in enduring this and agree with this opinion. I fully accept Speaker Pan's opinion representing the views of five million citizens. If necessary, I will definitely join Commander Xuan in requesting the central government to declare temporary martial law in Shanghai.

### Roaming Zhoushan Area, Gang of Thieves Arrested in Shanghai, Bandit Leader Knows Water Well, Boasts That He Had Three Near-Death Experiences

[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Zongpin, the notorious bandit and pirate leader who has been rampant in the Zhoushan, Zhenhai, Fenghua, and Quanshan areas for years, and his accomplices Shi Xiangsheng, Zhang Yueqing, and Zhang Lizhong, etc., have been apprehended by the Yulin Police and Investigation Bureau. This group of thieves came to Shanghai intending to organize a naval detachment, but they fell into the police net, eliminating a major scourge for the coastal people.

Bandit Liu is from Gaoting, Haidai Mountain, and is twenty-six years old this year. He is short in stature, accurate with a gun, and very knowledgeable about water. He usually recruits soldiers and buys horses, and organizes self-defense forces without authorization, accumulating wealth in the Zhejiang sea, threatening fishermen and merchants. Among them, the robbery of the Huaan ship on April 9, 1936, caused the greatest damage. In addition, he committed numerous crimes such as kidnapping for ransom, murder, and theft. According to Liu, after being arrested, he confessed: "I have escaped death three times. This time, dying in Shanghai is a peaceful death. The first time was in 1935 when I was arrested in the Zhoushan Islands. The county government sent four people to escort me to the beach for execution. As soon as we reached the beach, I jumped into the water and swam away. The second time was in 1936 when I was arrested in Dinghai. The county government used a speedboat to take me to the sea for execution. At that time, my feet were cut with a knife, making it impossible to walk, but I still seized the opportunity to jump into the sea, hid under the boat for half an hour, and then escaped. The third time was in a massacre, but I was lucky to escape because I happened to be in Ningbo."

Twenty-Eight Dance Halls Resume Business Last Night

### Six Hundred and Eighty-One Arrested Dancers and Staff Released on Bail

[Report from Our Newspaper] Of the 797 dance hall staff and dancers arrested during the Social Affairs Bureau crackdown, 681 were released on bail by the various sub-bureaus before 12:00 noon yesterday after initial interrogation. All twenty-eight dance halls in the city resumed business starting last night. The dancers, staff, musicians, and others said that they had no savings and lived from day to day, so they had to resume work immediately. However, they still hoped that the authorities would consider the circumstances and provide a reasonable solution to the issues of the dance ban and the investigation of responsibilities for the incident. The 116 people arrested with more serious involvement have been transferred to the General Bureau (107 of whom were identified the night before, with another nine identified later, including 31 dancers and 85 staff). A detailed interrogation will be conducted today, using individual questioning and confrontation to investigate the truth of the matter and the degree of each person's participation in the action, in order to determine their responsibility. However, those deemed to have no major involvement will be released on bail in succession. The complete list of the 116 people may be released by the police bureau today.

Red-Clad, Scarred-Faced Woman Has Fled Without a Trace

The scarred-faced woman in red who assaulted Director Wu during the incident has eluded capture. After two days of intensive investigation by the police bureau, Tan Peiwu (also known as Ellis) from the Liderer Dance Hall was found to have a strong resemblance and was suspected of involvement. However, after identification, it was determined that she was not the person. It is now known that the assailant has fled, and the police bureau is determined to arrest her and bring her to justice. In addition, Mayor Wu has ordered generous compensation for the police officers injured in the incident, with a reward of one million yuan for those with minor injuries and two million yuan for those with serious injuries.

Attempted Arson Foiled, Burnt Abacus Discovered

It is reported that after the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized by the dancers and staff, the losses were significant. Various departments continued to register damaged items yesterday. Director Wu first requested the city government to allocate 5 billion yuan for repairs and replacements, which was approved by Mayor Wu, with 2 billion yuan allocated first and the remainder to be allocated successively. After the damaged rooms were cleaned up, the broken doors and windows were temporarily covered with wooden boards and newspapers, but cold wind constantly blew in. The office desks, chairs, and utensils in the rooms were all incomplete and pieced together. The staff continued to work as usual in difficult conditions. The door to the Deputy Director's office was broken through, and one could simply step straight in without opening the door. One leg of the Deputy Director's desk was missing and temporarily propped up with a wooden strip. The white porcelain urinal and flush toilet in the Labor-Management Arbitration Council office were also smashed with wooden sticks. None of the windows in the room had glass. In addition to temporarily covering them with newspapers, bamboo curtains used in the summer were also hung to block the cold wind. A large charred area was found on the floor of the Arbitration Council office. Secretary Gu Zusheng also found a burnt abacus in the room. It is said that during the chaos on the 31st, the vandals placed sofas, paper, and other items on charcoal basins in an attempt to set a fire, but it was extinguished by firefighters, averting a major disaster.

Detailed Recording of Damage to Each Floor

The Food Section of the Economic Administration Department, which suffered the heaviest losses, had staff yesterday still searching through piles of paper for various receipts and account books, sorting and organizing them. The staff of the Industrial and Commercial Registration Section were busy sorting through the scattered and messy registration cards. As a result, the section has temporarily suspended registration work from yesterday, but the work of accepting application forms and issuing completed licenses will continue as usual. It is estimated that the work of sorting out the registration cards will take three days.

The Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, expressing gratitude to Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang and Prosecutor Quan Tao for personally inspecting the scene after the bureau was vandalized. It also requested that the instigators be severely punished according to the law, and that evidence would be submitted after it was collected. Prosecutor Quan said that a detailed record of the damage to each floor had been made during the inspection, and that the cause of the incident would be carefully investigated. Relevant personnel will be summoned for questioning at that time.

Condolences from All Sectors

The central government attached great importance to the Social Affairs Bureau incident.

### Huazhong Transportation Terminal, Hub of Jianghu Connections, Prospects for Chenglingji Port

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Changsha, 1st] Chenglingji is a port eight kilometers northeast of Yueyang, on the east bank of Dongting Lake. The Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng rivers of Hunan province all flow into Dongting Lake, and Chenglingji is the gateway for Hunan's goods. It is also where the Yangtze River merges, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including Sichuan, western Hubei, and northern Guizhou, are the port's hinterland. It is a hub of transportation in the Jianghu region, with an upstream drainage area of 670,000 square kilometers and abundant products such as rice, tea, tung oil, medicinal materials, and minerals. Therefore, Chenglingji is Hunan's ideal inland river port. Now that the Yuehan Railway is open, if a six-kilometer railway can be built from Chenglingji to connect with the Yuehan Railway, the products of that vast hinterland can be transported directly to Guangzhou through the port and exported overseas, saving time and money. In the past, the wharf at Chenglingji was at Guihuahui, which was very small, and due to years of siltation, many goods had to be transported through Wuhan to Shanghai, a waterway of more than 1,500 kilometers. There is also the trouble of reloading in Wuhan, and Shanghai's port also feels congested. Therefore, the construction of Chenglingji Port is of great importance to the economic development of the hinterland.

Planning to Develop a Port

The Hunan Provincial Government, recognizing the importance of Chenglingji, is now planning to develop it into a port, and has hired Li Rongmeng as an engineer to draft a construction plan. The planned project will be carried out in two phases: the first phase will be to build a revetment wharf and two machine bridges between Liugong Temple and Shuhuatang at the northern end of Chenglingji, and to utilize the funds first. The second phase will be to build three dry docks between Guihuayuan and Qilishan at the southern end of Chenglingji, all with compound boat locks. A six-kilometer railway will be laid from the riverbank to connect with the Chenglingji Station of the Yuehan Railway, and an eight-kilometer highway will be built to connect with Yueyang County. Loading and unloading equipment will be installed between the deep-water line of the Yangtze River and Chenglingji, and freight yards and warehouses will be built for use. Nearby, industrial, commercial, and residential areas will be developed, so that processing and manufacturing, and trade operations can be developed accordingly. Schools, hospitals, residences, roads, and other municipal constructions can also be planned at will.

According to the above plan, the cost of materials and labor is estimated to be 1,155,000 yuan according to pre-war currency values. The Hunan Provincial Government plans to start construction immediately. The funding methods, in addition to the railway and highway being handled separately by the Yuehan Railway Bureau and the Provincial Highway Bureau, the warehouses, lighters, and cranes will be contracted by merchants, and other projects will be built by borrowing money. It is estimated that after the completion of the project, there will be a throughput of 2 million tons. At a pre-war currency value of 50 yuan per ton, the total value of goods imported and exported annually is about 100 million yuan. One percent of various port fees will be drawn, which is 1 million yuan. After deducting management fees, the investment capital can be used to repay all the funds within two years.

After the completion of Chenglingji Port, goods from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the areas through which the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng rivers flow can be transferred to the Yuehan Railway for export from Chenglingji. The waterway from Chenglingji to Shanghai is 1,500 kilometers, while the land route to Guangzhou is only 800 kilometers. After the construction of the port, the transportation distance can be reduced by 47%, and the time can be reduced from seven days to five days. Transportation costs: currently, the cost from Chenglingji via Hankou to Shanghai is 1.22 million yuan per ton, while the cost from Yueyang to Guangzhou is only 570,000 yuan per ton. Therefore, after the completion of Chenglingji Port, transportation costs can be reduced by 53%.

The Yuehan Railway was originally a north-south artery south of the Yangtze River, and the Guangdong Provincial Government is also actively developing Huangpu Port. In the future, the development of Huangpu Port must rely on the economic development along the Yuehan Railway in order to have a large amount of cargo to transport and throughput. In terms of the Yuehan Railway line, Changsha Chongyang and other places are not suitable for building ports. However, in recent years, the siltation of the Xiang River and Dongting Lake has prevented them from connecting with the main channel of the Yangtze River. Only Chenglingji is located at the confluence of the rivers and lakes, is closest to the Yuehan Railway, and has the convenience of connecting water and land transportation.

When Hubei and Hunan are rich, the whole country is sufficient. Hunan province is indeed a region rich in products. It is a pity to abandon goods on the ground due to transportation issues. Once Chenglingji Port is completed, the Yangtze River and the Yuehan Railway, two waterways and land transportation routes, can be connected. During the flood season, 1,000-ton steamships can reach Yichang directly, and 500-ton ships can go up to Chongqing. If going downstream, 10,000-ton ships can reach Beijing and Shanghai. The Yuan and Zi rivers will be dredged, so that 200-ton to 500-ton ships can travel smoothly, so that they can reach northern Guangxi in the south and western Guizhou in the west. Soon we will see ships gathering and various goods gathering, all waiting for Chenglingji Port to transport them. Currently, the Chenglingji Port construction project is still in preparation, revealing a grand and beautiful prospect. When this imagination becomes a reality, not only will Yueyang County benefit, and Hunan Province will benefit, but the people of western Hubei, northern Guangxi, northern Guizhou, Sichuan, and even eastern Xikang will also benefit a lot. At the same time, the economic situation in Central China will have a new look. (Luo Sen)

### Railway Bandit Surrenders to Justice

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, January 31] Theft cases on the Jinghu train have occurred repeatedly, and robberies are often heard. Although the Railway Bureau has taken strict precautions, theft cases cannot be eliminated. Wang Decai, from Xuzhou, is 26 years old, with a burly figure, extraordinary strength, and good at swimming. He has been rampant on the railway for many years, committing numerous crimes. During the enemy and puppet period, he was captured by the enemy military police, but he used his party ties to overthrow the enemy military police and fled without a trace. After the victory, he worked for the Nanjing Transportation Company, while still engaging in theft on the railway. The Railway Bureau's Jingwu Office issued a wanted order, but failed to capture him. The Nanjing Jiangbian Station discovered the Nanjing Transport Company the day before yesterday. The Transportation Company had a dispute with the loading and unloading workers over handling fees, resulting in a big fight. The old man of the Transportation Company was incredibly strong, and many of the workers were no match for him. Many passers-by stopped to watch. The Jiangao Station police received the news and sent several policemen to bring both sides to the station for questioning. It turned out that the incredibly strong old man of the Transportation Company was Wang Decai, the notorious thief on the Jinghu line who had committed numerous crimes. He revealed his true name in his confession due to being carried away by his momentary success. The police station was very excited to learn that he was the railway bandit who had been wanted for a long time, and immediately escorted him to the Railway Police Office. Huang Yangsun, the squad leader of the Railway Criminal Police Team, personally interrogated him and showed him the wanted order. Wang Decai then realized that he had revealed his true identity and remained silent. Sun Shaotang, Wang Baoneng, and Peng Lin, who were arrested at the same time, will be prosecuted severely.

### Allowances for Public Educators in Bian City – Telegraph Request to Central Government for Upgrade to First Tier

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kaifeng, 26th] The Executive Yuan recently stipulated that Kaifeng should be classified as the third tier and Henan Province as the fourth tier in the zoning system for adjusting the allowances of public educators. Upon hearing this, all agencies were greatly alarmed, believing that this matter of personal concern was more serious than the Kowloon demolition incident. They gathered to discuss the matter, with the teachers and staff of various middle schools taking the lead. They had previously requested the central government to upgrade Kaifeng to the first tier, as detailed in previous reports. It has now been learned that the following are also responding: The Liaison Association of Central Agencies stationed in Bian City held its inaugural meeting at the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau. Leaders from various agencies, including Guo Zhongwei, Chen Panling, Yan Huatang, Zhou Yuzi, and Sun Mingcheng, along with over 800 employee representatives from 28 units, attended. They resolved that the soaring prices in Bian City were no less than those in Beijing and Shanghai. The decision to classify the city in the third and fourth tiers for allowance adjustments caused widespread unrest. Under the leadership of Guo Zhongwei, the Henan Supervisory Commissioner, they jointly appealed to the central government to raise the tier. The original telegram is as follows: "To President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, the news of the adjustment of allowances for public servants brings momentary relief amidst hunger and thirst. The province of Yu is rife with Red peril, with hardly any pure land left. Kaifeng faces threats from all sides, which have not yet been eliminated. Traffic is cut off, and prices are soaring. The current cost of living exceeds that of Nanjing, and prices continue to rise. The facts are undeniable and can be easily verified. However, employees of central agencies stationed in Bian City receive no in-kind benefits like those in Beijing and Shanghai, nor do they receive subsidized public grain like those in provincial-level agencies. The public is uneasy and apprehensive; how can we provide reassurance? We earnestly request that you consider our hardships and adjust the allowances according to the first-tier index to maintain our livelihood and facilitate our work. Representing the heads of central agencies stationed in Bian City, Guo Zhongwei, Chen Panling, Yi Tianjue, Zhou Yuzi, Yao Congwu, Wang Peisan, Li Yongji, and Sun Minghe respectfully." The Henan Provincial Government believes that classifying the province as the third tier in the adjustment of public educators' allowances does not match the actual cost of living. Furthermore, the province has recently experienced serious banditry and traffic congestion, with the prices of daily necessities such as cloth and sundry goods exceeding those of Beijing and Shanghai. It has telegraphed the central government to consider the hardships of public servants in the province and revise the classification to the first tier. It has also telegraphed Meng Zhaozan, the Director of the Provincial Department of Finance stationed in Nanjing, to personally present the situation to the Executive Yuan. The Kaifeng City Education Association believes that classifying the cost of living for public educators in Henan as the third and fourth tiers is inconsistent with the actual situation. It has telegraphed the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Executive Yuan's Accounting Office, requesting a revision to the first tier. The original telegram is as follows: "Upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the adjustment of allowances for public educators in Bian and Yu has been classified as the third and fourth tiers, which is truly unsettling. Since late December of last year and January of this year, prices in Yu have been rising rapidly and drastically. The daily necessities of life are extremely expensive. Public educators are largely impoverished, facing the hardships of supporting their families and experiencing the bitterness of hunger and cold. Their inability to obtain a full meal all day long and their difficulty in adding even half a thread of clothing throughout the year cannot be adequately described in words. If the adjustment is made according to the third and fourth tiers, public educators in Bian and Yu will face a situation where everyone feels insecure and unable to sustain themselves. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and war is raging, we earnestly request that you alleviate our plight and help us overcome these difficulties together. We request that you allow the adjustment of Bian and Yu to be classified as the first tier, so that public educators can continue to persevere. We are anxiously awaiting your orders."

### The Gou People of Southern Zhejiang Lead a Migratory Life

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nengquan, 1st] Shiitake mushrooms are a top-grade vegetarian delicacy, with a flavor that surpasses even chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Therefore, the sales of shiitake mushrooms extend both domestically and internationally. It is said that at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American soldiers in Shanghai tasted shiitake mushrooms and instantly felt their flavor cleanse their hearts and minds, washing away the greasiness from their mouths. They considered it an unparalleled delicacy in the world. They rushed to buy them in the market and brought them back to the United States to give as gifts to relatives and friends, causing the price of mushrooms to soar at that time, and mushroom farmers profited several times over. Mushrooms grow wild

on decaying grass and tree bark. To obtain mushrooms, one must use an axe to cut and split the tree bark to promote growth, which is different from the method of cultivating ubiquitous wild mushrooms. The quality of the same shiitake mushroom varies greatly, and the prices also differ. Flower mushrooms are the highest quality of mushrooms, with white patterns on the cap, caused by the mushroom cap cracking due to sudden sunshine after snowfall. The next best is thick mushrooms, which are thick in texture and small in size, caused by prolonged sunny weather during severe cold, making it difficult for the mushroom cap to expand. If there are consecutive days of cloudy and rainy weather, the mushroom cap expands and becomes thin in texture, which is called thin mushrooms, the lowest grade of shiitake mushrooms. The quality of mushrooms depends entirely on the weather, so mushroom farmers regard obtaining flower mushrooms as a blessing from heaven, which cannot be achieved through human effort.

To grow mushrooms, one must first select trees. There are more than two hundred kinds of trees that can be used to grow mushrooms, such as chinquapin, Chinese torreya, chestnut, holly, olive, and juniper. These trees are all produced in deep mountains and remote valleys, with the most in Fujian Province, and also produced in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces. Although mushroom trees are produced in Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the people who grow mushrooms are the specialty of the people of southern Zhejiang. Because the method of making mushroom trees has always been strictly guarded as a secret by mushroom farmers, outsiders have no way of knowing it, making it the exclusive patent of mushroom farmers in southern Zhejiang.

Longquan, Jingning, and Qingyuan counties in southern Zhejiang are the main bases of mushroom farmers, with a total of

150,000 people. From October to March of the lunar calendar is the mushroom growing season. Whenever the yellow leaves fall, there is often a group of people in tattered clothes and haggard appearance, men, women, old and young, carrying bags and baskets, walking along the Longqing highway. These are the mushroom farmers who are setting off for the mushroom mountains. They go to the mountains in winter and return in spring every year, as they are accustomed to it, operating in the cold mountains and ridges, and their lives are extremely bitter. In their minds, they only look forward to a pile of flower mushrooms revealed in the snow, which can make them rich.

After the mushroom farmers reach the mountain area, they build thatched huts to live in and begin to work. The selected trees are cut down, with the branches pointing downwards and the roots pointing upwards, removing the twigs and branches, and using an axe to make scars on the trees, each called "making rafters." Then, the branches and leaves are placed on the trees to cover them, called "covering clothes," and then they are left to be exposed to the sun and rain, wind and snow. By the second winter, they see if any small mushrooms have grown. Usually, it takes until the third year.

Those who have mastered the method of making rafters may even bloom in two years. After the flowers bloom, the branches and leaves covering them are removed, called "opening clothes." In the following three years, mushroom production is at its peak, called the golden age. At this time, mushrooms of different thicknesses and sizes are produced depending on the weather. After the tree bark rots, although the method of "催檣" can be used - lightly tying thin boards to the tree trunk to make it move - the yield is ultimately not much.

This large group of mushroom farmers travels across vast areas, managing their mushroom business. After the mushroom farmers harvest the mushrooms, they dry them, grade them, pack them into cloth bags, and transport them to the mushroom shop for sale. The organization of the mushroom shop is extremely simple. Every year in October of the lunar calendar, the boss and the mountain worker determine the location and start the business. They have a large amount of cash on hand to pay the mushroom farmers and provide them with food and lodging. When the mushroom farmers are short of food, they also provide high-interest loans, pre-ordering this year's mushroom production, and the mushroom farmers have no control over the selling price.

The prosperity and decline of the mushroom shop depends on the boss's relationships, the mushroom farmers' creditworthiness for loans, and issues such as weighing and selling, and even disputes between mountain owners and mountain workers, or difficult requests, all have an impact on the shop. Therefore, the bosses of the mushroom shops do their best to cater to the mushroom farmers, striving to make the business thrive.

The mushroom industry is not only related to the lives of mushroom farmers, but also has a significant relationship with the rural economy of the border areas of southern Zhejiang. In recent years, the dumping of foreign mushrooms has caused the shiitake mushroom market to become sluggish, the price of mushrooms has plummeted, and the mushroom industry is facing a crisis. This is because mushroom farmers secretly adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve, resulting in a daily decrease in production and a decline in quality. If scientific methods can be adopted to improve it, it may not be impossible to save it.

### Cash Flows South; Reaches 300 Billion in Over 20 Days; 100 Billion Intercepted in Shantou

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhou, 1st] A certain national bank in the city reported that in just over twenty days, cash was privately transferred south from Shanghai, with the total amount estimated at around 300 billion. 100 billion was transported to Shantou and 200 billion to Guangzhou. The authorities received confidential reports about the batch of banknotes being shipped and knew that it was done by a certain financial authority in Shanghai. They immediately made arrests, resulting in the seizure of three batches totaling 50 billion yuan in Shantou and two batches totaling 50 billion yuan in Guangzhou. However, the trend of large amounts of cash flowing south has not been curbed.

The anti-smuggling work in South China is actively underway, and smugglers have changed their "strategy." Most of them have switched to the Macau-Zhongshan route, while others take trains from Hong Kong to the Sino-British border, forcibly carry goods across the border, and then take trains from Shenzhen to Guangzhou. This lawless situation has proven to be a major headache for law enforcement.

Zhuo Yifen, the former magistrate of Nanxiong County in Guangdong Province, was detained by the provincial government for investigation on charges of corruption. The magistrate once attempted suicide by cutting his throat with a razor in prison but failed. Recently, Chairman Song Ziwen ordered that he be escorted to the city for interrogation. However, he bribed Officer Chen of the Qujiang Security Police Squad, who was responsible for escorting him, with 400 million national currency, and both escaped without a trace. They are currently wanted.

Amidst the housing shortage in Guangzhou, even central government agencies cannot avoid this predicament. A large Western-style house at No. 52 Fuxing Road, Shamian, managed by the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office, was originally designated as the location of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but this has been going on for a year. Recently, the Enemy Property Office suddenly notified the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, limiting it to move out within half a month, so that the Credit Bureau of the Central Trust of China could use the place. The head of the office, Guan Shi, negotiated with Zhao Wanping, the head of the Enemy Property Office, several times, but to no avail. They will file a lawsuit in court. People laugh and say, "Officials are forcing officials to move."

According to a report from Nanhai: A resident of Xingrenli, Foshan Town, named Zhong, has a daughter named Yinniang, who is only six years old and has not yet attended school, but she can write with a brush and write large characters outside the size of a ruler. The characters are in the Six Dynasties style, vigorous and well-organized, causing a sensation in the city. Calligraphers in the city have tested her repeatedly, and it has always been successful. Everyone is amazed at her talent as a goddess. Her father said that if he has travel expenses, he plans to travel to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and bring her to visit and ask for advice from President Yu Youren. (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)

### Dredging Geng Mountain; Dredging the Lake Water; Reclaiming Fertile Land

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Yuyao, January 29th] Mount Mou Lake is located in the west of Yuyao County, with an area of more than 11,400 mu. It is said that it was originally farmland in the Ming Dynasty. Later, due to water conservancy, the fields were opened as a lake, and now a part of it has been dredged and cultivated into fields to increase production. It has truly experienced the changes of mulberry fields into the sea. After three months of dredging and cultivation, Mount Mou Lake has acquired more than 3,500 mu of land, and the procedures for receiving cultivation are currently being handled. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to use the land as a demonstration farm for mechanized farming, and the villagers also place infinite expectations on it. The plan to dredge and cultivate Mount Mou Lake was launched before the war. In the 29th year of the Republic, the Mou Mountain and Liu'an Two Lakes Dredging and Reclamation Committee was organized to

divide the area and proceed with reclamation. Soon after, enemy cavalry crossed the river and harassed, and Yuyao was soon occupied, and the reclamation work had to be suspended. Last summer, the Zhejiang Provincial Reclamation Committee re-proposed the dredging and reclamation of Mount Mou Lake. Dr. Mao Gen, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Post-War Agricultural Abandonment Committee of the Relief Administration, also visited the lake twice to investigate, and believed that it was very reasonable and could be carried out. In mid-September, the "Mount Mou Lake Dredging and Reclamation Committee" was established, and expert Wu Guochang was hired as the chairman, and Sun Xinian, the head of Mou Mountain Township, was the vice chairman. The Joint Relief Office provided equipment and used the latest agricultural machinery for dredging and reclamation. It was decided to start work on October 1, and mobilize 1,600 farmers from Mou Mountain, Kaiyuan, Qinggang, and other townships to start from the reconstruction of the embankment project, that is, use the Joint Relief Office's relief flour to provide labor, and borrow 2,000 zu of grain from the Yuyao Water Conservancy Association to pay the expenses. The project began to proceed.

The embankment construction project was scheduled to be completed by the end of October. After the start of construction, due to the cold weather and the hardness of the soil, and the farmers lacked experience in handling the mud, the work could not be carried out. Therefore, the Reclamation Committee contracted another contractor. Since Double Tenth Festival, more than 2,000 workers have been working on the surface of Mount Mou Lake every day, densely packed like ants, buried in their work, and completed the task on schedule at the end of October, obtaining 3,500 mu of lake fields. Taile can then carry out dredging, which was delayed due to

financial twists and turns and must be completed before spring plowing this year.

The Reclamation Committee has been continuing to engage in canal construction, building gates, and other projects, and is handling the registration procedures for inviting strict reclamation. The management method is determined to be based on the principle of self-cultivation and cooperation, and the land is allocated to the nearby townships and farmers who have contributed to the dredging and embankment construction project by drawing lots. The county government issues a land certificate for the reclaimed land, and the land ownership belongs to the reclaimed farmer after all the project costs are paid off in installments, but it is stipulated that it cannot be sublet, sold, or divided. The county government allows the reclaimed land to be

exempted from taxes for five years. In the future, Mou Mountain Lake and various rivers must continue to be dredged, and dams must also be repaired, so it is stipulated that reclaimed farmers must pay a 60% interest fee to the Water Conservancy Association after obtaining property rights, which is equivalent to 50 jin of grain per mu. The payment will be stopped as soon as the work is completed, and it is currently limited to a maximum of ten years.

As the spring plowing season is approaching, the villagers are enthusiastically going to the township to register and apply for reclaimed land. The Reclamation Committee is negotiating with the Agricultural Bank for agricultural loans to purchase plowing cattle, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. Fourteen tractors from the Joint Relief Office's Restoration Team have already been shipped. This spring, it is planned to first use barley, wheat, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, and purple cloud English as experiments. It is expected that when mechanized cultivation and planting are successful in the future, farmers will enthusiastically praise the greatness of this project. (Ben Zhu)

The second is that the Football Association will host a cocktail party at the Hong Kong Hotel on the evening of the 14th to welcome the Shanghai team representatives.

This year, Hong Kong has a flourishing football talent pool. According to common sense, it is feared that the Shanghai team will not be easy to compete with Hong Kong. Based on usual observations, the Hong Kong Interport Team will produce the following lineup. However, on the 11th, when China United confronts the Shanghai team, China United will definitely strive for victory. It is feared that main player Feng Jingxiang will not be easy to take on the heavy responsibility of two games. The Hong Kong Interport Team may field the following:

▲ Interport Team Xiaogaoshanu, Yu Yaode, Hou Rongsheng, Zou Wenzhi, Chen Li, Liu Songsheng, Zhu Yongqiang, Jianeng, Xiao Weilu, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen

▲ China United Team Xie Jinhong, Tan Junhan, Hou Rongsheng, Feng Kunsheng, Song Lingsheng, Zhang Jinhai, Zhu Yongqiang, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen

### Farewell Battle of the Expeditionary Force; Jiangxi Guang to Meet Jiaoda Today

League A Group Ren Yu vs. Encas; Jiangxi Guang Defeated by Shantou Team Yesterday

Starting at 5:30 PM tonight, there will be a total of three basketball League A group matches, still competing at the Municipal Gymnasium. Starting at 8:30 PM, there will be an added friendly match between Jiangxi Guang and Jiaoda, with tickets costing 20,000 yuan upstairs and 40,000 yuan downstairs. In the Taochang A2 Group match, Xinsheng vs. Indian, the strength is average and there will be fierce competition. In the A1 group, Ren Yu will face Encas. Ren Yu has not been very successful in this league, but has gradually returned to normal recently. Today, with a strong enemy in front, they will definitely do their best.

The final battle will be between the visiting Jiangxi Guang and Jiaoda, starting at 8:30 PM. Jiangxi Guang came to Shanghai with relatively poor skills and was completely defeated, but their sportsmanship is good. It is commendable that a school team came to Shanghai from afar to observe. Jiaoda is the school team of National Jiaotong University and the runner-up of the university group of the college basketball league. When they face off against the visiting team, it is still feared that Jiangxi Guang will find it difficult to win.

Xinsheng - Indian (A2A) 5:30 PM

### Jiangxi Guang Loses Fourth Match Again to Shantou Team

Jiangxi Guang fought its fourth battle since coming [here] yesterday, meeting the Shantou team at the gymnasium at 5:00 PM. The Shantou team took the lead, and the visiting team chased to a 6-6 tie. From then on, the visiting team lagged behind all the way, but the score was still close. At the end of the first half, the Shantou team took the lead with 21 to 14. When the two teams re-entered the field, the Shantou team's score increased sharply. At 22 to 36, Hu Chubang of Jiangxi Guang graduated with five fouls. Zhu Siheng filled the gap, but the Shantou team still did what they wanted. When time was up, the visiting team was defeated 28 to 55.

### National Banks and Bureaus Gathered at the Four Joint Offices Yesterday to Review Applications for Purchase Cases; Purchase of Finished Products Mostly in Cotton Weaving and Soap; Meetings to Be Held Daily Until the End of the Lunar Year

[Our Newspaper] National Banks and Bureaus, acting as agents for the government to purchase finished products, convened the first Review Committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Four Joint Offices branch. Liu Gongyun, Wang Zishuang, Zhu Tongjiu, Diao Minren, and many others attended. Chairman Liu Gongyun reviewed 56 applications for purchase, with a total application amount of over 10 billion yuan, all of which were approved. Yesterday's applications were mostly from the cotton weaving and soap industries. It is heard that the committee will hold a meeting at the Four Joint Offices branch every day until the end of the lunar year, so as to review the application cases submitted by the National Banks and Bureaus on a daily basis. When applying to purchase finished products, manufacturers must first request the following three forms from the relevant banks and bureaus: ① Factory Production Statistics Table for the past six months, ② List of Finished Products Applied for Purchase, ③ Recent Balance Sheet, and submit them to the relevant banks and bureaus for investigation and review. Those approved can obtain the funds within one or two days. The finished products purchased from each factory will be handed over to the China Trust Bureau for public auction.

The industrial sector in this city has many concerns about the purchase method. They believe that one is that the quantity of finished products purchased is limited, and the assistance to the country may not be great; the second is the fear that after the government purchases these finished products, it will sell them to the market at low prices in order to stabilize prices, which will greatly harm manufacturers.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Oil Prices Fall; Mixed Fortunes for Coarse Grains and Bean Cakes

Yesterday, both the northern and southern markets received a total of over 11,400 *shi* (bushels) of rice. With the Lunar New Year approaching, shops were genuinely consuming more than speculating, resulting in brisk market activity. *Jing* rice continued to rise, increasing sharply by 250,000 *yuan*. *Xian* rice also rose sharply by 560,000 *yuan*, and *baiyuan* (white rice) was also in high demand.

Wheat flour rose steadily, continuing to increase by 120,000 *yuan*. Wheat bran also increased significantly by 67,000 *yuan*. Bean cakes from Shantou declined, with many dealers from other regions selling off their stock, causing a sharp drop of 300,000 *yuan*. Soybean oil factories were less active, and dealers from other regions were also subdued. Du yellow beans were strong, rising by 120,000 *yuan*, while other beans were generally soft, either openly or discreetly. Green beans rose by 670,000 *yuan*, red beans remained unchanged, cowpeas showed little fluctuation, and broad beans saw little trading, with prices being high initially but subsequently reduced.

Red sorghum remained stable. Corn from Yantai was readily accepted, rising sharply by 350,000 *yuan*. Raw peanuts saw little activity from either local or outside traders, and trading was average, with mid-grade ones declining by 340,000 *yuan*.

Sesame from Tianjin remained unchanged. White sesame declined by 350,000 *yuan*, and black sesame fell sharply by 780,000 *yuan*.

The oil market declined due to falling prices inland, leading to a cautious market sentiment and strong selling pressure. Raw oil fell sharply by 1 million *yuan*, with *ji* barrel raw oil falling below the 4 million *yuan* mark. Soybean oil factories successively sold off their stock, leading to a decline of 450,000 *yuan*. Rapeseed oil and clear oil both fell by 350,000 *yuan*.

### Coal Price Adjustments Announced Yesterday by the Fuel Management Committee

[Our Report] Zhang Xiwei, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, flew to Beiping on the 26th of last month to negotiate an increase in the transport of northern coal to the south. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai yesterday. He told reporters that during his trip, he had negotiated with the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, and the Beiping-Tianjin Fuel Management Committee regarding the transportation of coal from the new port to the south. An agreement has been reached to pilot the transport of 30,000 tons of coal south starting from February 1st. During his stay in Beiping, he visited Director Li of the Executive Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief Chuan, discussing the increase in the quantity of northern coal transported south and the protection of the Beining Railway. The Kailuan Coal Mine currently has 800,000 tons of coal in storage and can produce 450,000 tons per month. After meeting domestic demand, there is still a surplus available for transport to the south. In terms of white coal, Datong can produce several thousand tons more per month, and Mentougou can produce 100,000 tons per month. Once the transportation problem is resolved, the supply to the south can be continuous.

[Further Report] The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has adjusted the coal prices for February, effective yesterday, as follows:

Grade A coal for public utilities, delivered at the pier, is 3 million *yuan* per ton; delivered on barges, 2.05 million *yuan*. Grade B coal for railway, military, and naval use, delivered at the pier, is 3.25 million *yuan* per ton.

Grade D coal for factories, military, and government agencies, is divided into eight levels, ranging from 4 million *yuan* to 4.4 million *yuan* per ton. Grade E coal for public utilities overseas is 4.6 million *yuan* per *jin* (catty, approx. 500g) for coal dust and 5.04 million *yuan* for coal lumps. Coal dust for factories is 5.17 million *yuan*, and coal lumps are 5.04 million *yuan*. Grade F white coal is divided into six levels, ranging from 3.23 million *yuan* to 7.84 million *yuan*.

### Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in prices due to a shortage of spot goods and active real sales, leading to significant fluctuations. The Sugar Guild's assessed price for current spot Grade 24 raw white sugar was initially 1.94 million *yuan*, then rose to 1.978 million *yuan*, before slightly easing in the afternoon. The price for bagged Grade 4.5 white sugar was 1.98 million *yuan*, later falling back by 340,000 *yuan*. Grade 20 medium-grain white sugar was 1.865 million *yuan*, Shantou green sugar was high at 1.55 million *yuan*, cotton red sugar was 1.75 million *yuan*, and good quality refined white sugar in baskets was 1.8 million *yuan*. Xing red sugar ranged from 1.62 million to 1.54 million *yuan*. Diao green sugar ranged from 1.523 million to 1.5 million *yuan*, Hainan red sugar was 1.69 million *yuan*, sliced green sugar was 1.3 million *yuan*, Taiwanese green sugar ranged from 1.42 million to 1.4 million *yuan*, and Shunde green sugar was 1.53 million *yuan*.

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's *Hai Xiang* ship arrived from Kaohsiung yesterday with 20,000 bags of sugar, currently being unloaded at the Jinliyuan Wharf.

Woolen Fabrics Weaken

The woolen fabric market has been calm recently. Due to seasonal and environmental factors, both large and small transactions have decreased. Prices for various fabrics have weakened. The year-end financial reports of various firms show that many are superficially profitable but actually losing money. While accounting in national currency shows large profits due to rapidly rising prices, a review of actual inventory reveals that two-thirds of firms have suffered losses because their inventory is lower than the previous year. This is especially true for smaller firms that are not members of the guild, which have suffered even greater losses.

### Chinese Stocks Frequently See Low Prices; Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Are Weak

The situation for Chinese stocks was even more dire yesterday, with widespread forced sales. Hong Kong Electric also rose further, leading to frequent low prices. Small stocks saw smaller declines, while new domestic stocks continued to rise to their limit. Eventually, market sentiment stabilized, and prices recovered slightly after the weakness.

The morning opening was fearful, with Wing On Textile falling to 702 and 712 *yuan*. It continued to fall to 678 and 687 *yuan*. After a slight rebound, it fell again to 671 and 678 *yuan*. After 10:30 AM, more buying occurred, and Domestic Goods (stocks) hit their limit, causing Wing On Textile to rise to 677 and 687 *yuan*. Soon after, the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate rose to 3.7 *yuan*, causing many to close out their positions, leading to oversupply and pushing the price down to a low of 660 and 672 *yuan*. Off-market prices were again higher, and the market then turned. The noon closing price was 664 and 674 *yuan*. Compared to the Saturday immediate delivery prices, only Domestic Goods rose by 50%, while Mayer & Fech, China Textiles, Shanghai Knitwear, Wuhe, Wing On Textile, Sincere, New Kwong, King Foong, Chun Hing, Sino-French, New China, Wing Foong, Matches, Wing Kung, and China Silk Scarf declined by 5%. The rest saw slight declines. For deferred delivery stocks, Mayer & Fech, Sincere, China Textiles, and King Foong each fell by 10%, while Wing On Textile, New Kwong, and Chun Hing fell by 5%.

In the afternoon, Domestic Goods rose to its limit at 106, with 76 and 148 entering deferred delivery and 226 entering immediate delivery, rising to 680 and 690 *yuan*. However, the atmosphere of fear remained strong. Soon, a wave of selling began, with no support, pushing the price down to a low of 659 and 667 *yuan*. With the Bank of China’s exchange difference, market sentiment gradually calmed, rising to 680 and 690 *yuan*, before closing at 675 and 684 *yuan*. Compared to the morning immediate delivery prices, Domestic Goods hit its limit, while Wing On Textile, China Textiles, Wing Hong, King Foong, New China, and Heng Foong rose by 50%. The rest of the stocks saw mixed results. Off-market unlisted stocks recovered slightly by up to 50%. Public utility stocks saw the largest declines.

Government bonds fell again yesterday. United C bonds opened at 72,000 and formed a one-way downward trend, falling to 64,000 before stabilizing. Trading volume was approximately 4 million. Compared to the previous closing prices, A, B, and E bonds each fell by 5,000 *yuan*, United C bonds fell by 7,000 *yuan*, and United D bonds also fell by 6,000 *yuan*.

Foreign stocks also fell sharply yesterday. Foreign and Cantonese merchants were selling. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate also rose to 3.7 *yuan*, leading to market instability. Ewo Textiles fell to around 520,000, with limited recovery. Compared to the previous Saturday, Ewo Textiles saw a slight decline. British & Chinese Corporation, Ewo Brewery, Telephone, and Tramways remained stable, while Jardine Matheson, Ye Guang, Paper, Navigation, and Steel each fell by 5%.

There has recently been an increase, indicating that credit conditions have eased again.

### Yarn Management Committee Stipulates Procedures for Cotton Yarn Registration and Movement; Textile Export Association Purchases 60,000 Bales of American Cotton

[Our Report] The Textile Construction Company received a telegram from the Yarn Management Committee yesterday, stating: "Starting from February 1st, the Association will collect blank cotton yarn registration certificates and hand them to customers purchasing yarn to fill out, affixing the factory seal of the respective factories as proof, and then proceed directly to the Association to register and pick up goods for delivery." The company has notified its various spinning factories and warehouses, as well as its customers, that all holders of the company's cotton yarn warehouse warrants should immediately bring their warrants to the company's business office to obtain a blank cotton yarn registration certificate, fill it out themselves, and then take the warrant to the respective delivery factory for stamping, proceeding directly to the Yarn Management Committee to register and pick up goods for delivery.

The Textile Export Association, in order to increase the supply of raw cotton, has requested the Yarn Management Committee to promptly entrust the Textile Construction Company to purchase 60,000 bales of long-staple American cotton and to negotiate with relevant banks for the purchase. This is currently underway.

Coarse Yarn Strengthens

The cotton yarn market opened relatively stable yesterday. News that the Shenxin No. 9 Factory had gone on strike due to unresolved year-end bonuses, affecting production, led local dealers to make purchases, causing the market to strengthen. However, many took profits near noon. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon yarn were unchanged, while Precious Light, Golden City, and Heavenly Maiden yarn fell by 100,000 to 500,000 *yuan*. In addition, 20-count Double Horse, 16-count Heavenly Maiden, and 32-count Silver Moon and Eight Horse yarn rose by 230,000 to 560,000 *yuan* compared to Saturday. Throughout the day, fine yarn was stable to weak, while coarse yarn recovered.

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, selling a total of 304 pieces, equivalent to 606 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were 114 purchase orders, with 20-count Golden Double Chicken yarn selling for 32.5 million *yuan*.

Fine Cloth Firm

The cotton cloth market opened yesterday with strong demand from rural dealers. Local dealers also purchased in small quantities, and fabric stores also absorbed supply. Five Blessings and Dragon Head fine cloth saw stronger demand from Hankou and Yangtze region dealers, leading 12-pound fine cloth to rise by 3,500 to 35,000 *yuan* compared to the previous Saturday. In addition, Four Gentlemen, Zhigong, drill, raw cloth, and indigenous cloth also showed brisk trading, while other cloth markets remained stable.

### Cigarettes and Soap Sell Well

The cigarette market was strong yesterday due to the approaching Lunar New Year, with strong sales. Dealers purchased and drove up prices, causing the market to rise sharply. Near the close, news that Wing Tai Wo and Hua Cheng were distributing goods led floating accounts to sell off, but the result was that 10-piece Great Britain Old Knife and Two Cigarettes were still up 2.32 million *yuan* compared to Saturday. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-piece tin cigarettes also rose by 56,000 to over 10,000 *yuan*.

The daily necessities soap market saw strong sales, even though the Ouzhi Chemical Company was distributing "Beautiful Brand" soap at a discounted price of 1.28 million *yuan* per case. Due to strong demand from dealers and active searching and hoarding, the highest price reached 1.889 million *yuan*, resulting in a surge of 80,000 *yuan* per case compared to the previous Saturday. Arrow and Knife soap rose by 30,000 *yuan*, while Beautiful, Guanghua, Xiangmao, and other soaps also rose by 50,000 to 120,000 *yuan*. Match prices also rose by 120,000 *yuan*, and kerosene remained firm.

### Financial Management Bureau Inspecting Banks and Money Shops in Batches to Prevent Misuse of Funds

[Our Report] With the Lunar New Year approaching, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to the movement of the large sums of funds that banks and money shops must recall. In order to prevent these funds from flowing into improper channels, the Bureau launched a large-scale inspection yesterday, conducted in batches. The first batch of 20 banks and money shops will be inspected. The inspection period will be extended beyond the Lunar New Year. The targets of the inspection include the general movement of funds, the reasons for missing or returned documents, and the warehouses and collateral attached to the various banks and money shops.

[Further Report] The Bureau requires that the names, addresses, occupations, and trade association memberships of all customers who receive loans, overdrafts, and draw checks from banks and money shops be accurately recorded. However, due to banks and money shops' neglect of verification in the past, discrepancies often occur. The Financial Management Bureau has instructed the various banking, money, and trust associations in the city to direct all banks and money shops to conduct thorough investigations and accurate records by February 9, otherwise they will be prosecuted according to law. The deadline is approaching, and most banks and money shops have completed their investigations. The Financial Management Bureau will also conduct random checks based on the reports submitted by the banks and money shops to ensure that unreliable customers are prevented from using banks and money shops for activities that disrupt the financial market.

### Appearance and Reality

---

If you put a reed in the water, it looks bent, but it is actually straight. The bend is how the reed appears in the water, while the straightness is its original form. Philosophically, this distinguishes between appearance and reality. In our daily lives, especially when a person's knowledge is immature, we often take what we see as truth. This is also the case during the period of ignorance in human knowledge, when the issue of truth versus semblance doesn't arise. However, the pursuit of truth is inherent in human nature, and humanity has long been dissatisfied with appearances, seeking reality behind them.

Human knowledge is the result of human efforts on this path. Knowledge varies in degree, sophistication, and direction: all aim to uncover the reality of the subject of study by peeling away its appearance. Modern scientific philosophy, in its current stage, can be considered the pinnacle of this pursuit. Truth and falsehood exist on a scale, in other words, appearance and reality exist to varying degrees, therefore, knowledge has different levels of depth and sophistication. When knowledge can distinguish between truth and falsehood, science delves deeper, and philosophy goes even further. For example, when a reed is placed in water, common sense can discern that it is actually straight. Beyond this, further questions such as what the reed is made of and why it appears bent in the water are no longer pursued. With advances in science, science is no longer satisfied with the common sense understanding of what a reed is. It analyzes the round and slender reed into fibers, then into cells, then into the cell nucleus and cytoplasm... further into molecules, then atoms, and then electrons. As philosophy advances, it questions the ultimate nature of matter as accepted by science. Scientists take the existence of human knowledge for granted, while philosophers question what it is, how it arises, and how it is established. It is evident that philosophy seeks truth more thoroughly than science. What science considers reality, philosophy still regards as appearance, seeking the reality behind it. Furthermore, science seeks the truth of a part of the universe, a part of reality, while philosophy seeks the truth of the entire universe, the entire reality. Therefore, philosophy is not only deeper than science but also broader: philosophy is engaged in seeking the truth of truth and the reality of reality.

An event or thing presents itself to people and becomes an appearance. The appearance is different from the event or thing, why? Things are objective; whether people see them or not, they are always the same. However, people's perception of things is influenced by various internal and external factors, which combine to create a difference between what is seen and the original form of the thing. For example, a painting looks different when viewed from the front, side, above, or below, in sunlight or lamplight. These external factors, such as position, direction, and light, contribute to the difference between the appearance and reality of the painting. As for internal factors, some are common to all humans, while others are personal: common factors include the structure of the senses and the understanding of perception, which can make a two-dimensional design with color combinations appear as a three-dimensional object; personal factors include the person's artistic background, current emotions, and the condition of their eyes, all of which can cause a painting to have a unique appearance for them at a particular time.

Since people cannot escape the various obstacles of internal and external factors when viewing things, what they obtain is only appearance. How can they peel away the appearance to get to the reality? The only option is to use methods of comparison, verification, and correction. For example, if a reed appears bent in the water, one can take it out of the water to see and feel it, and the results can be used to correct the initial perception of its appearance in the water. This is mutual verification of perception through successive, similar, and different types of senses. If one believes that perceptions are difficult to distinguish and cannot determine which is true and which is false, one can also resort to reason: use the principles of refraction in physics to prove why the reed appears bent in the water. This is using reason to verify the senses. The possibility of obtaining truth is greater when using reason to verify the senses than when using the senses to verify each other. The wider the scope of verification and the more precise the method, the greater the possibility of obtaining truth. The progress of human knowledge is the increasing degree to which truth is sought and obtained. Although one cannot say that it has reached the reality of the universe, it is gradually approaching it.

### The Prerequisite Problems of "Building the Nation Through Industry"

— Zhang Qiyun

"Building the nation through industry" is not a new slogan. After the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the so-called "famous ministers of the Restoration," such as Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang, were all powerful figures who advocated new industries. Institutions like the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau, the Fujian Shipbuilding Bureau, and the Gansu Woolen Mill were already quite large in scale at that time. Why is it that after more than eighty years, Chinese industry still cannot occupy a place in the world? Industrial backwardness is indeed the main reason for China's poverty and weakness. As we begin to build the nation, we must urgently examine the root of the disease in order to provide a means for flourishing and growth. Of course, economics cannot be separated from politics, and if politics is not enlightened, there is no way to improve the economy. Conversely, it can also be said that the economy is the foundation of politics. This problem is too broad and needs to be discussed separately. Currently, focusing solely on industry itself, the author deeply feels that there are several prerequisite problems that determine the success or failure of "building the nation through industry," and I would like to briefly explain them.

The Problem of Industrial Research
The greatest characteristic of the twentieth century is the dissemination of knowledge, that is, the systematic application of the results of scientific research to people's livelihoods and daily use. Research institutions, both large and small, contribute their research results to society as much as possible, and the industrial sector uses this as a foundation to make the best use of it. The scientific method is the cause, and industrial technology is the result. The first issue in building the nation through industry is the issue of brainpower. We must not only find ways to utilize the existing achievements and ready-made materials of advanced countries (in fact, we have not yet made a good effort in this step), but we must also catch up and conduct our own research. How to promote communication between universities and factories is a fundamental and important plan. It is true that universities should maintain academic freedom and should not overly emphasize practicality. However, universities and the industrial sector can cooperate closely, understand each other, prevent Chinese industry from completely relying on traditional techniques, absorb new ideas at any time, increase its competitiveness in the world market, and cultivate a national habit of loving research, making it a unique characteristic of the nation. This is, of course, also a responsibility that universities should fulfill. Universities train talents, test materials, and solve problems for factories, and factories provide economic support to universities for the purpose of supplementing equipment. The way of mutual assistance is mutual benefit. Currently, the country's scientific talent is limited, so it is appropriate to concentrate it in universities. Currently, few private industries have the strength to establish complete laboratories themselves. As for the small number of experimental institutes run by the central government, it is not easy to fully take care of the needs of all regions. Therefore, universities in various places are undoubtedly responsible for the problem of industrial research. In the future, vocational schools should not be limited to training technical talents; more attention should be paid to research work. The government should have reasonable standards for the geographical distribution of vocational schools to avoid the drawbacks of duplication and unevenness.

The Problem of Industrial Location
The so-called regional planning in various countries of the modern world aims to comprehensively plan various factors of national industries, such as raw materials, power, labor, transportation, markets, as well as climate, water sources, and species selection issues, to make the most effective use of human and material resources and to achieve the most favorable distribution. In wartime, we often do not consider production costs in order to cope with national crises, but in peacetime, all industries must be able to develop independently. Therefore, from the perspective of economic concepts and national defense, we must consider many aspects to achieve the most appropriate solution. The study of industrial location is not only for the sake of one industry or one region, but often for the sake of the entire industry and the entire country. From a distance, we must pay attention to the world's position; from close range, we should divide a region into many sub-regions and conduct detailed investigations. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "National Reconstruction Outline" and "Industrial Plan" have already pointed out the main lines and key points of foreign industrial construction. This is a general outline, and more detailed research, data collection, and statistical analysis are needed. Based on past experience and referring to world trends, we can make practical contributions to the geographical distribution of China's new industries, so that national policies can be fully realized. This newly emerging specialized research is called industrial geography. In the past, the failures of industry were nothing more than the three elements of timing, geographical advantage, and human harmony. Studying the interrelationship of these three elements is the task of industrial geography. We firmly believe that private interests can only be entrusted after national interests are established, and that regional designs are only meaningful after a national design is in place.

The Problem of Industrial Management
This problem is the scientific study of labor issues. Its purpose is to improve work efficiency or morale, so that every male and female worker can achieve maximum production. Industrial management not only needs to train skilled workers, but also needs to cultivate knowledgeable and responsible citizens. This scientific research includes many aspects, such as industrial psychology, which is one of the most important. The relocation of factory sites to better locations is also a recent trend. Since the Industrial Revolution, factories have been located in large cities, creating a phenomenon of population concentration, which has led to various social problems. Nowadays, due to the convenience of power transmission, industry tends to be decentralized, developing towards the suburbs or opening up new cities, the so-called garden cities, with populations mostly between 10,000 and 50,000 people. These new industrial zones can be created based on ideals. For the interior of the factory, factors such as light, ventilation, temperature, and humidity should be considered to reduce diseases and improve health. For the environment outside the factory, factors such as hospitals, schools, libraries, entertainment venues, and other material and cultural conveniences are all taken into account. Adults and children are valued equally. These facilities are not only based on wartime experience to meet the needs of the air force era, but also strive to seek happiness for workers, which can indeed be followed as a national economic plan. In short, the ideal of industrial management is not only to reduce working hours and increase leisure time, but also to relieve workers of the pressure of life and the fear of unemployment. This is the price that social security should pay.

The Problem of Resource Coordination
As the saying goes, "No matter how beautiful the peony is, it needs green leaves to support it." Unless agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and mining are all actively improved and progress together, the so-called "building the nation through industry" will ultimately be like a mirage, desirable but unattainable. Dr. Sun Yat-sen foresaw this and proposed ten major construction guidelines, namely: 1. Transportation, 2. Commercial ports, 3. Cities, 4. Hydropower, 5. Industry, 6. Mining, 7. Agriculture, 8. Irrigation, 9. Forestry, 10. Immigration. Any one of these items must have the other nine as necessary conditions. He strongly advocated strengthening the ties between the inland and the border areas, believing that the railways connecting the inland and the border areas were the most profitable investment for the country. Industry is a link in the entire economic construction. If we distort the meaning, the phrase "building the nation through industry" is actually incomprehensible. The author has an article on the ten major guidelines of national reconstruction (published in the "Thought and Era Monthly," issues 10 and 11), which will not be repeated here.

### The Activities of American Philosophers During the War

— Xie Youwei

Our country knows very little about the activities of American philosophical circles during this war because of wartime transportation. We mostly did not receive their publications and books, so we are really ignorant of what they actually did. Now that more than two years have passed since the end of the war, we have gradually understood the activities of American philosophical circles during the war, and American philosophers have also made a rather detailed report on their own work. Now, I intend to describe the activities of American philosophers during the war based on this report. This is not only a lesson for our country's philosophers, but it can also let the general reader know that "although philosophy cannot bake bread," philosophy is not a useless thing in any era.

First, let us explain the attitude of American philosophers towards this war. After the Nazis launched the war, but before the Pearl Harbor incident, the Eastern Branch of the American Philosophical Association held a conference and resolved to express sympathy and resist the aggression of the Axis countries. This resolution was based on two assumptions and one fact. The two assumptions are: philosophy aims to seek wisdom that will be true for everyone, and that this wisdom can only be obtained through the free exercise of human functions. One fact is that the governments of the Axis countries now place race or nation above humanity, and force above right and wrong and truth. In other words, the main reason why American philosophers also stood on the common front of resisting the Axis countries was because the dictatorship of the Axis countries hindered the free exercise of human functions, thus preventing philosophy from obtaining true wisdom. As for the ethics of war and the question of non-resistance or pacifism, American philosophers did not discuss it.

Such was the attitude of American philosophers, so after the Pearl Harbor incident, American philosophers actively participated in the war. Many philosophers, both those eligible for military service and those slightly older, worked in various departments of the American war agencies, and many showed very good results. The work of these philosophers was very complicated. Some were sent to prisoner-of-war camps to manage prisoners, some were sent to the Red Cross to do things, some were chaplains in the army, some participated in the training of new soldiers, some were in the country, and some were abroad. The philosophers who remained teaching at universities also reduced their hours of teaching philosophy and went on to teach other sciences and courses related to military affairs. For example, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geography, meteorology, languages, etc., all had philosophers teaching them. As a result, their working hours increased, their holidays decreased, and most of them had no holidays. They also specially wrote a "Preface to Philosophy" for soldiers serving in the military. It was written by several famous philosophers, such as Professor W.E.Hocking, etc. All of these can be said to be the work directly related to the war by American philosophers.

American philosophers fulfilled their responsibilities for the war and did the work they should do, but they did not neglect their own work. In universities, the philosophy departments of American universities did not stop due to the war. Although the number of students generally decreased, the number of students in the philosophy departments of women's universities and coeducational universities actually increased. At the same time, the number of graduate students in the philosophy departments of various universities increased due to the increase in veterans and foreign students. As a result, the philosophy departments of various universities admitted students to the maximum extent. The vacancies of philosophy professors who left the university to participate in the war were filled by many professors who had escaped from Nazi-controlled areas and came to the United States, so there was no worry about a shortage of professors. As for the curriculum of the philosophy department, it itself changed little, but courses such as social and political philosophy, democratic political philosophy, the philosophy of war and peace, and the philosophy of Latin America were either newly opened or emphasized. Some university philosophy departments even expanded during the war, such as Cornell University and Yale University. It can be said that American philosophy education developed instead during the war.

Secondly, the various philosophical societies organized by American philosophers did not completely stop during the war. The Eastern Branch of the American Philosophical Association held a meeting in December 1941, and the Western Branch also held a meeting in April 1942. After that, it was suspended for several years due to transportation issues. However, the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology, the Southwestern Philosophical Conference, and the Association for Symbolic Logic never stopped their activities. In addition, several societies were added during the war: one was the International Phenomenological Society, established on December 23, 1939, in New York, and the other was the concern for science, philosophy, religion, and the democratic way of life, which began to be launched in December 1940 and held its first annual meeting in September 1941. International philosophical conferences were also held in the United States during the war. One was the Pan-American Philosophical Conference held at Yale University at the end of April 1943, and the other was the International Philosophical Conference held in Haiti in September 1944.

### T.V.A.

— Li Chunfen

The Metabolism of the Tennessee River Valley

I. Introduction

Fifteen years ago, the Tennessee River Valley was a desolate and declining agricultural area, like a patient at death's door. After the doctor's dissection and treatment, it has now reversed its haggard appearance and become a prosperous land full of flowers. This savior is the highly acclaimed T.V.A. T.V.A. is the abbreviation for the Tennessee Valley Authority, established in 1933, responsible for the regional design, planning and execution, and business management of the Tennessee River Valley development, to achieve the triple mission of fully developing resources, rationally utilizing them, and appropriately protecting them.

II. Viewing the Past and Present of the Tennessee River Valley

The Tennessee River Valley is located in the southern part of the United States, covering an area of 40,000 square miles, with a warm climate, warm and short winters, and hot and long summers, with a growing season of about 200 days. Rainfall reaches about 50 inches, with rain in all seasons, more in spring and summer. The general terrain is mostly between 500 and 1,000 feet, with mountains in the east, low plateaus in the north, and low plains in the west. The northern part belongs to the corn and wheat area, the southern part belongs to the cotton belt, and the northwest is rich in tobacco. Its natural resources are quite abundant, with hydropower (potential energy of 4 million horsepower) and phosphate being the most important.

Due to unbalanced land use in this area, in the past, single cropping was the main practice. Coupled with the high intensity of rainfall and the short period of soil freezing in winter, soil erosion is very severe. In the 100 years before 1932, about half of the medium and above farmland in this area could not be cultivated due to soil erosion. It is truly shocking! Moreover, in the upper reaches of the Tennessee River, flash floods occur frequently during the rainy season, rushing into the mainstream. In the alternating area of the middle and lower reaches, the gradient is greatly reduced, and floods often occur in the downstream areas. In addition, there are few lakes along the river to regulate water volume, so the flow difference is very large, with a minimum of 8,000 cubic feet per second and a maximum of 500,000 cubic feet per second. The seasonal changes are very extreme.

In short, due to human negligence, the area was economically backward. In 1933, T.V.A. was ordered to be established to clean up the mess and formulate a comprehensive rescue plan. The focus of the rescue was on soil and water conservation, such as dam construction, afforestation, grass planting, and agricultural improvement. Due to direct prevention and treatment, indirect and huge gains were obtained, and the entire Tennessee River Valley was renewed. A few examples are listed below to illustrate the general situation: Flood control: In January 1946, the flood level in Chattanooga was 35.7 feet. Due to the regulation of the water-blocking dams, it was reduced by 10 feet, otherwise the city would have suffered the fifth major flood in history, and the entire area might have lost 10 million yuan due to this flood. Power generation: The mainstream of the Tennessee River is equipped with locks to facilitate transportation; tributaries are equipped with dams for power generation. In 1946, the power generation reached 12 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 11 times compared to 1933. Navigation: The Tennessee River transport volume reached 256,000,000 ton-miles in 1945, an increase of eight times compared to 1933. From Knoxville to Paducah, a total length of 652 miles, it is scheduled to be dredged by 1950, which can maintain a 9-foot channel. Agriculture, forestry, and soil conservation: The main tasks are agricultural experiments and demonstrations, such as afforestation, grass planting, terrace farming, embankment construction, ditching, crop rotation, fertilization, adoption of new varieties, improved farming, promotion of livestock breeding, irrigation and drainage, agricultural product production and marketing, and rural electrification. After more than ten years of efforts, the farmland that had been destroyed by soil erosion has been restored to production. In 1944, the farmland abandoned due to topsoil erosion was less than one-tenth of that in 1934. Fertilizer production: Using the phosphate reserves in the west, a large-scale factory for manufacturing high-grade phosphate fertilizer and ammonium nitrate was established near Wilson Dam. The products are supplied for military use during wartime and for fertilizing fields during peacetime. According to last year's report, during World War II, T.V.A. supplied 60% of the phosphate used by the military, totaling 100,000 tons; during World War I, the total supply in the area was only 1,000 tons. Currently, a total of 39,000 farmers use T.V.A. phosphate fertilizer, widely distributed in 29 states. Industrial development and adjustment of population occupations: More than a decade ago, industries had been established in various places, but on a small scale. Since the dams were completed one after another and cheap electricity was sold, new industries have flourished one after another. Now, in addition to fertilizer production, there are also manufacturing industries for food, textiles, clothing, woodworking, papermaking, leather making, rubber, pottery, machinery, transportation equipment, etc. Its industrial structure has almost reached a stage of multi-faceted balanced development. Due to the development of new industries in this area, the distribution of population occupations has also been adjusted. In 1940, the agricultural population was twice that of industrial workers, but by the second half of 1944, the proportion of those engaged in industry had taken the lead.

III. The Extraterritorial Application of T.V.A.

After 15 years of construction, the Tennessee River Valley has transformed from desolation to prosperity, undergoing a metabolism. Therefore, many interested people want to apply this new strategy to other regions. In the United States, the Missouri River Valley area has already been planned for an M.V.A.; China's Yangtze River and Ganjiang River basins Y.V.A. and G.V.A. are also extraterritorial applications of T.V.A.; in Europe, there have also been calls for the organization of a D.V.A. in the Danube River basin. In principle, this is not infeasible. Success depends on human effort. As long as the countries involved treat each other with sincerity and take the welfare of the people in the entire basin as a prerequisite, the Danube River may not be transformed into a pleasurable river.

### On "Sincerity" (Part II)

— Bu Dang

The Use of "Sincerity"

The so-called "achieving subtlety" and "clarifying sincerity oneself," the work of "establishing oneself" and "completing oneself" lies in fulfilling one's nature: all that the mind and body know and do is nothing but the ultimate principles, and all that is obtained from the Way of Heaven as virtue is fully realized. Thus, knowledge is sufficient to know the constancy of one's own nature, and benevolence and courage are sufficient to practice it, to the utmost. As for "establishing others" and "completing things," it is only a matter of "fulfilling the nature of others" and "fulfilling the nature of things"; if one wants to fulfill the nature of people and things, one can only extend oneself to others, and extend others to things. Therefore, it is said: "If one can fulfill this nature, then one can fulfill the nature of things." For the nature of others is like one's own nature, so one can extend what one knows about oneself to know others, and what one uses to establish oneself to establish others, so that others also have a way to know the certainty of their nature, and use their benevolence and courage to practice it, to the utmost. This is what is meant by "fulfilling the nature of others." People and things are all born of Heaven and Earth, and they share the principles of Heaven and Earth as their nature. If one can know the nature of others and cause them to reach their limits, then one can also know the nature of things and cause them to obtain their due. Therefore, it is said, "If one can fulfill the nature of others, then one can fulfill the nature of things." Fulfilling the nature of things has the effect of "being able to manage the great order of the world, establish the great foundation of the world, and know the transformations of Heaven and Earth." "Order" is constancy; "great order" is like saying "reaching the Way," that is, the "five constants" of sovereign and subject, father and son, husband and wife, brothers, and friends. "Managing the great order of the world" means managing human affairs to rectify the "five constants." "The great foundation" is what is called "center," "center" is like the "center" of "descending center," which is the nature of the mandate of Heaven; "establishing the great foundation of the world" means using the power of education to make people "rectify their nature and destiny." "Knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" means thoroughly understanding the causes of the changes and destruction of all things in the universe. The ability of modern theoretical science lies entirely in this. "Knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" can "assist in the transformations of Heaven and Earth." The application of modern applied science often goes up to the sky and enters the earth, breaking through the barriers of mountains and rivers, turning danger into safety, eliminating the obstacles of roads, and turning distance into proximity. Is this not assisting in the transformations of Heaven and Earth?

The ability of "sincerity" and "achieving sincerity" reaches the extreme of "knowing the transformations of Heaven and Earth" and "assisting in the transformations of Heaven and Earth." Its effect is "then form, form then manifests, manifests then illuminates, illuminates then moves, moves then changes, changes then transforms"; its merit is "without ceasing, without ceasing then long-lasting, long-lasting then evident, evident then far-reaching, far-reaching then broad and deep, broad and deep then high and bright." For "sincerity" means that all that is known within the heart is a shared principle and public rule, and all that is done outside the body is nothing but the implementation of a shared principle and public rule; what the body comes into contact with and does is something that has traces that can be sought, so it is called "form." The principles of the intangible are applied to tangible things, and their effects are seen, so it is called "manifest." When the principles are manifest between things, things fully obtain their reasons for being, and what is obscure is all illuminated, so it is called "illuminate." When one understands the reasons for the existence of things, one can rely on their principles to control them, so it is called "move." When there is movement, change arises; when there is change, there is a way to adapt to the times and take what is appropriate to the situation. Its effects are not something that those who are confined to old habits can窥测, so it is called "transform." Only because the mind and body of "sincerity," both inside and out, and its thoughts and actions, are all manifestations of the Way of Heaven and Earth, can it be "without ceasing." "Without ceasing then long-lasting," nothing is otherwise: the movement of the sun, moon, and stars, only because it does not cease, can it last as long as Heaven and Earth. As for the birth of the human body, it is because the mechanism of metabolism does not cease; the water of rivers does not rot because it flows endlessly. When it is long-lasting, merit is achieved and effects are evident, so it is said "long-lasting then evident." When merit is achieved and effects are evident, they are spread to different places and cities, so it is said "evident then far-reaching." "Far" means long, referring to time; "reaching" means great, referring to space. The moral achievements of "sincerity," its actions are as broad as Heaven and Earth, its transmission to the world is as long-lasting as Heaven and Earth, and its admiration by countless generations is like the high and bright, the long-lasting Heaven and Earth, without distinction, so it is said: "Broad and deep matching the Earth, high and bright matching the Heaven, long-lasting without bounds." If one can be like this, then one's merit is equal to Heaven and Earth, and one can "be evident without being seen, change without moving, and achieve without doing." This is the eight ideal qualities set up by Confucianism by analogy with Heaven. (Concluded)

### Searching for the "Shoe-Shining General"

Editor: My uncle, Mr. Jiang Min, joined the resistance work during the September 18th Incident. My aunt and younger siblings were all shot and killed by the Japanese invaders. After the failure in the Northeast, my uncle returned to Tianjin to promote resistance against Japan, and made a living shining shoes or selling vegetables at the Tianjin Railway Station, still donating all the money he earned to the country. At that time, newspapers all featured this interesting story of patriotic deeds, and people called him the "Shoe-Shining General." In 1936, he served as a political instructor at the Central Military Academy's Special Training Class, and also served in the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Corps. After the July 7th Incident, he followed the government to Chongqing, and there has been no news since the victory. He is over fifty years old this year and is from Wenshang County, Shandong Province. His patriotic deeds have been seen in elementary school textbooks, but where is he now? Family members are looking for him everywhere. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please send a letter to inform us. We are very grateful! Jiang Huazhong respectfully writes. Mailing address: Secretariat, Shandong Provincial Police Department, Jinan City.

### Regarding Comic Books

— Mao Gong

I saw in the newspaper a "citizen urgently calling to save the future masters of the nation," which turned out to be about "the need to ban comic books with toxic elements." I am old and no longer a future master of the nation. Even if I read comic books with toxic elements, I should not be on the list to be saved. However, my children, even the oldest is not yet twenty, are undoubtedly future masters of the nation, and they are very fond of comic books. I usually did not pay attention to this, so I did not know if they were toxic or not. Now that I hear someone urgently calling for this, I examined what they were reading. The "drawings are poor," the "text is crude," and the "content is absurd and ridiculous," as the person who urgently called for it said. However, whether there are "toxic elements" worth "saving" is something I cannot immediately agree or disagree with. I must read all the comic books before I can say more.

What I have said above may lead you to mistakenly believe that I intend to defend comic books. Actually, that is not the case. I just feel that the "poor drawings" of general comic books are merely less beautiful than those of famous painters, the "crude text" is merely less elegant than that of famous classical writers, and the "absurd and ridiculous content" is merely about gods, monsters, and martial arts. If children use them as models for school essays or as a treasure trove for managing the world and benefiting the people, they are certainly inappropriate. However, if they are just casually read, it does not necessarily mean they are toxic, and they will be able to see the flaws. Some of the drawings and text in elementary school textbooks are not necessarily free of poor quality and crudeness. As for the absurd and ridiculous content, textbooks certainly should not have it, because their original purpose is to enable readers to cultivate themselves, manage their families, govern the country, and bring peace to the world. However, in leisure reading, gods, monsters, and martial arts are not a problem. If it is said that children will become confused or even go into the mountains to seek enlightenment after reading them, then even if it is not like a person with bad teeth having a toothache after eating beef, the problem cannot be solved by banning comic books, because children are exposed to many drawings and text in their daily lives that are no less harmful than comic books.

Let me give a simple example. Newspapers are full of movie and theater advertisements. The crudeness of the text in some of them is more "toxic" than that in comic books. The crudeness of the text in comic books is due to being ungrammatical or unpolished, while the crudeness of the text in some movie and theater advertisements is sensuous and suggestive. Everyone reads newspapers every day, so there is no need to provide examples here.

### A Record of the Egyptian Anti-Emperor Farouk

— Yun Gong

The current Egyptian Emperor Farouk is one of the most powerful figures in the Arab countries, but he is also the protagonist of a tragicomedy.

According to a journalist who interviewed him, he is a twenty-five year old young man, with a fat body, soft hair, and blue-gray eyes, perhaps inherited from his great-grandfather Colonel Sevan.

Farouk studied in England in his early years, and the newspapers unanimously praised him as "the most well-educated child in the world." Twelve years ago, his father, Emperor Fuad, passed away. He rushed back to Egypt upon hearing the news and soon inherited the throne.

Initially, when Emperor Fuad ascended the throne, he succeeded his brother, Emperor Hussein. Fuad initially had no money, but during his reign, due to the respect of the people, he collected a huge sum of 50 million US dollars, all of which was left to Farouk. Therefore, the latter has shares in almost every important industrial and commercial enterprise in Egypt. He is the country's leading financier.

Emperor Farouk has ten luxurious Rolls-Royce cars and five Packard cars. He loves to collect stamps, coins, medals, watches, and ancient copies of the Quran. He loves to eat chocolate and likes to swim and shoot wild ducks in his spare time. His regrets are that he often suffers from insomnia and cannot speak pure English.

As early as January 1942, a coup occurred in Egypt. Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha was forced to step down. Farouk intended to appoint Ali Maher Pasha, who was known for his anti-British stance, as the new prime minister. In February of the same year, the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, objected and recommended Mustafa el-Nahhas Pasha as his successor, but Farouk refused and indicated to the British Ambassador that he should return to his country immediately.

Ambassador Lampson had no other choice but to ask the then US Minister to Egypt, Alexander Kirk, to mediate. If Farouk could appoint pro-British and American figures, he would certainly win the favor of the United States. However, Farouk was unmoved. On February 4, the Egyptian Emperor received the British Ambassador for the second time. Sir Miles Lampson was accompanied by Major General Stone, the commander of the British garrison in Egypt, to the palace.

After Ambassador Lampson was received, he took out two official documents. One requested the Egyptian Emperor to abdicate and be taken to South Africa by special plane. The other official document requested the Egyptian Emperor to appoint Nahhas Pasha as the new prime minister.

At that time, the Emperor was hesitant, but British troops had already surrounded the palace, creating a threatening situation. The palace guards were outnumbered. At the same time, two light tanks drove into the palace, making the once prominent Egyptian Emperor no more than a prisoner. Ambassador Lampson asked the Emperor to look out the window and see the good show he had arranged.

The Egyptian Emperor was silent for a while. It is said that he later said, "You have left me with no other choice, because I do not want to abdicate. But I will never forget this incident."

At this point, Sir Miles Lampson and Major General Stone withdrew from the palace. According to rumors from locals in Cairo, the Egyptian Emperor flew into a rage afterward, ranting and raving for a full hour, hitting the table, smashing glassware, and even kicking down the pictures hanging on the walls.

There is also a popular story about the discord between the Egyptian Emperor and Britain. It is said that shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Farouk suffered from insomnia and was chased by a lion in his dreams. He sought treatment from Malaji, the president of Al-Azhar University. Malaji told him, "Your Majesty must kill a lion before you can sleep peacefully." So the Egyptian Emperor went to the zoo and shot two lions. But he still had the same dream and went to Malaji for advice again. Malaji retorted, "You fool. I am talking about a different kind, namely Britain."

### Old Book Stalls

— Zhang Xinru

Living in Shanghai, buying books is very convenient. Unfortunately, there is always an invisible barrier between me and bookstores. Even if I occasionally enter a bookstore, I can only drool and feel envious of those who buy books. Disheartened, I retreat to the next best thing: spending all my free time running to old book stalls.

The so-called old book stalls are not the usual second-hand bookstores. The books they sell may also be old, but they are arranged neatly, and the prices are not too low; in some cases, they are even frighteningly high, perhaps because the bookstore owners are asking for too much profit. The people who run the old book stalls are probably just people who buy up junk. They do not have storefronts; they simply set up a temporary wooden架 (jià, frame/shelf), or they take advantage of the windowsills of shops, and most often, they are just piles and piles of books heaped on the cement floor, each pile with a cardboard sign indicating a common price. You are free to choose, and if you can find something you like, you will be pleasantly surprised, because the price is not much different from buying waste paper. Compared to the books in bookstores that cost tens of thousands of dollars just to touch, they are so cheap that it's unbelievable.

According to my financial situation, even such inexpensive items can still be considered luxury goods. However, as long as I have a few bills in my hand, I will always run uncontrollably towards Fuzhou Road. There are so many small book stalls on both sides of the road! I often run down the right side of the road and then back up the left side, searching pile by pile in order. I call this "mining." Really, it is not easy to find something you like from that messy pile of broken books. The items are so varied, bizarre, and strange: there are antiques, and there are new gadgets; there are secrets of the martial arts world, and there are complete magic guides; there are Beijing opera scripts, and there are music scores for folksongs, and there are popular songs, and there are triangular love affairs; there are "New Youth" magazines from the May Fourth era, and there are famous works printed on native paper after the Sino-Japanese War… If you want to pick one book, you have to翻 (fān, turn over) several dozens of them, and you might not be able to pick one even after flipping for half a day.

This requires patience. As long as I have nothing to do, I can often linger there for half a day. This kind of gold-panning excavation gives me a strong sense of taste. I feel that the occasional success has an alluring power. When I accidentally discover a rare little book, the joy is indescribable. Moreover, this kind of bookstall has another advantage: they almost always have new items added every day. It is like a circulating library for poor scholars. Presumably, there are many friends with difficult lives who often use this method of "selling old books to buy new ones" to replenish their spiritual food. I feel that I have greatly benefited from them.

Today, while tidying up my boxes, I took the opportunity to inspect the large pile of old books that I had been running around to collect for several months. A ripple of joy could not help but well up in my heart. However, a shadow of melancholy immediately followed. I was thinking: For the time being, these tattered but lovely treasures are lying quietly and comfortably here, but I don't know when, perhaps they will once again drift to the streets like fallen leaves.

### The Origin of Champagne

— Mao Yi

Opening a bottle of champagne will inevitably be accompanied by a "pop" sound. This sound is like the most heavenly music to those who love a drink. It is not only pleasant to the ear but also makes people salivate.

The first person to be associated with this exciting music was Dom Pérignon, a humble French Benedictine monk. However, since he discovered champagne, his name has been preserved for more than three hundred years without being forgotten.

At that time, Louis XIV, who was fond of grandiose achievements and extravagant extravagance, was sitting high on the French throne, while a group of devout but happy Benedictine monks were promoting their service to God among the farmlands of Reims in the Champagne province. However, neither their religious duties nor their vows of poverty could prevent them from enjoying a few glasses of the light, unsweetened wine produced in the area.

Pérignon happily accepted the wine that the farmers gave him, classified it, processed it, and then bottled it at the appropriate time. He would hold a candle, tighten his swaying robe, and walk down to the great cellar of the Abbey of Hautvillers. He would taste this wine, try that wine, and an entire afternoon would pass. When he came up the stone steps, he would always have a few bottles of good wine for meals in his arms.

It is said that Pérignon was a learned man, and his knowledge of grapevines, grapes, and wine was unparalleled in the village; and it is possible that this knowledge even surpassed his knowledge of the scriptures. However, one day he made a serious mistake. However, it was this mistake that gave rise to champagne.

In the monastery's white-walled great cellars, there were several wine barrels dedicated to holding new wine that was not yet fully fermented. These barrels were marked with special signs according to the vineyard, grape variety, and harvest period. Other barrels were dedicated to holding mature, aged wine. Usually, the two were kept separate. The wine that Pérignon routinely bottled every afternoon was all drawn from the aged wine. However, one day, in some inexplicable circumstance, these two types of barrels were misplaced, and the aged wine was mixed with the new wine. Pérignon, due to his haste, or because he was absent-minded, did not notice the signs on the barrels—although he faithfully copied the signs and pasted them on the bottles after bottling. These bottles were placed in another corner of the cellar, because Pérignon was a man who knew that the older the wine, the better it would be.

Several months later, one afternoon, Pérignon went down to the cellar again to get wine. He thought that those bottles that had been mistakenly filled should be aged enough, so he took them out.

Pérignon had a habit of always opening a bottle and tasting it before drinking to see if the taste was good enough. He took a bottle at random and casually pulled the cork; however, the sudden pop startled him.

"Ah," he thought to himself, "this is terrible, the wine has gone bad!"

However, to make sure that the wine had really gone bad, he put his nose to the mouth of the bottle, and the aroma was surprisingly exciting and intoxicating. Perplexed, he poured a little into a glass and was shocked to find countless golden bubbles dancing on the surface of the wine. He took a sip.

"Angels have descended!" he exclaimed. "They have left stars in the wine!"

This is the story of the discovery of champagne. If you go to the Champagne province to inquire about the origin of champagne, the people there will tell you the same story.

### Buying American Candy

— Jin Jin

A few days ago, in a million-word memoir of World War II written by an American, I read an anecdote about a case of theft and sale of military supplies in Marseille, France, during World War II. An American black soldier agreed to sell three tons of soap to a French merchant, promising to deliver it at midnight in secret. After he delivered the goods by truck, the merchant climbed onto the truck, opened the boxes, and confirmed that they were the correct type. The black man insisted on being paid in full before unloading the goods.

The next morning, the merchant was overjoyed, thinking that he could make a huge profit, but he was soon disappointed. It turned out that the black man could not get any soap, so he loaded three tons of discarded explosives, and the boxes he loaded were similar to soap boxes. The matter was later discovered by the US military authorities, who could not help the French merchant. The latter could only admit his misfortune.

I think this French merchant must have felt indignant at being deceived. Unexpectedly, I have recently had a similar experience (in fact, I am sure that I am not the only one who feels this way). Haven't you all read in the newspapers in the past few days the advertisement that a certain bureau has entrusted various stores to sell American candy? Of course, there are some stores that pay attention to commercial ethics and remove inferior goods before selling them, but some do not. I went to such a store: it hung a large banner outside with large characters stating "Buy soon!" I could not help but step in and ask the clerk for a bar of ×× brand chocolate. When I opened the wrapper, I saw that it not only had wormholes but was also moldy. The store had a clever way to shift the loss to the customers, because according to the store's instructions, sold goods cannot be exchanged.

I suddenly had a feeling of being cheated. I felt that losing 5,000 yuan was a small matter. Fortunately, I am a person with some common sense. If I had believed the clerk's distorted explanation (at the time, I saw many people buying boxes of moldy chocolate after hearing the clerk's one-sided words), and eaten the chocolate, I think it would have been detrimental to my health.

Therefore, I finally hope that the authorities selling the candy can remove the rotten and spoiled candy when distributing it, and the store clerks should not quibble or deceive customers. The loss of money is a small matter, but the impact on the health of the people is very great.

### Sending off the Kitchen God

— Guo Yi

It is said that the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month is the day for 送灶 (sòng zào, sending off the Kitchen God). I do not know when this custom began, but Luo Yin of the Five Dynasties wrote a poem about sending off the Kitchen God, so it has been around for a long time. Luo Yin's poem says: "A cup of clear tea, a wisp of smoke, I send you, Kitchen God, to the Jade Emperor in heaven. If the Jade Emperor asks about human affairs, say that articles are worthless." This poem is widely recited by the world. Luo Yin, who was known as Luo Jiangdong (Yin) and was famous in enemy countries, still sighed that "articles are worthless." So what is there to blame for the poor scholars whose words cannot cure hunger? However, reciting his poem is ultimately a cry of shared fate for all the talented and unlucky throughout history! Although Luo Yin was known for his poetry and was unparalleled in his time, it is said that when Li of Jiangnan sent an envoy to Yue, the people of Yue asked if they had seen Luo Jiangdong. The envoy said: I do not know him and have not heard of his name. The people of Yue said: The world has heard of Luo Jiangdong, how clumsy you are! The envoy said: He has no name on the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. This matter is extremely laughable. Whether or not one is famous is judged by the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. It is right that the envoy is ignorant and does not know Luo Jiangdong. However, everyone has this view in their minds. Those whose talent is far inferior to Luo Yin's, and who have no support to use as a ladder, will find it even more difficult to survive in this world! "Articles are worthless," Luo Yin expressed his sentiments in his time. Judging from his experience, it was still not to this point. If he were born today, even if he had the talent of Luo Jianyan, it would not be enough to support his wife and children, and he would end up…

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 9 Leaking Secrets (Part 1)

Zhu Qidao said: "I am completely in a passive position in this matter. Uncle knows about my family, so it is difficult for my father's side to get by. Therefore, I have always been afraid to talk about it outside, and I am not hiding it from Uncle." Xiao Bai, seeing that a few words had revealed Zhu Qi's true feelings, smiled and said, "I have known for a long time that Qi Wan is interested in you, but have you ever thought about this matter carefully?" Zhu Qidao said! "I have thought about it. Qi Wan is sincere and wants to be with me. I also feel that it is not easy to find a confidant in life." Xiao Bai said, "She is usually extravagant. Can you afford it with your current status?" Zhu Qi said: "I have also thought about this carefully. According to Qi Wan, she will not go out to perform and will not socialize at home, so she will save a lot of money. Moreover, she has some private money that can subsidize the family." Xiao Bai shook his head and said, "This is unreliable. You must pay attention to this, and don't let it become a burden for the rest of your life." Zhu Qi said: "I don't think it's a problem. As long as our feelings are harmonious, it will be very happy to live a thrifty life. I think the serious problem is still my father's side. How can I communicate with him and get the old man's understanding? My father usually respects Uncle the most. Can Uncle help me talk to my father? I think it will be successful if Uncle speaks up." Xiao Bai said, "I can talk to your father, but what if it doesn't work?" Zhu Qi said, "If my father really doesn't agree, I will have to think of another way. This situation is like riding a tiger, and I have to do it." Xiao Bai said, "What do you plan to do?" Zhu Qi said, "I can only run away!" Xiao Bai was stunned and secretly shocked. Yu Ru only has this one son. If he runs away, wouldn't he make the old man anxious! Although Xiao Bai was thinking like this in his heart, he still smiled and asked, "Are you really planning to do this?" Zhu Qi said, "I can't solve this difficulty without doing this." Xiao Bai said, "Aren't you afraid that your father will be angry?" Zhu Qi said, "I don't think it will be to this extent. I can still come back after I leave." Xiao Bai said, "Aren't you afraid that there will be family turmoil?" Zhu Qi said, "No, Qi Wan can support herself, live independently, and do her own thing, so she can avoid all conflicts." Xiao Bai, after probing Zhu Qi's tone, knew that it was useless to dissuade him, so he still smiled and said, "You young people are really willful, ignoring others and only thinking about yourselves." Zhu Qi said, "This kind of thing doesn't cause much loss to the family, especially my father, who has always lived separately from me. We only see each other every few days, and there is not much affection between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. I think it will be fine if I do this. Although they may not agree at first, it won't matter later! However, I always hope that the old man can understand my difficulties and agree to me marrying Qi Wan. That would be great. And my father trusts Uncle the most. As long as Uncle speaks well, I don't think it will be unsuccessful." Xiao Bai said, "I will definitely talk to him for you." Zhu Qi said, "If this matter is successful, Qi Wan and I will come together to ask you to be our witness."

### Prison Paradise

— Copper Camel

"Ladies and gentlemen," the warden said, "we welcome you to this place and hope you enjoy your stay with us. As you know, this is not an ordinary prison. The guards are kind, the food is excellent, and the rooms are comfortable with no bars on the windows. You are free to wander inside and outside the prison as you please. If you want to escape, no one will stop you. But there is one very severe penalty—you will not be allowed to re-enter this prison."

The above is the welcome speech of the warden of Britain's newest modern prison to new inmates. This prison without iron bars is called Tortworth Court, located in Falfield, Gloucestershire, covering 400 acres.

Since the Labour Party came to power, there has been a preliminary experiment with prisons, trying to replace punishment with kindness to "cure" criminals. Tortworth Court houses 260 inmates. The buildings include a fortress-shaped central building and numerous military huts. In fact, it is a military camp, once stationed by the US military during the war, and the equipment inside is entirely the same as when the US military was stationed.

The warden calls the inmates "boys." The boys work eight hours a day. The rest of the time and on Sundays, they can choose their own entertainment. Indoor games include billiards and table tennis. Outdoors, there is a swimming pool, a football field, and a small fishing lake.

The prison is very democratic. The first thing the inmates need to know is that they do not need to call the guards "Sir." This is one of the factors in building the self-esteem of these young people.

When relatives visit, the inmates greet them in a pleasantly furnished room. A plainclothes guard sits in the distance; he can see the visitors and the criminals, but he is out of earshot.

The food is very good every day. One inmate said, "The meals are like banquets; I have never tasted such cooking. They even peel the potatoes—this has never happened in other prisons. And there are guards clearing the dining room and washing the dishes."

The inmates include murderers, burglars, embezzlers, arsonists, rapists, and other criminals. They are all first-time offenders. Before being allowed into Tortworth Court, each person has been tested by experts and deemed capable of rehabilitation before being admitted.

One day, an accident happened. Seven people escaped—that is, because the prison had no iron bars and no barbed wire fences, they simply ran away and never returned. They were later captured and placed in another prison. All seven requested to be sent back to Tortworth Court, and everyone expressed regret for rashly leaving this happy place. But they could never return; the most unforgivable crime is escape.

Stockholm also has a similar modern prison, built in a beautiful rural area. Every inmate has a private room, like an apartment. London Mirror editor Mr. Bowden visited and saw a vase of flowers in one inmate's room. Famous paintings hung on the walls, bookshelves were full of books, and there was a typewriter on the desk. Whenever he was free, he would sit at the desk and write poetry.

In another room, a sailor was lying in bed reading a book, with an oil painting he had painted himself hanging on the wall. It turned out that there was a guard in the prison who was good at painting, and the sailor learned from him. The sailor's room had a violin, and there were recent newspapers on the desk.

Each room has its own wireless, the windows are open, and there are no iron bars.

This kind of "hotel-style detention" is very successful. This year, more than half of the inmates in Sweden are fortunate enough to be detained in this kind of open prison room.

According to Mr. Bowden's opinion, modern prisons have no emotional effect. The leaders are truly taking on the important task of saving human lives. The inmates living inside only have sorrow, not anger. They feel that they are being treated as human beings!

### No Need to Enter for Timekeeping

— Ze Shi

The hanging clock at home seems to be running slower every day, so whenever friends come to chat, the child will ask him, "Uncle Ji, what time is your watch? Let us compare ours with yours." I don't have many friends, and only three or five people visit often. Fortunately, they each have a watch, so the child won't be "embarrassed." But the result of the comparison is not very satisfactory. For example, three friends came last night, and the child compared the time three times in a row, but the more he compared, the more inaccurate it became, which was the same as not comparing at all. Because when comparing with the first friend, ours was ten minutes slow. Less than half an hour after adjusting it, the second friend came, and when we compared again, ours was still five minutes slow, so we adjusted it forward again. A quarter of an hour later, the third friend came, and when we compared, ours was exactly a quarter of an hour fast. The child said that the third uncle's watch must be running slow, so he refused to adjust it back. I never cared about the accuracy of the watch, so I told him not to make comparing the time a priority, but he refused to obey. Now that I see him comparing it to the point where he doesn't know what's right, I say, "What's the use of comparing? Comparing back and forth is the same as not comparing at all! I will never allow you to compare again."

How could the child be convinced? He said, "How can we not compare? If the watch is inaccurate, how can we keep time?"

I: Keep what time?

Child: We have to keep time for everything. We have to keep time for going to school, and you have to keep time for going to work.

I: It's true that we have to keep time for going to school, but why do we have to adjust the watch? If ours is slower than the one at your school, the actual mistake might be at your school, because maybe it's running fast. But the school always bases its time on the school's time, so you can just look at our watch as being a little faster, for example, if it's eight o'clock, you can see it as eight fifteen or thirty, and so on. As for my work, even though your mom laughs at me when I get up and always says, "Our watch is slow, get up quickly, get up quickly," I have never been late or had my salary deducted, because I always set our watch to be a quarter of an hour slow, for example, if it's clearly seven o'clock, I only see it as six forty-five.

Child: Then wouldn't you be even later for work!

I: Definitely not.

Child: Liar! Mom, Dad is lying!

I: I'm not lying to you. You don't know that the watch at our office is a quarter of an hour slower than the one at home.

Child: Then why did you go upstairs to Zhao's house to compare the time last Sunday when Uncle Zeng got married at two o'clock in the afternoon?

I: Yes, you know that the time of the wedding must be extremely accurate, because it's a so-called auspicious day and time, and you can't miss a minute or a moment. And you always say that the watch at home is slow, I was afraid it would really be slow and I would be late for the ceremony, which would be disrespectful to my friends, so I specifically compared it with Zhao's watch, which you always say is the most accurate.

Child: That shows that we have to

I: Definitely not "shows." When I arrived at the wedding hall of Uncle Zeng, there was no clock on the wall. The wedding hall was deserted. I thought it was already past the time, and I was about to turn around and leave when I suddenly saw someone delivering congratulatory banners, someone delivering flower baskets, and people dressed neatly like wedding guests arriving. I thought maybe it was still early, so I sat down again. Once I sat down, I sat for who knows how long. I couldn't help but ask a friend to compare the time on his watch. It was already four o'clock. Looking at another person's watch, it was still five minutes to four. I simply looked at a few more, and some said five minutes past four, some said eleven minutes past four, some said a quarter of an hour to four, and some even said a quarter to one. But in short, the two o'clock that the host said had already passed a lot, and the wedding had not yet begun. You think that people who are going to be happily married for a hundred years can't even keep time accurately for an auspicious day and time, so why should we care about other trivial matters?

Child: Then Uncle Hu invited you to dinner at exactly seven o'clock this evening, so you don't have to keep time.

I: Of course not.

Child: Then what if they've already eaten?

I: If you go, then you won't miss the meal if you go right after lunch.

Child: Then you can go at twelve o'clock at night.

I: Of course not. But I told him that what he said about exactly seven o'clock was a joke. First, whose watch are we using as the standard? If we use his, then the host is too inconsiderate of the guests. If we use the guests', then at least nine out of ten guests will have different times. Moreover, the amount of effort everyone puts into getting there is uncertain, and even those who clearly arrive early may have temporary problems with their vehicles, so would it be a failure to keep time if they were delayed? Therefore, I say that the invitation card should write "around seven o'clock," and there's no need for a "precise" seven o'clock. And in reality, when inviting people to dinner, it's said to start between seven and eight o'clock at the earliest, because there are always some guests who are busy attending the banquet, of course, some are genuine and some are fake, and they all have to arrive. Let me tell you a story: Father Zhang once invited a guest, setting the time at six thirty in the afternoon, but the guest didn't arrive until eight o'clock. He was angry, so he invited him again and set it for eight o'clock, but the guest didn't arrive until almost nine o'clock. So he simply invited him again and set it for nine o'clock, and the guest didn't arrive until around nine thirty. The last time, he set it for eleven thirty at night. This guest called and asked why it was so late. Father Zhang said that every time I invite you, you are always late, so I simply started at midnight and drank until dawn. That guest was never late after that, but how many people are like Father Zhang?

Child: Then what about catching a train?

I: Nine out of ten people who catch trains don't have watches and haven't missed the train, because everyone always arrives at the station one or two hours early. Those who have watches also always go early, even if their watch is an hour faster than the rest of the world. Because if the train station's watch suddenly moves forward an hour and the train leaves, can you argue based on that watch?

Child: What if you're summoned by your boss?

I: That's the same as catching a train. In short, it doesn't matter to keep time. Therefore, it doesn't matter whose watch is fast and whose watch is slow.
