### Selection of Grand Justices and Examination Committee Members: The Control Yuan's Heated Review, Voting Possible Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] To exercise its power of consent over the President's nominations for Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and members of the Examination Yuan, the Control Yuan held plenary review committees both in the morning and afternoon of the 12th. Members extensively expressed their opinions, and a decision was made to continue the meeting at 9 AM on the 13th to continue the review. It is rumored that separate reviews may be conducted on the 13th. If all goes smoothly, a vote on consent may be held in the afternoon of the 13th. It has been learned that the focus of the heated discussions at today's meeting, chaired by Zhao Shou-xuan in the morning and Liang Shang-dong in the afternoon, was the uneven distribution by region. For example, no one was selected from frontier provinces such as Ningxia and Qinghai, while there were many from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Most members believed that regional allocation was the most important factor, so the discussion lasted a long time without a conclusion. Furthermore, the Control Yuan Secretariat has completed preparations for the exercise of the power of consent, such as printing the consent ballots.

### Control Yuan Members Donate One Day's Income to Comfort Generals and Soldiers in the Central Plains

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Control Yuan held a general meeting at 9:50 AM on the 12th, chaired by President Yu. He raised the question of whether to resume the session immediately and sought opinions. Some people pointed out that the Organic Law of the Administrative Commissioner's Office had not yet been passed, while the former Control Department of the National Government was still exercising its functions. They questioned whether there would be conflicts and requested that the session be resumed immediately. Cao De-xuan stated that it was not necessary to raise it for discussion and that the session should be resumed immediately. This was passed without dissent. Subsequently, the 17th meeting began at 10:00 AM sharp. In addition to the Secretariat reading the minutes of the 16th meeting and the letters and telegrams of leave requests from members, the Presidential Office's reply regarding the results of convening the presidents of the Legislative, Control, and Judicial Yuans to discuss the legal proposals submitted by the Control Yuan was also read. After the reporting items were completed, President Yu proposed a temporary motion by Cao De-xuan and 56 others: "With the great victory in the Central Plains war, celebrations are being held everywhere. The members of this Yuan should also express our support. In addition to sending a telegram of condolences, we should also donate one or three days' income to present to the generals and soldiers fighting bandits on the front lines to express our respect."

### The President Holds a Tea Party to Host All Control Yuan Members

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The President held a tea party in the auditorium of the Presidential Palace at 6 PM on the 12th to host all Control Yuan members. The President delivered a speech, explaining two points: (1) Regarding the issue of the Control Yuan's right of proposal, if the Legislative Yuan proposes a solution, there would be many obstacles. Therefore, it is better to follow the legal path and have the Grand Justices interpret it. (2) The selection of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has many practical difficulties regarding regional issues, but efforts will be made to remedy this in the future, and he hopes that all members will understand. After the President's speech, Control Yuan member Liang Shang-dong immediately stood up and gave a speech. Regarding the issue of the President's proposed right of proposal, he believed that it was no longer necessary to discuss it. However, the three fundamental laws of the Control Yuan, namely the Control Law, the Organizational Law of Various Committees, and the Organizational Law of the Control Yuan's Administrative Commissioner's Office, are the basis for the Control Yuan to perform its duties. If these three bills cannot be passed before the Legislative Yuan adjourns, the work of the Control Yuan will inevitably be hindered. Therefore, he hoped that the President could find a way to ask the Legislative Yuan to expedite the legislative process. Finally, the President stated that he could find a way to solve the problem, and the tea party adjourned at 6:30 PM.

This case will be presented to the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 13th for reporting, so as to make a quick decision.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Legislative Yuan continued to hold group review meetings throughout the day on the 12th.

Each group worked with maximum efficiency to rush to calculate the budget figures. By the evening, except for the fifth group regarding the budgets of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Resources Commission, which still had some details to be decided, the other six groups had largely completed the preliminary review of the budgets of the various government departments under their responsibility as scheduled and were preparing to draft reports. The conveners of the Budget Committee will meet on the 13th to study various technical issues. The fifth group will also reconvene in the afternoon of the 13th to continue its internal review work. If the 19th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 13th cannot be completed before noon, the group will decide to hold a meeting in the evening, ensuring that it completes its unfinished tasks on the same day. This will prevent the overall meeting of the Budget Committee from being delayed on the morning of the 14th and allow the national general budget proposal to smoothly enter the comprehensive review stage.

### Legislators from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to Report and Participate Immediately, Constitutional Government Maintains the Spirit of Cooperation Among the Three Parties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Legislators from the Democratic Socialist Party have decided to come to the meeting on the 13th to report and participate in the Legislative Yuan, which is a good manifestation of the recent progress in the spirit of cooperation among the three parties. Lei Zhen, who is responsible for maintaining contact with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on behalf of the Kuomintang, told reporters on the 12th: Regarding the issue of the Democratic Socialist Party attending the Legislative Yuan, the Democratic Socialist Party originally requested that the Kuomintang make concessions for five seats recently, so that the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party who had already been elected could attend the Legislative Yuan meeting before the adjournment. However, the work of persuading them to concede was very difficult. Now, after the Kuomintang persuaded them to concede amidst extreme difficulties, an agreement is gradually being reached, but it has not yet been announced. The legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party, in light of the difficulty of national affairs, have decided not to wait for the announcement of the five seats and will attend the Legislative Yuan on the 13th to fulfill the original intention of sincere cooperation. We deeply admire and welcome the spirit of the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party who put national affairs first, and sincerely hope that the legislators of the Youth Party can also attend the Legislative Yuan recently.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Legislative Yuan news: Legislative members of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zhou Shu-sheng, Zhang Ting-zan, Yu Shao-xian, Tang Ru-mei, Hu De-yuan, Wang Han-sheng, Xiao Jue-tian, Hu Dao-yuan, Chai Chun-lin, Xie Zi-qing, Ji Zu-qian, Wang Shi-xian, Sun Ji-xu, Wang Sheng-ting, Li Tian-lin (female), Wang Xi-bin, Li Yu-hua, Xu Fu-lin, and others, a total of 18 people, are scheduled to take the express train from Shanghai to Nanjing on the night of the 12th and arrive on the morning of the 13th. The Legislative Yuan has sent Hou Zhong-yi, head of the Liaison Section, to the station to meet them. After the legislators get off the train, they will go directly to the Legislative Yuan to report, and then attend the 19th meeting of the Legislative Yuan. The General Affairs Section of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has prepared the badges, manuals, documents, and public funds to be received by each member, so that they can be sent immediately after the reporting procedures are completed.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Zhou Zhen recently explained the fact that the Kuomintang has made concessions to legislators in detail and wrote a letter to members of the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei's letter was handed over to Sun Ya-fu of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 12th and sent to Shanghai by special messenger on the night of the 12th. Some people believe that after the legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party report collectively, the legislators of the Youth Party will follow suit, so the government after the implementation of the Constitution will continue to maintain the spirit of cooperation among the three parties without slackening.

[Our Report] The spokesman of the Youth Party stated last night that the party headquarters had notified the elected legislators in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places to report to the Legislative Yuan and attend meetings starting today. It is reported that there are a total of five elected legislators from the Youth Party. When Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen negotiated in Shanghai last month, there was a proposal for the Kuomintang to concede five to ten seats to increase the number of legislators from the Youth Party. This matter is currently being seriously negotiated within the Kuomintang. The Youth Party, on the other hand, claimed that it required the original number of 41 seats, which would be made up by the Kuomintang legislators conceding in installments within three months.

### Kuomintang Central Memorial Week, Minister He Reports on Military Affairs, Soldiers' Pay, Subsidiary Fodder Expenses, etc. Will Be Reasonably Adjusted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Minister He Yingqin attended the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week on the 12th and reported on the recent situation of military affairs. In his report, He first put forward several important items that the Ministry of National Defense has recently handled:

(1) Division of Personnel Authority and Responsibility. In order to meet the requirements of suppressing rebellion militarily, the central government has decided to divide the personnel of military officers into three levels: general, colonel, and lieutenant. The personnel of generals are managed by the Ministry of National Defense, the personnel of colonels are managed by the four general headquarters of the army, navy, air force, and logistics, and the personnel of lieutenants are managed by the military (reorganized division) and equivalent units. Each Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Military Control Area is responsible for the management of the personnel of colonels in the directly affiliated units, with reference to the general headquarters of each military service. All of the above-mentioned personnel management units are required to have an organization of a personnel evaluation committee. All personnel appointments, removals, transfers, merits, demerits, rewards, and punishments must first be publicly evaluated by the evaluation committee before being submitted to the principal officials of each level of personnel management for review and issuance. Regarding the standards for selection and promotion, it has been stipulated that (1) the front line shall be based on military exploits, (2) the rear shall be based on the results of reorganization and training (including training, management, hygiene, command, and all military administration), and (3) institutions and schools shall be based on service performance.

(2) Reasonable Adjustment of Soldiers' Pay, Subsidiary Fodder Expenses, and Public Miscellaneous Expenses. At present, the morale of the troops is low, and military discipline is poor, mainly because the officers and soldiers cannot be adequately fed and clothed. Moreover, because public miscellaneous expenses are insufficient, the troops often make up for it with shortages, which has a significant impact on combat effectiveness. In order to meet the needs of the facts and under the principle of not excessively increasing the burden on the national treasury, a method of adjustment has been formulated. A reasonable adjustment can be made to soldiers' pay, subsidiary fodder expenses, and public miscellaneous expenses.

He also reported that the recent war situation in various battlefields was very auspicious.

### Minister Wang Reports on Prices, Plans to Implement Price Stabilization Plan Immediately

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Ministry of Finance held a monthly meeting in the auditorium of the ministry at 10:00 AM on the 12th. Hundreds of ministry colleagues attended.

Wang first reported on his work since taking office as Minister of Finance, the first of which was to be busy with the preparation of the general budget for the second half of the year, and the second was to deal with the increasingly severe price problem. The general budget has now been prepared and is being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. The price problem has also been worked out by Premier Weng and himself and relevant ministries to formulate practical and effective measures, which will soon be implemented (see separate article). He then encouraged his colleagues to work on time, work hard, and hope that everyone will provide opinions on the current financial problems and related ministry affairs based on their research. He himself decided to carefully review them and start reading the opinions submitted by his colleagues after getting up at 5:30 AM every day. After Wang's report, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, reported on the work of the department. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu reported at the monthly meeting of the ministry on the morning of the 12th that although the current price increase is more worrying, Premier Weng and himself and relevant ministries have formulated a plan to stabilize prices. He believed that after the implementation, the rising trend can be curbed. Wang said in a very firm tone that he believed that there was absolutely a way to solve the price problem. As for the content of the proposed method and when it will begin to be implemented, Wang did not reveal it, but Wang once said that he absolutely believed that "Heaven never seals off all paths for man."

### Third Quarter Aid to China Allocation Reaches 60-70 Million USD, Cotton to be Primary Import

[United Press Washington, 11th Dispatch] Officials from the China Aid Administration stated on the 11th that the third-quarter allocation for China is likely to reach 60 to 70 million USD, which is more than double the first quarter.

They said this amount could be realized, and the exports to China in July, August, and September would be the highest. At that time, the China Aid Administration will allocate more than half of the first year's aid funds to China.

They stated that the exact amount is not yet known because some goods are available while others have not been determined. In general, the purpose of the China Aid Administration is to transport several major goods to China: first is cotton, second is oil, third is fertilizer, and fourth are machine parts.

[Local News] Yan Jia-gan, a member of the American Aid Utilization Committee, told reporters on the 12th that whether the 60 million USD special American aid fund for construction will be reduced, and how the funds will be allocated, will be finally decided in mid-August after Stillman and others complete their investigation and submit a report to Washington.

American aid materials for general economic recovery will be shipped to China in large quantities starting in August. Most of the proceeds from the sale of these materials will be frozen to contract the currency, but a portion will still be allocated for other expenses. The use of these funds is expected to be discussed at a meeting this Thursday. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning.

Editorial

### The Responsibility of Journalists

Recently, the Legislative Yuan held several discussions on military, diplomatic, and financial secrets, which were partially or completely leaked by several newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai. This not only caused a great uproar in the Legislative Yuan but also sparked a debate in the public opinion regarding the scope of "freedom of the press." Standing in the position of journalists, we naturally feel particularly interested in this issue that concerns us directly.

Looking at the content of newspapers, there are news reports, opinionated commentary, advertisements that assist commodity exchange, and columns of text that satisfy readers' desire for knowledge. Its relationship with social life is indeed very close. Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, said, "Newspapers are the best tool to enlighten the people, helping them understand things and become a complete member of society." President Wilson also said, "Newspapers are the spiritual food of the nation." William, an American expert in journalism education, even regards newspapers as one of the three major forces promoting the progress of modern civilization. Chinese scholars and experts also emphasize the great responsibility of newspapers to society. Liang Qichao discussed the responsibility of newspapers, saying: "Newspapers are the foundation of politics and the teacher of teachers." Zhang Jiqiang, a journalist of the era, also said about the nature of newspapers: "On one hand, it should be operated as a commercial business, and on the other hand, it should bear the responsibility of actively supporting and advocating for the country and society."

Although China's newspaper industry is formally behind Europe and the United States, it was indeed able to fulfill its responsibility to the country and society during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Whether it was a private newspaper or a party-run newspaper, it was able to do its best to promote national policy and "certain victory in the War of Resistance" under a common belief of "nation first, country first." The result of Chinese journalists devoting themselves to serving the country through writing for eight years has not only gained the trust and respect of the people but also won international honors. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China's newspaper industry faced two major crises: one is an external crisis. Because the domestic war has continued, society is unstable, people's livelihood is declining, and prices are soaring, newspapers across the country are feeling the panic of material poverty. Many newspapers have even automatically ceased publication because they cannot survive. The second is an internal crisis. Because Chinese journalists have been stimulated by international trends, they are all obsessed with "freedom of the press," while often ignoring the "responsibility of the press." Because in the eyes of some journalists, they fully believe that freedom of the press is no different from allowing us journalists to break through barriers and do whatever we want. Therefore, whether in news reporting or in speech, they inevitably step out of the norm, and even abandon the nation's stance. The disputes in the press have emerged endlessly in the past three years, and the problems in the press in the future may still be on the rise, which is not necessarily caused by this internal crisis.

In fact, there is no incomprehensible or mysterious theory about freedom of the press. From its beginning, during World War II, enlightened people in various countries believed that if they wanted to achieve world peace after the war, and hoped it could be maintained for a long time, they must seek international freedom of the press. On one hand, it can promote understanding and cooperation among the people of various countries, and on the other hand, prevent the kind of secret diplomacy in the past from recurring in the future. At the same time, they also believed that if they want to maintain the democratic system in various countries, they must obtain domestic freedom of speech. Without criticism, there is no democracy. Theoretically speaking, this freedom of the press movement is a major innovation movement in the world's newspaper industry. But what is freedom of the press? Because of the short time, there has been no accurate explanation. Therefore, it has been abused by some people, and under the smoke screen of freedom of the press, they have unknowingly committed many sins. In March and April this year, the International Conference on Freedom of the Press was held in Geneva. Many resolutions were passed on freedom of the press. The most important one is the question of whether freedom of the press has a scope. It has been successfully adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and established as a clause on freedom of the press. It stipulates that everyone has freedom of thought and speech, and these freedoms are part of human rights, and should not be interfered with by the government, but it also stipulates that freedom of the press must have its responsibilities and obligations, and must not exceed the following eight restrictions, otherwise it should be subject to legal sanctions. These eight restrictions are: (1) matters relating to national security interests that must be kept confidential; (2) speech inciting people to overthrow the government organization by violence; (3) speech inciting people to commit crimes; (4) speech corrupting morality; (5) speech undermining the fair trial of justice; (6) infringing copyright or copyright; (7) speech defaming the reputation of others; (8) systematic reports of false or distorted facts that slander friendship between countries or between people.

This clause on freedom of the press should be accepted by all people in the world who strive for human rights, love freedom, and uphold democracy. Here, we can not only understand the true meaning of freedom of the press, but also believe that although our current publishing law needs to be revised, it still has some value to be retained in principle. For example, Chapter 4, Restrictions on matters published, except for the phrase "intention to undermine the Chinese Nationalist Party" in the first item of Article 21, which may not be applicable to today's constitutional rule, the rest of the articles are generally applicable. It is heard that the government authorities will also revise this article. But recently, some people have advocated abolishing this publishing law, which is either "with ulterior motives," or theoretically distorts freedom of the press.

In short, as the ancients said, "One word can make a country prosper, and one word can ruin a country." Isn't it the same now? The reporter's pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the country and the safety of the world, but also the fate of mankind is tied to the hands of journalists. We recall that the reason why Chinese journalists were able to fulfill their responsibilities during the War of Resistance Against Japan, in addition to having a common belief of "nation first, country first," the National Political Council also formulated a wartime news policy, taking the program for the War of Resistance and National Construction as the standard, and determining five principles for news reporting, so that journalists across the country, whether writing commentary or reporting news, had a common rule to follow, so that they could achieve the goal of "concentration of will and concentration of strength." Now that we are still in the period of suppression of rebellions and national construction, there are many difficulties, and it is even more important to rely on the efforts of our journalists to fulfill our responsibility to the country and society within the scope of simultaneously emphasizing freedom of the press and responsibility of the press. The staff of this newspaper are willing to encourage each other with colleagues across the country!

### Great Construction Regrettably Overlooked Hainan Electric Power Plant in Critical Condition; Scale Second Only to Xiaofengman and Sun Moon Lake; Trapped in Bandit Areas, Eagerly Awaiting Government Relief

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Today, I am reporting to the people of the country a great construction that has been overlooked. This construction is deeply and significantly related to our country's economy and national defense. However, it is currently being abandoned like worn-out shoes, which is regrettable. What is this construction? It is the Hainan Electric Power Plant in Guangdong Province. The scale of this plant is unmatched in water power generation in various provinces, except for Xiaofengman in Northeast China and Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan. After the Japanese occupied Hainan in the 29th year, because the island did not produce coal and petroleum, there was almost no other way for industrial power except for water power generation. Therefore, they established the Dongfang Hydroelectric Power Plant. After the Japanese surrendered in the 34th year, it was managed by the National Resources Commission and renamed the Hainan Electric Power Plant. The plant is located on the south bank of the Xinbei Dagang River in Dongfang Market, Ledong County. The river suddenly becomes a large bend at this point, and the river bank is steep, tens of meters high. The Japanese took advantage of the terrain to build dams and dig channels upstream of the waterfall to divert water for power generation. The dam is 427.65 meters long and 4.5 meters high. The diversion channel is a trapezoidal open channel, 3 meters deep, 6 meters wide, and 1,170.77 meters long, with a maximum capacity of 26 cubic meters per second. The effective capacity of the water tank is 3,000 cubic meters. The water pipe introduces water from the water tank into the power plant to drive the generator. The pipe is a soft steel pole with an inner diameter of 2.1 meters and a length of 62.24 meters. As for the motor equipment, there is a 7,000 kW vertical shaft single-input single-flow reaction hydraulic turbine, and a 7,000 (KVA) 11,000 volt 80-cycle three-phase synchronous AC generator directly connected to the hydraulic turbine. The voltage generated by the plant is 11,000 volts, which is increased to 66,000 volts through a transformer and sent into the transmission line, from the plant directly to the Huishui area, and then divided into southwest and north directions. One line passes through the Shilu Mine, and the other goes to Beili Basuo Port, with a total length of 80 kilometers. The plant has two substations, one located in the Shilu Mine in Baisha County, with four transformers, each with a capacity of 1,000 (KVA), and one located in Basuo Port in Ganen County, with four transformers, each with a capacity of 6,000 (KVA). According to the Japanese equipment and plan, the power generated by the plant, in addition to providing electricity for mines, farmland, and factories, is more than enough to supply lighting for the entire island. However, after the takeover, the communist bandits ravaged the area, and many takeover employees and engineers died. The 80-kilometer transmission line was destroyed from time to time. As of September last year, the transmission line had been completely destroyed. Although the plant's motors still generate electricity day and night, they are no longer able to transmit electricity to Beili and other places. The plant is now trapped in the core of the bandit area, surrounded on all sides. Since the power outage, not only all equipment and various materials cannot be transported elsewhere, but also the employees cannot enter or leave. Wages and rations are delivered every half a month by the garrison of the Beili Brigade. If the authorities do not take immediate action, the plant may not be preserved. The National Resources Commission has decided to end this original driving force for the electrification of Hainan. If it is realized, then the "Development of Hainan Island" currently touted by officials is simply deceiving. In a few years, Hainan Island may degenerate to a barren state before the War of Resistance.

### Chongqing Heavy Rain Causes Sudden Rise in River Water, Anhui Water Level is Far From the Warning Line and Will Not Cause Disaster, No Danger Occurs in Major Production Areas Along the River

According to the conversation, the Yangtze River water level in Anhui is still one meter lower than the highest water level in the 20th year, and there are still two meters from the top of the embankment. So far, the three main production areas along the river in Anhui, the Ma Hua Chang in Susong Wangjiang, the Guangji Dam in Tongcheng Huaining, and the Huangsi Beach in Wuwei, have not shown any dangerous situation. The water conservancy department has allocated materials for flood relief, such as more than 70,000 sacks, which have been distributed early in case of emergency. If the upstream does not rise and the sky has cleared, Anhui will not suffer a disaster. However, due to the rain, the breach of the Wanxingwei dike in Guichi, which was released into the river last winter, has not been opened, resulting in the submergence of 3,000 mu. The mountain flood in Yufengwei in Dongliu submerged 4,000 mu. Sheng will also inspect the Anhui River with the water conservancy department's water survey boat, which will depart from Nanjing immediately.

### Armed "Spy Terrorist Groups" Infiltrate Southern Border, All Captured, CCP Responds to Cominform Condemnation of Tito

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 11th] The Ministry of Internal Affairs announced today that the government has captured the number one war criminal it has been hunting for a long time, the Fascist party leader Bevric, who has been actively engaged in anti-Tito activities abroad in the past year. He sent 19 armed "spy terrorist groups," totaling 95 people, to infiltrate Yugoslavia, but they were detected and captured one by one by the police. Bevric's assistant Kavran was also among them.

They were all carrying small arms and radios and were acting on the orders of the so-called "Croatian National Committee," with the aim of creating terror and spying for foreign intelligence agencies. The official announcement of this matter is a warning to all countries participating in the Cominform who are attempting to send personnel into the country to overthrow the Tito government through conspiracy.

CCP Broadcast

[United Press, San Francisco, 11th] According to a broadcast from a CCP radio station in northern Shanxi picked up here on the 11th, Yugoslavia was condemned as a traitor to Marxism, and it was resolved to stand in line with the Cominform. The radio station said that the CCP's resolution "fully agrees" with the Cominform's resolution, rejecting the Tito regime. This is the responsibility that the Communist International should take to defend Marxism-Leninism and is an act of world peace and democracy, protecting the Yugoslav people from the aggression and欺侮humiliation of American capitalism. The resolution assesses Tito's actions as "rebellious and erroneous," which is vastly different from Marxism-Leninism and the difference between socialism and capitalism. The CCP hopes that the internationalists of the Yugoslav Communist Party will rise up and correct the mistakes of the Tito group. The broadcast also said that the international communist movement has also had similar situations within the CCP, such as the purging of Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao.

### South Korean Assembly Approves Constitution, New Government to be Established Next Month, Will Request UN Recognition

[Associated Press, Seoul, 12th] The South Korean Constituent Assembly has approved the first democratic constitution, and the new government is expected to be established on August 15th, the third anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 12th] The Korean Assembly adjourned today after passing the draft constitution in its third reading by a vote of 162 to 1, and will reconvene on the 14th to discuss the government organization law. The passage of the constitution represents the first step in the establishment of an independent Korean national government, which will accept the authority of the U.S. military government in South Korea.

It is reported that the main points of the constitution are based on the constitution of our country: (1) Korea is named the Republic of Korea, or the Republic of Korea; (2) The Republic considers wars of aggression to be inappropriate actions; (3) The status of foreigners in Korea will be guaranteed within the scope of international treaties; (4) The president has a four-year term and has extensive administrative powers, including the appointment of cabinet members and ministers; (5) The representatives of the unicameral legislature have a five-year term; (6) Judicial independence; (7) Local autonomy; (8) The government or public operates important enterprises and resources; (9) Equality of men and women in marriage; (10) Land to the tiller.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 11th, Associated Press] The South Korean Assembly formally passed the constitution and resolved to begin organizing a democratic government on the 14th. The new government will gradually take over the responsibilities currently borne by the U.S. military occupation authorities in South Korea. The communist puppets in Soviet-occupied North Korea yesterday announced that their Soviet-style constitution had come into effect and that general elections in North Korea would be held on August 25th. The communists claim that this move is aimed at freeing Korea from foreign exploitation. Syngman Rhee, who will be the first president of South Korea, said that the South Korean Assembly would not consider the recent actions of the communists. He said: "We will do our best to cooperate with the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union has any good plans to propose, we are willing to have them go through the U.S. State Department and the United Nations at Lake Success." South Korea will ask the United Nations delegation to Korea to assist the Korean government in taking over the responsibilities of the U.S. occupation authorities. Rhee's wish is for the United Nations General Assembly to be held in Paris in September to unconditionally recognize the South Korean government. The United Nations must choose between the government established by the United States and the government established in North Korea after the elections on August 25th.

Due to space constraints today, the special feature on the Cominform will be continued tomorrow.

### U.S. Democratic Party Platform to be Submitted to the Convention Today, Convention Chairman Denounces Republican Party for Eight Sins

[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] The drafters of the Democratic Party platform completed the "Roosevelt-Truman" draft platform on the 12th, emphasizing "our glorious achievements in the past sixteen years." The drafters, led by Senator Meyers, worked all night and did not adjourn until 3:30 AM on the 12th, remaining silent about the specific items in the platform.

Meyers said: "This platform states the purpose of our struggle in the past sixteen years, but I cannot reveal the content because the draft is only a suggestion and the Convention has the right to dissect it." When asked how the drafting committee dealt with the thorny issues of national rights, Pakistan, and the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, Meyers did not answer. These issues are likely to cause fierce debate at the Convention. Although Meyers said that the platform is the "Roosevelt-Truman" platform, the Southern representatives were not satisfied. They wanted to review the human rights portion of it before deciding whether to support Truman or withdraw from the Convention. Meyers said that he would submit the platform to the full committee for approval on the morning of the 13th and then submit it to the full representative convention on the afternoon of the same day.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] Democratic National Convention Chairman McGrath delivered a speech welcoming the Democratic delegates on the 12th, denouncing the Republican Party for eight sins. He called the Republican-controlled 80th Congress "forever memorable, because its harm is far greater than its meager successes, and its record is the most reactionary and regressive in our history." Therefore, to avoid a third world war and seek domestic prosperity, the "experienced" leadership of the Democratic Party is essential.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 12th] The Democratic Party's anti-Truman movement in California has ended. James, son of former President Roosevelt, and 48 other delegates have announced that they will support Truman's nomination, while 13 others have not yet decided.

### Analysis of Price Increase Factors by Leaders from All Sectors: Speaker Pan States There Should be a Comprehensive Control Plan and Advocates for Establishing a National Institution

[Our Own Report] The series of fierce price increases in recent months has made it almost impossible for everyone to breathe. In recent weeks, prices have been increasing rapidly every day, which is truly shocking and makes everyone live in constant anxiety. In the end, can this vicious cycle of currency inflation and price increases still be curbed? Can price fluctuations still be stabilized? Our reporter specifically and widely interviewed leaders from all sectors and industry leaders in this city, and summarized their opinions below, hoping to provide an accurate and effective diagnosis of the current price surge.

City Council Speaker Pan analyzed that there are three reasons for the current high prices: (1) Currency inflation is an undeniable fact. However, if we use the pre-war period as a standard, the increase in currency issuance has still not exceeded the rate of price increases. Therefore, the true meaning of so-called currency inflation lies in the shrinking area of currency use and the accelerated circulation speed, which leads to high prices. (2) The general increase in interest rates is also mutually causal with price fluctuations. The business community is affected by high interest rates, which leads to increased costs, and ultimately they have no choice but to increase the prices of their products. (3) Monthly adjustments to the cost of living index also make prices echo each other before and after, creating a mutual cycle. Pan believes that the price problem is a part of the entire economic problem. The central government should urgently establish a national general institution to be responsible for management, and cannot simply allow local governments to handle it alone. Because the management of price matters, if it lacks a comprehensive plan and only starts from trivial matters, it will not only fail to achieve the effect of suppression and stabilization, but will also increase stimulation and create a vicious cycle of one after another. He also cited the results of yesterday's warehouse inspection review meeting, explaining that this method can certainly help to temporarily suppress the price of goods, but if Shanghai strictly inspects warehouses, other goods from other places will not dare to be transported here at all. For example, recently, the news that rice from Jiashan, Jiaxing, and Songjiang areas has been diverted to Wuxi for hoarding. In the future, there is also the possibility that the rice stored in this city will flow to other places. Therefore, the warehouse inspection method seems very appropriate on the surface, but in reality, it may still not be helpful for price stability.

Speaker Pan believes that the government urgently needs to set a complete method to suppress prices and implement it comprehensively, otherwise, limiting it to a local area is just like robbing Peter to pay Paul. For example, on the one hand, it opens up provincial exchange, and on the other hand, it prohibits carrying more than two hundred million in cash into the country. The municipal authorities once talked about inspecting the check stubs of various banks and firms, but it has never been implemented. There was news that the melting and selling of gold bars was being thoroughly investigated, but the truth has not been announced. The central government once planned to investigate the hoarding of rice in Wuxi, but there has been no movement at all. How much did the rice price fluctuate from the opening to the closing of the City Council? But the relevant departments have never been seen to have any practical and effective methods. All of this is enough to prove that the government should first have a method for all measures to stabilize prices, and then seek to gain the trust of the people, so as to achieve the effect of cooperation between superiors and subordinates.

### Securities Exchange: No Need to Close

Regarding the recent rumors that the government will close the Securities Exchange, Pan added that this measure by the government may be considered an emergency measure taken because of the abundance of floating capital, but the excess of floating capital is due to the failure to fully introduce it into the production industry due to security, transportation, and other factors after the increase in currency issuance. He believes that the exchange trading of national bonds and industrial and commercial stocks can indirectly absorb floating capital for the production industry. The circulation of stocks on the market can arouse the investment interest of those with floating capital, and those engaged in production can also use this to absorb floating capital. There is no need to close it. Some people think that operating the exchange is speculative in nature. Even if this statement is correct, this kind of speculation is far more beneficial to people's livelihood than manipulating daily necessities. Therefore, it can be asserted that if the exchange is closed, a large amount of floating capital will inevitably turn to hoarding daily necessities, and the rise in prices will be even more predictable. Pan believes that all methods to deal with prices are easier said than done, it is difficult to implement them, and it is even more difficult to clean up the situation. Therefore, at the beginning of implementation, we must consider the actual consequences of the method in order to be effective.

Punishing Speculation: Should Seek Thoroughness

Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing said that the effective way to suppress prices at present is to use all efforts to crack down on illegal merchants. For example, the authorities will soon implement the inspection of warehouses and punish the leading speculators in various industries. It is hoped that this work can be done thoroughly, and special attention should be paid to not disturb legitimate industry and commerce for a long time in the execution procedures. He believes that only in this way can good merchants play an exemplary role, and unscrupulous merchants will know where to restrain themselves.

Should Reform the Monetary System: Support Industry and Commerce

Liu Jingji, the Standing Director of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, said: To solve the problem of materials, the government should try to reform the monetary system, stabilize the value of the currency, and at the same time, truly try to support industry and commerce, so that floating capital naturally flows to the production path. Otherwise, the endless surge in prices will not only cause disasters to the national economy and people's livelihood, but also Shanghai's legitimate industry and commerce will declare bankruptcy. Liu also said: In my personal opinion, to stabilize prices, we must start from increasing production and materials. To stabilize the value of the currency, we must start from encouraging exports to earn foreign exchange.

Exchange Business: Scope Should be Expanded

Wang Naixu, the Director of the Brokerage Association, believes that the excessive amount of floating capital on the market without a suitable place to go is the biggest factor in rising prices, and the exchange is the most ideal place to collect floating capital. If we want to ease the price increase, we must find ways to expand the scope of the exchange business.

Rice Prices in Production Areas: Should be Suppressed First

Qu Zhenhua, the Standing Director of the Rice Business, said: Limiting rice prices locally makes it easy for production areas and sales areas to form a reverse flow, which affects the source. It seems appropriate to suppress prices from the production area to seek a fundamental solution, while dredging the grain source, reducing freight and costs, strictly prohibiting speculation, and investigating the hoarding of wealthy families are all important measures to treat the symptoms.

### Dumping Policy Deserves Review: To Protect the Lives of the General Poor, We Should Seek to Expand the Types of Rationing

Legislator Xi Yushu said that the price problem is a national problem, and it is interconnected and should be dealt with comprehensively. Before the war, farmers could exchange one dan of rice for two bolts of cloth. Now, high-quality fine cloth has reached 40 million. If rice is sold at the limited price, one dan of rice can only be exchanged for half a bolt of cloth, and the livelihood of farmers will become a problem. Taking coal prices as an example, the Fuel Management Committee pointed out that the reason for the price increase is the high transportation cost, but after the price increase, the transportation cost will inevitably be even higher. In addition, the cost of living index and prices are also mutually causal. All of this shows that all economic factors are closely related. Today's price problem is actually a currency value problem, which is directly related to the government's issuance. In the past 50 days, the black market for daily necessities and gold bills has increased five times. Speculators who disregard social interests are indeed hateful, but the competent authorities still lack a comprehensive policy to stabilize prices. At present, the interest rates stipulated by the Central Bank and the interest on treasury bills are close to 30%. Since the implementation of exchange settlement certificates, although the Central Bank has secretly dumped them, the number of times they have risen is also considerable. All of these are indicators of prices. At the same time, the government's policy of handling and controlling materials is also worth reviewing. The current dumping policy cannot make these materials directly reach the hands of ordinary people, but instead allows middlemen to take advantage of the opportunity. Today's rice rationing system has been implemented effectively, and we should find ways to expand its types so that even if prices fluctuate, the lives of the poor can still be minimally guaranteed.

### To Control Prices: We Must Control Materials

Shui Xiangyun, the Chairman of the General Labor Union, said: To stabilize prices: First, it should be implemented nationwide across the board. Applying pressure in Shanghai alone is useless. (1) We should use economic methods to solve economic problems. The government itself must control materials, so as to cooperate with politics and military affairs to control prices. (2) If there are indeed man-made factors in the price problem, the government should consider "borrowing heads" and "performing surgery," then it must kill a few "tigers" from top to bottom to see. In addition, the government itself should set an example, and civil servants must not do business.

Freeze Issuance: Contract the Currency

Tian Hezheng, the Secretary-General of the Industrial Association, said: In the current situation, everyone has no confidence in the legal currency. As soon as they get it, they immediately use it up. This increases the turnover rate of the currency and promotes the cyclical rise in prices. Therefore, the government should quickly win back the hearts of the people. First, it should freeze issuance, and second, use US aid to dump materials to contract the currency. As for checking warehouses and borrowing heads, these are not fundamental solutions.

### Pan Shihao Hopes for US Aid

Pan Shihao, a leader in the copying industry, advocated that the Securities Exchange should resume delivery to allow floating capital to go there. He also advocated that the rate and trend of currency flowing to the military for the war effort be tracked and that the government monitor the velocity and direction of the returning flows of these funds into material goods and to gauge the demand for materials. Pan also said: US aid is coming soon, and the war situation in the Central Plains is also improving. If public utilities and state-owned enterprises can be patient, and the cyclical stimulation of the cost of living index and commodity prices can be eased, the price surge can be reduced.

### Opinions of British Business Leaders

Arnold, the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, said: Generally speaking, to control domestic prices below the world price level, I personally believe that it is not effective. For example, taking the rationed rice price as an example, calculated according to the black market exchange rate, it is only equivalent to one-quarter of the world rice price level. Even at the official exchange rate, it is only equivalent to half of the world rice price level. Ignoring these facts, everything is in vain. The rationing system is reasonable, but the food subsidy system is useless and will lead to abuses because the government cannot balance the budget. At the same time, prohibiting the import of consumer goods that do not even require exchange settlement will inevitably force prices in this city to rise. In addition, foreign stock trading is also a reasonable way out for floating capital, but now the consideration is not thorough, and this type of transaction is also prohibited, so that this part of the floating capital is transferred to commodities, and how can prices not rise?

### Rice Hoarders Fled to Wuxi: The Mayor Telephoned the Executive Yuan Again to Request a Thorough Investigation: The Ministry of Food has Sent Personnel to Zhenjiang and Wuxi to Investigate

[Our Own Report] Since this city stepped up its crackdown on hoarding rice, hoarders have fled to Wuxi. Even the rice from Jiaxing and Xiashi, which was originally transported to Shanghai, is now being transported directly from there to Wuxi by train, which can be proven by the Railway Bureau. Mayor Wu telegraphed President Weng yesterday to request a thorough investigation. In addition, the rice and grain hoarded in Wuxi are mostly under the name of tax grain. It is hoped that the Ministry of Food will be ordered to send senior officials to Wuxi immediately to supervise the local government, thoroughly investigate warehouses, investigate hoarders, and even if it is tax grain, it can be put up for sale to stabilize grain prices.

[Our Own Report from Zhenjiang, 13th] He Yushu of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Office said: The Wuxi rice and grain market is sluggish. Before the war, there were often 3 million dan of grain circulating in Wuxi, but now there are only hundreds of thousands of dan. Regarding Mayor Wu of Shanghai's telegram to President Weng proposing to purchase a large amount in Wuxi. President Weng and Minister Guan are very concerned about stabilizing grain prices and have sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to investigate.

[Our Own Report from Wuxi, 12th] Because of rumors that there were large amounts of rice, paddy, and flour hoarded in this county, the Ministry of Food sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to Wuxi to conduct investigations with the Grain Storage Association and other industry associations this morning. If this is true, the government will forcibly purchase them at the original price. It is reported that the actual number of grains stored in each association is very different from what is rumored.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to people from Wuxi, the rice and grain stored in Wuxi warehouses and transported from various places have been prosperous recently, and the flour produced by various flour mills is also abundant, so there is no problem in supplying Nanjing, Shanghai, and the local area. The Ministry of Food has sent Inspector Wang Mingyi to inspect, and it is reported that Shen Guojin, the Director of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry, has also been sent to Wuxi and Zhenjiang to inspect the grain market and plan to dredge the grain source and stabilize grain prices.

### West Railway Station Murder Case: Inspection Caused Misunderstanding: Dispatch Soldier Shot Dead

[Our Own Report] At about 11:40 am yesterday, on the railway platform of the Shanghai West Station on Changning Road in West Shanghai, Li Zhihua, a dispatch soldier from the 169th Brigade Headquarters of the 64th Division in Qingdao, and three logistics soldiers, Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, were walking along the road to the northern countryside when Sun Liansheng, the squad leader of the first squadron of the third brigade of the first corps of the traffic police corps, led two team members on patrol and suspected them of being deserters. They ordered them to stop and searched them, but Li refused to be inspected and had an argument on the spot. Li immediately took out a grenade from behind. When Sun Liansheng saw that he intended to throw a grenade, he immediately fired two shots with a carbine, hitting Li in the back, penetrating his chest, and killing him on the spot. Upon hearing the alarm, the Changning Police Branch immediately ordered Zhao Xiruo, a detective from the Criminal Investigation Unit, Xu Zhengting, a police chief, and Zhang Yuner, a police officer, to rush to the scene to investigate. They reported to the Photography Unit of the Criminal Investigation Division of the General Bureau to take photos. Later, Xu Xiaohua, the Captain of the First Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Department, interrogated them at the Traffic Police Headquarters together with the head of the military police. According to Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, they arrived in Shanghai by the Huahai ship from Qingdao and landed at the Huangpu Wharf. Because they were not familiar with the route, they mistakenly went to the West Railway Station and were not deserters. According to Sun Liansheng, the traffic police squad leader who caused the incident, I took two brothers to patrol along the railway, from north to south. When I was 60 meters away from the West Station, I found three soldiers walking out from the barbed wire fence next to the station. I suspected them of being deserters. Because they refused to be inspected and intended to throw a grenade, for self-defense, I fired a shot, and so on. As a result of the interrogation, the squad leader who caused the incident and the other two traffic policemen, together with the logistics soldiers Hu Yong and Zhu Guangpu, were taken to the Garrison Department for interrogation and review.

The distribution price will be decided at the next meeting.

### Western Film Stalemate Resolved: Cinemas Accept Western Merchants' Conditions: New Films Will be Released in Succession Soon

[Our Own Report] The dispute over the suspension of new films by Western film merchants in this city has been officially resolved after the first-run cinemas adjusted ticket prices again last Saturday to three levels: 500,000, 700,000, and 900,000. The Western film merchants stated that they are not absolutely satisfied with the above prices, especially the price-limited film tickets of 200,000. They still insist that the base number of five jiao should be multiplied by the cost of living index of employees and adjusted dynamically at any time. For example, the current price-limited should be 280,000, but this request has been rejected by the Social Bureau. Therefore, Western film merchants have issued a statement to the cinema industry again that if there are special high-quality new films, the cinema that screens them must temporarily increase the selling price according to the contract to make up for the losses of price-limited tickets. For example, the highest ticket price for the new film "Water Lotus Princess" in the next period of the Grand China Cinema may be more than 1 million. It is heard that the cinema industry has fully accepted the conditions proposed by the Western film merchants, so the new Western films that film fans in this city have been waiting for for a long time will be released successively starting this week. The first new films to appear in the next period are "The Blue Sky" in the Grand Guangming Cathay, and "Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles" in the Nanjing Meiqi.

After Director Wu explained in detail, he immediately discussed the key points for the implementation of warehouse inspection in Shanghai, item by item, and invited representatives to express their opinions. Opinions were divided during the meeting, and disputes were fierce. The meeting adjourned at around 8 PM. The following revisions were adopted based on the original text (the full text will be published in this newspaper on the 10th):

Exchange Old Warehouse Receipts Before Mid-August Except for Daily Necessities

(1) The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, in order to effectively crack down on hoarding, regulate surpluses and shortages, and thereby stabilize market prices, specifically handles the inspection of daily necessities stored in various warehouses in accordance with Article 16 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times.

(2) Regarding the inspection of the warehouses (storage facilities) of members of the Shanghai Warehouse Commercial Guild, the warehouses (storage facilities) affiliated with members of commercial guilds such as banking, trust, and docks, and the warehouses affiliated with various shipping companies and railway bureaus, the method is as follows:

A. Deadline for exchanging customer signature cards and existing warehouse receipts: (1) Warehouses (storage facilities) should notify each customer to exchange the old warehouse receipts issued previously for new warehouse receipts before the end of July. These new warehouse receipts must indicate the name of the stored goods, quantity, name of the depositor, name of the company or firm, business license, commercial registration certificate number, and address, and must retain a signature. When goods are released, in addition to returning the warehouse receipt, the signature must also be verified. Furthermore, the term "allegedly" must not be used on warehouse receipts from now on. Customers should also be notified that new warehouse receipts for daily necessities must be exchanged before the end of July, and new warehouse receipts for other items must be exchanged before mid-August. (2) After the warehouse receipts are exchanged as described above, the warehouse (storage facility) should stamp the returned warehouse receipts with a rubber stamp bearing the words "New receipt exchanged, this document is void" and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. For those who fail to exchange within the deadline, each warehouse (storage facility) should list the warehouse receipt number, name of the stored goods, quantity, storage date, name of the owner, address, and other items, and report them to the Social Affairs Bureau through the Warehouse Commercial Guild or the relevant banking, trust, or dock commercial guild for verification. (3) After the Social Affairs Bureau compiles the reports mentioned above, if they concern daily necessities, the Social Affairs Bureau may report to the Municipal Government to entrust various markets to sell the stored goods and may deposit the proceeds of the sale in a national bank under the original name. Each owner may submit supporting documents to the Municipal Government at any time, and after verification, the deposit will be returned. If the goods are not daily necessities, the Municipal Government will report to the Central Government for handling. (4) After the promulgation of these measures, each warehouse (storage facility) should uniformly stipulate the method for issuing warehouse receipts.

Report the Entry and Exit of Designated Goods to the Guild in Monthly Lists

B. Strictly enforce cargo source registration and dynamic reporting: (1) The total amount of designated goods stored in warehouses (storage facilities) throughout the city should first be compiled and reported by the relevant guild to the Social Affairs Bureau within a specified period. Subsequently, when goods enter the warehouse, each customer should register the source of the designated goods in detail. If the source is unknown or the registration is refused, the warehouse (storage facility) should report to the government immediately after storing the goods. (2) Each warehouse (storage facility) should report the entry and exit of designated goods on a daily basis to the trade association in list form, which will be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. The format of the aforementioned weekly report will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) When the ownership of designated goods on a warehouse receipt is transferred and the transfer procedure is carried out, the old and new customers should jointly submit a transfer application to the warehouse (storage facility) for filing. The warehouse should include the transfer information in the aforementioned weekly report for inspection. (4) When a customer withdraws stored designated goods, they should submit a withdrawal application form. The form should state the purpose of the withdrawal, and if the goods are being transferred, it should also state the buyer and their address, and be submitted to the warehouse (storage facility) for filing. Each warehouse (storage facility) should also include the withdrawal information in the aforementioned monthly report for inspection. The aforementioned application form should be stamped with a seal containing a registered signature; otherwise, the warehouse (storage facility) may refuse the withdrawal. The format of the application form will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau. (5) Each warehouse (storage facility) must not store goods for which signature cards have not been registered or registration has not been completed.

C. Unified Investigation and Handling: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau will compile monthly statistics on the total amount of designated goods stored throughout the city based on the monthly reports from each warehouse (storage facility) and forward them to the Municipal Government for verification. Any failure to report within the deadline (within the first ten days of the following month) will be immediately reported to the Municipal Government for sealing. The Social Affairs Bureau will then, together with relevant agencies and trade associations, dispatch personnel to inspect and handle the situation. (2) Any goods found without registered signature cards or unregistered or unrecorded will be considered hoarding and profiteering, and the warehouse (storage facility) will be subject to the appropriate punishment. (3) Merchants engaged in the relevant business, if they store designated goods for more than three months without a special reason, the Social Affairs Bureau may order them to sell them on the market. If this is not feasible, the market may be entrusted to sell them, and the proceeds of the sale will still be handed over to the owner. (4) If non-industry personnel or merchants not engaged in the relevant business hoard designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau will report to the Municipal Government for approval and entrust the market to sell them. In addition to fines, the case will also be sent to the court for handling. (5) When merchants in the relevant industry hoard large quantities of designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau may, based on the needs of the market, order them to sell some or all of them on the market. If they fail to comply, the Social Affairs Bureau may, with the approval of the Municipal Government, sell them on their behalf. The term "large quantity" refers to one-fourth of the annual sales for kerosene, newsprint, and coarse-edged paper, and is otherwise handled in accordance with the Implementation Notes of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. (The measures are attached separately.)

Warehouse Business Operators Must Join the Guild Before the 20th

(3) Regarding the inspection of warehouses (storage facilities) of various import and export merchants in the city, the method is as follows: A. The Social Affairs Bureau will designate the names of the goods and send a letter to the Customs, various shipping companies, and railways to cooperate in notifying the Social Affairs Bureau of the imported quantity and the name of the importer on a monthly basis. B. Each importer should report the quantity of designated goods, import date, and location of the storage warehouse (storage facility) to the relevant trade association in list form on a monthly basis, which will be compiled and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection. C. After receiving the aforementioned notice and report form, the Social Affairs Bureau will carefully verify them against the warehouse monthly reports. If there are any questions, they will be investigated to prevent concealment. D. The format of the aforementioned report form will be determined by the Social Affairs Bureau.

(4) Regarding the inspection of self-provided warehouses (storage facilities) in the city, the method is as follows: A. The location of the warehouses established by each company, factory, and business, and the quantity and purchase date of the existing designated goods, will be publicly announced by the Social Affairs Bureau. The inventory on July 25th will be used as the standard, and a report must be submitted to the relevant trade association for compilation and verification before the end of July. B. Those who fail to report after the deadline will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering once it is discovered that they have violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures. C. The self-provided warehouses (storage facilities) of companies, factories, and businesses must not store the following items. Violators will be deemed to be hoarding: Goods belonging to others, materials that are not sales products or manufactured products of the business. D. Citizens may report companies, factories, businesses, or individuals who have set up warehouses (storage facilities) to store goods but conceal them. If it is discovered that they have violated Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be rewarded in accordance with Article 21 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times.

(5) Regarding the crackdown on other privately established warehouses (storage facilities), the method is as follows: A. Those engaged in the warehouse (storage facility) business who have not yet complied with the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of Private Warehouse Businesses and obtained a registration license will be strictly cracked down on. B. Those engaged in the warehouse (storage facility) business who have obtained the aforementioned registration license but have not yet joined the Warehouse Commercial Guild as members in accordance with the law must join the guild before July 20th. Those who still fail to join the guild after the deadline will be subject to a suspension of business and will still be ordered to join the guild. If they continue to resist and fail to join the guild, the Social Affairs Bureau may send a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to revoke their registration license and order them to cease operations. C. If citizens report that the designated goods stored in the above two types of warehouses (storage facilities) violate Articles 11 and 4 of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times and Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering, and rewards will be given as usual.

(6) (Note): A. When implementing the inspection, the Social Affairs Bureau may invite relevant agencies and trade associations to cooperate in the handling. B. All matters related to the investigation of hoarding and profiteering and the implementation of limited-time sales (entrusting the market to sell) will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Measures for Cracking Down on the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. C. These key points will be implemented after being approved and promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the same applies to revisions.

### Haitian Steamer Safely Arrives in Japan, Repairing Communication Equipment

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitian steamer, which sailed from Yulin Port to Japan on the 5th of this month carrying mineral sand, encountered a typhoon en route and its radio was damaged, making it impossible to communicate with the head office, resulting in five days of no news.

It is now known that the steamer sent a telegram to Shanghai from the International Radio Station the day before yesterday (the 11th), reporting that it had safely arrived in Japan on the 10th, and the damaged radio is being repaired. It will return to Shanghai as soon as the sand is unloaded.

### District Chief Humiliated While Mediating Dispute

Residents of Caojiadu, Changning District, Zhu Zishan, Cai Maosheng, and others previously suffered a fire. Afterwards, they made every effort to repair the damage in order to have a place to live. However, the Public Works Bureau learned of this and sent employees to forcibly demolish it on the 12th because they had not obtained a permit. Zhu and others went to the district office to petition District Chief Wang Zikui. Wang went to inquire about the situation but discovered that a conflict had already occurred. He stepped forward to mediate but was also insulted. Two residents were injured when they were pushed to the ground and are currently in the hospital. The issue of Wang's humiliation has been reported to the Municipal Government for investigation.

### College Student Sues Own Father, Requests Joint Living and Payment of Educational Expenses; Trial Opens Yesterday, Both Parties Absent

[Our Newspaper's Report] A student from Great China University, Ming Wanhui, has filed a lawsuit with the District Court against her biological father, requesting a judgment ordering: (1) The defendant should fulfill his educational obligation to the plaintiff, and both parties should live together from now on, and the defendant should bear the plaintiff's two-year educational expenses; the living expenses borrowed and spent by the plaintiff from May of this year until the date of the two parties living together should be reimbursed by the defendant, (2) A declaration of provisional execution, (3) Litigation costs should be borne by the defendant.

The plaintiff, Ming Wanhui, is currently a sophomore in the Economics Department of Great China University. Her mother, Zhu, was the legal wife of the defendant's father, Ming Shiting, and bore three children. The eldest sister is married to Chen for many years, and the second sister, Wanhua, is married to Zhu and was married in April of this year. More than ten years ago, the defendant took Zhang as his wife, and she bore a son. Zhang gradually became arrogant. In January of the 23rd year of the Republic, Zhu passed away, and Zhang treated the plaintiff and the second daughter even more harshly and advocated for separation. As a result, the defendant, Zhang, Zhang's son, and Zhang's sister lived separately from the plaintiff, Wanhua, and three maids. The defendant initially provided the necessary living expenses and educational expenses for the plaintiff, but before Wanhua's marriage in April of this year, the defendant invited relatives and friends and allocated 1,000 mu of farmland in the native place as marriage expenses for the plaintiff and Wanhua. Unexpectedly, the defendant then refused to pay living expenses from May onwards, claiming that the land allocated by the defendant was all in the communist area of northern Jiangsu and had no income, and a painted cake could not satisfy hunger. The plaintiff repeatedly pleaded with the defendant, but the defendant, listening to Zhang's slander, ignored her. He also stated that he would no longer bear the plaintiff's college education expenses for the remaining two years. Although relatives and friends were asked to persuade him, the defendant still did not consider it. The plaintiff borrowed money to make ends meet, but it has become difficult to continue. The plaintiff then asked a lawyer to write to the defendant for negotiation, but it was ineffective. The plaintiff believes that parents have an obligation to educate their children, and she is still a minor. Therefore, in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, she asked her sister, Wanhua, to be her legal representative and filed a lawsuit. Judge Huang Wenlan of the District Court opened the court yesterday, but both parties were absent. Judge Huang hopes that the two parties will reconcile outside of court.

### Pilot Program for Rice Distribution to the Poor Begins; Detailed Household Investigation to Be Completed by Deadline

The survey work on the poor has been widely launched yesterday. At 9 AM yesterday, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee convened the supervising committee members and the heads of the district offices to discuss the schedule and steps for the survey of the poor. It was then decided that in 13 of the 30 districts in the city, members of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee would be dispatched to conduct detailed household investigations together with the Jia chiefs, including Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, Yulin, Xinjing, Zhabei, Yangjing, North Station, Hongkou, Songshan, Penglai, Yimiao, Jiangning, and Changning.

Regarding the investigation time, it is stipulated that it will begin on the 12th and be completed by the 25th.

The outgoing chairman stated that he will personally go to various districts for spot checks to ensure that it is in line with reality. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM, and the investigation began yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, with work underway in ten districts.

### Colluding to Steal Supplies from the Supply Bureau; Caught in the Act with Goods

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the afternoon of the 2nd, Xu Kaitai, a criminal police officer from the North Sichuan Road Police Precinct, received a tip that a group of criminals had colluded with laborers from the Executive Yuan's Supplies Bureau to steal supplies from the bureau's cargo trucks behind Zhongzheng Park on East Sports Road. After reporting to his superiors, he dispatched plainclothes policeman Li Zhiming to wait at the location. A car loaded with the bureau's supplies passed by, and a laborer on the car threw a car horn and four small motors from the car, which were picked up by Dai Songzhou and Sun Yiqing, who were lying in wait there. They were immediately arrested. They confessed that last month, they had used the same method with Zhao Longlong, who is still at large, to steal 24 dan of iron chain, which they sold to Yan Rongchang Iron Shop on Xinjiang Road for 21 dan and to He Xingxiang on the same road for 3 dan, and the proceeds were divided and spent. Dai Songzhou was taken to the addresses to recover the stolen goods, and two suspects of receiving the stolen goods, Zhu Ronghua and Cheng Yuekang, were arrested. Seven old iron chains were recovered from Yan Rongchang's shop and 13 from He Xingxiang's shop. After Wang Wanshu, the chief of the inspection office of the Supplies Bureau, confirmed that they were indeed the stolen public property, they were allowed to be returned, and all the criminals were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment.

### Thieves Sell Hydrochloric Acid from Dacheng Factory; Main and Accomplice Offenders Arrested in Suzhou

### The First Person in the Country to Donate a Huge Sum for National Relief: Zhang Xiangchu, a Respected Elder of Shaanxi

— Our Correspondent Zhang Xianzhou

[Report from Xi'an, Shaanxi by this newspaper's airmail] In Shaanxi, almost everyone knows Mr. Zhang Xiangchu. Whether old or young, when they mention this old gentleman, they are affectionate and respectful, and some even heroize him in their speech. Indeed, a person's life and career, if connected with the public, will naturally be respected by people. Mr. Zhang's main achievement was overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's local government in Shaanxi, which influenced the Wuchang Uprising and liberated Shaanxi from the chains of autocracy and incompetence. As a revolutionary leader, an elder, and a gentleman, he has always been respected here.

Half a Lifetime of Toil, Quiet in Old Age

For the past ten years or so, he seems to have grown tired of his official career, half a lifetime of toil, and a body of fatigue. So, he retired to his hometown, quietly spending his twilight years. Sometimes, he would still come out to attend some official social engagements, but these were considered "idle" affairs in his life. As for "serious" matters, he seemed never to talk about them. In his own words, he only acted as a "cheerleader," meaning he only observed from the sidelines, not participating directly. He would clap and cheer when he saw something good or a lively event.

His humorous content, paired with a humorous tone, always made people laugh. He was proficient in Qinqiang opera, Peking opera, and local Shaanxi tunes. He was also skilled in all roles: male, clown, painted face, and female. Therefore, some people said that as long as Elder Zhang was present, any opera could be staged, and he could fill any missing role. Some people considered his actions a "symbol of frustration," but his own explanation was, "I love this stuff."

Generously Donating Family Property

Two months ago, when the national special relief donation was launched, Zhang Xiangchu was the first to donate his ancestral house, valued at about 2 billion, to the country, telegraphing the President to express his patriotic zeal. This act of his was applauded by everyone. Especially when those with even more money were unwilling to contribute a single cent, constantly lamenting their poverty, this old man generously donated, being the first to hand over his family property. This kind of magnanimous spirit can indeed shame and make jealous those wealthy misers. When the reporter chatted with him casually, he said, "I don't seek fame or profit, and I'm afraid of standing out. Handing over my ancestral property is just my duty."

Discussing the Current Situation, Witty Remarks Like Pearls

When talking about the current situation, he was even more witty, making people burst into laughter. His tone of speech was standard Chang'an dialect: "Now it's summer, and the communists are like flies, buzzing around in a chaotic manner. But this is fate. When winter comes, you won't be able to find a single one of them. There won't even be anyone to see." Then he added, "We are now protecting our homes and villages. People always love their hometowns. As the saying goes, 'It's hard to forget the homeland.' It's fine for the Americans, but we don't love them. We won't donate money to them, because that's a different thing. We can't love them, and they don't want us to love them. Nanjing and Shanghai, the Jiangnan heartland, are not bad either, but we don't miss them. Why? Because they have nothing to do with us. No acquaintances, no personal belongings, no ancestral graves. No matter how good they are, it's none of our business. Look at the northern mountains of Shaanxi (i.e., northern Shaanxi), a piece of yellow earth, with poor mountains and barren land, but we always linger reluctantly, because that's ours! Relatives, friends, and fellow villagers are all connected there. You say it's barren, but it's ours. You say other places are better, but that's other people's. So, people from the northern mountains always say the northern mountains are good."

Using Wealth to Develop Oneself is Called Benevolence

"The benevolent use wealth to develop themselves, while the unbenevolent use themselves to gain wealth!" In Mr. Zhang's eyes, there are only these two kinds of wealthy people. The "benevolent" often use money to do good deeds, achieving success and fame, and money brings them honor. The "unbenevolent" don't even want their lives when it comes to making money. If they lose their lives, what good is the money?

So, at this time, everyone should take out their money, whether earned or inherited from ancestors. Donate according to your means. Money and life are directly proportional. If someone can donate 1 billion, then their life is worth several billions. If someone can donate hundreds of billions or trillions, then their worth must exceed hundreds of billions or trillions.

"As the saying goes, 'As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood.' As long as people are there, if they could make money in the past, can make money now, and will be able to make money in the future. Money is an external thing, it goes away and comes back."

The Battle of Kaifeng, Full of Emotion

The Battle of Kaifeng is nothing less than a warning to the wealthy. If they don't contribute a single cent in peacetime, it will be too late when the flames of war reach their heels. Mr. Zhang said with great emotion about this matter: "In the Battle of Kaifeng, the plates, bowls, tables, and chairs that were destroyed can be counted. If you count them carefully, it's only a few billion. What cannot be estimated is 'life,' because the lives of the dead cannot be calculated. If the wealthy don't take out their money, those people are truly seeking their own death!"

Currently, the number of donors for special relief donations across the country is still very few. We are reporting on this "model of humanity" who can take and let go, which should be a good example for the wealthy.

### A Mother Kills Herself Out of Shame for Her Daughter's Immorality: An Unexpected Twist in a Case in Changshu

[Report from outside Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] In the case of Yang Shijie's escape, the former magistrate of the puppet Songjiang County, the Wujiang District Prosecutor's Office today interrogated Cao Gengsheng, a court clerk who misappropriated the High Court's seal. Cao confessed that he had taken a bribe of 150 million and conspired with bailiff Zhou Jiucheng to release Yang. The bribe money was exchanged for 7.2 qian of gold jewelry, which had already been spent in Shanghai. After the interrogation, he was returned to custody. Furthermore, the Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court today suddenly received a guarantee for Yang stating that the Senchang Hotel and Yixiangyuan Confectionery in Suzhou's Gong Lane had submitted a written guarantee, promising that he would be available whenever summoned. Based on the guarantee, the High Court immediately ordered the police to summon Cao Quanxing, the manager of Senchang, for questioning, ordering him to deliver Yang within three days and releasing him on bail. In addition, Zhou Jiucheng, the bailiff who perverted the law in this case, abandoned his post and fled on the 10th. The Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office has dispatched personnel to pursue him.

### Human Dyke to Save a Breach: Zhenjiang Gaoqiao District, Wind Shifts, River Tide Recedes

[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 11th] Since the typhoon struck on the 6th of this month, many houses have been destroyed in the Lotus Pond area of Gaoqiao District, Zhenjiang. At that time, a section of the riverbank breached, and the people's cries shook the heavens. People rushed to the scene to save it. District, township, and baojia personnel all rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Since there was no burlap or other equipment along the river, they took wood and door panels from the surrounding area to block the breach, but they were immediately washed away. In this extremely dangerous situation, the district chief Chen Dewu and others were struck by inspiration. They told the masses to weave people into a human dike with long ropes, lining them up at the breach to temporarily replace wooden stakes with their bodies. The people on the bank also used all their strength to hold the ends of the ropes, helping this human dike, until 9 p.m. when the wind direction changed, and the river tide receded, preventing the breach from expanding further. After learning of the above situation, the county government has now allocated 10,000 burlap sacks and 5,000 wooden stakes to handle the aftermath.

### Jiangsu Province's This Year's Field Tax Quota: Provincial Assembly Urges Collection of One and a Half Borrowings

[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 11th] For the 36th year, Jiangsu Province collected one tax and borrowed half. This year's field tax was approved by the Executive Yuan as one and one, that is, 3.03 million shi of grain should be collected for tax and 3.03 million shi should be borrowed. [Further News]: The Provincial Provisional Assembly believes that Jiangsu Province has suffered eight years of war of resistance and three years of communist banditry, with empty houses and little savings among the people. Furthermore, the autonomous expenses of various county townships, the expenses of security schools, the expenses of local teams, the expenses of conscription, and the supply of garrison troops are all funded by taxing fields. The heavy field tax in Jiangnan is the highest in the country. On the 10th, they sent a special telegram to Grain Minister Guan Jiyu, asking to alleviate the people's difficulties and to set the collection quota for the 37th year at one tax and one and a half borrowings, as in the previous year.

### Is There No One Wealthy in Hangzhou?

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] In the years since the victory, Hangzhou has always stood in a position of ease and happiness. Nourished by wealthy outsiders, its economic situation has not appeared to decline. Therefore, in today's world of war and chaos, it is truly a "paradise" in name and reality.

But since the government launched the special relief donation campaign, this "paradise" has stirred up some disturbances. The wealthy are planning how to escape the title of "tycoon," and they are going to great lengths, asking people to intercede. Another group of people has lightly set aside the special relief donation.

The Slogan of the Wealthy

The Hangzhou Press Association happened to launch a public vote to elect wealthy people at this time. The Postal Administration sympathized with this righteous act and specially donated a mailbox for free. The wealthy became even more disturbed and shouted the slogan "There are no wealthy people in Hangzhou." The Press Association carried out its original intention and insisted on holding the election. One week before the vote count was about to begin, they borrowed the auditorium of the City Council as the venue for the vote count. At a symposium, one councilor said, "There is fundamentally no one wealthy in Hangzhou." Someone else said, "The Press Association is making a mountain out of a molehill." The more they talked, the more agitated they became. As a result, they said that the Press Association's borrowing of the City Council's auditorium this time did not comply with the regulations. One of their regulations stated that loans could only be made for matters related to citizens. Therefore, they flatly refused.

The City Council Refuses to Lend the Auditorium

Originally, in the minds of the Hangzhou City Councilors, this matter of electing wealthy people was unrelated to the city's citizens, even smaller than the proposal to "prohibit wonton vendors from striking clappers." They believed that electing wealthy people had no effect and no meaning. This refusal aroused the resentment of the Hangzhou press, and they unanimously wrote commentaries criticizing the City Council's inappropriate refusal to lend the auditorium.

When the votes were counted, representatives from the municipal government, the city council, and other agencies were sent. Everyone asked the representative of the City Council why they didn't lend the auditorium. He said that this was not his idea!

When the votes were counted, many people detailed the assets of certain individuals, many people explained the reasons why certain individuals became wealthy, and many people exposed how certain individuals had transformed themselves to become the wealthy people of today. There were a total of more than 4,000 ballots. Many wealthy people were listed. The Press Association sent this information to the government for reference.

The government's method for nominating wealthy people was to have various trade associations nominate them. After repeated discussions and research, the trade associations replied to the government that "there are no wealthy people!" The reporter once asked the government how to resolve this "special relief donation" stalemate. They said, "See what happens in Shanghai, and then we'll decide!"

The Target of the Special Donation

In the past, there were righteous people who "would not lag behind others in loving the country" and heroes who "generously donated their wealth." Now, who exactly are the people the government is protecting? And why are these people unwilling to fulfill their obligations?

Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has sent a document to Hangzhou urging the remittance of the special donation. However, the targets of the special donation in Hangzhou have not yet been found. Whose pockets will these special donations come from?

In the past few days, there has been a campaign in the city of Hangzhou to elect a director of a certain financial institution, with banquets for guests and separate activities. It is truly unknown how much money will be spent. If this money were used for special relief donations, the special relief donations could probably be paid.

Recently, commodity prices in the city of Hangzhou have fluctuated greatly. With a single turn of the hand, a blink of an eye, a phone call, a gesture, the wealthy deal with tens of millions or billions of dollars. If they were to extract some interest from this, the special relief donations would probably not fall through!

### Miniature News

Wuxi [Report from this newspaper] During the recent typhoon, a batch of rafts transporting wood from Xidi were scattered by the typhoon at the Dantu Estuary of the Yangtze River. Hundreds of workers were quickly hired to salvage them from the river, resulting in very heavy losses, reaching hundreds of billions. It is said that the losses of wood merchants in Changzhou were also large.

Guangfeng [Report from this newspaper] Bandit forces are rampant in the surrounding villages. The county government has requested and been approved by the Jiangxi Provincial Security Commander to dispatch one platoon each of regular troops from Shangrao, Yiyang, Hengfeng, and Guixi counties to assist in the suppression. The regular platoons from Shangrao and Hengfeng counties have already arrived in the county and were dispatched to various townships to encircle and suppress the bandits on July 6th.

### Mayor Accepts Rice Merchants' Request: Rice Price Limit Further Relaxed Yesterday, Off-Exchange Bids Have Broken the 30 Million Mark

Rice market transactions began on a small scale yesterday, but bids soared, breaking the 30 million mark. At 9 a.m. yesterday, representatives from the North and South Rice Markets, Yin Fuxiang and Hu Wen'an, went to the City Government to request Mayor Wu to relax the price limit to maintain proper business. The mayor then consulted with Executive Yuan President Weng via long-distance telephone, and as a result, it was decided to make a decision based on the rice prices in the production areas. Considering the actual difficulties of the rice merchants in this city, the mayor approved the relaxation of the white japonica rice price limit in the North and South Rice Markets to 28.5 million. The rice merchants expressed to the mayor their willingness to restrain their colleagues and never raise prices for transactions.

[Report from this newspaper] Following last week's price surge, rice prices continued to reach new peaks. The average price per shi was about 2 to 3 million higher than last week. Market prices were 28.5 million for medium white japonica rice, and off-exchange bids had broken the 30 million mark, with white japonica rice at 31 million. Arrivals were scarce yesterday, with 2,028 shi arriving at the South Market and 400 shi arriving at the North Market, for a total of only 2,428 shi.

The reasons for the price increase: (1) Grain prices in the Wuxi production area are soaring, and large households in Wuxi and Changzhou are absorbing Shanghai rice, leading to a depletion of sources. (2) The continuous rise in various non-agricultural commodities is stimulating people's minds. (3) Small investors are aggressively buying in, driving up market prices even more.

Yesterday, I met with Director Ji of the Social Food Department and asked him if he had any countermeasures. He shook his head repeatedly, saying, "This is not a simple rice price problem. From another perspective, this is not a rise in prices, but a devaluation of legal currency."

### Shantou Grain Soars

Flour is the only commodity showing a decline, due to the extremely tight money supply. The morning market opened with rice prices rising rapidly. As manufacturers stopped selling, still wanting to struggle, the opening price for old army rice was 9.3 million, but it fell back to 8.9 million in the aftermarket, a soft decline of 150,000. Bingchuan, Jiancheng, and Hongfeng each fell by a small amount of 100,000, and bran was trading at 6.85 million.

The rise in coarse grains was insane. Although the negotiated price of soybeans had been raised by 20%, the limits were 17 million for carob beans and 15 million for broad beans. In the end, carob beans were slightly transacted at 16.8 million and broad beans at 14.9 million. Northern gangs were aggressively buying red beans and corn, with the former rising by 6 million and the latter by 5 million. Sesame rose by 5 million, raw peanuts increased by 7 million, and selected green and white peanuts were raised by 3 to 4 million. Mung beans were marked up by 3 million.

Edible oil prices soared in a straight line and have returned to free trade. Pure raw oil opened at 78 million, locally produced soybean oil traded at 66 million, up 6 million, raw rapeseed oil at 64 million, Jiton jumbo cans at 69 million, and Jiton mini army cans at 74 million, up 4 million. Bean cake customers were actively disposing of it, rising from an opening price of 7.5 million to 7.9 million, and 8.1 million, a surge of 30%.

### Local Business Conditions

Wuxi [Report from Wuxi by this newspaper on the 12th] Because the source of rice and grain is small and sales are large, market prices were weak at first but then firm. Flour and wheat have rebounded slightly. White japonica rice is 29.84 million, white yuan rice is 29.94 million, yangxian rice is 29.34 million, wheat is 20.5 million, white wheat is 22 million, and cotton yarn is 1.2 billion on the black market.

Suzhou [Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to rise today. The market is trading at 25 million for coarse japonica rice, 26.8 million for secondary white japonica rice, and the negotiated price for secondary white rice for door sales is 27.4 million, up 2.5 million from the previous day.

Zhenjiang [Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper on the 12th] Prices in Zhenjiang continue to climb. High-quality rice is now selling for 29 million, soybean oil is selling for 70 million, and flour is approaching 10 million. In order to suppress the price surge, the Provincial Police Bureau has dispatched officers to arrest illegal merchants. In just a few hours, they uncovered more than ten shops selling on the black market without complying with the negotiated price, and they have all been arrested and sent to the headquarters for questioning.

Jiangyin [Report from Jiangyin by this newspaper on the 12th] Rice prices rose again on the 12th. The association's limited price for medium white japonica rice is 31 million, and the black market price is 32 million. One dou of rice can be exchanged for 100 jin of watermelon, and each silver dollar is worth 2.75 million.

Xi'an [Report from Xi'an by this newspaper on the 12th] Local banking officials estimate that the inflation rate in Xi'an for the first half of the year averaged 2036 percent, while the inflation rate for Fengxiang wine was 1100 percent.

Chengdu [Report from Chengdu by this newspaper on the 12th] Chengdu has been experiencing continuous rain, and grain prices have soared. Rice is 32 million per double shi on the 12th, and cotton yarn and cloth are soaring. The provincial government has decided to announce the names of large grain hoarders and force them to sell, and to begin controlling daily necessities.

### Hua Shares Revolve at High Levels, Market Foresees Across-the-Board Limit Ups

Hua shares first showed good looks yesterday. In the morning market, they rose high and then retreated, once appearing weak near noon. However, physical goods still had elasticity. Benefiting from the rumor of parallel line bills, the market later rose to the limit and then had premium transactions. The morning market initially continued the momentum of the previous week, opening considerably higher.

Yong Yarn debuted at 9250 yuan. After reaching a new peak of 9300 yuan, it was sold down to 8750 yuan. Nos. 23 and 65 advanced to 8880 yuan. However, both yarn and cloth physical goods showed declines. Large households closed out many holdings, and Nos. 14 and 104 were closed out, falling further to a low price of 8620 yuan. Near noon, sentiment improved, and yarn and cloth rebounded slightly. Nos. 12 and 152 vigorously bought, and the noon closing rose to 8810. Shanghai Cement's new shares also announced a limit up. Matches fell to the limit and then rebounded. Compared to last Saturday, Meiya rose by half, Datong was good by one-tenth, Matches, Li'an, Guohuo, Zhabei, Commerce, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Yonggong fell by half, Zhongsi and Hengfeng by one-tenth, and the rise and fall of the remaining shares were minimal.

In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 9200 yuan. Sentiment was excited. Nos. 71 and 169 advanced to the limit up. After this, nineteen shares were at the limit up, and hot stocks had premium transactions. Yong Yarn first added 400 yuan, Xinguang and Jingfu 12 yuan, and Meiya 10 yuan. Later, there were rumors that the National Bank was stepping in, and there was a small retreat to 100 yuan. Finally, with the National Bank exchanging and stepping in considerably, the final transaction was at about a half-board increase. With the exception of Matches, Rongfeng, Lianhua, Commerce, Guohuo, Wuhe, Jingyu, Hengfeng, Huaxin, and Xinyi, which rose by half to one and a half, the rest all hit the limit up. Among off-market stocks, the World and Dasheng stocks rose strongly by more than 20%, while the rest were steady.

Public Bonds: Yesterday saw a small retreat. Unified C opened at 1.15 million, retreating from 1.26 million to 1.08 million before rebounding slightly. About 4 million was transacted. Compared to last Saturday, A, B, and D were each down 70,000 yuan, C fell 110,000 yuan, and Unified E fell 80,000 yuan.

### Silver and Money Industry Changes Overnight Interest

Regarding deposits, loans, and interbank overnight rates, the three Silver, Money, and Trust Associations have jointly formulated a plan. Starting on the 13th of this month, the deposit overnight rate will be changed to 1.7 yuan per thousand, the interbank overnight rate will be changed to 8 yuan per thousand, and the loan overnight rate will be changed to 10 yuan per thousand. In addition to reporting it to the National Bank Auditing Office for record, the associations will send circulars to all member firms.

Further news: According to the Central Bank's statistics, among the major cities in the country, the highest interbank overnight rate is in Shantou, at 25.5 yuan per thousand, and the lowest is in Jinzhou, at 0.5 yuan per thousand. The highest loan overnight rate is in Shantou, at 32 yuan per thousand, and the lowest is at 1.2 yuan per thousand.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Surge in Price Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Since the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement certificate system, the export industry has been more active than in the past. Export foreign exchange in June reached about 50 million US dollars, setting a record high for the year. It is expected that this month's export volume will not be lower than the previous month. However, the continuous rise in domestic prices is affecting the cost of export goods, indirectly affecting their sales overseas, which is a concern. In terms of overseas remittances, the amount was as low as 900 million yuan in May. After the implementation of the new system in June, it has increased. Currently, the conversion of overseas remittances is based on market prices, with special preferential treatment, and it is expected that there will be an improvement in the future.

Further news: The price of foreign exchange settlement certificates surged yesterday, with the highest bids reaching 3.3 million. The most transactions took place at 3 million, an increase of more than 800,000 yuan compared to last Saturday.

### Extraordinary Tightness of Money in Xiamen; Unable to Meet Remittances from Overseas Chinese

[Our Xiamen dispatch, 11th] A huge amount of remittances from overseas Chinese have recently poured in, but due to the extraordinary tightness of money in the market, various private remittance agencies are unable to cope, causing resentment among the dependents of overseas Chinese and creating a serious situation. Yesterday, under the urging of the municipal government, a portion of the remittances was distributed, but large amounts still cannot be cashed. According to the person in charge of the remittance agencies, overseas remittances to the city in June were about two trillion, all of which were paid. This time, the amount is quite large at three trillion. Although there was 400 billion in floating capital responding to the market yesterday, the difference is still large, and it is hoped that the government can provide assistance to alleviate the current serious situation. Also, after part of the overseas remittances were distributed yesterday, prices rose sharply, especially the US dollar, which sold for 3.6 million per dollar, repeatedly causing market chaos. If all remittances are distributed within days, the inflationary trend will become even more severe.

### Weak Market Sentiment; Supply Exceeds Demand; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices are Falling; Authorities Announce Large-Scale Sale of Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Due to the excessive price increases in the cotton yarn market last week, sales were slow, and prices of non-industry materials decreased; furthermore, the fellow traders’ funds became tighter, sellers competed to sell in succession. After the opening, popular yarns were in scant supply, while miscellaneous brands flooded the market, and calling prices rose, resulting in a dull market and a sharp drop in prices. Finally, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was heard to have sellers bidding at 1.4 billion, but lacking buyers, the price finally settled at 1.45 billion, down 150 million. 40-count "Ren Zhong" yarn was priced at 1.33 billion. 32-count "Five Color Star" yarn was 1.14 billion, and 21-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1.1 billion, all for delivery the day after tomorrow, but there were no takers. Near closing, due to the decline in the stock market, cotton cloth prices fell sharply, and the prices further declined, ultimately closing down 120 million, with a total of 36 transactions for the day, amounting to 146 pieces.

The cotton cloth market yesterday was affected by rumors that the authorities would implement warehouse inspections. Moreover, the Textile Construction Company supplied a large amount of cloth on Saturday, causing funds to tighten, and many were selling at a loss. Outside the market, fine cloth opened at 38.4 million, but the North Gang started dumping, and retail investors followed suit, resulting in oversupply. The market fell rapidly to 34.8 million, before rebounding slightly to 500 million at the close, down more than 10% from the weekend.

"Four Gentlemen" broadcloth fell by 6.05 million yuan as a result of the Textile Construction Company distributing cloth in bulk and the traders reselling it. Outside of small recoveries across other fine cloth grades, "Shilin" cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, raw cloth, "Nafu Tuo" (a type of fabric) and other fabrics continued to be strong, with gains varying from 1 million to 13.5 million.

Another report says that the Textile Construction Company is tendering for the "Football" fine cloth produced by the Nanyang Factory, and the "Double Fish" fine cloth produced by the Wuxi Qingfeng Factory. The price that traders are considering paying is around 32.5 million to 33 million.

### Large Amounts of Yarn and Cloth Not Yet Sold Off

Another report: Liu Gongyun of the National Bank announced yesterday morning that a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth worth 5 trillion yuan would be sold off, which greatly threatened the market. Yarn and cloth prices fell by about 10%, and market demand was also not very smooth. In the end, the banks only sold yarn and cloth totaling 145 million yuan, and although the China Textile Company was prepared to sell cloth, there was no sales. The China Textile Company, on behalf of the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, sold 129 pieces of yarn on the market, totaling 20,109,000 yuan.

### Shortage of Cash in the Market; Banks Issue Banker's Drafts

[Our dispatch] Yesterday, rumors circulated in the market that the Central Bank would issue fixed-amount banker's drafts. However, according to the responsible authorities of the bank, this is absolutely not the case. However, due to insufficient funds, the city banks were specially allowed to issue a large number of 500,000-yuan banker's drafts for use by government agencies to pay salaries. Moreover, the authorities of the National Bank, in view of the alarming rise in prices in recent days, have decided to implement large-scale sales of goods, hoping to absorb 5 trillion in funds within the next few days in order to tighten the money supply and prevent the sharp rise in prices.

The opinion of the financial community in this city is that with such a rise in prices, there is a general feeling of insufficient funds in the market, and the issuance of large denominations of currency is only a matter of time. However, at present, the public is restless, and the issuance of large denominations of currency will further shake the public's confidence in the legal tender, which will have a great impact on prices. This is the main consideration of the authorities of the National Bank.

### New Method for Paying for Yarn and Cloth Allocations to be Implemented Today

Regarding the new method for settling payments for various yarn numbers allocated by the China Textile Company, the China Textile Company stipulates that it will be implemented starting today (the 13th). It stipulates that payments made before 12:00 noon on this day can be settled with a bank draft or check. Payments made after that time must be paid in cash sealed by the bank; otherwise, they will not be accepted. It is also strictly stipulated that anyone who has a check returned once will have their allocation eligibility revoked.

### The Work of Purchasing Raw Cotton is Gradually Coming to a Standstill

Regarding the purchase of raw cotton, the quantity purchased is currently gradually decreasing, and some have even come to a standstill. According to people in the industry, there are many reasons for the decrease in raw cotton purchases, the most important of which are three: (1) The main producing areas, such as Shaanxi Province, have now prohibited external transportation; (2) Secondary producing areas, such as Luoyang, Xiangyang, and Xincheng, have repeatedly suffered damage to transportation, making it almost impossible to repair, and it is also impossible to transport cotton; (3) Cotton farmers in other producing areas have lost faith in the legal tender and will not sell unless they are traded in silver dollars or silver dimes. In fact, the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee cannot purchase a large amount of silver dollars in Shanghai to purchase cotton, and it is also strictly prohibited by government laws. With these three difficulties, the work of purchasing raw cotton can only gradually come to a standstill, and the future of raw cotton supply in this city is not optimistic.

### Artificial Silk Initially Weak, Then Strong

The artificial silk market yesterday fell due to government supervision, but finally became strong due to the rise in prices of non-industry materials, resulting in prices similar to those of last Saturday. 120-count "Golden Three Horses" bright silk opened at 1.9 billion yuan, but trading was quiet and prices fell frequently. The spot price at noon closing fell to 1.65 billion yuan, with a premium of 80 million yuan for deferred settlement. The afternoon opening was at 1.88 billion yuan, and the closing fell by a small 20 million yuan. Finally, the off-market price rose again to 1.93 billion yuan.

Factory Silk: The market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, with each grade ending up higher than last Saturday by 23 million yuan. High-grade silk fell to 1.85 billion yuan in the morning with some transactions, and rose to 1.97 billion yuan in the afternoon with transactions. B-grade opened at 2.05 billion yuan. 28-grade serge was still asking for around 1.5 billion yuan.

Silk Fabrics: The market fell and then became strong. The largest deferred settlement price for real silk quilt covers was 1.05 billion yuan, and the smallest spot price fell to 880 million yuan, with the spot price at closing at 930 million yuan. Gingham crepe was priced at 3.25 million yuan. In the afternoon, the price of quilt covers off-market was more than 1 billion yuan outside the customs.

### Tea Market Sentiment is Boosted

Since the fierce inflationary trend struck the city's commodity market last weekend, all goods have fluctuated, and the tea market has also seen improvement. However, the market yesterday showed no changes in the morning. Then, news that grain and other commodities repeatedly reached new highs boosted market sentiment, and those holding onto goods gradually developed the idea of defending them, and asking prices rose rapidly without limit. Prices were extraordinarily brilliant, but transactions were not very strong, as trading involved negotiations.

### Commercial Briefs

Kerosene: Asking prices in the kerosene market yesterday were chaotic. It was heard that the limited price for 46-degree barrel oil was 118 million, but cargo owners insisted on 123 million. The asking price for tinned oil was also raised to 16 million.

Coal balls: The limited price was 2.3 million per dan (a unit of weight). Yesterday, due to the rise in raw materials and all commodities, the black market rose, and it was heard that the factory price had also increased to 53.6 million per ton.

Soap: In the soap market, raw material caustic soda rose to the 700 million mark per barrel, resulting in Huang Xiangmao raising the price to 32 million, Gubben to 42 million, Jian Dao to 41 million, and Guanghua soap to 32.3 million.

Timber market: The market price of foreign pine and Liu'an rose sharply due to the large increase in exchange settlement certificates, and the market price has broken through 1 million. The market price of local fir timber was stable yesterday.

The Transportation Control Committee has formulated concrete plans to encourage the export of local products from the South China region and to support the development of export trade, and has submitted them to the relevant authorities for reference.

### Guanghua Issues Notice of Dismissal of Students; National Sports Committee to be Dissolved in Compliance with Ministry Order; President Zhu to Come to Shanghai to Discuss the School's Financial Problems

[Our dispatch] Zhu Jingnong, President of the private Guanghua University in this city, recently went to Nanjing to meet with Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the school's board of directors, Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, and Chen Lifu, Minister of Youth, to request instructions and discuss how to handle the school's movement to become a national university and other matters. President Zhu has completed his official business in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the school's board of directors will hold a meeting soon to discuss the school's financial problems.

Order from the Ministry of Education

Also, the president's office of the school yesterday issued a notice of dismissal of the students who spearheaded the movement to become a national university. The school had previously received Order No. 37611, Gao Zi, dated July 7 of this year from the Ministry of Education, which stated: "According to the request of the National University Movement Committee of the school to change the school to a national university, it is found that according to the regulations of the University Law, national universities should be established by the Ministry after examining the conditions in various parts of the country. The establishment, change, and closure of private schools should be submitted to the board of directors for approval, and the regulations for private schools also have clear provisions. It is illegal for a small number of students at the school to form a so-called National University Movement Committee. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to coerce the majority of students to strike and refuse to take exams, issue declarations indiscriminately, incite disturbances, and send representatives to the Ministry to petition. The school should immediately and severely stop this, dissolve the committee, investigate and severely punish the leading figures, and expel them from school. Please strictly comply and report back.

### Numerous Personnel Adjustments at Taiwan University; More Than 100 Faculty and Staff Terminated; Association Formed to Appeal for Return Travel Expenses

[Our Taipei dispatch, 12th] There have been many personnel adjustments at Taiwan University this semester, with more than 30 professors, more than 30 associate professors, more than 20 assistant teachers, more than 20 lecturers, and more than 10 staff members being terminated, totaling more than 100 people. Among them, those with academic reputation include Xu Xixuan, Director of the History Department, Li Hanying of the College of Science, Zhang Sihan of the Department of Western History, and Qu Zhenren of the Medical College. They believe that, according to Taiwan University's usual practice, the first and second contracts for professors are for a minimum of three years, and the third contract is for life. Moreover, the usual practice of universities is to notify of termination in mid-June and issue all appointment letters by the end of June. Because Taiwan University's issuance of appointment letters was late this time, and no notification was given before the termination period in July, they believe that it is a destruction of university tradition and an unreasonable measure. Therefore, they formed an association and held a reception for reporters this morning to appeal to the press. They claimed that they have no preconceived notions about whether to stay or leave, but because the school suddenly terminated their contracts, they lost the opportunity to prepare. Therefore, they have requested the school to issue four months' salary as return travel expenses. Zhuang Changgong, the new president, has agreed to issue two months' salary as appropriate, depending on the needs, and is continuing to negotiate. In the past few days, they have visited Chairman Wei, Commander Peng, and the Senate to report the truth and have received much sympathy. If the school has no intention of accepting their request, they will proceed in terms of law, society, and public opinion.

School Introduction

### National Wusong Merchant Marine College

School History: As early as the late Qing Dynasty, the Ministry of Posts and Communications reorganized Shanghai Public School into the Higher Industrial School and set up specialized departments in Railroad, Mine, Civil Engineering, and Navigation Administration. In the third year of the Xuantong era, Director Tang Weizhi established a specialized school by separating the Navigation Administration Department to cultivate shipping talents, naming it the "Ministry of Posts and Communications Higher Merchant Marine School," with Xia Sunpeng as the Dean of Academic Affairs. After the Republic of China, the Wusong school buildings were completed, and Sa Zhenbing was appointed as the President by the Ministry of Communications. It was suspended once in the fourth year of the Republic of China. It was re-established in the 18th year of the Republic of China with a complete scale. The school buildings were completely destroyed in both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was re-established in Chongqing, renamed the "Chongqing Merchant Marine College," and directly under the Ministry of Education. It was suspended again in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and was taken over by Jiaotong University. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education believed that the school was the only place in the country to cultivate shipping talents and had a long history, and should be re-established as soon as possible. Therefore, in February of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, a re-establishment preparatory committee was formed, with Zhou Junshi as the President. The former Lester School at No. 505, East Changzhi Road was rented as a temporary site. It officially opened on October 14, the 35th year of the Republic of China.

Current Status: The school currently has two departments: Marine Engineering and Navigation. The Marine Engineering Department has 44 students in the first year and 65 students in the second year.

Recently, new-style marine engines purchased from the United States will be added for students to study. The school's current biggest goal is to restore the Wusong school buildings. The National Shipping Commercial Association has recently donated 30 billion to allocate building materials. The Executive Yuan has also allocated a destroyer to be used as a training ship for students. The students of the school have excellent study habits and a good school spirit. In the past two years, in a stable environment, all teachers and students have been advancing towards the goal of "education for education" and have never experienced suspension of classes.

### National Shanghai Conservatory of Music

School History: The Conservatory of Music was founded in the 16th year of the Republic of China, initially named the National Conservatory of Music, with Cai Yuanpei serving concurrently as the President. In July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the "National Conservatory of Music" in accordance with the University Organization Law of the National Government, with Xiao Youmei as the President. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Anti-Japanese War broke out. Because the school had not been completed, it was once accepted by the puppet government and renamed the Puppet National Conservatory of Music. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education in Qingmuguan, Chongqing, renamed the branch of the National Conservatory of Music to "National Shanghai Conservatory of Music," in order to continue the past history. Dai Cuilun was appointed as the President. After the victory, it was ordered to return to the original site in the central district of Shanghai, repaired the school buildings, and made efforts to rectify the situation, and announced the opening of school.

Current Status: The school is located on Shijing Road in the central district of Jiangwan City, Shanghai, with three three-story school buildings and two practice rooms.

### Such Rule of Law!

— Jingwen

The Nuremberg Trials in Germany have long ended, and more than a dozen Nazi culprits, including Goering, have long been executed. However, the execution of such a major case that should have shocked the world was kept strictly secret before and after. Although the trial process was completely open, the indictment described the facts from the legal principles, spanning tens of thousands of words, and the death sentence was also pronounced publicly; however, the execution of the death sentence was kept absolutely secret except for the representatives of the participating countries and a few journalist representatives, and photography was not allowed, nor was the newspaper allowed to have excessively detailed and exaggerated descriptions afterwards. It is said that the reason for this is to prevent this event from being regarded as a "martyrdom" by the remnants of the Nazis; however, the most important point is that the civilized spirit of the West has long forbidden the law to be merely a tool to satisfy "popular sentiment." Because if one only seeks to satisfy popular sentiment, war criminals like Goering could have been "beheaded and displayed" after "parading through the streets" without waiting for a trial, and then "left to rot for three days."

However, looking back at our country's law enforcers, their understanding of the spirit of the rule of law does not seem to have yet broken away from the primitive civilization stages of "parading through the streets" and "beheading and displaying." I have not studied law, and I do not know whether the current legal provisions allow for parading through the streets. However, I remember that not long ago, the authorities were criticized by foreign newspapers for their barbaric act of parading Japanese war criminals through the streets before they were shot, which caused a ban. It is not allowed to parade war criminals who have been sentenced to death and are awaiting execution, which proves that our authorities are still able to respect the civilized spirit of modern rule of law.

However, the Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city the day before yesterday published photos of two suspected profiteers being paraded through the streets on their way to court. The fact that speculators and profiteers should be severely punished has long been a unanimous opinion, but I believe that apart from a few "spectators in the courtroom," what the general public demands from the law is the guarantee of justice, not just temporary emotional satisfaction. Even if "parading through the streets" is indeed a punishment explicitly stated in the law, it is ultimately not a phenomenon that should exist in a country that is advocating the rule of law to execute it before the crime has been determined. Now these two suspected speculators are out on bail pending trial in court, so even if they are suspected of committing a crime, it is unlikely to be so serious that it requires "executing first and reporting later." In the unlikely event that the court declares them innocent, wouldn't their suffering the punishment of being paraded through the streets add another page of "wrongful imprisonment" to the record of calls for the protection of human rights?

The parading through the streets has just passed, and the calls for "killing one to warn a hundred" and "borrowing a head" have come again. Moreover, some people have even taken up their pens to openly call for "borrowing a head" in newspapers. I really can't believe what kind of society we are in. This can't help but remind me of Robespierre during the French Revolution; however, this cruel politician, who liked to "borrow heads" to gain the applause of the masses, finally ended up on the guillotine that he had created himself. I often hear people say that heavy penalties should be used in times of chaos, but I always doubt its effectiveness.

In today's world, where intellectuals still believe that emotion should drive reason, one cannot help but feel sad for the future of the rule of law in our country. Our current situation may not yet be strictly implementing the rule of law, but unless we have completely lost faith in the progress of human civilization, we should strive for the spirit of the rule of law in the country. In particular, state officials who bear the important responsibility of law enforcement should always carefully exercise their power to avoid infringing on the dignity of the law and inviting ridicule from outsiders.

However, what we are suffering from today is that many people who are responsible for law enforcement still cannot thoroughly understand the essence of the spirit of the rule of law. Such shortcomings can be found in their conversations and official actions at any time. For example, not long ago, a certain party made a statement saying that if anyone is found impersonating a soldier in the future, they will be sent to the front line to serve as soldiers. The meaning is nothing more than saying that since you like to impersonate a soldier, then I will send you to be a soldier. Speaking frankly, this method is naturally the most enjoyable. However, impersonating a soldier is clearly a violation of discipline, and serving as a soldier is an honor in modern countries. To equate crime with honor, isn't it still the misguided notion of "good iron is not used to make needles, good people do not become soldiers" at work? It is not only illegal, but it also inadvertently damages the reputation of the military!

Furthermore, taking the "monk's haircut" as a means of punishment is also exceeding the bounds of the rule of law. What kind of people are dancing hall managers, I think readers know more details than I do. Of course, "taking advantage" and exploiting dancers violate police regulations, but what does the "monk's haircut" have to do with crime? Perhaps because male prisoners in prison all have "monk's haircuts," it has become a symbol of criminals. However, this explanation is ultimately far-fetched. The reason why prisoners have "monk's haircuts" is probably only to save time and money; it seems that the New Life Movement also advocated cleanliness, including hair, and among the important government officials today, there are many who have monk's haircuts, especially soldiers. Therefore, the monk's haircut should never be used as a symbol of punishment. And now someone actually thinks so, acts so, isn't that a strange thing?

Perhaps some people say that the law is dead, and people are alive. The dead provisions should be interpreted by living people, but the greatest danger is precisely this kind of specious misinterpretation. The provisions will not open their mouths and require people to interpret them, but the white paper and black letters still have a scope to follow. If everyone can arbitrarily turn it into power according to their own fantasies and convenience and impose it on others, then why do we need laws, court organs at all levels, and the case law interpretation of the Supreme Court? Moreover, the examples listed above completely ignore the law and cannot be said to be interpreting the law. If my judgment is not wrong, then it can only be said that feudal consciousness is at work, and the psychology of the "courtroom audience" and the consciousness of "satisfying popular sentiment" are at work. However, this kind of consciousness is precisely an obstacle to the spirit of the rule of law!

### Visiting the Science Exhibition of Various Middle Schools

— Suobei

Thirty years ago, we had already shouted "Mr. Science," but thirty years later, Mr. Science has not yet arrived. What the Chinese people lack most today is the basic common sense of elementary school students in some civilized countries.

Therefore, this science exhibition of various middle schools in Shanghai is more for the people than for the students. On the second day of the opening of the exhibition, I stepped into the first venue (inside Gezhi Middle School) and found that the many interesting science performances and displays and explanations of scientific specimens and instruments attracted many ordinary people, which could not help but make me secretly happy. Today, someone is doing science knowledge publicity, and this publicity is really the cleanest and most valuable of all "publicity" in the world.

Many schools' exhibits are displayed here, each containing endless knowledge. The most complete exhibits and the most exquisite and beautiful arrangement belong to Jiliang Middle School (formerly Nie Zhongcheng Huatong Public School). A total of three classrooms are displayed, with specimens, teaching aids, and collections made by teachers and students in the fields of animals, plants, minerals, and physics and chemistry, numbering no less than thousands. This is impossible for schools with shorter histories, because collection takes time and money. I most appreciate the insect life history, human fire acquisition history, and large contingents of various pests that they have compiled, which can make people who have been away from school for a long time review their past lessons. When I bid farewell to the Jiliang exhibition room, a biology teacher was holding a human skull and explaining why hitting the temples is most likely to be fatal, and many people were listening with their eyes wide open.

The exhibits of the Dade Midwifery School also make people stop and not want to leave, especially the active pregnancy model, which tells people common sense that should not be ignored, but under the concept of old morality, many people cannot understand this common sense very well. Many monsters, such as children without skulls and exposed brains, are creepy. In addition, the publicity of the dangers of old-fashioned midwifery and the specimens of diseases of children and pregnant women are all of profound significance.

Entering the exhibition room of Gezhi Middle School again, an electric car is being demonstrated inside. The eruption of a volcano is also surrounded by many people. Especially the model of a radio-controlled aircraft makes me reluctant to leave. The principle of this thing is very simple, but in China, where common sense is lacking, many people find the "driverless aircraft" too mysterious.

The exhibition is successful, but what makes me doubt is: I have not yet found that any school's teaching material specimens contain anything about atomic energy and atomic bombs, even simple diagrams are lacking. Is it that this major common sense of the 20th century has not yet been mentioned in the homework of middle school students?

### Small Statistics

The US Post Office announced that there are still money orders worth US$32 million that have not been cashed. These money orders have been in the office for more than a year, and the oldest one was issued in 1863.

According to statistics from the American Keli'an Weekly, there are a total of 8,000 people in the United States with assets of more than one million US dollars, of which 4,475 live in six states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Shanghai, and Pennsylvania.

### Philately

From an economic point of view, stamp collecting is also an investment. According to statistics from "Newsweek," several types of American stamps have increased in value by 8% to 10% per year in the past decade.

Take Henry Boulton, a cloth merchant from 　 city, as an example. In 1912, he decided to invest $150 in stamps every year. After detailed research on market prices, he found that commemorative stamps were profitable, so he specialized in collecting these stamps. Seventeen years later, he had invested $2,500, but the current value of his stamp collection was $100,000! What a huge profit.

This seems like a pipe dream, but if readers have doubts, they can check the prices listed in the "Scott Stamp Catalogue" over the years. In 1946, a stamp collector sold 100 sets of Zeppelin airmail stamps for $6,000. He had purchased these stamps from the post office in 1931 at face value for $455. Another stamp collector recently sold 50 sets of the Falkland Islands Centennial commemorative stamps issued in 1933. The face value totaled only $750—which was also his cost—but he got $9,000 in return.

If your collection 　 contains an investment component in addition to a hobby, then don't pay too much attention to the beauty of the design. Most beautiful stamps do not increase much in price after many years because many people collect them when they are issued—stamps are also affected by the "law of supply and demand" like other goods. The one-cent stamp issued by British Guiana in 1856 has an extremely simple design, but now one is worth US$50,000. Age also has little effect on the price of stamps. The one-penny black stamp first issued by the United Kingdom in 1840 is now worth only $25, and that is limited to unused ones. The four-penny orange-red stamp issued by Nicaragua in 1938, however, has risen to $8 in just ten years. No one can predict how much it will be worth in 100 years.

If you decide to invest in stamp collecting, you should know some common sense about stamps—their history, development, and issuance. In a few years, your investment will pay you unbelievable high profits.

### Earning a Living

— Shi Yu

Opening the newspaper, advertisements for short-term deposits are always dazzling. The interest rate is increasing every day, and the principal and interest are paid in three months, which is really "generous." Today, I happened to browse a newly borrowed original book, which contained a story of an astrologer, which is quite thought-provoking.

A New York astrologer has invented a "male and female random" method. That is, couples can freely choose the gender of their baby. Pay US$50 to learn this method. If a boy is chosen but a girl is born, or a girl is chosen but a boy is born, then US$55 will be compensated. At first glance, this method is also very "generous," at least it cannot be considered a scam. But with a little analysis, the true colors are revealed. Statisticians tell us that the birth rate of men and women in the world is roughly equal. If New York produces 200,000 babies a year, then roughly 100,000 will be male and 100,000 will be female. Therefore, as long as 100 couples ask this astrologer for advice, even if he has a low forehead and guesses wrong 50 couples, after deducting US$2,750 in compensation, he can still earn a net profit of US$2,250.

"Jinshi" is the highest stage of fame and wealth. In the years of "Chou," "Chen," "Wei," and "Xu" (this refers to the regular examinations, which are held once every three years. If an additional examination is added, this limit does not apply), the successful candidates of each province throughout the country gathered in the capital for examinations, which were presided over by specially appointed ministers. After three rounds, the "Xiaolian Gong" (successful candidates) numbering one or two ten thousands were selected with 200 to 300 people, called "Hui Shi" (Metropolitan Examination). Those who passed the "Hui Shi" would still have to go through the "Dian Shi" (Palace Examination, not held in the examination hall, but in the Imperial Palace Hall, with the Emperor giving the questions, which was solemn and unparalleled) to become a "Jinshi" (Successful Candidate). Jinshi are divided into three ranks, the first rank being only three people, who were given special treatment and immediately appointed to the Hanlin Academy. The first ranked were appointed as "Xiuzhuan" (Compiler, like Zhang Jian from Nantong), and the second and third ranked were appointed as "Bianxiu" (Editor, like Yu Biqian, who currently resides in Beiping). The second and third ranks, with a certain number of people each, were only given the qualification of "Jinshi," and had to go through "Chao Kao" (Court Examination), then be screened and announced. The best ones were the "Shujishi" (Bachelors), who entered the Hanlin Academy for study, the second best were assigned to various ministries as "Zhushi" (Principal Clerks), the next best were appointed as "Zhongshu" (Secretaries) to the Inner Cabinet, and the next best were appointed as "Zhixian" (County Magistrates) and assigned to various provinces. Therefore, among the two to three hundred Jinshi in each examination, only a few dozen could enter the Hanlin Academy. These few dozen Shujishi still had to study at the "Shuchang Guan" (Hall of Bachelors) until their term expired and then be screened and tested again. The best ones were appointed as "Bianxiu" (Editors) and "Jiantao" (Reviewers), and the next best were still assigned to other departments and provinces as "Zhushi" (Principal Clerks) and "Zhixian" (County Magistrates), which was called "San Guan" (Graduation from the Hall of Bachelors). Those who passed the "San Guan Shi" (Graduation Examination) and remained in the Academy were fully entitled to "Hanlin" (Member of the Hanlin Academy). Those who changed their posts after "San Guan," although they had left the Academy, had gone through the "Shujishi" stage and had entered the Hanlin Academy, so they could still be called "Hanlin" with some justification. For example, Xiong Xiling was dismissed before he could work at the Hall because of the Reform Movement of 1898, but he had indeed entered the Hanlin Academy. Therefore, it is somewhat justified to call him "Old Hanlin Xiong."

Since the "Hanlin Academy" was an official department, entry into the Hanlin Academy had to be selected from among many Jinshi, which was the usual practice. But there were also exceptional cases: (1) The "Boxue Hongci Ke" (Special Examination for Learned Scholars) in the early Qing Dynasty, in which the Qing court ordered the major provinces to recommend well-known figures with outstanding literary talent and high prestige, regardless of whether they had achieved academic fame, to the capital for an imperial examination, and the best ones were awarded Hanlin officials (Readers, Lecturers, Compilers, Reviewers, and Bachelors). (2) The examination for students who had studied abroad at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in which those who had completed their studies in the East and the West and returned to China, registered in Beijing, and took a regular examination were first awarded the qualifications of Jinshi or Juren (Recommended Man), depending on their academic qualifications and examination results. Then they were graded and awarded positions such as Hanlin, Departmental Secretary, Petty Official in the Capital, and County Magistrate. For example, Yan Huiqing Junren in Shanghai and Wu Dingchang Dashuan in Nanjing both entered the Hanlin Academy through the examination for students studying abroad (Yan was appointed as Compiler and Wu was appointed as Reviewer). Although they had not gone through the Rural Examination and the Metropolitan Examination, since they were appointed to a post and entered the Academy, the glory of "golden hat and court beads, purple robes and sable coats," and the prestige of "jade hall and golden horse" were the same as those who entered through the old examination hall. It has been almost forty years since then, which is enough for them to be called "Old Hanlin."
