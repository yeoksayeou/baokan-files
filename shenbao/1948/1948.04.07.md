### National Assembly Enters Formal Agenda: First Meeting Yesterday Discussed Rules of Procedure; Presidium Requested to Prepare for Presidential Election

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Assembly held its first meeting on the morning of the 6th, entering its formal agenda. The first group of the presidium took turns presiding, with Chairman Yu Youren presiding. At 9:25 AM, he announced the opening of the meeting. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported on the method of the presidium taking turns as chairmen and the group lists. The chairmen of the first group of the presidium successively took the stage, and Hong also took office amidst applause. The entire assembly then stood up to observe a moment of silence for revolutionary martyrs, fallen soldiers in the War of Resistance and Suppression of Rebellion, and deceased compatriots. The assembly then proceeded to discuss the draft rules of procedure, chapter by chapter. In the first chapter, "General Principles," regarding the confidentiality obligation for unpublished documents, some representatives believed that it should be determined at any time which matters must be kept secret, and that confidentiality obligations should also be stipulated for assembly staff. Regarding Article 5 concerning the holding of preparatory meetings, it was considered appropriate to move it to Chapter 3 and add a new article to Chapter 1, stipulating that the National Assembly should listen to government policy reports and make recommendations when it convenes. Regarding Chapter 2, "Review of Representative Qualifications," some representatives believed that since certificates had already been verified and photos checked upon registration, they should be deemed qualified, and there was no need for a second review, so this chapter should be deleted. In Chapter 3, "Meetings," the number of extensions of waiting time due to insufficient quorum had already been stipulated as two, but some representatives believed that the length of each extension should also be specified, and that there should also be restrictions on the point that mid-meeting departures do not affect the calculation of quorum. Chapter 4 was "Proposals." Article 17, "The scope of proposals is limited to matters related to the provisions of Article 27 of the Constitution," was again opposed by a majority of representatives, who generally believed that the National Assembly's powers are clearly enumerated in the Constitution and should not be arbitrarily restricted by the rules of procedure. Some advocated expanding the scope of proposals, while others advocated deleting it, but their goal was to empower the National Assembly to inquire into political and national affairs. The meeting paused briefly at 10:50 AM for a break. After gathering backstage, the presidium resumed the meeting at 11:25 AM. At this moment, the capital's power plant took advantage of the assembly's break to switch power supply lines, and there were only a few small lights inside the entire venue, making the light dim. Chairman Yu then consulted the opinions of the assembly and announced the adjournment. However, due to the suddenness of the matter, some representatives did not understand the reason for the adjournment and gathered to question the chairman, causing a minor disturbance again. All the representatives finally left the venue at noon. (The picture shows Yu Youren reporting the situation.)

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The first meeting of the National Assembly will be held all day on the 7th. The second and third sessions will be held at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM respectively. The presidium decided on the 6th that the second and third groups would take turns presiding, with Gu Zhenggang, Zhang Fang, and He Zhonghan respectively presiding. In addition to the secretariat's report of documents, the presidium decided on the 6th that the deadline for proposals to the assembly would be noon on the 10th, and a report would be submitted. In addition to continuing the discussion of the rules of procedure that was not completed on the 6th, the organizational regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the general rules for the organization of the Proposal Review Committee are also prepared for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] After the National Assembly enters its formal agenda, the election of the President and Vice President will proceed. The presidium of the assembly has prepared to submit a motion requesting the assembly to decide on the dates for the election of the President and Vice President and the deadline for joint nomination of candidates, so as to prepare in advance. According to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the President should be elected first, followed by the Vice President, and the names of the candidates should be announced three days before the election.

### Civil Aviation Aircraft Attack Incident: We Will Lodge Final Protest

Soviet Reply Under Study by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on the 6th that the Soviet Union's second reply to our protest regarding the attack on an Air Transport Corps aircraft over the Bohai Sea by a Soviet aircraft was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 3rd. Its content is the same as that announced by Moscow. The reply was reviewed by senior officials on the 5th after spending the weekend at the Ministry, so the Ministry was unable to confirm this matter on the 5th. The spokesperson also said: The Ministry is currently studying the reply and may issue a further reply, lodging a final protest. According to reporters, there are several points of contention that are difficult to resolve: (1) The Soviet Union stubbornly insists that the markings of the attacked aircraft were unclear, which is a sophistry. (2) The Soviet Union stubbornly insists that the attacked aircraft flew over the airspace of the Lushun Naval Base twice, while we assert that the aircraft did not fly over the base, and even if it had, it was within our sovereign airspace and should have the freedom to do so. (3) The Soviet Union believes that according to the agreement on Lushun Port in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet military command has the right to force down aircraft with unclear markings, but we believe that our aircraft have the right to free navigation in our sovereign airspace, and the aircraft of the Air Transport Corps have clear markings, so there is no reason to accept the Soviet aircraft's order to force down for inspection. (4) The Soviet reply further requires that in the future, if our aircraft fly over the Lushun base, we should notify the Soviet military command stationed in Hong Kong in advance, which we believe is unnecessary for civilian aircraft during peacetime unless there is a war between the two countries against Japan, in which case it is technically necessary, and it is especially unnecessary to land.

### Chairman Will Address the National Assembly: Explain the Current Situation, Including Political and Economic Realities

It is believed that the Chairman will soon come to the meeting to meet with the representatives and explain the national situation and political and economic realities.

Deputy Secretary-General Wang Qijiang first explained that the proposal was decided by the first meeting to be submitted to the Standing Committee for research, and the report was submitted to the meeting for a decision.

No matter in politics or society, we will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves to carry out the party's spirit of saving the country and complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and building the country. We respectfully ask the conference to adopt this opinion and make a resolution, so that all party comrades can follow it consistently. Whether it is appropriate, please decide."

### Fire at Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang: Property Loss of 500 Billion; Over 20 Monks Jumped Into the Fire to Commit Suicide

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang, which is famous throughout the universe, known to every household, and praised as the only Buddhist holy site in the southeast, suffered a major fire at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The fire burned for five hours, destroying more than 100 halls and buildings of the Jinshan Temple. The precious scriptures stored in the Sutra Repository were completely destroyed. The fire spread rapidly. About twenty monks who gave their lives to the temple and committed suicide by jumping into the fire. Public and private property losses amounted to about 500 billion, which is an unprecedented disaster. When the fire started in the temple's warehouse, this newspaper's reporter was accompanying colleagues from the Beijing-Shanghai reporters' group on a tour of the mountain, preparing to interview the abbot of the temple. The fire was reported, so they rushed to the front of the temple to inspect. They witnessed black smoke rising slowly when the fire started. When the first manually pulled fire truck (Xiaobailong) arrived at the scene at 3:50 PM, the flames had already reached the Grand Hall. In a moment, the fire spread rapidly. Before 5:00 PM, the Water and Land Hall, Baoguang Building, Ziyou Hall, Grand Hall, Miaogao Terrace, Xionghua Hall, and Liuyu Pavilion of the temple were all turned to ashes. When the fire spread, although the Heqiao Police Station in charge sent police officers to requisition trucks and respond to a large number of two-legged water dragons to the scene to put out the fire, the flames could not be suppressed. Until late at night, all the firefighters were biting dry food and holding gasoline lamps, trying to put out the fire. When thousands of lights were lit, most of this ancient temple had been reduced to ashes. It is comforting to the world that the seven-story ancient pagoda that reaches to the sky and the Fahai Cave, whose mythology is still passed down, still stand tall on the riverbank and are fortunately unscathed. According to Master Taicang of the temple, since the Jin and Liang Dynasties, the god of fire has visited the temple seven times. However, each time it was burned in the past, it was rebuilt. But I don’t know when it will be repaired after the disaster today. Furthermore, Monk Taicang tried to jump into the fire to commit suicide, but was stopped by someone and did not get to bury himself in the fire pit.

### Chronicle of the National Assembly: First Day of Formal Agenda!

Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper (Nanjing, April 6th)

The milestone of the National Assembly has informed us that today marks the first day of entering the formal agenda of the Assembly. The first session this morning, waiting to meet the legal quorum, and due to a temporary malfunction of the lights in the venue, opened late and adjourned early, totaling eighty-five minutes. Among them, reading the minutes of the sixth preparatory meeting, reporting a series of names and votes of the presidium election results, routine congratulatory telegrams, delegates' leave requests, and the Secretary-General's report on the results of the presidium meeting took up another twenty minutes. Therefore, the time officially spent on discussing proposals today was one hour and five minutes. The meeting started at 9:25 AM and the recess started at 10:50 AM. After the chairman announced the continuation of the meeting, he immediately announced the adjournment time as 11:25 AM. Subsequently, the adjournment issue caused a commotion. Some people believed that the Assembly Hall had almost become a powder keg, which could easily cause an accident and explosion. Today was just a small fuse. Fortunately, the storm was only fierce when it came, and soon the wind subsided and the rain stopped, and it was over.

The Assembly began to discuss the draft rules of procedure, which were divided into thirteen chapters with sixty-six articles. Yu Youren first asked the delegates to express their opinions extensively. Twenty-two people spoke successively. There were not many opinions on the first three chapters, but the fourth chapter hit a snag. The delegates focused on the national courtesy of the National Assembly. In the general rules of the first chapter, some people proposed that "During the National Assembly, the government's policy reports should be listened to, and inquiries and suggestions should be made." Article 17 of the fourth chapter on proposals stated, "The scope of proposals is limited to those related to the provisions of Article 27 of the Constitution." Most speakers felt that the restriction was too harsh. Yu Jichuan cried out loudly, "We are representatives of the people. We should understand all kinds of problems before us and be able to express our opinions. All proposals related to politics, society, culture, military affairs, and economy can be discussed." Lin Bin believed that Article 17 should be deleted because Article 27 of the Constitution has already stipulated the power to amend the Constitution. Anything that hinders the implementation of the Constitution can be proposed for discussion and amendment. However, Article 27 does not include the entire power of the National Assembly. Therefore, some problems, such as the issue of the session, cannot be submitted according to the provisions of Article 17. For example, the Constitution stipulates that an extraordinary session can be convened to set a date. If we cannot propose a discussion in the Assembly, it will be difficult to convene and will be held indefinitely. Therefore, Lin Bin said that this becomes a situation where the power exists but there is no time to implement it. This Assembly is the first Assembly and will also become the last Assembly. His conclusion was that Article 17 should be deleted. His clear explanation won several rounds of warm applause. Because in his speech, first, he removed the restrictions on proposals in the rules of procedure, and second, he reminded everyone to stipulate the date of the extraordinary session in the Assembly.

The speakers continued to criticize the restrictions imposed on proposals by Article 17, expressing disagreement. Hua Shousong said that the provisions of this article are tantamount to restraining our opinions and proposals. For example, if there is a change in the territory, we cannot discuss it in the Assembly? So I think it should be amended to "limited to the powers conferred on the National Assembly by the Constitution."

Secondly, some people believed that the current National Assembly should be discussed, but Article 17 could not include it. Huang Yiming said that the issue of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion should be included in the discussion. Others said that according to the provisions of Article 17, it would almost become "no discussion of national affairs." Finally, Guo Hongxiang, a representative from the Northeast, spoke generously. He said, "We want to listen to the report on national affairs, and we want to submit the issue of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country for discussion. We must know what the situation is in the Northeast when we are meeting here today?" Representative Guo's words were full of enthusiasm and power, and the atmosphere of the meeting was tightened by him. Finally, he shouted, "The country is about to perish. This Assembly should be an Assembly to suppress the rebellion and build the country." He shouted and slammed the table, arousing a lot of sympathy. The extensive expression of opinions is only the first day, and the general opinion is to expand the power of the National Assembly and relax the limits of proposals.

The Assembly adjourned for a break at 10:50 AM. Here, an unexpected episode suddenly occurred. The lights in the venue malfunctioned and went out during the break. The entire venue was illuminated only by the light of a few small lamps, which naturally hindered the progress of the Assembly. Therefore, the break was repeatedly extended until the meeting resumed at 11:25 AM, but the lights were still not on. So Chairman Yu Youren began by reporting that the lights were out. Could the meeting be adjourned early? Only because Elder Yu's voice was slightly low, the delegates did not hear clearly, so most of them adopted an attitude of neither agreeing nor opposing. Elder Yu believed that everyone acquiesced, so he announced the adjournment. Who knew that the mischievous lights came back on after the adjournment was announced, and the entire venue was brightly lit. More than two thousand delegates upstairs and downstairs immediately rioted, questioning, "Why was the meeting adjourned?" A group of representatives rushed to the chairman's platform, with a menacing momentum, "Why was the meeting adjourned?" "It must be intentional, thinking that we want to discuss some cases, so we acted rashly." "Too casual." Representative Lin Zigui was particularly agitated, jumping on the podium and shouting, "We will hold our own meeting and elect another chairman." Most of the representatives did not understand why the meeting was adjourned early, and even less why Representative Lin was so excited. So the upstairs and downstairs were in chaos. Because the chairman had already announced the adjournment, there was no need to make a temporary change, so he left the meeting first, leaving behind a mess. Secretary-General Hong used his hoarse voice to explain "Why was the meeting adjourned," but no one could hear his voice, and it was a noisy mess. Finally, Zhang Shouxian's persuasion led Lin Zigui to shout, "Okay, bring it up for discussion at the Assembly tomorrow." This little fuse was only "unheard," but Representative Lin's words were not wrong, "After holding a meeting for more than an hour, the people don't know what we are doing?"

### Editorial: The Crossroads of Division and Reunion in Korea

The work of the United Nations Commission on Korea in Seoul can be said to have completely failed. Commission Chairman Menon and Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse have already left Korea together. Representatives from Canada and Australia also firmly opposed the Commission's supervision of the May 10th elections and criticized the Little General Assembly for making this suggestion as "unwise and contrary to the Charter." Just as the Commission was on the verge of disintegration, the Soviet occupying forces command in North Korea issued invitations to leaders of various parties, right-wing, left-wing, and centrist, in South Korea, urging them to hold a pan-Korean political party conference in North Korea on April 14th to discuss the establishment of a Korean government. Currently, various political parties in South Korea are holding meetings and tests. Except for the Democratic Party led by Syngman Rhee and Kim Seong-soo, which is willing to participate in the May 10th elections, all other political parties, whether left-wing or centrist, unanimously oppose separate elections. As for whether the political parties in South Korea will participate in the political party conference hosted by North Korea on April 14th, or whether they will coordinate and unite after participating, it is still difficult to judge at this time. However, the development of this new situation in Korea illustrates the failure of the work of the United Nations Commission on Korea and the miscalculation of the US military's policy of conducting elections in South Korea.

The organization of the United Nations Commission on Korea is based on the resolution of the General Assembly, and this resolution came from the US proposal. The Commission, with representatives from nine countries as its core, was joined by eight countries after Ukraine refused to participate. Their motivation was to promote US-Soviet coordination with a neutral attitude, to reasonably solve the Korean issue, and thereby lift the shackles of the Korean people. After the Commission arrived in Seoul, the ideal became a bubble. They felt disappointed with the US military's ruling policy in South Korea and also had a poor impression of the leaders of some political parties in South Korea. And the political parties in North Korea, under the control of the Soviet Union, were not only unwilling to cooperate with South Korea, but even refused to cooperate with the Commission. Menon's request to go to North Korea to observe and explore the intentions of various political parties was also rejected by North Korea. Menon felt that this trip was completely useless, so he returned to Lake Success on February 24th to report to the Little General Assembly, hoping to open the deadlock through other routes. The United States' attitude was quite firm, suggesting to the Little General Assembly that separate elections be held in South Korea, electing two-thirds of the national representatives in South Korea, and reserving one-third of the representatives to wait for North Korea to participate. This proposal was passed on the 26th, but still did not receive the support of the Soviet Union and its five satellite states. It is worth noting the opposition of the two Committee countries, Canada and Australia. Canada is very concerned that separate elections will easily lead to the division of Korea and accelerate the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. They also seem to be very suspicious of the popularity of Syngman Rhee and his colleagues. Hodge, the commander of the US military in Seoul, announced May 9th (later changed to May 10th) as the election date for South Korea after the Little General Assembly resolution was passed, and asked the Commission to be responsible for supervision. Before the Little General Assembly resolution was passed, the opinions of the Committee countries were still consistent, but after the resolution was passed, differences arose. Canada and Australia expressed disappointment, and the representatives from China and India quietly left, and the Committee was virtually suspended.

The tragedy of Korea was caused by the United States and the Soviet Union. Korea is weak, and the pitiful 30 million people are still separated by the 38th parallel, without any contact with each other. We sympathize with the plight of Korea and do not attach importance to the failure of the Commission's work. If the political parties in South Korea truly insist on refusing to participate in the May 10th elections, the Soviet Union will naturally not suddenly declare North Korea's independence. Then, the people of North and South Korea should seize this opportunity, be self-conscious, break through the shackles of the United States and the Soviet Union, and extend hands of peace and friendship to cooperate and unite together, so that the tragedy of Greece will not appear in Korea. We have repeatedly argued that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Now the time has come. Politicians from North and South Korea should no longer linger on the idea of "serving Qi or serving Chu" and lose the opportunity to strengthen themselves and survive. Recently, the "Korean Public Opinion Association" in Seoul conducted a Korean public opinion test. Only 5% of the people supported South Korea's separate elections, while 71% of the people supported negotiations between the key figures of the political parties in North and South Korea to unify the country, which is enough to clearly show the intention of the people of South Korea to eagerly unify the North and South. Under the control of the Soviet army in North Korea, there is no genuine expression of public opinion, but it is clear without judgment that the intelligent and creative Koreans, their blood relationship determines their common will to survive. The idea of Korean independence was originally undifferentiated between North and South Korea. Except for the bad tendencies of a few people, it is believed that the conscience of the vast majority of Koreans is to be united.

China and Korea have close relations. For the future peace of the Far East, we strongly support Korea to be united. Now the dawn of peace and unity in Korea is near. We hope that the politicians of North and South Korea, outside the unfree atmosphere of Seoul and Pyongyang, will gather to negotiate a way to unify the country and not disappoint the neighbors and the vast number of people. Chinese historical philosophy has pointed out the fate of small states. The only way is to constantly strive for self-improvement in order to survive in the world. "Serving Qi or serving Chu?" This is the question of a small state. Serving Qin or serving Chu has the risk of being annexed. If they are not deceived by Qi or Chu, they should strive to strengthen themselves as a righteous country. Mencius said, "Now, if a small state wins by extending its strengths and making up for its shortcomings, and becomes fifty li long, it can still become a large state." Today, Korea has 220,000 square kilometers of land, which is more than one-third of the total area of Japan, and six times our Taiwan Province; a population of 30 million, with thicker endowment than the Japanese and a greater wealth than Taiwan. If it is independent and self-reliant, it will definitely make a good contribution to the peace and stability of the Far East. Therefore, we must awaken the vigilance of the United States and the Soviet Union: a peaceful and independent Korea can serve as a buffer between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the United States and the Soviet Union want to avoid war in the Far East, they should withdraw from Korea, watch Korea's independent reunification, and make it a corridor of peace in the Far East, not a powder keg. The military experts of the United States and the Soviet Union are vying to control the Korean Peninsula according to the theory of geopolitics. This is not a way to avoid war. This is self-immolation, not burning others. The powerful political power should be cautious.

### The Mystery of Mount Jishi

Rumor that American Pilots Secretly Explored it, Height Approximately 23,500 Feet

[Central News Agency Nanjing 6th Electric] Hua Peng, director of the Boston Museum of America, one of the American founders of the "Mount Jishi Exploration Team," arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th and visited Dr. Sa Benlian of the Central Research Institute. The Chinese scientists currently stranded in Lanzhou include Luo Kaifu, Xu Jinzhi, and Sun Dian. There are also one reporter and three liaison officers. Reynolds' absurd behavior has aroused unanimous dissatisfaction and condemnation from all walks of life in China and the United States. According to reports from authoritative sources, the reason why Reynolds hurriedly left China twice was because since Reynolds advocated "taking risks," an American pilot from the Central Air Transport Corporation flew a plane from Lanzhou to Dihua and secretly explored Mount Jishi, which is approximately 23,500 feet high, while Mount Everest is 29,918 feet high. Reynolds and his driver Orton have heard about this rumor. Reynolds still intends to try. His first secret departure from China may have been intended to fly to Mount Jishi for exploration, using flying to India as a cover. His second use of "test flight" as a pretext was to escape long ago.

### What is He Wuwang Dezhen? The Wife of a Village Head Was Frightened to Death. Self-Government Personnel in Changzhou Demand Reasonable Protection

[This newspaper's Wujin dispatch on the 5th] Jiu Bao in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan District, in response to the second phase of conscription, Zheng Chao was introduced to serve as a volunteer soldier. After the family allowance was collected, including guarantor Liang Shufen's share, and was about to be handed over, at about 10:00 AM on the 30th of last month, Wang Dezhen, who claimed to be the platoon leader of the search company of the 48th Regiment of the Second Reserve Brigade of the Army stationed in Tangshan, Nanjing, suddenly arrived at the Jianhu Township Office with a squad leader, carrying a Thompson submachine gun. He claimed that he was ordered to arrest Zheng Chao, a deserter. His tone was fierce, so Township Head Wu clarified the situation and sent someone with a note to find Liu Guoliang, the village head of Jiu Bao. As Liu was not at home, his wife, Zhou, received them. Unexpectedly, Wang Dezhen acted rudely, and without asking for details, he roared loudly and led the squad leader into the house to search everywhere. After about an hour, nothing was found, so he declared that he would take Zhou and He, the wife of the Jia (neighborhood) head of the Bao, to Nanjing. Zhou and He were originally [blank space] small, and were greatly frightened by the news. They cried and begged for mercy, and accompanied them to the Fuxing Restaurant in Qishuyan [blank space] Street for a meal.

### International Conference on Freedom of the Press Prevents Malicious Reporting. Grotowski's Rage

— Special correspondent of this newspaper, Mao Shuqing

[This newspaper's Geneva airmail dispatch, March 30th] The Conference on Freedom of the Press has entered its second stage. The plenary session has ended, and the focus has shifted to the subcommittees. The Chinese delegation also has a "division of labor" method for handling the subcommittees. Chief representative Zhang Pengchun himself serves on the General Committee, which is usually called the "Steering Committee" in the United Nations General Assembly mechanism, equivalent to the "Presidium" commonly used in China. The General Committee decides on the rules of procedure, regulations, and other technical issues that do not belong to freedom of the press. Most of the debates are diplomatic in nature. In addition to the General Committee, there are four subcommittees discussing freedom of the press: the First Committee discusses the principles and theories of freedom of the press, and the Chinese delegation recommends Cheng Cangbo to attend. The Second Committee discusses the collection and dissemination of freedom of the press, and Deng Youde attends. The Third Committee discusses free publication and free [blank space] announcement, and [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] attends. The Fourth Committee discusses the long-term [blank space] structure and organization of freedom of the press of the United Nations, and Ma Xingye attends.

William Benton Speaks, Emphasizing Rationality and Morality

Representative William Benton gave a speech in the First Committee that was appreciated by everyone. This veteran of journalism, who was once the Assistant Secretary of State and also the Director of the Washington Headquarters of the United States Information Service, spoke very gently, appropriately, and powerfully. He initially said a long passage about the United States' promotion, growth, and contribution to the new freedom, and then talked about the basic concepts of the American people regarding freedom of the press. He said: The American people revere rationality, and the American people believe that freedom of the press is one of the moral standards of the United States. As sacred journalists, they have unwavering moral confidence. In World War II, the United States exerted this highest moral force, defeating fascism like sweeping away fallen leaves. "However, what we regret most today is that there are still [blank space] strong [blank space] people in the world who have the ability to destroy freedom of the press activists." He also said: This conference does not allow [blank space] them to be too [blank space] [blank space], but in any case, [blank space] there is no [blank space] bill, we came to Geneva, our efforts are not in vain. We want to gather representatives from all over the world and write those solemn words of freedom of the press in black and white on the classics of our humanity. This effort is by no means fruitless. Then he concluded:

Oppose Violence and Despotism, Promote Freedom of the Press

A few days ago, US President Truman, in a speech to Congress, said a few very painful words: "The freedom of the Czech Republic has died, and the freedom of the press of the Czech Republic has also died!" How many countries today sacrifice the freedom of their citizens under violence and despotism! Let us all be uplifted, we must promote the power of freedom of the press, so that this truth becomes a symbol of national independence, world peace, and human dignity.

A warm hall [blank space] repaid William Benton. When his speech was in progress, the whole place was silent. The delegations of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China were all present. The Soviet delegation [blank space] whispered, showing great tension. Many small countries were indifferent, and even the zero seats of many countries were all [blank space] empty. I once inspected the entire representative [blank space], a total of [blank space] ninety-two people.

Even more [blank space]'s [blank space] target was Poland's speech on a noon afternoon. General Grotowski, the chief representative of Poland, an "old friend" whom I met in Warsaw last year, Grotowski is the director of the Polish News Bureau, he was in the past, and he is still now. General Grotowski is a remarkable talent in the Communist government of Poland, and indeed the only talent. Not only are his English, Russian, and French fluent and amazing, but also his thinking is meticulous and his speech is smooth. This time, he is the chief representative of Poland at the news conference. He stood up and spoke in English, speaking very slowly, one word at a time, hitting the hearts of the audience.

Grotowski's Viewpoint: Please Do Not Scold Poland

He said: The Polish government and people have always adhered to the principles of freedom of the press and accurate reporting, because freedom of the press can promote international cooperation and eliminate mutual misunderstandings. Since Poland was liberated from the iron road of Nazi fascism in 1944, it has only been more than three years. Poland now has 735 publications, including newspapers, bi-monthly magazines, and periodicals. The Polish government allows [blank space] paper publication for any religious belief, because it respects [blank space] freedom, but unfortunately, foreign journalists come to Poland, and the reports they [blank space] write greatly hinder the national interests of Poland.

Grotowski [blank space] [blank space] to the extreme, he said: From March 1946 to March 1948, in the two years, a total of 400 foreign journalists came to Poland, of which 250 were American journalists. They enjoy all the conveniences, preferential treatment, and freedom in Poland. They can watch to their heart's content, ask to their heart's content. At foreign journalists' receptions, they are like the most shrewd judges, asking all the doubts they want to ask. The Polish government respects their freedom of the press, and has done its best, but what they write and record is full of scolding Poland. In their eyes, they never put Poland, with 25 million people, in their eyes.

Respect the Interests of All Countries and Promote International Unity

After listing examples, he said: The Polish government absolutely adheres to freedom of the press, but has the need to accept harsh historical lessons. The Polish government for this time news freedom meeting missing, advocates discussing the following points. (1) Freedom of the press should respect the national interests of all countries with each other. (2) Eliminate insults, instigations, and war profiteering. (3) To end the progressive lives of all mankind, eliminate reactionary news reports. (4) Establish a permanent institution in the United Nations to supervise and manage the above-mentioned transgressions. Grotowski's final conclusion is: Freedom of the press is not to promote the division of the world, but to create international unity.

He sat down amid much applause. After listening to Grotowski's speech, I walked to the Eden Hotel. I told Mr. Ma Xingye about the content of Grotowski's speech. Teacher Ma patted his thigh and said, "Well said, well said!"

If we put aside the international political position and stand in the position of a purely neutral journalist, watching the telegrams, communications, or photos sent back to the United States by American journalists in China every day in New York, I infinitely [blank space] love [blank space] Grotowski's anger [blank space], the anger [blank space] of a pure journalist!

The purpose of the conference is to eliminate the difficulties caused by the Soviet control of traffic between Berlin and West Germany. The Soviet Union is now slowly and obviously reluctantly succumbing in the "war of nerves" caused by its actions. [Reuters, Berlin, 6th] The Allied Deputy Commanders-in-Chief are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the Soviet proposal to merge the eight committees under the Allied Command in Berlin. Soviet representatives attended the Finance and Health Committees of the Joint Command today, but did not attend the Cultural Committee.

### Anglo-Soviet Aircraft Collision Incident: Soviet Union Expresses Apology to Britain; Anglo-American Armed Escort Order Rescinded

[United Press, London, 6th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that a swift investigation would be conducted regarding the incident where a British transport plane was shot down by a Soviet fighter jet over Berlin, resulting in the deaths of fifteen people.

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] British military headquarters announced tonight that the Soviet Union had responded to British protests over the Soviet fighter jet colliding with the British transport plane. The British side deemed the response satisfactory and rescinded the order to dispatch fighter jets for protection. The United States followed suit, and on the 6th, aircraft from both countries entered and exited Berlin without fighter jet escorts.

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] The Soviet Union has formally apologized for the collision between Soviet and British aircraft over Berlin. Initially, Britain and the United States indicated their intention to deploy fighter jets to protect transport planes flying in German airspace. Britain had also formally protested to the Soviet Union regarding the plane collision. A communique issued today by the Soviet military government stated, "The Soviet military government, with deep regret, announces the unfortunate news of a British passenger plane en route from Hamburg to Berlin colliding with a Soviet fighter jet preparing to land at the Soviet-controlled Dallov airfield. Both planes were completely destroyed, and all personnel on board perished." The Dallov airfield is near the edge of the British sector in Berlin, approximately five miles from the British Gatow airfield. The British plane carried ten passengers and four crew members, all of whom perished. The Soviet fighter pilot also died. Following the collision, both planes immediately caught fire and crashed. The U.S. military government announced that all its planes would be grounded on the 5th, and starting on the 6th, unless the British authorities had obtained a satisfactory explanation from the Soviet side, all planes would be escorted by fighter jets. According to eyewitnesses, as the British plane was turning left to land at the Gatow airfield, the Soviet fighter jet suddenly dove towards the British plane, leading to the collision.

### United States to Implement Foreign Aid Plan: Truman Orders Reconstruction Finance Corporation to Advance $1.1 Billion; China May Receive $50 Million

[Our Correspondent] New York, 6th (Broadcast from Washington): President Truman has selected Hoffman as the administrator for the European Recovery Program and is awaiting Hoffman's formal acceptance. Hoffman, chairman of Studebaker Corporation, had previously traveled to Japan with Undersecretary Claypoole and returned to Washington today.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman has ordered the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to immediately advance funds: $50 million for the China Aid Program, $50 million for the Greek-Turkish military aid program, $1 billion for the European Recovery Program, and $5 million for economic assistance to Trieste. The State Department has established a temporary European Aid Agency, ready to implement the foreign aid plan once authorized by Truman.

A White House spokesperson declined to comment on what decisions Truman would make, but stated that Truman "might" appoint his European aid program administrator on the 6th, "but not necessarily." Bridges told reporters that he had notified the State Department on the 3rd that he opposed the department's temporary management of the European aid program.

### News Conference Passes Resolution on Freedom of Thought and Expression; Chinese Amendment to Principles of Freedom of the Press Passed

[Reuters, Geneva, 5th] The International Conference on Freedom of the Press recently passed, by a vote of 30 to 5, a U.S.-proposed resolution guaranteeing freedom of thought and expression. A Soviet amendment calling for sanctions against defeated nations was rejected. The overall passage of the U.S. resolution is the first major achievement of this session. The resolution guarantees the broadest participation in news sources.

The assembly also passed an Indian resolution encouraging the establishment of one or more non-official journalists' organizations in each country. A French proposal to issue international press cards will be discussed after considering whether to establish an international press commission to issue such credentials.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 5th] The First Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press continued its discussion this afternoon of the Indian amendment to Article 7 of the U.S. draft resolution on principles of freedom of the press. The chief delegate from China, Chang Peng-chun, regarding the phrase "to prevent the continued dissemination of false or distorted reports that are likely to increase hatred or promote prejudice against nations, individuals, or groups of different races, languages, religions, or philosophical beliefs," believed that the dissemination of false or distorted reports itself was already undesirable and deliberately deleted the word "continued." Zhang's amendment was ultimately passed. Furthermore, Radio Geneva tonight praised the proposals submitted by the Chinese delegation to the First Committee regarding improving the quality of journalism during its broadcast of the assembly's opening.

### U.S. Strengthens Arctic Defenses: Strategic Base Built in Aleutian Islands; Naval Fleet to Visit Norway at the End of the Month

[United Press, Washington, 5th] U.S. military authorities announced that they would set aside large areas of public land for military use in the Aleutian Islands. Authorities only stated that this was a routine matter. However, these islands are closest to the Soviet Union, and their role in World War II proved their strategic importance. The Japanese military used them to attack the U.S. mainland, and the U.S. military used the base to launch retaliatory attacks on the Kuril Islands of Japan. The Kuril Islands have now been incorporated into the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will designate a series of islands in the Aleutian Islands solely for military use, directly strengthening defenses in the Arctic region. Additionally, the Navy Department announced that the U.S. Mobile Fleet will visit Bergen, Norway, from April 29th to May 2nd for a goodwill visit. While officials state that both events are routine, they each have a context. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated two weeks ago that the garrison in Alaska consisted of only 7,000 troops and fewer than 100 fighter jets, and that plans were underway to increase troop strength to 15,000, with further expansion to follow. President Truman publicly expressed concern over developments in Scandinavia. Ten days later, a Soviet official newspaper launched an attack on Norway, which diplomats here believe to be a signal of renewed pressure. It is recalled that a year ago, Moscow Radio announced that Norway had agreed to cede military bases on Spitsbergen Island to the United States, which Norway denied. Spitsbergen Island occupies a strategic position on the shortest air route from the U.S. across the Arctic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union. It is governed by Norway under a 1920 international treaty abolishing military installations. The U.S. State Department stated last year that the U.S. should be consulted if the status of the island were to change. The U.S. fleet's visit to Norwegian ports will indirectly strengthen its ability to maintain control over strategic islands in the Arctic.

### Japan Determined to Stop Strikes to Secure U.S. Aid

Ashida Delivers Important Speech

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida stated in his address to the Governors' Conference on the 6th that the recent suspension of discussions in the U.S. Congress regarding the $180 million aid package for Japan's reconstruction due to the strikes by Japanese civil servants is a fact that we cannot ignore. It is only natural that the government take appropriate measures to prevent illegal strikes.

### United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Rejects Soviet Proposal

[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission's working group rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for world atomic control today by a vote of nine to two. The proposal was deemed impractical and unworkable. This decision has put the United Nations' two-year effort to find an agreement between the East and West to establish a structure to prevent atomic war on indefinite hold. The Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against the proposal. The majority of nations, led by the United States, as well as China, Britain, France, and Canada, stood together. The commission is scheduled to hold a plenary session again in the second half of the month. The work of the control and operational groups has reached a standstill. The future situation will be determined by the committee or even the UN General Assembly this fall.

### Riots in Alexandria Worsen; Authorities Announce Curfew

[Reuters, Alexandria, 6th] The riots in Alexandria entered their second day. Gunfire on the main streets leading to Mohammed Square was even more intense than on the 5th. Looting and arson continued to occur. More than a dozen fires broke out throughout the city last night. A curfew was announced, and up to 5,000 troops were deployed to maintain order. Premier Nokrashy ordered citizens not to go out after 7:00 PM on the 5th and 6th, and that anyone found on the streets after 7:00 PM would be shot on sight. Nokrashy also asked representatives of the striking police to meet with him, but the police refused.

### U.S. Representative Proposes Temporary Trusteeship for the Holy Land to the Security Council; Soviet Union and Ukraine Refuse to Attend Discussion

[U.S. Information Service, New York, 5th] U.S. Chief Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Austin today outlined a proposal for a temporary trusteeship for Palestine to the other member states of the Security Council. Austin held a closed-door meeting in his Manhattan office. The Soviet and Ukrainian representatives on the Security Council did not accept Austin's invitation. The experimental approach to resolving the Palestine issue is to place the region under the United Nations Trusteeship Council, on which the Soviet Union has no representative and where no other nation wields absolute veto power. According to U.S. officials, the temporary trusteeship would not prejudice the final political agreement between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. The temporary trusteeship would end once a future government is established.

(11) Improving Inland Military Transportation Problems

When General Stilwell wanted to find justification for his operations in northern Burma and a panacea for China's ills, his Chongqing headquarters completely ignored the internal transportation problems in China.

The internal situation in China was such that even if the Burma Road were open, it might still be ineffective. For three years, the theater headquarters had been trying to open a route to China through Burma, but had failed to pay attention to, or refused to pay attention to, internal transportation in China.

While the theater headquarters was focused on opening a route through Burma, it did nothing to improve internal transportation in China. It paid no attention to facilitating the distribution of the increasing supplies flown over the Hump, or to preparing for truck transport, even though truck transport was what the theater headquarters fervently hoped for.

In 1944, when the Japanese offensive broke into eastern China, Chinese troops could not obtain overland supplies, even though the theater headquarters wanted to provide such supplies.

The theater headquarters was easily satisfied with the state of internal highway transport in China, as evidenced by the fact that in 1942, highway transport barely existed. The supply department only hired one civilian staff member, Taylor, at the end of that year to solve that problem.

Taylor had little assistance and had to handle a task whose importance was second to none in the world. His failure was certain.

Some progress was made in transportation in 1943, but this was the result of efforts by people outside the theater headquarters. The China Defense Supplies and Lend-Lease representatives helped Taylor find parts for the trucks used by Chinese agencies, which did most of the hauling on China's unusable highways. Two civilian staff members of the China Defense Supplies Committee completed the first complete highway survey for Taylor, which later became a basic guide for the theater headquarters.

When a representative of the China Defense Supplies Committee handed over this study, the transportation director of the China-Burma-India Theater expressed appreciation, but before looking at the report, he said he wanted to know whether the internal transportation problem in China was a railway problem or a highway problem. In January 1944, the internal transportation situation in China was so appalling that I flew to New Delhi, India, where the rear echelon headquarters of the China-Burma-India Theater was located, and requested that the Air Service Command be responsible for this task. I did not want to manage this matter myself, but I did not know of any other way to get the supply department to assign personnel qualified to handle this major task.

As a result, Colonel Sheehan was sent to China in February. Given his lack of adequate personnel, lack of supplies, and other factors beyond his control, Sheehan can be said to have accomplished quite a bit. However, when General Stilwell was recalled in the second half of 1944, a few months before the opening of the Burma Road, a complete solution had still not been found.

Sheehan was a transportation expert and served as the transportation director for the China region of the supply department. He increased the volume of transport on the main transportation lines from Yunnan Province to the air bases in eastern China from about 2,500 tons per month to over 6,000 tons, despite various obstacles created by the theater headquarters.

From the end of 1943 onwards, Stilwell was repeatedly told that the Chinese could not have adequate transportation without material assistance. In fact, there were only two options: either airlift new trucks to China, or implement air transport east of Yunnan Province.

However, in mid-1944, when Stilwell acknowledged that the Fourteenth Air Force should receive supplies to resist the Japanese offensive then underway in eastern China, he handed over the responsibility for transportation to the Chinese government and refused to listen to contrary opinions.

The theater headquarters' failure in China was related to its assessment of the Burma Road. The theater headquarters' assessment of this major project was superficial from the beginning.

When the Burma Road problem was being given full consideration, transportation expert Colonel Sheehan told me that, for the reference of Roosevelt and Churchill, he estimated that the volume of transport on the Burma Road could never exceed 11,000 tons per month. He had attended the first Quebec Conference, and this figure proved to be too high.

However, at the Quebec Conference, an even higher official estimate for the Burma Road was produced. This was obtained by compromising between Sheehan's seemingly conservative estimate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons and another person's casual figure of 100,000 tons.

Stilwell did not become interested in increasing the Hump airlift until after the spring of 1943. At that time, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington authorized my air force to prioritize the delivery of 4,700 tons of cargo per month over the Hump.

Later, it became clear that the Salween campaign would only be possible after the Fourteenth Air Force reached the level of carrying 4,700 tons per month. Stilwell's attitude toward the Hump airlift had changed slightly.

But I will postpone the story of the execution of the Salween campaign plan and narrate it in the next chapter. This is a regrettable story that has not yet been told.

### Stabilizing Index; Expanding Rationing: Various Industries Agree to Mutually Ration Products; Subcommittee Established to Study Technical Issues

[Our Correspondent] The Research Committee on the Compilation of the Cost of Living Index, convened by the Social Affairs Bureau, was held in the bureau's conference room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Manufacturers Association, and various industry associations, including the underwear knitting industry, the flavoring powder industry, the soap industry in the Fourth District, the handmade cotton weaving industry, the textile industry in the Sixth District, the towel and blanket industry, the cigarette and candle industry, the firewood industry, and the soy sauce industry, attended. Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department, also attended. The meeting was chaired by Bureau Director Wu, who explained that the Shanghai Industrial Association had previously requested the government to uniformly set wages based on the cost of living index for the previous month because manufacturers could not bear the increase in the cost of living index. After considering this suggestion, the government did not implement it. Currently, several daily necessities, such as rice, kerosene, oil, and sugar, are rationed by the government. To stabilize the index, the goal is to expand the scope of rationed items. The government already bears a heavy burden, and further increasing rationing would be unsustainable. Therefore, it is hoped that the factories will cooperate to implement a rationing system, where in addition to rice, kerosene, oil, and sugar, all manufacturers can participate in the rationing of daily necessities listed in the cost of living index, and sell them to all employees at cost. The attending representatives all agreed to this principle and decided to form a subcommittee to promote the daily necessities rationing system, to hold its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 12th of this month to discuss technical issues and conduct detailed research. The elected members of the subcommittee are Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau; Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department; Tian Heqing from the Industrial Association; Jin Runxiang from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Ge Jichen from the paper industry; Wang Zhuyi from the cotton spinning industry in the Sixth District; Liang Songling from the soap and candle industry; Pan Shihao from the dyeing and weaving industry; Zhang Wenxue from the firewood industry; Lu Jusheng from the knitting industry; and Ni Gengnian from the underwear knitting industry, totaling eleven members.

Director Wu mentioned in the meeting yesterday that if factories producing machinery, cement, etc., cannot supply daily necessities, but the cost of living index is only set at one level, and all industries must adopt it, then there would be a situation where some enjoy rights without fulfilling obligations. This difficulty needs to be resolved. After the attendees exchanged opinions, it was decided to hand the matter over to the subcommittee for discussion. According to Director Wu, the government is currently promoting rationing policies on one hand and expanding the cooperative system on the other to stabilize the index, both complementing and supporting each other. This matter is for the local government and does not require instructions from the central government.

### Federation of Trade Unions Expresses Attitude: Rationing Must Be Universal and Comprehensive

[Our Correspondent] Regarding the issue of stabilizing the cost of living index and expanding the daily necessities rationing system, a spokesperson for the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions expressed their attitude yesterday, stating that the Federation of Trade Unions greatly hopes to stabilize prices, as the cost of living index is based on prices, and if prices are stable, the index will naturally stabilize. The Federation of Trade Unions greatly welcomes the expansion of daily necessities rationing, but the rationing must be universal and comprehensive. All industrial workers and professional workers in the city who are paid according to the cost of living index should have the right to rationing, and there should be no partiality or neglect. If the rationing of daily necessities only reaches a portion of industrial workers or professional workers, and the cost of living index has been lowered due to the impact of rationing prices, then those who have not received rationed items will inevitably suffer losses, and this can easily cause disputes. Therefore, the Federation of Trade Unions hopes that the authorities will carefully consider this matter. Furthermore, the Federation of Trade Unions convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors today to discuss preparations for the May Day Labor Day celebrations.

### Retrocession Property Rental Fees Adjusted; Residents Notified to Pay the Difference

[Our Correspondent] The retrocession property managed by the China Trust Bureau Real Estate Department had its rental fees adjusted starting from January of this year, but it was not implemented at the time because it had not been approved by the Retrocession Property Clearing Office Review Committee. It is now learned that this rental fee has been approved by the Review Committee, and the department has notified all residents that the rental fee shortfall for January, February, and March of this year must be paid in full. The prices of retrocession properties are currently being reassessed due to price fluctuations. After completion, they will be sold in batches.

### Following Doctor's Advice for Cough, Mayor Quits Smoking

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is well known that Mayor Wu is a heavy smoker, invariably with a cigarette in his mouth while reviewing official documents or attending meetings. However, news circulated yesterday that Mayor Wu had surprisingly quit smoking. According to Wu himself, when speaking to reporters yesterday, he has recently been suffering from a cough and has been advised by his doctor to quit smoking, otherwise, he risks developing asthma and suffering adverse consequences. As such, he resolved to quit smoking starting last week. Reportedly, he felt empty, lonely, and extremely pained at the beginning, but after a week, he has grown accustomed to it. Furthermore, an American friend of Mayor Wu specially purchased a bag of candy from the United States as a gift, intended specifically for soothing his throat during the smoking cessation period. According to Wu, it has been very effective. It is reported that Mayor Wu used to smoke nearly a hundred cigarettes a day, so his abstinence is truly commendable.

### Conspiracy to Sabotage Power Plant: Iron Filings Found in Generator; Detailed Investigation Yields Clues

[Shanghai News Agency Report] At the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Electricity Company, a large quantity of iron filings and broken porcelain pieces were discovered inside the No. 3 horsepower engine in the workshop at midnight on the 1st of this month, causing the internal machinery to overheat, resulting in a serious situation. The No. 1 engine was immediately switched on to continue generating electricity, but the same situation recurred. Investigation revealed that the iron filings were remnants from the plant's lathe. It is suspected that a villain placed the iron filings and other debris under the oil filler cap, allowing them to flow into the axle with the oil, with the intention of sabotaging power generation. On that day, the workshop staff included British engineer Thorne and assistants Sun Zucheng and Chen Jiahua on the middle shift (3 PM to 10 PM), and American Jewish engineer Kobert and assistants Qu Jiongming and Wang Feiyun on the night shift (10 PM to 8 AM the next morning). A thorough investigation has been conducted by the plant, yielding initial clues and a highly advantageous piece of material evidence. The case has been jointly studied with the police局, and personnel have been dispatched to closely protect the generators.

Continuing the Search for Hidden Bandits

The search for hidden bandits in this city has resulted in the capture of over two hundred individuals as of yesterday. These individuals are currently detained at the Police Bureau and will be transferred to the Special Criminal Tribunal for investigation and trial within days. Previous reports that the Police Bureau had concluded its search for hidden bandits are inaccurate. It has been reliably learned that the list of Communist Party members in Shanghai obtained by the Police Bureau contains over four hundred names.

### Family Tragedy in a Property Grab: Pregnant Woman Beaten to Death in Chuansha, Pudong

Ding Zhenlin (25 years old), the wife of Zhang Shuntao (a mute) from Zhangshuntao's family in Wu Jia Nong, Heqing North, Chuansha, Pudong, had been raised in the Zhang family as a child bride since she was young. Her mother-in-law, Zhang Jinshi, was known for her domineering and cruel treatment. The second son, Zhang Kuntao, and son-in-law, Gu Quansheng, conspired to seize the mute's property. Seeing that Ding Zhenlin was an obstacle, they plotted to harm her. On the morning of the 29th of last month, at 10 AM, Zhang Jinshi beat Ding Zhenlin in the fields over a trivial matter. Zhang Kuntao and Gu Quansheng seized the opportunity to join in the assault. Ding Zhenlin, who was pregnant, could not withstand the beating and fainted on the spot. Gu Quansheng and others dragged her back home, claiming she was feigning death. They kicked her abdomen repeatedly with their leather shoes and inserted a wooden cudgel into her lower body, causing her labia minora to protrude, resulting in excessive bleeding and death. Seeing the tragedy that had unfolded, Zhang Jinshi immediately used a rope to hang Ding Zhenlin from a beam, falsely claiming the next morning that she had committed suicide. The truth was uncovered by Gu Chengxiang, the village chief of Qingxiang Township, who detained Zhang Jinshi and sent her to the judicial authorities for investigation. The second son, Zhang Kuntao, has fled out of fear of punishment. The victim's father, Ding Adong, rushed back from Shanghai and is currently petitioning the judicial authorities for severe punishment.

### Arrest Made in Draft-Dodging Scheme: Job-Seeking Youths Fall Prey; Four Suspects Arrested After Reporting to Police

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Returns to Shanghai to Talk: City-wide Grain Rationing to Be Implemented Long-Term; Still Dependent on American Rice, Which Needs to Be Ordered from Abroad

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, returned to Shanghai the night before last after official business in Nanjing. Yesterday, he met with reporters and answered questions on various issues, including grain rationing: (1) The plan for the Civil Food Allocation Committee to purchase arriving food grains has been jointly submitted by him and the director of the Allocation Committee to Mayor Wu. (2) The city-wide grain rationing, originally scheduled to be implemented for four months starting in March, has been decided to be continued long-term after discussions with Minister Yu of the Grain Department in Nanjing. The source of grain still relies on American rice, which needs to be ordered in large quantities from abroad. (3) The supplementary issuance of grain to workers for February is not being discussed at this time due to the issue of whether there is sufficient grain available.

City Government Decides on Purchase Policy

[Report from Our Newspaper] To balance the supply and demand of food grains and to maintain the livelihood of farmers without affecting production, the municipal government has decided to implement a purchase policy. Yesterday, Mayor Wu stated to reporters: The food grain purchase policy was drafted by the Civil Food Allocation Committee in the middle of last week and will be used in conjunction with the price fluctuations in the grain market in the future. When the supply of food grains exceeds demand, the price of grain will inevitably fall, and farmers' income from selling grain will not be enough to maintain their livelihoods, which will inevitably lead to an economic recession in rural areas, the consequences of which are unimaginable. To achieve a balance between supply and demand, the government plans to make timely purchases. If the grain market experiences price fluctuations and high prices, it will implement sales. It is firmly believed that the above policy can achieve the practical effect of stabilizing grain prices.

Reasons for Adjusting Grain Rationing Prices

When reporters inquired about the reasons for the increase in grain rationing prices this month, Mayor Wu stated: The United States has one principle regarding relief grain aid to China: (1) It is not purely for relief but aims to stabilize grain prices, and (2) the proceeds from the sale of grain are used for charitable relief throughout the country, and the scope of relief is not limited to the five cities with grain rationing. Furthermore, the United States and China have jointly established a ratio for the price of relief American rice, which cannot be lower than 5% of the free market price of rice. For this reason, the price of grain rationing had to be slightly adjusted. Mayor Wu also stated that if the grain rationing system had not been implemented in a timely manner, the price of grain in this city might have already exceeded the 5 million mark today. Relief American rice is currently being shipped continuously, and at a minimum, it can likely be maintained until the new grain comes on the market, so citizens do not need to panic.

Over Four Million Grain Ration Coupons Issued

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to an announcement by the Municipal Civil Survey Committee: In April, the committee issued 4,346,906 large-portion grain rationing coupons and 701,464 small-portion coupons, totaling 5,048,370 coupons. 281,298 coupons were returned and were verified and destroyed yesterday morning together with representatives from various agencies. The actual number of coupons issued was 4,767,072. The remaining uncollected coupons will be processed together with the already retrieved ones once they are collected. In April, 182,360 shi of American relief rice, 3,520 shi of white Xian rice, plus 103,435 shi and 7 dou and 3 sheng of rice from the remaining stocks from rice shops from March, a total of 289,215 shi and 7 dou and 3 sheng, had been distributed. As of April 4, a total of 49,011,694,325 yuan of grain sales revenue had been collected for the month (excluding the 5% profit that rice shops deduct as commission).

### Lawsuit Involving Gold Bars for Land Purchase: Two Women Fooled for Profit, Broker Accused of Fraud, Case Dismissed but Returned for Re-Investigation

[Our Report] The case of real estate brokers Chen Jisheng and Chen Chunsheng, accused of fraud, was originally dismissed by the District Prosecutor's Office, but was returned by the High Prosecutor's Office yesterday for re-investigation. It originated with Xu Xuying, wife of Zhuang Lihui of China Investment Company, and Zhou Xiujuan, owner of Xingxing Candy Company, who knew Mrs. Zhu. Mrs. Zhu had four mu of land at the intersection of Lin Sen West Road and Changshu Road, two mu of which had previously been bought by Yan Qingling, owner of Guangyu Real Estate Company, leaving two mu. In March of the 35th year [1946], Chen negotiated with Xu and Zhou, saying that Yan intended to buy the remaining two mu of land at a high price to build garden houses. Xu and Zhou then negotiated with Mrs. Zhu. Mrs. Zhu asked for 80 gold bars, plus four gold bars as a middleman fee. Chen advised Xu and Zhou to invest in purchasing it first, and then resell it to Yan to make more profit, and if they lacked funds, he could help them find a way. Xu and Zhou thought this was a good idea, so they borrowed 20 gold bars from Yongda Bank to pay Mrs. Zhu as a deposit. In addition to raising some funds themselves, they also borrowed 50 gold bars from Chen, with a monthly interest rate of 12%. Under the pressure of high-interest loans, Xu and Zhou wanted to sell the land, so they entrusted Chen to negotiate with Yan. However, according to Chen, Yan was only willing to pay 70 gold bars. At this point, Xu and Zhou realized they had been deceived, losing 25 gold bars including interest. Xu and Zhou then sued Chen for fraud in court.

### High Foreign Exchange Rate, Loose Credit, Renewed Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks

### Local and Out-of-Town Buyers Boost the Market, Cotton Yarn Market Thrives, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Re-Enters the 200 Million Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was stimulated by the sudden rise in foreign exchange rates, boosting buying interest. Out-of-town buyers became more active, and local buyers were also aggressively buying. Market sentiment was stronger than ever. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped 9 million at the opening, re-entering the 200 million yuan mark at 205 million yuan, and investor confidence improved significantly. Prices for other counts of coarse and fine yarn also followed Shanghai's lead.

Towards the closing, scattered individual investors took the opportunity to profit from the rise and sell at high prices. However, actual sales remained sluggish, and the market ultimately retreated. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn closed slightly lower at 202 million, but still up 6 million compared to the previous day.

21-count Double Horse yarn also rose by 2 million, while 32-count yarn of various brands saw weak prices due to an oversupply. Prices for coarse yarns such as 20-count and 16-count mostly increased by 500,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Later, many day traders sold, and the price fell slightly to 4.3 million yuan. Then, with the rise in the US dollar exchange rate, investor confidence suddenly increased, and the table saw a strong push. At the same time, Shanxi buyers also came in to purchase, greatly boosting the market. Longtou fine cloth rose from the low point to a peak of 4.478 million yuan. Wufu fine cloth also jumped from the low level of 4.14 million yuan to 4.24 million yuan, with some buying activity. Prices for other cloth also rose sharply. After 10:30, Fangjian sold cloth at a lower price than the market. At the same time, there were reports of stable yarn prices, which calmed investor confidence. Most scattered individual investors took profits and sold, and at noon closing, Longtou fine cloth retreated to 4.45 million yuan, still up 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Over-the-counter prices rose by 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. However, in the end, there were reports that yarn prices had not risen much and had fallen back to 4.4 million yuan, with some selling.

### Ministry of Education Recently Received Letter from the Ministry of Food: Distribution of Grain to Public School Teachers and Staff in Beijing and Tianjin, Situation of Pay for Teaching Staff, Employees, and Police in Various Colleges and Universities has Improved Compared to the Past

[Our Nanjing Report, 6th] Regarding the request from teaching staff, employees, and police in colleges and universities in Beijing and Tianjin for higher pay, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: "The government has always been concerned about the lives of educators and will do everything possible to improve their lives. Pay in Beijing and Tianjin is currently at the second level, higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, in the past, it was adjusted every three months, and by the end of March, there was inevitably a large gap with prices. Starting this month, it has been changed to monthly adjustments. Although this month's index has not yet been set, Beijing and Tianjin have already made advance payments based on 230,000 times the previous amount, so the situation is generally better than last month. Also, in the past, public school teachers and staff in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai were allocated eight dou of rice per month. Since January, it has been changed to a free allocation of three dou of rice per month for public school teachers and staff nationwide. Those who receive flour are changed in proportion. This is a general policy, not just for educators. A letter was received from the Ministry of Food stating that the distribution of public school grain and student grain in Beijing and Tianjin has been scheduled to begin this month and will be completed before the 15th of next month. The grain has been fully distributed and transported, so there should be no shortages. As for the increase in academic research funding, the Ministry has long planned for it and may be able to implement it soon."

[Our Nanjing Report, 6th] In order to encourage overseas Chinese students to return to China for further education, the Ministry of Education has previously promulgated preferential measures for implementation, and recently stipulated five points for attention on the summer referral of overseas Chinese students to universities for the 37th year [1948], and sent them to the relevant agencies for handling: (1) This year's referral of overseas Chinese students will be handled by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, important overseas Chinese groups at home and abroad, and our country's embassies and consulates abroad, and will be submitted to the Ministry for approval by the end of July. Referrals submitted after the deadline will not be distributed. (2) The referral of overseas Chinese students is limited to high school graduates from overseas Chinese schools within the past two years.

It is also found that there are currently 893 overseas Chinese students enrolled in colleges and universities in the country.

### Answers to Questions About Military Service (1); Described by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau

This year's conscription in the city, as decided by the military service conference, will implement formal conscription. This method involves conscripting according to the order of the lottery numbers. All procedures must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the law.

The formal procedure for conscription is: (1) Background investigation (including applications for exemption from military service, deferment of conscription, and substitute service), (2) Physical examination, (3) Lottery drawing, (4) Conscription. The lottery drawing in the city was held on March 23rd, and conscription will also be carried out soon. The examination of applications for exemption from military service and substitute service has largely been completed. Some citizens were not aware of this due to the recruitment of volunteers last year. They only became anxious when they learned that the city was going to conscript by lottery number. They have sent letters asking for explanations of the relevant military service laws, as well as the procedures and processes for handling military service matters. For the sake of convenience, a general answer is given below, summarizing the inquiries from all parties.

1.  Background Investigation:

(1) Firstly, regarding the investigation, the target of the investigation is men of conscription age. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, those who reach the age of twenty and pass the conscription physical examination in the following year are conscripted into active service. This year's conscription is based on last year's investigation. The age range investigated last year was five years, from those born in the 16th to the 12th year of the Republic. This lottery drawing is also based on last year's investigation.

(2) Shanghai, being the largest industrial and commercial area in China, has many citizens who have migrated from various places. Most citizens have two registered residences. According to the Military Service Law, conscription is to be carried out in the place of origin. If residing in another area, service may be performed in the place of residence after reporting and approval. Many men of conscription age have two registered residences and participate in the lottery in both places. How can one person serve in two places? This error must be corrected. The solution is simple. If fulfilling military service obligations in the place of origin, please obtain a certificate of service from the township or town office in the place of origin and ask the district chief in the place of residence to cancel the registration in the investigation roster to avoid duplication.

(3) Conscription is about to begin, and many men of conscription age are trying to report departures in the household registration, but in reality, the men have not moved out and are still working or operating in their original location. In recent times, migration has been frequent. This cowardly behavior of evading one's obligations to the country has a significant impact on military service administration. The government has consulted with representatives from public opinion organizations and relevant agencies and has issued a notice in March to suspend resettlement during the prescribed conscription period. As for the group of men who have moved out on the household registration but are still in the area, the Ministry of National Defense has been notified by telegram to give priority to conscripting and sending them to serve in the military as unregistered men and draft evaders. According to reports, the number of unregistered men and draft evaders is very large. This group of men is suspected of obstructing military service. It is hoped that men who have missed the lottery or evaded military service will quickly report to the district chief in charge, otherwise they will be subject to punishment in the future.

2. Examination of applications for exemption from military service, disqualification from military service, and deferment of conscription:

Those who have legitimate reasons to be exempt from military service, disqualified from military service, or defer military service are examined in accordance with Articles 4, 5, 24, and 26 of the Military Service Law, and are granted exemption from military service, disqualification from military service, and deferment of conscription, respectively, depending on the circumstances. The reasons for each clause, application procedures, required documents, and examination procedures are described below:

### Postal Service Q&A

(D) Stamp catalogs can be obtained from the bureau's philatelic group, and they have already been sent. (E) Postage rates for mail to Hong Kong, except for airmail fees and regular mail calculated according to domestic rates, are generally calculated according to international rates.

### Scientific Research Results Show Women Are More Easily Startled

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] China Natural Science Society News: Research institutions in the United States, using a group of brave young girls as test subjects, proved that women are more easily startled by unexpected sounds than men. However, they recover quickly, while men do not. This proves that nerve strain from work and overexertion in men is one of the main causes of stomach ulcers.

### "Yangzhou is Good"

— Hong Weifa

—Continuation of Yangzhou Dreams, No. 28

The poems on small pleasure boats written by the late Yangzhou Senior Xin Buyun, praise the past condition of searching the West Lake in Yangzhou, and truly makes one yearn for it. I have already mentioned it in another article. Following Mr. Xin, there is also the Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes by Layman Xing'an. The layman's surname is Huang, given name Dingming, styled Luqi. The Jiangdu County Chronicle says that he "was skilled in writing and had a reputation in the local school." It also says that his "calligraphy was in the Northern Dynasties style, obtaining its elegance. He was able to write poetry, and most of his works were discarded at will, but the Yangzhou Hao and Four Books poems still exist." These Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes, the tune borrowed from "Longing for the South of the River," its writing object is much wider than the small pleasure boat poems, and everything such as Yangzhou's historical sites, customs, habits, and local products are mentioned, which can be read as a small Yangzhou gazetteer. My late maternal great-grandfather Zang Yisun wrote four quatrains of poems for the title, and the first poem said: "The book records the fleeting time like a shuttle, what is the local customs like in my hometown? The hundred tunes are cleverly written, and only then do I realize how good Yangzhou is!" The fourth poem says: "When the small pleasure boat floats in the setting sun, I once wrote poems on the lake with Xin Lang; I have failed to live up to the good weather of the lotus flowers, not as good as Huang Jiu's good lyrics." His praise of Yangzhou Hao Hundred Tunes is truly not to flatter his own preferences.

Everything written in Yangzhou Hao has undergone great changes after decades, but because it is written very intimately and meaningfully, it can still evoke some old dreams in me. For example, it says:

Yangzhou is good! Grand ceremonies are held to welcome spring. The bear sedan is carried by eight people to admire the colorful clothes, the ox whip moves three feet to activate the incense celebration, followed by the Mang God.

Yangzhou is good! Divine gatherings parade the City God. Women with muddy knees worship incense devoutly, charming young men and girls stick shoulder to shoulder to follow the procession, all at once benefiting the widows and orphans.

Yangzhou is good! Grand festivals parade the Dutian God. Jasmine thousands of flowers woven into fans, two parts of sheng and flute lead the swings, and the pavilions tower into the clouds.

Yangzhou is good! Water gatherings pass by in the deep night. Cinnamon oars welcome the City God, lotus lanterns are released to fill the moat, and many monks from the market perform alms giving.

These many activities of welcoming gods and temple fairs have almost disappeared today, but they were still very lively in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. Although I have never played the "Mang God," nor have I "stuck shoulder to shoulder to follow the procession," nor have I taken care of the "gege" or released lanterns for alms giving, I have often followed my family in and out of the crowd, dancing and laughing gleefully. At that time, there were also blind men's temple fairs, which were especially interesting.

Yangzhou is good! Temple fairs are called double blinds. White eyes are added horizontally to pity and redeem vows, red flags are held together to stumble and fall, and unexpected events must be guarded against!

This is what is written about this matter. It is a pity that there are not few blind people in Yangzhou now, but such temple fairs are no longer eye-opening.

In addition, Yangzhou Hao says:

Yangzhou is good! Flower markets tempt you to linger. Clear shade surrounds the house, protected by reed screens, and rows of dense and colorful plants are planted in tile pots, showing elegant intentions to pity the talented.

The number of flower markets shows that there are many people who love flowers when they are in season. Zheng Banqiao once said that Yangzhou "plants flowers for ten miles as farming," although it is an exaggeration, it is true that Yangzhou people loved flowers and plants in the past. From this, we can see the "elegance" of Yangzhou people in the past. It also says:

Yangzhou is good! Storytelling workshops break the melancholy. Talking about Fei Tuo, the aftertaste is beautiful, listening to Pi Qian, the knowledge is broad, and everyone laughs heartily.

"Fei Tuo" refers to "The Biography of Fei Tuo Zi," and "Pi Qian" refers to "Qingfeng Gate." This is authentic Yangzhou storytelling, and non-natives will not fully understand many of the slang terms in it. Yangzhou people are happy to listen to it, and children's eyebrows dance when they hear or talk about Fei Tuo or Pi Qian. From this, we can see the "leisure" of Yangzhou in the past. "Leisure" and "elegance" were originally the typical life of Yangzhou people in the past. Unfortunately, there are very few flower markets in Yangzhou now, and the flower affairs are declining, no longer as splendid as in the past. There are still people who tell stories about Qingfeng Gate, but there are no longer any who tell stories about Fei Tuo Zi. As far as the Yangzhou storytelling world is concerned, it is especially sad to see the passing of the old generation.

Finally, regarding the educational situation in Yangzhou in the late Qing Dynasty, Yangzhou Hao also said, such as:

Yangzhou is good! Several levels of schools have opened. Names distinguish official and private education, courses combine Chinese and foreign to cultivate talents, and there is one class per year!

Yangzhou is good! Broad exercise fields have been opened. People jump and run like toads, and groups grab balls like lions, and from now on the nation will be strong!

Yangzhou is good! Girls' schools gather fairy ladies. Black-faced books are tucked in their arms, and yellow bags are carried in their hands, truly competing with the boys!

Perhaps Mr. Huang sees it very unpleasantly, so the words and sentences are full of satirical components. It also says:

Yangzhou is good! Northern and Southern operas share the stage. Famous actors perform in two groups every day, and students swarm in with half-price tickets, closing and opening again and again!

This is precisely the fashionable behavior of fashionable young people in the past. When I was young, I had infinite envy for such actions, but now when I read this poem by Mr. Huang, it only arouses infinite melancholy. Even if I could go back in time and relive my childhood, I am afraid I would no longer have the courage to envy, and I would let it be placed in the old dreams!

### Soliloquy

— Guo Tian

In the sunless, secluded path, pacing back and forth, back and forth, the bamboo grove sobs softly; the water under the bridge sighs, the solemn wooden fish of the ancient temple, with the hope of a life, resounds in the evening clear sky, once and again...

The edge of the bamboo forest is connected to a desolate, yellow field. I walked from the dark bamboo path to the bright field, slowly, tapping the grass with my hand.

Blue sky, distant mountains, the eagle soars, circling in the high sky. I think, how free it is to have wings! To fly over mountains after mountains, to make a long march of ten thousand miles; to break through the roaring waves, to greet the dawn's rising sun... However, people, people only have the freedom of thought...

--Thought, is the free wings of man!

With the wings of man unfolded, traveling in that desolate desert, the snow-covered Northwest Plateau, the primitive wilderness, the beautiful world of the future, the magical things in the magical country....

In these sick days, in this ancient temple in the deep mountains, I have forgotten the dim home, the people living in the dilapidated village and the wilderness. I flap my wings of life, flying in the colorful sunshine.

### Reply

— Tie Ming

Last night, she

Sobbed for me—

Said I

Why

So thin,

Unaware of cherishing.

My heart

Is like

A withered lotus in the cold wind,

Broken, astringent;

How often have I

Weaved

But I don't want to—

Don't want to say.

### Memories of Kunming

— Li Puyuan

It was getting dark, and the several gentlemen who came with me were not at home. Although the sound of cars on the road was endless, in this corner of the small building, it was so quiet that I could hear the footsteps of the rats. I was lying on the table, writing about Jiang E'erwen and Di Jiang Fogerson.

"Excuse me, is there a Mr. Li at home?"

Turning my head sharply, it was Liu Shi!

It has been almost ten years! In Kunming, two frustrated people met for the first time, hit it off right away, complained together, ate things together, played together at the fishing platform, and also performed Dumas' "La Dame aux Camélias." In the winter of 1939, I was forced to leave this blessed land where it is like spring all year round, and since then, there has been no news.

Now, almost ten years have passed, and I never thought I would meet him in this lonely dusk.

He was still so energetic, still so enthusiastic, and still so eloquent. Seeing him brought back so many memories, so many flavors of Kunming—the orchards of Chenggong, the steep peaks of the West Mountain, the camellias of Huating Temple, the ice crystals of the Cuihu Hotel...

Memories, one after another, and finally, we talked about painting again.

"I now specialize in painting fish," he said.

"Isn't that great? I believe that with your intelligence, the fish you paint must be extraordinary." This is the truth. Among the many friends in the painting world, I have always admired his intelligence.

"But I'm going to be scolded to death!" The last two words were still in the Kunming accent.

"Why?" I stared at him.

"Isn't it the same old thing?" He smiled contemptuously, his little beard tilted to one side, but it immediately recovered and became very serious. "People scold me for wanting to apply Western painting to Chinese painting, making it neither Chinese nor Western! Heaven knows, painting is just painting, isn't it? Look--" As he spoke, he unfolded a five-foot-long single Xuan paper in his hand, on which was a hibiscus branch and more than ten dace fish. "These fish were painted by me. Can you say how much is Western painting and how much is Chinese painting?"

I turned on the light and turned from his excited face, which was slightly red, to the more than ten fish: they were expressed with transparent colors, light brushstrokes, and very skilled techniques, and finished in one go. Those fish were gathering and chattering about something in the clear water. His light, lively, and natural style, in this type of fish and in his personal style, is a natural product of himself.

"What's wrong with that? Didn't you express the nature and soul that you felt intuitively with great confidence? Isn't that what you were seeking?"

He laughed. From his smile, I saw Kunming again, and at the same time, I saw the cherry blossoms blooming outside the window.

### Carp

— Liu Shi

### Inscription on Liu Shi's Fish Love Picture

— Ma Gongyu

Encounter

Leaning on reeds, two small fish lie in ambush, suddenly seeing a red dress, eyes bright, I am more beautiful than Qing Lang, washing gauze at the Bing Cave, but meeting you.

Pursuit

The empty pool raises a thousand ripples, knowing that you are a high scholar but have not yet been transformed, inches away from flowing water, shy to avoid face, willing to bother Qingdao to send a letter of love.

Traveling Together

Playing in pairs on the waves, this is an ordinary towel, laughing at those who shrink their necks, there are immortals, peach blossoms are thousands of feet long, love is thousands of feet deep, occupying all the scenery in the spring at the bottom of the water.

Achievement

No need to envy mandarin ducks in the Jin River, flounder float lightly and the algae are fragrant, surprised to find the royal family destroyed, how can the jianghu jiazi forget each other.

### Song of the Earth

— Qingguo

Flowers

The earth is rich in emotions, and the earth opens into繁[繁]花朵[朵]。

The earth loves fighting, loves freedom, loves life……

And the flowers bloom red, yellow, blue……

Now there are red yellow and blue flowers everywhere ah

Young people yo throw away those two branches of black and white flowers of grief and sorrow that are inserted in your chest!

Because these ugly flowers will soon wither and beautiful flowers are already flourishing.

Forest

Everywhere are dense forests.

The earth has too many forests: the earth has green forests, red forests; the earth has dawn's forest, the sun's forest; the earth has young and robust forests; the earth has forests that love to talk and laugh……

When I walk into any forest I feel that they are so mysterious and magical deep and vast.

I feel that every tree in the forest is simply a thought that has been drawn from the earth's chest.

So the earth is the smartest after all!

### Recent World Literature

— Zhao Jingshen

Romain Rolland's Autobiography

Recently, a "Philosophy Book" was published in New York, containing Romain Rolland's autobiography, "Journey Within." This fragment of autobiography is for those already interested in Romain Rolland, not for those who want to get to know him. In other words, this is not an introductory book of common knowledge; these fragments are impressionistic and sometimes mysterious, requiring great effort from the translator, Elsie Pell.

The author writes about his childhood, feeling imprisoned by that life. He talks about his own illnesses, the deep impact of his little sister's death, his belief in Spinoza's philosophy, the loss of his traditional Catholic faith, his ancestors and his relationship with his parents, his early creative attempts, his lifelong love of music, his dealings with Rome, the creation of the character Jean-Christophe, his final friendship with Malwida von Meysenburg, the impact of World War I on him, and so on.

Malwida was quite familiar with Wagner and Nietzsche, Mazzini and Herzen. She raised her cold but calm hand to the young Rolland, and looked at him passionately with her wise eyes. He was greatly influenced by her. He said, "Malwida's love helped me. Her wise heart makes you trust yourself. Brightness shines, giving you warmth. My spirit thus gained new strength. She is a friend who understands you, a friend who creates you."

This situation is similar to his observation of Rome: "She does not hide her secrets; perhaps she has no secrets. But she shows yourself to you. All who know her do not know her, but discover themselves."

Rolland's work "Colas Breugnon" is better than the lengthy and cumbersome "Jean-Christophe." However, even though the latter is cumbersome, terrible, and lacks stylistic elegance, each part of this monumental work, as well as the sum of all parts, approached with the greatest patience, is truly great. Apart from this book, the author had no such creative power, nor such painful post-war experiences. At that time, Barrès and Thomas Mann were both against him. Barrès spat out his resentment. Thomas Mann opposed civilization based on German culture, even saying: "Humanity degenerates through peace. 'Lazy rest' is the tomb of 'courage.' Law is the friend of the weak, the purpose of law is to balance the world, war is strength.'"

Romain Rolland's strength is heroic, and the pressure he endured was particularly great. "Jean-Christophe" will ensure his eternal existence.

Two Novels by Mauriac

Two recent novels by the great French novelist François Mauriac (1885—) have been translated into English: one called "Thérèse" and the other called "Vipers' Tangle."

"Thérèse" is composed of four stories, two longer and two shorter, all writing about the same protagonist, Thérèse. They were written at different times, from about 1927 to 1933. The original French versions were published separately, but now the translator, Gerard Hopkins, has combined them.

The story of Thérèse can be said to be a story of crime and punishment. Mauriac studies the southwest of France, which he knows well. In the first story, it begins with Thérèse being accused of attempting to poison her husband, Bernard, and having just been acquitted by the court. She is on her way home, planning how to poison her husband.

In the latter two stories, she is already eleven or twelve years older than before. In the former, she is almost insane; in the latter, she seeks love from a younger man. The former is written worse, the latter is better, and the best should be the last long novel, "The End of the Night" (1935). She seeks love throughout her life, but seems to be unsuccessful. She said very early on: "I don't know what love is. It is just the goal I often desire. This goal possesses me, blinds me, makes my legs stand on wasteland, throws me against walls, forces me into the mud, and exhausts me in the mire." Now it talks about her daughter's life. Her daughter also falls in love with a young man, which is a painful test for her. This is a cruel trial, a major blow, and her body and mind collapse. Later, she spent many years in prison. Only death can free her. She waits for death, and the story ends.

Is this Mauriac's best novel? According to his position in the modern French literary scene, although this work is very delicate, it is not entirely flawless. The first part makes the reader interested in the heroine and is touching. The last part is not very satisfying. The overall structure lacks a sense of harmony.

"Vipers' Tangle" was published in France in 1933 and is the story of a madman, mostly written in diary form. The title is particularly symbolic; the knotted vipers symbolize the family's mutual jealousy and the protagonist's complex emotions. Like Dostoevsky, Mauriac's characters are complex, ambiguous, and illogical. In 1939, Jean-Paul Sartre, still unknown, attacked him for writing characters who were merely passive puppets in a chess game. More recently, he has been attacked by anti-Manicheans, saying that he is a spokesman for conservative diners.

As a novelist, he was influenced by Dostoevsky; as a poet, he was influenced by Baudelaire. He is worthy of being one of the greatest writers in the world, and it is fortunate that his two books have been translated into English.

### On "Scholars"

— Wu Yong

Not long ago, someone in Jiang Guo called on China's intellectual class to step forward in the turbulent times, shoulder some responsibility, and play a role. This matter, on the one hand, shows the American people's concern for China, and on the other hand, reflects the American people's emphasis on the intellectual class.

"Intellectual class" is a new term. We originally had similar terms, called "scholars," or more popularly, "reading people." In the past, our country also valued reading scholars, but looking at the four professions of "scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants," "scholars" ranked first. The ancient saying "Scholars can be killed, but not humiliated" also gave "scholars" a particularly lofty position, as if to say that people belonging to other classes can be insulted, and that scholars, even if there is a difference, must be given special consideration and cannot be punished casually. Probably also as a result of this concept, the Qing scholars did not have to kneel down and perform great salutes when they saw officials, and officials could not casually beat the scholars' buttocks.

According to the author's personal opinion, such emphasis on reading scholars may overestimate the identity of scholars too much. It must be known that scholars are only one class among many classes in society, and their status should not be particularly superior to other classes. After ten years of war in our country, in fact, the status of "scholars" in society has been reversed and has undergone a great change. Those who used to respect scholars are now quite inclined to despise scholars. The reason is nothing more than that during the war, people valued livelihood the most, and the problem of eating was particularly important, while scholars were most ignorant of livelihood problems. In the process of survival competition, they inevitably performed lifelessly. In the midst of currency fluctuations, most people in society either hoarded goods or speculated, and there were quite a few people who made a fortune from the national crisis. As a result of "not engaging in production," scholars naturally became poor reading people. Greed is human nature. People witnessed the glory and wealth of those nouveau riches, returning home in brocade, and inevitably ridiculed those poor reading people as "poor and sour," and harbored the idea of looking down on them. In my humble opinion, this also lowers the status of scholars too much. Although this is a reaction against the past excessive emphasis on scholars, it is also unnecessary to overcorrect.

It is just that today, the scholars of our country are indeed facing a major crisis, and there is a great need to reconsider their own position. In fact, the respect of the Chinese people for reading people in the past also contained some snobbish effects, because only reading scholars could enter the court to become officials and enjoy glory and wealth. Secondly, the reading people in our country are a minority class, "rarity is valued," and scholars are regarded as privileged members of society. Therefore, today's scholars have been reduced to civilians, losing their original special status, which is also the result of the natural progress of society.

In this era of great upheaval, society is evolving forward. Although we cannot predict in which direction the evolution is taking, one thing is certain: the era of only eating and not working, only knowing how to enjoy and not knowing how to fulfill one's due obligations, will eventually disappear. And the so-called scholar class in our country, generally speaking, is a leisure class that enjoys more than it works. The highest ideal of social evolution is "each according to his ability, each according to his needs." We ask the scholars of our country, apart from a few learned scholars who can still write some impractical books and establish some empty theories, what "virtue" do they have, what "ability" do they have? Monks chant scriptures and meditate, knowing that they are only consumers in society, so they eat vegetarian food, wear simple clothes, and strive for simplicity in everything. However, the majority of the ten people in our country, although not really "unable to restrain a chicken," their contribution to society is equal to that of monks who have become monks, and the enjoyment they demand is ten or a hundred times that of monks. Its unreasonableness is obvious. This is something that our scholar class should reflect on.

Of course, the ancients had a set of moving explanations for the role of scholars in society, saying that scholars, on the one hand, enjoy the food, clothing, and shelter provided by the people, and at the same time, they are busy eliminating harm for the people, so that the people can live and work in peace, and do not have to worry about political affairs anymore; according to this, the relationship between scholars and other classes is a relationship of division of labor and cooperation. Although this theory makes sense in theory, we must know that the reason why scholars have become a class of their own is only the result of the lack of universal education. In the future, once education is universal, people will all have the opportunity to read, and people will all become scholars; what will the situation be like at that time? In the author's opinion, if future scholars do not seek other developments and purely take the position of scholars as a starting point, their main outlets will be no more than two: the first is to teach future generations with what they have learned, which is teaching, which was called sitting in a hall in the past; the second is "learning to be excellent then serving as an official," which is becoming an official. But in fact, where would there be so many vacancies for teaching or becoming officials?

Therefore, today, scholars must seek other ways out. Relying solely on the empty name of scholars, there will be absolutely no hope of development in future society, because the scholar class will inevitably be eliminated in the future. In an ideal society, farmers, artisans, merchants, scholars, and soldiers will all be scholars. Therefore, scholars must simultaneously be farmers, artisans, merchants, scholars, or soldiers in order not to become parasites in society.

### Portuguese Businessmen

— Li Li

In the Qing Dynasty, Portuguese individuals sailed in fleets of large sailing ships and round ships to Lisbon every year, fully loaded with wool fabrics, fine glass products, clocks produced in England and the Netherlands, and wine produced in Portugal; then they visited various seaports to exchange for various goods.

The ships sailed from Goa to the Aegean Sea, exchanging for spices and gems; from the Aegean Sea to Malacca, exchanging for spices and sandalwood; then sailed to Macau, China, exchanging for silk fabrics; then turned to Japan, exchanging for gold and silver ingots; then returned to Macau, and then fully loaded with gold, silver, musk, pearls, ivory products, fine woodwork, lacquer porcelain, and silk fabrics, and returned to Europe.

### Price Increase is Good

— Yi Jun

Tomorrow is April 1st, and I heard that the price of photography is going to increase. I told this shocking news at home, and immediately gathered 300,000 yuan, and rushed to the photo studio that night to wash half a dozen photos each for myself and my two sisters. This matter is indeed "people are of one mind." The photo studio was booming and lively.

Having done this thing tonight, let him increase the price tomorrow. What does it have to do with me? On the way home, I felt a kind of "cheap" comfort in my heart.

Thinking carefully, isn't that how we usually react to fluctuations in any commodity price? Whenever we hear news that a certain commodity is going to increase in price, we always buy desperately, for fear of being behind others. As a result, this commodity is immediately sold out, and those who are left out consider themselves unlucky.

Think about it, what kind of advertising in the world can compare with the words "price increase"? As long as you shout the preliminary command of "price increase" or make a preliminary gesture of "price increase," you are guaranteed that your goods will be sold out quickly and the banknotes will pile up like mountains. Not only can you save a lot of advertising fees in a passive way, but also, in an active way, its effect of attracting customers is ten thousand times better than ordinary paid advertising. From the perspective of the boss, of course, "price increase is good." And on the customer side? Buying goods before the price increase is considered to have taken advantage. If the price does not increase, they feel that they have not taken advantage. Therefore, from the perspective of the buyer, they also feel that "price increase is good." As for those who "slowly follow and climb later" and are left out? It doesn't matter. Let's buy the goods that have increased in price for the time being. Soon, the price of the goods will increase again, then the goods that you bought at the increased price before will be cheap again at this time. At this time, wouldn't you feel a kind of "taking advantage" pleasure! In this way, price increases are always good.

Conversely, what about price drops? It goes without saying that the store owner suffers a loss, but the buyer is not necessarily comfortable. Why is the buyer uncomfortable? I can also give an example of a personal experience to illustrate: Yesterday, the school began to reissue the public sale of rice for February to each student, 2.3 dou. Many publicly funded students sold this 2.3 dou of rice because they are now boarding at the school. I also bought one share, priced at 575,000 yuan, equivalent to 2.5 million yuan per stone. I was triumphant, feeling that I had taken advantage. Who knew that the students who sold it today all sold it for 500,000 yuan per share, which was a price drop compared to yesterday. I felt that I had suffered a loss yesterday, and I was indeed a little uncomfortable. If they sold it for 600,000 yuan today, then I would definitely be happy that I had bought a cheap product. This matter can also indirectly prove that "price increase is good."

Since price increases are so good, why not increase them?

### Diplomatic Language

— Shuang

American diplomacy only emphasizes the brain and not the feet. — C.G. Dawes, author of the Dawes Plan —

Frank and clear — the art of deceiving and confusing people lies in this. — British Prime Minister B. Disraeli

There are three kinds of animals in the world. When they seem to be coming, they are actually gone, and when they seem to be going, they are actually coming. One is a diplomat, one is a woman, and one is a crab. — Hai John, the originator of the open door policy

An ambassador is an honest man sent to a foreign country to lie specifically for the benefit of his country. — Sir H. Wotton

I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats. I just have to tell the truth and they will never believe me. — C. Carnot

When a diplomat says "yes," he means "maybe," when he says "maybe," he means "no," and a person who says "no" is definitely not a diplomat.

The most important thing is: (1) do not set up non-luxurious banquets, (2) pay more attention to women. — Napoleon's instructions when he appointed Archbishop Mien as the ambassador to England

Diplomats are fortunate to have long noses, because their vision often cannot extend beyond their noses. — Former French Ambassador to the United States P. Claudel

### From Ideal to Practice

— Mao Yi

Almost every major invention has been hindered by people with conservative ideas. Six months after the Wright brothers first flew a plane, a famous American scientist shamelessly said that flying was impossible. When Edison's first electric light was tested, the president of the "Stevens Institute of Technology" poured cold water on it, saying that the test was a "failure." … When Germany built the first railway, doctors solemnly said: The train's fast speed of fifteen miles per hour would cause the passengers' blood to gush out of their eyes, mouths, and ears.

This opposition to change is often insisted upon by those who believe that change will cost them money. Capital and labor are equally opposed to new machines and new methods. The owners of British carriage firms used ridiculous laws to exclude the first steam cars. In Florence, Italy, when some merchants first adopted Arabic numerals to record payments, other merchants believed that this time-saving counting method was greatly detrimental to themselves. They did not think of abandoning the inconvenient Roman numerals to learn Arabic numerals, but in 1299, they enacted laws to prohibit the use of Arabic numerals.

There must be a long period of time between the emergence of a new idea and its widespread use. Someone analyzed the results of nineteen major inventions between 1888 and 1913, and the average was: 176 years from the generation of the idea to the creation of a concrete model. The first actual application was another 24 years behind. It took another 174 years for it to truly become a commodity, and it took another 12 years for it to become a necessity in society.

This long period of time is caused by the majority of people in society. Human beings have long developed inertia, which not only hinders their own feet, but also hinders the few prophets and pioneers.

### Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Weather — the only material for some people's conversations. As the saying goes, "relying on the sky for food" and "leaving it to fate," who says otherwise?

If sunflowers are pro-Japanese, then goosefoot, maple trees, and monthly red roses must be red party members without a doubt. Does the weeping willow not know "left-leaning," or is the willow "right-leaning"? Still needs to be confirmed. Peony is the king of flowers, and the imperialist is the host. Orchid has the fragrance of a king, and it is obviously a remnant of feudalism that still exists. — "If people can understand words, there will be a lot of things to do." The flowers are sighing.

The cicadas on the branches, regardless of everything, shout "I know, I know" all day long. Obviously they don't know, but they still desperately "know." — singing a high tune.

The proud rabbit took a nap during the race, and as a result, the tortoise won.

In fact, if it had woken up earlier, it might have been in time. — No, it would definitely have been in time.

When the flower withers, the fragrance is gone; when a person dies, his fragrance is still there, and forever. — if he really has fragrance.

The peach blossoms outside the curtain are particularly beautiful, and it is also particularly cute to look at people from a distance.

### Xiaoyao Hua

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 Xiaoyao at Sea (210)

Zhu Zhai knew that Feng Sheng had never had any opinions and must have listened to Han Yu's words, so she could be so resolute. The result of coming today can be said to be still zero. Yun Qing believes that her letter has power, but it is still ineffective. I might as well go to Yun Qing's house again and tell her what happened, and ask her to think of a way. Yun Qing is a warm-hearted but cold-faced person. If I ask her repeatedly, she will definitely understand me. Zhu Zhai sat silently in the chair and thought quietly for a while. He felt that there was no other way but to bother Yun Qing. Then he sighed and said, "Since you are so determined, I have nothing to say. I very much agree that Feng Sheng, you can be independent. If you need my help in the future, I will still fulfill my obligations." Feng Sheng said, "I don't need your help." Han Yu hurriedly interjected, "That's not how you should say it. You should help each other. Mr. Xu helps Feng Sheng, and Feng Sheng also helps Mr. Xu. You two, on the surface, are each going your own way, but in spirit, you are still cooperating together. I hope you two can cheer up and work hard to move forward. I wish you success." Feng Sheng and Zhu Zhai's stalemate was finally broken by Han Yu's words. Although both of them were sad in their hearts, they reluctantly showed a little smile after hearing Han Yu's words and thanked her for her kindness. Zhu Zhai took this opportunity to stand up, nodded to Han Yu and said, "Thank you for your kindness! I am very grateful to you!" Then he nodded to Feng Sheng and said, "I hope you take care of yourself. I will come to see you again before I leave Beiping, and even after I leave Beiping, I will write to you." Feng Sheng just stood there woodenly, without saying a word. I don't know if she was sad or resentful in her heart. Seeing that she had no expression, Zhu Zhai had to say goodbye and left, feeling very melancholy in his heart. He felt that Feng Sheng was usually a person with no opinions and was very easy to be moved by her enthusiasm and change her views. He did not expect that she would know this Miss Han and have her give her ideas. Now that she has been caught by Han Yu, it is impossible to change her psychology again. I will tell Yun Qing about this situation and see if she has any good ideas. If she is at a loss, I will trouble her again. In the end, she cannot refuse me. She has deep feelings for me and cannot ignore me. After Zhu Zhai decided on his idea, he hired a rickshaw and rushed straight to Yun Qing's house.

### Celebrating Grandfather Sa (Part 1)

—

Old General Sa's benevolent and amiable image, resembling the compassionate appearance of Guanyin of the South Sea (see page 2 of the March 21st Shen Bao), meets us again. He has been almost forgotten by the world, but he is truly an old man most worthy of being remembered. He is a military man, yet more gentle and refined than scholars; he is a noble official, yet more simple and unpretentious than commoners. Everything about him is unique!

The old man is celebrating his ninetieth birthday this year. "Few live to seventy since ancient times," seventy is already a "rare age," let alone eighty? Let alone ninety? Truly rare indeed. Speaking of senior officials in the political arena that can be pointed to at present, there is Chen Kuilong, the former Governor-General of Zhili under the Qing dynasty, residing in Shanghai, who is ninety-two years old this year. This one representing the civil and the other representing the military can be considered two elder stars, both high-ranking officials of the first rank during the Qing dynasty. (After the victory, Mr. Chen even sent a telegram to intercede for his former master, the Pu Emperor; this person seems to be still alive.)

The old man is a general, a veteran commander, who commanded great power in his time, holding the fate of the three armies. But he never grew a beard in his life. Therefore, when President Xu Shichang appointed old Sa as acting Prime Minister, there was a doggerel in the newspaper saying, "Old and yet ascends the stage, Sa Zhenbing," meaning he was like the old Lady Yang (Yu Taijun) in a play, mounting the stage to appoint generals. Even at this venerable age of ninety, his lips and chin are still as bare as Ox Mountain. If it were not clearly stated that it was "Sa Gong Zhenbing," people might mistake him for someone's grandmother. (At that time, there were two people famous for being "beardless" in the northern political circles, one was Sa Weng, and the other was Wang Shitong Shuheng, the father of Wang Yintai. There were also two people famous for having "big beards," one was Sun Baoqi Muhun, who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs during Yuan Shikai's time, and the Prime Minister during Cao Kun's time; and the other was Wang Dantang, "Big Beard" Wang.)

More than ten years ago, the old man suddenly had the grand idea of touring the north. People thought that since he had retired to his hometown for many years, he might have some lingering affection for the old capital. But, unexpectedly, he did not linger in Tianjin or Beijing, but instead made a big circle in the desolate and cold areas outside the Great Wall, in the Northwest. When the Japanese invaders were rampaging in "Manchuria and Mongolia," some suspected that he had some investigative mission, which was inconsistent with his idle status. Later, when talking with Elder Chen Youyong (also from Fujian, also a senior figure in the naval circles), it was revealed that the old man was specifically there to repair the tomb in the Zi Tai Mo area. The Sa family is a large clan in Fujian, but in the national genealogy, it is a rare surname. It is said that they were originally part of Genghis Khan's troops, and due to Kublai Khan's unification of the Central Plains, they were assigned land to garrison and assimilate in Fujian, thus becoming Han Chinese. Historically, this is not uncommon, and it is not limited to this one surname. (In the Three Kingdoms period, there was Samo Ke; in the Yuan Dynasty, there was the minister Sa Dun; both are transliterations, and the original text of the Sa surname should have been more than one character.)

In the past, the generals of the Northern Warlords, such as Old Duan and Old Feng, were all arrogant and hot-tempered. But old Sa was always amiable and had a kind expression. Although he was the leader of the military, he was more gentle and refined than scholars. Xu Shichang appointed him as Prime Minister because at that time, the political tides were turbulent, and those sharp-edged politicians and bureaucrats were constantly vying for power, causing almost a complete collapse. He had no choice but to ask him to temporarily maintain the situation. When others were seizing power, old Sa remained indifferent. When old Xu asked him to come forward, he did not decline or push back, saying that it was fine if it was fine, and there was nothing he could not do. All parties had no ill will or jealousy towards him, and all regarded him as a "Mr. Nice Guy" and a peacemaker. According to the old-style bureaucracy, it is not surprising to have a "Mr. Nice Guy," but in the case of a naval admiral, it must be considered special. Yang Xiaolou was a leading figure in martial arts, but his demeanor was more refined than a male lead in civil plays. People called it "performing martial arts in a civil manner," and old Sa's style was quite similar.
