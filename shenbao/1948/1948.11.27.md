### Approved Resignation of Weng Wenhao, Sun Ke Appointed as President of the Executive Yuan, Heads of Ministries and Commissions to be Decided Next Week, Presidential Orders and Official Communications

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Presidential order on the 26th: (1) Weng Wenhao, President of the Executive Yuan, requested to resign from his position with sincere words and earnest requests. Weng Wenhao is hereby permitted to resign from his current position. This order is issued. (2) Sun Ke is hereby appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan. This order is issued.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] President Chiang nominated Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. The official communication No. 25, asking the Legislative Yuan for approval on the 26th, is as follows: "Weng Wenhao, President of the Executive Yuan, is approved to resign. It is proposed to appoint Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Sun has served as President of both the Executive and Legislative Yuan, and as Minister of Communications, Finance, and Railways for many years. He has rich experience and outstanding reputation. I am confident that he will be able to fulfill the role happily. Therefore, in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, I hereby request your approval so that he can be appointed. This is communicated to the Legislative Yuan, President Chiang Kai-shek."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The long-pending issue of the President of the Executive Yuan was successfully resolved on the 26th with a sudden turn of events. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, was transferred to become the second President of the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution. This was approved by the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the majority of the Legislative Yuan on the morning and afternoon of the 26th, respectively. The resignation of the former President, Weng Wenhao, and the heads of various ministries and commissions was also approved at the same time. Sun's Executive Yuan will appear with a new style, inviting powerful figures from all sides to participate, strengthening the lineup, and establishing a new Executive Yuan with the unity of the entire party, refreshing the ears and eyes of domestic and international figures. It is reported that the decision to transfer Sun Ke to the President of the Executive Yuan was the result of President's careful consideration and research over a long period. He proposed it to Sun on the 25th. Sun was planning to go to Shanghai to the Sino-Belgian Radium Hospital for medical treatment of his leg ailment. Suddenly, on the morning of the 25th, he received two long-distance calls from the President, instructing him to come to Nanjing that day to discuss important matters. Sun returned to Nanjing at noon on the 25th and visited the President that evening for a long talk of two hours. The President told him that he intended to invite Sun to head the Executive Yuan and overcome the current difficulties together. After detailed discussions, Sun agreed to consider. At 10:00 am on the 26th, the President personally visited the Legislative Yuan to listen to Sun's reply to form a cabinet in 15 minutes. Immediately afterwards, the President, in his capacity as the Director-General of the Kuomintang, presided over the Central Standing Committee and approved Sun's appointment. At noon, in his capacity as the President, he sent a letter to the Legislative Yuan to conduct a consent vote. The results of the Legislative Yuan's vote were announced at 4:20 pm. The smoothness and speed of the process were incomparable to the previous formation of Weng's cabinet. However, due to medical reasons, Sun's inauguration will be postponed for a week.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Political figures here generally believe that Sun Ke's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is of great significance. This move not only resolves the issue of President Weng's resignation, which has been delayed for four weeks, allowing the almost-stalled government affairs to continue to advance, but also the wartime system issue, which has been brewing for many days, will be concretely realized through Sun Ke's organization of a new Executive Yuan. It is said that when Sun agreed to consider taking office as President of the Executive Yuan, he requested that the recent past Presidents of the Executive Yuan and important leaders of the Legislative Yuan be invited to participate in the Executive Yuan at the same time, in order to strengthen the power of the wartime system and establish a cabinet with the unity of the entire party. Some people believe that Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, and others may all have the possibility of holding positions in the new Executive Yuan. There will be considerable changes in the heads of ministries and commissions in Sun's Executive Yuan, and the position of Foreign Minister is expected to be so. After the Central Standing Committee approved Sun Ke's appointment on the morning of the 26th, it was widely rumored in Nanjing that Guo Taiqi would serve as Foreign Minister. Others said that if Zhang Qun could participate in the Executive Yuan, he might be given the position of Foreign Minister, but this is unknown. However, these are all speculations. The list of heads of ministries and commissions in Sun's Executive Yuan may not be decided and announced until next week. Before Sun's new Executive Yuan is formed, all government affairs will still be the responsibility of Weng's cabinet. However, Weng has not been to the Executive Yuan to work for many days. In fact, Zhang Lisheng is in charge, waiting for Sun to take office and handle the handover.

### The Legislative Yuan Exercises the Right of Consent, Completing the Vote in Fifty Minutes, Chen Lifu Acts as President of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After receiving the President's official communication nominating Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan at 12:30 pm on the 26th, the Legislative Yuan quickly prepared for the vote and exercised the right of consent at the afternoon regular meeting. In fifty minutes, the long-vacant new Premier was successfully produced. At 3:30 pm, the 23rd meeting continued, chaired by Vice President Chen. With the consent of the members, the agenda was changed to first handle the case of the President's nomination of Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan in accordance with Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, requesting consent. After Secretary-General Zhang Jianyuan read the President's official communication, the members unanimously passed it in the hall, omitting the procedure of review by the Committee of the Whole. Therefore, it was also considered unnecessary to request the President to notify the nominee to submit policy opinions. The vote was immediately conducted, and Cheng Tianfang, Chen Zifeng, Wu Hexuan, and Chu Gongsu were appointed as four members to supervise the vote. Starting at 3:30 pm, the voting took place in a very harmonious atmosphere. The legislators went to the podium on the left and right sides in an orderly manner, collected the ballots, marked them, and put them into the ballot box. Then, they returned to their original seats via the stairs on both sides of the hall. The voting was completed in 20 minutes. The ballots were then opened on the spot. At 4:15 pm, Chairman Chen, the Vice President, announced the results of the vote. A total of 275 members attended, and 275 ballots were issued. 274 ballots were opened, including two invalid ballots and 272 valid ballots. The number of votes in favor was 228, and the number of votes against was 44. It was resolved to agree to the President's nomination of Sun Ke as President of the Executive Yuan. The members again responded with warm applause. At this point, Sun Ke, the original President of the Legislative Yuan, was elected as the second Premier of the cabinet after the implementation of the Constitution with the support of the vast majority of his colleagues.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the current President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, was nominated by the President and approved by the Legislative Yuan on the 26th to take office as President of the Executive Yuan, in accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution, which states that "Legislators may not concurrently hold official positions," his status as a legislator and President of the Legislative Yuan should be lost with the President's appointment order. Then, in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Organizational Law of the Legislative Yuan, which states that "When the President of the Legislative Yuan is unable to attend to his duties due to an accident, the Vice President shall act on his behalf," his duties will be performed by the current Vice President, Chen Lifu. As for the election of the President, it will be held regularly by the Procedure Committee after the President's appointment order is issued. If Chen Lifu is elected as the President at that time, the vacancy of his Vice President will also need to be re-elected.

### Sun Ke Comes to Shanghai to Continue Medical Treatment for His Leg Ailment

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Sun Ke, who needs medical treatment for his leg ailment, took a car to Shanghai on the evening of the 26th for diagnosis and treatment. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in two or three days to submit a list of political commissars and heads of ministries and commissions for the President to appoint. Also, Sun hosted a banquet for Xu Chongzhi at noon, and invited Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Wu Tiecheng, and others to accompany him. The matter of forming a cabinet was not discussed during the banquet.

### Xu Chuanlin Expresses His Views, Hoping that Sun Will Reorganize Personnel

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the news of Sun Ke's cabinet formation spread, people from all walks of life placed high hopes on it, hoping that the new cabinet would be formed as soon as possible to preside over government affairs. Xu Chuanlin of the Democratic Socialist Party expressed his views, saying: "Mr. Sun's ability to come forward and form a cabinet in today's difficult national affairs is admirable. However, it is hoped that Mr. Sun can reorganize personnel, adjust the lineup, and add more new people, then the future will be limitless."

### Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, Zhang Qun Succeeds
Central Standing Committee Approves Sun Ke as Head of the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a temporary meeting at 10:00 am on the 26th, personally presided over by Director-General Chiang. The meeting approved Weng Wenhao's resignation from the position of President of the Executive Yuan, with Sun Ke succeeding him. The passage of the case was extremely smooth, and the attending members unanimously agreed. Secondly, the case of Zhang Qun succeeding as Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee was approved. After the meeting, Director-General Chiang, in his capacity as the President, nominated Sun Ke to succeed as the President of the Executive Yuan and requested the Legislative Yuan for approval.

### The Legislative Yuan Passes a Telegram to the US Senate and House of Representatives, Asking the United States to Accelerate Aid to China, Explaining that Our War is Anti-Aggressive

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 23rd meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 26th. At 9:45 am, President Sun declared the meeting open and proceeded with the reporting items. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved, and after Luo Chong made slight revisions to the resolution on his proposed abolition of the Civil Aviation Administration, the members unanimously agreed to the President's consultation cases for the revision of the Gold Yuan Coupon Issuance Measures and the Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Owned by the People, and the Executive Yuan's consultation case for answering the question of responsibility for the failure of the Jinan battle.

The meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] At today's afternoon meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a temporary motion proposed by members Cheng Tianfang and other 88 people was passed, requesting that the United States Senate and House of Representatives be telegraphed in the name of all members of the Legislative Yuan, explaining the nature of our country's war, the Chinese people's determination to fight against aggression, and requesting to accelerate aid to China. The text of the motion is as follows: "It is found that the Chinese Communist Party is a tool of the international aggressive group. Their claim to use force is actually to conquer China, make China a vassal of an aggressive country, and then use China's human resources to further invade other countries in order to achieve the goal of 'world revolution' advocated by the Communist International. Therefore, our country's suppression of the rebellion is actually an anti-aggressive war of international nature. Unfortunately, the government has not made widespread publicity on this point in the past, causing friendly countries to mistakenly believe that China's suppression of the rebellion is a civil war and has no relationship with other countries. Recently, military failures, the entire northeast has fallen into the hands of bandits, and the currency reform has been frustrated, which has shaken people's hearts and caused many criticisms of the government. The Communist Party took the opportunity to spread rumors that the Chinese government is no longer loved by the people, and the collapse is not far away. Friendly countries are confused by these rumors and have a negative and pessimistic attitude towards the situation in China, believing that China is beyond salvation. All of this can directly affect the US aid to China and indirectly affect the progress of the suppression of the rebellion. Our hospital, as a legislative body representing public opinion, has the responsibility to clarify international views. Therefore, it is specially proposed to telegraph the United States Senate and House of Representatives in the name of all members of this hospital, explaining the following points: (1) China is not only fighting for national independence and national survival, but also for world peace and security, and freedom and democracy. All countries that love peace and respect democracy are closely related to China, and have a moral obligation to help China. (2) At this time of widespread war, economic panic, and difficult life, the Chinese people cannot avoid complaining about the government, and the government's past measures cannot avoid mistakes. However, the people of the whole country, except for a very small number of people who are intentionally willing to be accomplices of aggressive countries, unanimously support the basic national policy of anti-communism and suppression of rebellion, and hope to eliminate the red disaster in China with the greatest determination and effort. The legislators are elected by the voters and can represent the people to express this intention. At the same time, they will also do their best to supervise the implementation of domestic reforms and the effective use of US aid. (3) China and the United States have had friendly relations for more than a hundred years. During World War II, China and the United States were allies fighting side by side. Now China is again subject to aggression by totalitarian countries and resists strong powers alone. If China unfortunately fails, the security of the United States and world peace will be threatened. Therefore, the US government's acceleration of military and economic aid to China at this time is not only to relieve the crisis in China, but also to save the United States itself."

### After the Fall, Shenyang is Desolate and Terrifying, Waves of Grievance Spread Throughout the Northeastern Countryside

[Central News Agency Reporter Li Zongxi, Tianjin, 26th] After the fall, Panyang has become a chaotic, suffocating, desolate, and terrifying city. Shops are closed to prevent looting by rioters, and business has stopped. The market is deserted and unrecognizable. The prosperity of the past can no longer be seen. After the Communist bandits infiltrated the urban area on the afternoon of November 2, the roads were cut off and people were scarce, and gunfire rang out everywhere. From that night until noon on the 3rd, dense artillery fire continued to come from the southwest corner of the urban area. This was because some officers and soldiers of my 207th Division were still defending the last stronghold of Tiexi, fighting bravely as isolated troops. In particular, the six warriors of the Youth Army who guarded a certain fortress repeatedly refused to surrender to the bandit army, and used fierce artillery fire to inflict ruthless blows on the dozens of times more numerous bandit crowds who came to commit crimes, killing many bandits. The six warriors shouted "I would rather die than surrender," and fought hard with the bandits for a day and a night, until they ran out of ammunition and food, and the bunker was destroyed and people died. After the citizens learned about their loyalty, bravery, and heroic deeds, they were all moved to tears. The "Panyang Special City Military Control Committee" headed by bandit leader Chen Yun was established on the 3rd, and immediately began street inspections, creating all kinds of difficulties for pedestrians. Citizens hid in their homes and dared not go out. On the 4th, the bandit provincial and municipal governments began to work, and posted announcements to force public officials to report for duty through threats and inducements. Two newspapers are currently published by the bandits in Panyang, taking extremely strict measures to block news. Most of the newspapers are filled with absurd military news, and the rest are filled with remarks that poison people's minds. The people behind this "iron curtain" feel unparalleled suffocation and depression. In terms of economy, the "Trade Bureau" forces people to exchange gold yuan coupons for bandit coins at a very large ratio, and raises the price of gold in order to set up a gang to purchase civilian materials. The people of Panyang, who have lived a happy life for three years under the protection of the government, have almost no freedom to speak of so far, and are running away to the pass. The reporter disguised himself and escaped from Panyang in the early morning of the 11th. It was cold early outside the pass, and the cold wind in the suburbs was biting. The long Panyu Highway was filled with a large crowd who did not want to be "liberated." Bandit checkpoints were set up along the way, and they inquired and extorted in every possible way. Countless good people were detained. The bandits attached more importance to property than pedestrians. The "road pass" that they relied on as a talisman, so many refugees were able to safely escape to government areas after offering part of their property. The reporter was detained for one night in Xidianzi, four kilometers east of Tai'an, and the fountain pen, watch, and other items were plundered by the bandits. The Northeast Communist bandits are currently calling for fighting into the pass. Farmers' children from 18 to 35 years old in Liaozhong and Liaoxi are being forced to "join the army" and become cannon fodder. Waves of grievance have now spread throughout the northeastern countryside.

[This City News] According to reliable information from the transportation industry, passenger and freight transportation on the Pukou-Bengbu section of the Jinpu Railway was smooth as usual on the 26th and was not affected by the war at all.

Editorial

### Sun Ke's Cabinet and US Aid to China

Amidst the vague state of the central authorities for the past half month, and in the extreme anxiety of the people who were yearning for a responsible cabinet, yesterday the President obtained the consent of Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and nominated him as the President of the Executive Yuan. In the afternoon, it was passed by a majority vote in the Legislative Yuan, and the procedure stipulated by law that the President of the Executive Yuan should report the policy guidelines to the President of the Legislative Yuan was specially waived, so that the new President can quickly form a cabinet in a very short period. At this critical moment for winning the internal suppression of bandits and seeking assistance from allied nations, this can be considered a fairly satisfactory and welcome event.

At present, what the people are eager for is nothing more than two points: (1) Internally, there should be new, refreshing, and popular enlightened measures, so that the government can truly build its foundation on the shoulders of the people's support. (2) Externally, the erroneous notion of wanting to be a bridge between China and the Soviet Union and touting "bipolar diplomacy" should be swept away, and sincere and open discussions should be held with the United States to strengthen mutually beneficial assistance to China, so that China can become a powerful member of the international camp that believes in democracy and resists totalitarianism. Only in this way can the Chinese government's suppression of the rebellion achieve final victory, and the building of the nation can be guaranteed the greatest success.

How the talent lineup of President Sun's cabinet and its internal policies on finance, economy, education, and culture will be are matters for later discussion. What needs to be pointed out here first is that China's foreign policy should be announced first. It should sincerely join hands with the United States to more closely unite the two major countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, which have a traditional friendship, and to prevent the tide of communist totalitarianism from spreading throughout Asia and the Pacific. The Chinese government must inject new blood into this reorganization of the new cabinet, show a new vitality, strengthen confidence, and strive for self-reliance, so that it can obtain assistance from others, and timely and strengthened US aid can become a matter of course.

On the eve of President Sun's appointment to form a cabinet, US Secretary of State Marshall happened to issue a statement to reporters on the US attitude towards China's recent request for assistance. He said, "Although the rise of the Communist Party in China is extremely worrying, the aid to China will be carried out cautiously." Although Secretary Marshall's remarks were as euphemistic and evasive as possible, they revealed the US's distress at being at a loss for the world situation. We, the Chinese people, who are calling for "more and faster" assistance, did not feel disappointed because of this, but we cannot help but express our deep regret for the possible future consequences of the US authorities' adherence to their prejudices and giving priority to Europe over Asia.

After returning to the United States from Paris, Secretary Marshall immediately consulted with President Truman on the situation in China. Washington and London also thoroughly exchanged views on the situation in China. At the same time, the US Security Council held meetings for several days to review the world situation. According to a report by the United Press, the issues discussed included the following: (1) Can the United States save China from communism? (2) What measures will be taken if aid to China is to be increased? (3) Will large-scale aid to China affect domestic inflation in the United States? (4) Will large-scale aid to China harm the US aid to Europe plan? In addition, Secretary Marshall personally has to consider the attitude of the future 81st Congress towards China. Therefore, the US government can only hesitate at this time, and Secretary Marshall can only be distressed and annoyed.

What will the US policy towards China be? Scholars and experts generally believe that the United States has only four paths to take: (1) Continue the current limited aid to China; (2) Encourage the Chinese government to form a coalition government with the Communist Party; (3) Provide full economic, military, and political assistance to China to prevent the national redization; (4) The United States does not ask or listen, implements a complete withdrawal, not only withdrawing from China, but also withdrawing from the entire Asia. But from our point of view, assistance is like medical treatment, insufficient medicine is equivalent to not taking medicine, and expired medicine is equivalent to not being treated. Therefore, limited assistance is of no avail, and to talk about a "coalition government" at this time is even more impractical. It is tantamount to forcing China to take the road of Poland and Czechoslovakia... and become a victim within the Soviet red iron curtain. The fact is very obvious that if the United States does not immediately provide full assistance to China, economically and militarily, and provide "more and faster" assistance, to firmly implement the Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union, then it will only voluntarily withdraw from China, fundamentally abandon Asia, and reduce the scope of its Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and defense against the Soviet Union to a corner of Western Europe. However, if it does not want to oppose communism and defend against the Soviet Union, then it is already done. Otherwise, to disregard China with its 400 million people and even Asia with its 1 billion people, and to want to achieve the goal of preventing the tide of communist totalitarianism is like a dream!

Conversely, on the Chinese side, since it is seeking assistance from the United States, it must express a clearer attitude in diplomacy. In the three years since victory, the most undesirable thing has been the fence-sitting concept that China should be a "bridge" between the United States and the Soviet Union! These diplomats, who think they are clever, often say that this is the only way to maintain China's independence and safeguard world peace. However, China should first have a clear sense of right and wrong and a rational distinction between gratitude and resentment in the international arena. The United States abolished unequal treaties with us, while the Soviet Union newly obtained privileges from China; the United States assisted our country in accepting surrender and returning to their former posts, while the Soviet Union gave support to the anti-government Communist Party to launch a rebellion; the United States economically assisted China and prepared to cooperate with us economically, while the Soviet Union seized a large amount of materials from the Northeast to hinder our country's recovery... All of these, isn't it clear who is the friend? However, our diplomatic authorities still want to send flirtatious glances to the Soviet Union while seeking US aid, and think that they are detached from the United States and the Soviet Union and have the qualifications of a "mediator" to act as a bridge. It is originally okay for a person to dream of this kind of fantasy, but what about the serious mistake it makes to the overall national situation!

To be honest, if President Sun's new cabinet wants to open a path, so that the people and friendly nations feel that there is really new hope, in addition to a thorough refreshment in the selection of personnel and in domestic affairs, the first thing that should be started and the most important thing is to abandon the seemingly right but actually wrong "dual diplomacy" and frankly and sincerely join hands with the United States for mutual assistance, in order to obtain more and faster assistance and curb the expansion of the red iron curtain in Asia.

### Chinese and Foreign Journalists Visited Qiu Qingquan, Inspecting the Southeast Xuzhou Battlefield, Where the National Army Artillery Was Displaying Its Power Two Miles Away from the Bandits

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] This morning at 9:00, the Beijing-Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Journalists Group set out to inspect the southeastern Xuzhou battlefield. They visited the defensive positions of the various armies of the Qiu Qingquan Corps. The journalist group first went to Pantang Town, 35 li southeast of Xuzhou. This place is a barrier to Xuzhou and a stronghold to protect the airport. Its position is important. The Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns and the Luzhongnan Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops began to invade the Qiu Army's positions on the evening of the 16th, using "human sea tactics," while we used "fire sea tactics" to deal with them. The bandits launched eight large-scale assaults and thirteen small-scale assaults. After a day and night of hard fighting and hand-to-hand combat, the invading bandits were completely defeated. More than 20,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and 24 tons of spoils were seized. The Chief of Staff of the Qiu Army analyzed the reasons for the victory to the reporters as follows: (1) The predecessor of the 74th Army, the reorganized 74th Division, was besieged and defeated in the Menglianggu Campaign last year. The entire army is determined to avenge their shame, and everyone is doing their best and taking the lead. (2) The Battle of Xuzhou is of great importance to the overall national situation, and the officers and soldiers have a sense of responsibility to defend their territory. (3) The command of General Qiu Qingquan and the generals at all levels below him was flawless. (4) There was sufficient preparation and sufficient supply. The reporters then went to the front-line positions for inspection, passing through Jianglou and Wangtang, and arriving at Er Chenji, which had just been recovered for 24 hours. This place is only 2 li away from the bandit army's positions. The National Army artillery is displaying its power, with an average of two shells fired per minute. The bandit side was silent. The National Army is strengthening the fortifications built by the bandits in this area, talking and laughing about the battle process, and full of confidence.

### The Largest Comet in 21 Years The Zijinshan Observatory Has Abundant Observation Gains

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The largest comet in nearly 21 years (1948-L) has been observed by the Zijinshan Observatory for ten days, and there have been very abundant gains. The night sky has been clear for ten days, which is very conducive to observation. The observers include Zhang Yuzhe, Chen Zunyu, and Li Hang. This comet is the twelfth one discovered this year and is named "1948-L" according to the usual astronomical practice of arranging them in alphabetical order. According to Mr. Zhang Yuzhe, its speed is about four times the diameter of the moon per day. The Harvard University Observatory in the United States and the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark regularly report the comet's movements in advance to facilitate observations in various places. The Zijinshan Observatory in China is a card subscriber rather than a telegram subscriber, so it learns about it a little later. Fortunately, Shen Liangzhao, a student in the Physics Department of Tsinghua University in Peiping, discovered the star when observing a variable star in the Hydra constellation on the morning of the 11th, so it was still possible to observe it early. According to Mr. Li Hang, it is moving southwest by more than two degrees per day, and the luminosity of the comet's nucleus is gradually decreasing.

### Tojo and Others May Be Hanged This Morning; US Military Defense Is Even More Stringent; Tojo's Wife Requests Return of Body After Execution

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th, United Press] Some believe that Japanese war criminals may be executed on the morning of the 27th.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] According to reliable sources within Sugamo Prison, United Press has learned that four new gallows are being built inside the prison to execute Tojo and six other war criminals sentenced to hanging. During Tojo's and the others' waiting period, prison defenses are unusually tight. Ordinary prisoners share cells in pairs, but these seven men are each in single cells, with one specially assigned armed US soldier guarding each cell. The cell doors are not locked but left open at night so that guards can immediately enter if they see any movement inside.

They were taken to a US military hospital for strict examinations and X-rays to detect any hidden poison in their bodies. They are checked regularly every night to determine if their breathing is normal. Their meals are no longer prepared by Japanese cooks, and all Japanese are prohibited from contacting them to prevent them from obtaining poison from the outside. When sleeping at night, they are required to face the open cell door with their heads. It is said that although they are trying to appear calm, their appetite has decreased sharply in recent days, their temperaments have become perverse, and they are acting like thugs. Tojo has lost two pounds in a few days. Hirota was the most affected after MacArthur's final decision was announced, as he had expected MacArthur to at least spare his life and commute his sentence to life imprisonment.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] Tojo Hideki's wife submitted a petition to MacArthur on the 26th, requesting that after Tojo and the six accomplices are executed, their bodies be returned to their families for burial. Tojo's wife believes that the remains of war criminals will not be returned to their families after execution. Eighth Army Commander Walker told United Press that Tojo and his accomplices' bodies will be treated the same way as the remains of other war criminals. However, Walker, who has only recently arrived in Japan, frankly admitted, "I really don't know how other war criminals have been disposed of."

### News About Japanese War Criminals to be Released Uniformly by MacArthur

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur ordered tonight that all news regarding Japanese war criminals should be released by the General Headquarters Press Office.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] Eighth Army Commander Walker, who was appointed by MacArthur as the execution supervisor, refused Allied reporters this morning permission to visit the execution site when Tojo and the other six war criminals sentenced to death are hanged. At noon today, Allied reporters submitted a joint request to MacArthur's headquarters, strongly arguing that they have the right to visit the execution site to gather news.

### Syngman Rhee Repeatedly States That South Korea Needs US Troops Stationed There

Korean Ambassador to China to Come to China at the End of the Month

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 26th] Korean President Syngman Rhee stated today that the Korean government and parliament must immediately submit a request to discuss the stationing of US troops in South Korea, as the US has no intention of keeping troops here. Rhee stated at a press conference this morning that there are various misunderstandings in the outside world that Koreans do not want US troops stationed here. These misunderstandings stem from a suggestion made by some congressmen several weeks ago to withdraw foreign troops from Korea. Rhee said, "That bill has been shelved, but the United States and other foreigners have been spreading rumors, taking it as the wish of the Korean people." He also stated, "US troops should not withdraw from South Korea until the country is capable of defending itself and achieving unification." When asked by reporters how long it would take for Korea to be strong enough to defend itself, Rhee stated that he is an optimist and believes that this goal can be achieved soon after the transfer of government institutions is completed.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 26th] The Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the Korean Ambassador to China and representative, Jung Hwan-beom, will leave here by ship on the 29th or 30th to take office in China. Three of Jung's staff members are scheduled to fly to China tomorrow to make the necessary arrangements. Dr. Jung was the former head of the Korean World Games delegation, participated in the Korean Provisional Government in exile in Chongqing in 1943, and was once a university professor there.

### Soviet Union Accuses the US of Supporting Right-Wing Japanese and German Groups

[United Press, Paris, 25th] The Soviet Union accused the United States today of supporting fascist groups in Japan and Germany during the UN Social Committee's discussion of the draft Declaration of Human Rights. Soviet representative De Dinh Gu stated that MacArthur's occupation forces are supporting the revival of Japanese fascist groups. Another Soviet representative, Pavlov, stated that the remnants of fascism and Nazi groups are still active in West Germany and are receiving constant encouragement from the occupying authorities. The Soviet representatives used these remarks to support France's amendment to Article 28 of the declaration, which stipulates that no group may secretly use this declaration to undermine various human rights and freedoms, which was unanimously passed.

### The Berlin Dispute Is Not Easily Resolved; The Four Powers' Replies Will Be Published Soon; Neutral Countries Will Not Abandon Mediation Efforts

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The original text of the replies to Bramuglia's request for opinions on the Berlin issue will be published this afternoon. The reason for the delay in publishing the Four Powers' replies is due to a request from Soviet representative Vyshinsky, to allow him time to consult with Moscow. At the same time, Bramuglia himself will travel to Rome for a four-day trip, returning to Paris at the end of the month, and then returning to his country before December 10th. His term as President of the Security Council will end at the end of the year.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] The representatives of the six neutral countries on the Security Council held another meeting tonight, chaired by Bramuglia, to continue studying the Four Powers' replies on the Berlin currency issue. According to a diplomatic source, there is still hope of formulating a currency plan that can be accepted by both sides. The source also stated that the British and French notes contained detailed proposals on the establishment of a currency institution, which is helpful to the neutral countries' efforts. In short, the rumors that neutral countries will abandon their mediation efforts are completely unfounded.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] Informed sources say that the United States, Britain, and France have told Bramuglia that his attempt to resolve the Berlin dispute is doomed to failure, meaning that the Security Council's resolution of the Berlin crisis based on the current foundation is on the verge of despair. The current foundation refers to not recognizing the East German mark issued by the Soviet Union as the sole currency of Berlin, in exchange for the Soviet Union lifting the blockade. The United States, Britain, and France had already requested that Bramuglia publish the three countries' replies, aiming to show that their policies on the Berlin issue remain consistent. When Britain and France separately submitted memorandums to Bramuglia to express their opinions on the currency issue, there were already differences of opinion among the Western allies. Although there are currently such small differences in opinion, the Western allies are still maintaining a strong front in the Cold War.

### France Achieves Diplomatic Goal by Having the Right to Participate in the Control of the Ruhr Industry; Monnerville Re-elected as President of the Senate

[United Press, Paris, 25th] A French government spokesman stated today that France will naturally accept US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal yesterday to invite France to participate in the management of steel and coal mines in the Ruhr area. Although the Ruhr is not within the French occupation zone, Marshall's invitation is a proper step. France has now at least satisfied one of its two major demands, namely, that France has the right to participate in the management of the Ruhr industry during the period before a formal peace treaty with Germany is signed.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The chief representatives of the six countries attending the London Ruhr Conference held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the differences among the countries regarding the international control of the Ruhr and its organizational structure.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] Monnerville was re-elected as the President of the new Senate. Monnerville is a black man from French Guiana.

### US West Coast Labor Dispute Ends; Three-Year No-Strike Contract Signed; More Than Eighty Days of Disputes Come to an End

However, ships will not resume sailing until agreements are reached with other employers and the other three striking unions. However, it is generally believed that the resolution of the longshoremen's union strike is the key to the problem, and the other three striking groups—the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the independent Firemen's Union, and the Radio Operators Union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations—will inevitably be affected.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The spokesperson for the Arab bloc, Syrian representative Khoury, moved in the UN Political Committee today to abolish the State of Israel and create a Palestinian state controlled by Arabs. However, the failure of this move can be predicted. Khoury made this proposal while the United States reiterated its opposition to directly passing the Bernadotte Plan, as British and American opinions still differ greatly on the handling of the Holy Land issue. The United States has asked the Political Committee to reject the important parts of the British-proposed solution to the Palestine issue and accept the more relaxed US amendment.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] UN Acting Mediator for Palestine, Bunche, requested on the 25th that the United Nations supervise any direct peace negotiations between the Arabs and Jews.

Bunche's statement sparked heated debate in the committee on the Holy Land issue. The committee has a wide range of suggestions for the Holy Land, but the most important is to put one of the suggestions to a vote, but no decision has been made so far. The committee is scheduled to reconvene on the 26th, at which time it may submit all suggestions to a small committee, as the Political Committee will begin dealing with the Korean and former Italian colonial issues.

### Authorities Strictly Enforce Martial Law; Prohibit Strikes and Class Boycotts; Municipal Council Passes Three Measures to Handle Labor Disputes

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan, in order to enforce martial law and strictly prohibit strikes and class boycotts, specially held a joint reception for reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:30 PM yesterday to report on the situation. Commander Xuan first delivered a speech, stating that after the national army launched the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the government felt that maintaining social order was an urgent task, and specially announced the emergency martial law order for the Nanjing-Shanghai area. All actions that affect social order are strictly prohibited. Under martial law, it is clear that some of the people's freedoms must be restricted. However, unfortunately, some people in this city cannot understand its significance. After the martial law order was announced, incidents of strikes, slowdowns, and taking "leave" in name but actually going on strike have occurred continuously, disrupting social order and plunging people's hearts into extreme anxiety. After discussing the matter with Mayor Wu, I believe that what the people need most at this time and place is stability, and the government's main responsibility at present is to maintain stability and strictly prevent lurking elements from taking the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt social order. Therefore, it has been jointly decided that if there are any unruly people who incite unrest here, whether they are workers or people from other walks of life, the headquarters will definitely enforce the law. The martial law order issued by the government clearly states that strikes and class boycotts must be strictly prohibited, and the leaders will be severely punished. At this turbulent time, the government must take into account the living problems of workers, but it must also take into account the maintenance of overall social order, factory production, and social order. When labor and management have disputes, the person in charge of the workers' organization can make a request to the management, but the request must be reasonable. If labor and management cannot coordinate, they can ask the competent authority (i.e., the Social Affairs Bureau) to make a fair mediation. In the future, if the labor party makes demands that are harsh and unreasonable, and the procedures are not followed, it will be a violation of martial law, and the authorities will severely punish the leaders.

I hope that after today's speech is published, all kinds of unrest in the city will disappear, including workers, civil servants, and teachers. It is regrettable that the teachers of municipal and private schools have successively taken "leave" in name but actually boycotted classes. Of course, the lives of teachers are very difficult, but compared with soldiers, they are already several times better. Soldiers are fighting for the country in such difficult circumstances, and I hope that others can emulate them. At this time when the country is suffering from many hardships, the people must tighten their belts, endure hardship, and work hard to overcome difficulties together. No one from any walk of life should make special demands to satisfy themselves.

Mayor Wu then reported on the three points of the measures to handle labor disputes passed at yesterday's municipal council meeting: (1) The demands of each labor union must be submitted through the labor union, otherwise the government will not consider them at all. (2) After submitting a demand, the labor union must seek a solution through legal channels, that is, wait for the authorities to mediate, arbitrate, or judge. During this period, no strikes or slowdowns are allowed to occur. If such things occur, the management is allowed to unconditionally dismiss the workers. (3) The authorities will also investigate and deal with the instigators according to the law.

### Matters Concerning the Implementation of Curfew Regulations; Police Bureau Orders Subordinates to Comply

The Municipal Police Bureau has formulated matters concerning the implementation of curfew regulations in this city, which have been approved by the Garrison Headquarters. The Police Bureau has ordered its subordinates to comply. The full text is recorded as follows: (1) All military, police, and constitutional personnel performing curfew duties who are wearing uniforms are allowed to pass. As for the plainclothes police of the Police Bureau, they must pass with their service certificate. (2) During the curfew, for vehicles parked in front of public entertainment venues, if they have special passes, their passes should be immediately confiscated and submitted to the Garrison Section of this bureau for transfer to the Garrison Department for approval. (3) For vehicles with special passes, the passengers must match the identity of the special pass before they are allowed to pass. (4) During the curfew, all doctors who hold a license and identity card, or who are traveling by car without a special car pass, are allowed to pass. (5) If there is a medical emergency during the curfew that requires a doctor or to be sent to a hospital, the patient's family must first report to the branch bureau in charge, which will contact them. However, the designated hospital or doctor must have an ambulance or pass. (6) Midwives affiliated with the Health Bureau must wear uniforms, have a delivery bag, and carry their national identity card and service certificate when going out to deliver babies during the curfew. The Health Office will issue a certificate for going out to deliver babies, stating the destination (i.e., the address of the home), which will be verified and released by the military police on duty. (7) Ambulances of hospitals do not need special passes. (8) The working hours of night soil collectors are changed to start every morning at 5:00 after the curfew is lifted and end at 12:00 noon. (9) The working hours of cleaners are changed to 20:30 to 22:30 the day before. (10) The business hours of each vegetable market are from 5:00 AM to 10:00 AM every morning.

### Business Is Slow on the First Day for Silver Shops: Gold Control Bureau Instructs on Business Strategies

The silver shops in this city resumed business collectively yesterday. Overall, the day's business conditions in various stores showed that apart from the larger stores, the rest of the industry was not as lively as imagined.

[Another Report] Regarding the resumption of silver shop operations, the person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau convened a meeting of representatives from the industry association yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to provide earnest instructions for the resumption of business. The main points are as follows:

(1) The selling price of gold jewelry in each silver shop is stipulated to include the price of gold, labor costs, operating expenses, and profits, and shall not exceed 2,100 yuan per tael. Each silver shop shall hang up a sign with the approved price every day. This rigid regulation is made because if the price in the silver shops is too high, few people will be interested, and it will stimulate the market. (2) The above price for selling gold jewelry is calculated based on a purity of 995 or higher. If it is less than 995, the price should be reduced accordingly. In the past, the purity of gold jewelry in the larger silver shops in this city was indeed very reliable, but recently it has gradually become chaotic again. What is called pure gold is only 990 or 980, or even less. The Central Bank sells gold at full purity. If silver shops sell at reduced purity, it is tantamount to adding another layer of exploitation. (3) The highest labor cost shall not exceed 50% of the Central Bank's gold price. This point is related to the calculation of the selling price of gold jewelry in the first item and cannot be changed. Furthermore, in the past, silver shop labor costs were flexibly regulated, ranging from 50% to 100% depending on the fineness of the manufacturing. In reality, each silver shop calculated it based on the highest standard of 100%. To emphasize facts and avoid opportunistic profiteering, rigid regulations must be added. (4) In the past, due to various concerns, the silver shops did not have detailed records of transaction quantities and prices in their accounts. After this resumption of business, they must comply with the regulations and record each item in their accounts.

### Wedding Just Completed, Groom Imprisoned: Leader of the "Thin Knife Gang" Arrested and Prosecuted

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of June 2nd, Pan Yunlong, a member of the Seventh Inspection Team of the Garrison Headquarters, was riding a three-wheeled vehicle on official business when he passed Xiaoximenkou on Zhonghua Road in the Southern City.

Fortunately, Pan was alert and immediately drew his official handgun, and Du fled in a frenzy. Afterwards, Pan reported the information to his superiors, who instructed the Penglai Police Sub-bureau to issue an arrest warrant. Unexpectedly, Du got married yesterday at No. 67 Jiangyin Street.

### Mayor Convenes Meeting with School Principals: Four Measures Decided: Private Schools Allowed to Charge One to Three Times More Tuition: Complete Subsidies for Teachers and Staff: Schools Must Resume Classes Immediately, No Later Than Next Monday

[Report from Our Newspaper] To resolve the issue of increased tuition fees for private schools, Mayor Wu convened a meeting of principals from private primary and secondary schools in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than 200 school principals attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting and immediately decided on four points: (1) Private schools are allowed to moderately increase tuition fees by one to three times, all of which will be used to subsidize the lives of teachers and staff. (2) Schools that have already collected four times the tuition must proportionally increase their free tuition slots (according to the Bureau of Education's regulations, the number of free slots in each private school must not be less than 20%). (3) All schools are ordered to resume classes today, no later than next Monday. (4) Xiaokuaile is urged to stop scolding private schools.

Hoping Principals Will Conduct Self-Reflection

The atmosphere was tense and agitated during yesterday's meeting, and the discussion lasted for three hours before it was adjourned. First, Mayor Wu clarified that the purpose of today's meeting was to review the facts, investigate responsibilities, and find appropriate solutions. He recounted the Private School Teachers and Staff Association's request to the Municipal Government on the 11th of this month for special rice rations and emergency subsidies, as well as the Municipal Government's handling of the matter, believing that the private schools' unauthorized collection of fees was unreasonable. As a result, a stalemate was created with teachers taking collective leave. Principals should conduct self-reflection on where their responsibilities lie.

The Mayor Raises a String of Questions

Mayor Wu said: The government admits that its leadership has been inadequate and cannot shirk its responsibility. However, was the Private Primary and Secondary School Association too hasty in this unauthorized collection of fees? In principle, if private schools have financial difficulties, the principals should submit a request for resolution to the board of directors. If it cannot be resolved, then they should request assistance from the Municipal Government. May I ask if each school has submitted a request for resolution to the board of directors? What is the attitude of the principals towards the current situation where most teachers in the schools are taking collective leave? Tuition fees are paid in one lump sum. Are schools issuing them to teachers in one lump sum? Are the unpaid funds stored in kind? Principals are requested to conduct self-reflection on each of the above questions in order to resolve the incident.

Principals Complain About Their Difficult Circumstances

After the Mayor's speech, the principals of various schools successively expressed their opinions, explaining the difficult circumstances of the schools. The increase in tuition fees was indeed due to the fact that the teachers' lives were too difficult, and they were unjustly condemned by all walks of life. The schools are willing to use all of the increased tuition fees to subsidize the lives of teachers and staff. For the sake of the students' studies, they are willing to do their best to persuade the teachers and staff of the schools to resume classes immediately. Finally, four solutions were agreed upon as above, and the meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.

### National Colleges and Universities' Holidays Will Remain According to the Original Academic Calendar

Some private colleges and universities in this city are planning to increase fees or bring forward the holidays by two weeks due to financial difficulties and the lack of food for students. Decisions had been made previously. As for whether the class times in the national colleges and universities in this city will also be shortened, it has been learned that the principals of Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, Zhang Yi and Wang Zizhu, told reporters: Although national colleges and universities are also affected by price fluctuations and financial shortages, in order to maintain the students' studies, they have decided to hold classes and holidays according to the original academic calendar and do not intend to make any changes.

[Another Report] In order to strengthen the teaching effectiveness of various schools, the Ministry of Education has ordered all universities to require teaching assistants and professors who also hold positions to work at the school for the specified amount of time.

### Shanghai Prison Murder Case: Investigation Continues Yesterday: Four Suspects Detained

(Report from Our Newspaper) In the bizarre murder case at the Shanghai Prison, the case of guard Jin Ruiliang being burned to death with a hot iron in the prison public toilet, the coffin was opened and the body examined the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office summoned suspects related to the case for questioning. Prosecutors Cao Hong and Tang Meiqiao questioned Tang Fujun, a staff member of the guard section of the Shanghai Prison, and guards Ding Shoudian, Wang Fuming, Li Fengshan, Jie Fangxing, Jie's wife Zhuang, and others. Gao Yong'an, a judicial staff member from the Tilanqiao Police Bureau, patrol officer Yu Yingkai, and plainclothes police officer Cong Lin went to provide materials. Doctors Wang Yueru and Zhou Defu from Gongji Hospital also appeared in court to testify. According to Tang and others, Jin suddenly suffered a stroke, and a cigarette butt fell on his pants and burned him, causing his death. However, according to the examination, the injury was different from a cigarette burn, and the statements of the various people were contradictory. The prosecutor ordered that Tang, Ding, Wang, and Li be temporarily detained by the Tilanqiao Police Bureau for further investigation. Jie and Zhuang were ordered to return home. The results of the examination at the Changde Road mortuary the day before yesterday are being compiled by Sun Kui, director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine. After the examination results are sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, the investigation will continue.

### Shipping Industry Decides to Give Preference to Public Servants: Facing Difficulties, Seeking Loans from the National Bank: Wei Wenhan Hosted Reporters Yesterday to Report

Wei Wenhan, the newly appointed chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, and Secretary-General Shen Dongmei hosted reporters at the China Merchants Bureau on the 6th floor yesterday and reported on the preferential treatment measures for public servants and the current difficulties of the industry. It is said that the industry, in view of the hardships of the lives of officers and soldiers and public servants, in addition to scattered officers and soldiers on business trips, now provides a 40% discount on fares. In addition, it was decided at a meeting of peers on various shipping lines yesterday that public servants themselves can ride ships, with their certification documents, according to the class of cabin they are riding in, with a 20% discount on the fare. Furthermore, because it is difficult to maintain operations, the Shanghai Association is currently applying to the Central Bank for a shipping industry loan of 20 million yuan for turnover. After many contacts, no results have been obtained. It is hoped that the government will quickly approve it so that they can overcome the difficulties.

### Yangmi Certificates in Luwan District: Not Marked with Store Numbers

Xincheng District Rushes to Complete Procedures Overnight

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Civil Food Allocation Office's designated rice stores for the allocation of rice by population in November originally stipulated that Songshan, Luwan, Hongkou, Jiangwan, and Gaoqiao districts would be the pilot districts. Among them, although the Civil Food Allocation Office had planned well for the Lujiawan district, because the district保方面 did not follow the instructions to mark the rice certificates with the rice store numbers, all of them have been issued, and there is no way to recover them. It is now heard that the Civil Food Allocation Office is deeply regretful. Furthermore, because citizens of the Xincheng district have repeatedly sent letters requesting designated rice stores for allocation, the office also tried to rush to complete the procedures overnight. It has recently been learned that it has been approved to be included in the pilot district.

### North Water and Electricity Company Urges Energy Conservation

The source of coal in this city is becoming increasingly difficult, and the first to be affected are the power plants in the public utility industry. According to the person in charge of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: Since September, the company has only been able to receive 60% of the approved quota, resulting in the depletion of the accumulated reserve coal for the past three months. In November, according to the actual application amount, more than 11,000 tons of coal are needed (which is also the stipulated quota), but as of today, only 5,000 tons have been received, which is less than half. The amount of electricity generated has therefore been greatly reduced. Therefore, starting on November 11, the company re-scheduled the rotating power outage dates for electricity users and stipulated that all motor use should be stopped during the evening peak load time. Since its implementation, it has been able to cope with it at first, but recently it still feels insufficient. The reason is that: (1) the weather is getting colder, and users are using electric heating for heating; (2) the theft of electric heating is increasing; (3) electricity users cannot comply with the rotating power outage and the peak load power outage time and continue to turn on motors as usual, so they have to pull electricity separately on a temporary basis, which affects a part of the lighting users. Not only do residents feel inconvenienced, but the company's scheduling is also very difficult and cannot be maintained. In addition to considering rigidly stipulating zonal power outages, there is no better way, and it is still hoped that general users will cooperate sincerely, do not use electric heating, and abide by the company's scheduling, so as to overcome this difficult time.

### Fang Li-yun's Murder of Her Husband Case: Court Schedules Sentencing

[Report from Our Newspaper] The court heard the case of Fang Li-yun murdering her husband yesterday and scheduled the sentencing for December 1. Fang Li-yun killed her husband Zhang Weimin because he had fallen in love with someone else. On the morning of October 20 this year, at 4:00 AM, while Zhang was sound asleep, Fang attacked him with a kitchen knife. After Zhang's mother discovered it and stopped her, she had already cut his head in several places. After Fang cut Zhang, she also raised a knife to cut her own head, but was stopped by Zhang's mother. The police were called and she was taken to court. During yesterday's hearing, Fang Li-yun confessed to cutting Zhang. She intended to cut off Zhang's limbs or blind him so that his new love would not want to marry Zhang.

### Well-Known Leaders in Shanghai Jointly Launch Reform Movement: Advocate for Thorough Improvement of Military, Political, and Economic Affairs: Have Maintained Contact with American Relations in Beijing and Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to yesterday's Shanghai English-language "Great Beauty Evening News," sources in this city's political circles say that several well-known and authoritative leaders in this city are currently jointly launching a reform movement to save the current crisis. The members of this group include well-known domestic industrialists, businessmen, bankers, newspaper editors, university presidents, technical experts, and professionals. They are more willing to spend time and money to promote this reform movement, but they do not want to reveal their names. After the group was formed, it maintained contact with various American relations in Beijing and Shanghai.

According to a spokesperson for the group: "We are all of the opinion that although we hope for increased American aid, China must strive for self-help in order to make China worthy of receiving foreign aid." The group's thorough reform plan includes military, economic, and political aspects. In terms of military administration, they believe that the military supply part, in particular, must be thoroughly improved so that war materials can be fairly and uniformly distributed, and the loss of materials and corruption can be eradicated. Therefore, they advocate that there should be foreign advisors and guidance systems above the military supply system. The issue of military pay and benefits also needs to be reformed immediately. The "Do Not Eat Empty Quotas" system must be effectively implemented immediately. If foreign aid is needed, it should still be appealed for. Regarding military staff work, not only should foreign advice be adopted, but it must also be earnestly implemented. Therefore, the existing staff department organization should be reorganized immediately.

In terms of economy, they advocate two points: (1) Strictly divide the scope of private and government industrial and commercial enterprises immediately. (2) There should be a realistic plan to attract foreign investment. Legitimate private enterprises should be given full economic freedom, and the government should immediately withdraw from the scope of various private enterprises that it has now invaded. Regarding foreign investment and trade, they believe that the right of inland river navigation should be immediately granted to foreign shipping companies. Industrial and commercial enterprises in areas not affected by the military, if they receive foreign investment, must be given the most-favored-nation treatment. China must choose which countries should enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment, but China should abandon the academic attitude to study the issue of sovereignty here.

In terms of politics, they strongly advocate a responsible cabinet system, strictly adhering to the constitution to govern, based on law and not decrees. Unless this political system can be effectively implemented, China's future will continue to be bleak.

The spokesperson also said: "We are currently doing our best to promote this reform movement and will never 'sit and wait for death,' because the time for reform and promoting self-help movements is not too late. Currently, our initial work has been to present the reform plan to the government. We will continue to promote this movement until we achieve results."

### Shanghai Circles Jointly Telegraph the US Government, Urging Aid to China is Extremely Urgent, Provide Swift Moral and Material Assistance, So as to Avoid Historical Tragedy in Time

Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the National Textile Federation, Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the National Federation of Industrial Associations, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Associations, Li Ming, Chairman of the National Banking Association Federation, Qin Runqing, Chairman of the National Money Industry Association Federation, Qian Yongming, Chairman of the National Electrical Industry Association Federation, Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Jiang Yiping, Standing Director of the Shanghai Jinban Teachers' Association, He Yuanming, Standing Director of the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association, Zhu Zhongdao, Standing Director of the Shanghai Medical Association, Feng Youzhen, Standing Director of the Shanghai Journalists Association, and others, jointly telegraphed US President Truman, Vice President Barkley, and Secretary of State Marshall yesterday, urging stronger US aid. The translated gist is as follows:

A Determination to Fight to the End

At this moment of deciding life and death, the people of our country must appeal to Your Excellencies and the people of your country. If you want to avoid this great tragedy in human history in time, where hundreds of millions of peace-loving men and women are forced to be ruled by the Communist dictatorship, then your country must provide assistance without any delay. We guarantee the Chinese National Government's determination to fight to the end. This is not only to maintain our own freedom and independence, but also to prevent the spread of the Communist scourge in Asia. Apart from this, there is no other way to go. How can we obtain freedom and happiness under the command of the Communist Party? What hope will there be in the future? The events in Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Poland have made us no longer have any illusions about the "coalition government" advocated by the Communist Party.

Time Cannot Be Delayed

Once the Communist Party controls our entire country, it will be a signal that the iron curtain surrounds Asia. From then on, there will be no free trade or any possibility of operating any enterprise in the Pacific. It must be understood that the interests of your country, our country, and the world in maintaining peace and stability in the Far East are whole and inseparable. At this time when the terrible darkness is about to come, we cannot stand by and watch. We will seek effective political reform plans in order to overcome difficulties. However, our resources are limited, and time is running out, so we have to appeal to Your Excellencies. With the love of freedom of Your Excellencies and the people of your country, you will surely sympathize and provide assistance, so that quick results can be achieved. Time waits for no one, and Your Excellencies should put this into practice.

Swiftly Adopt Actions to Support Together

In addition, the presidents of public and private universities in this city, Wu Qintai, Zhang Yi, Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, Hu Dunfu, Hu Wunyao, Zhu Jingnong, and others, also jointly sent a telegram to US President Truman, Vice President Barkley, and Secretary of State Marshall yesterday. The main idea of the original telegram is as follows: We urge Your Excellencies to pay attention to the fact that our country is fighting a life-and-death battle with the Communist Party to reduce its threat to control Asia. This is related to the interests of your country and the destiny of our country. Your country must quickly make a decision and take action to support it together. Although there have been setbacks in past battles, in the Battle of Xuzhou, our military and civilians spared no effort to sacrifice their lives to repel the Communist army, thus winning this valuable opportunity. With our determination and perseverance, coupled with the friendly and effective assistance of your country, working together, we will surely be able to continue the struggle for a long time. What we are worried about is that your country will not provide assistance in time, and if we suffer another setback, your country's policy and interests in the Far East will inevitably be greatly affected, to the point of being irreversible. We believe that your country will not bear to abandon our government and people at this time, otherwise Asia will be completely controlled by the Communist Party, which is something your country will never want to give up lightly. If Asia is placed under the iron curtain of the Communist Party and ruled by totalitarians, then the countless lives sacrificed by your country in the Pacific War will be in vain.

Position in the Far East Will Be Blockaded

We are also aware of the various shortcomings in our government, which are far more than those known to people abroad. However, this is the only reliable and powerful political institution in the country that is determined not to compromise with the Communist Party. We cannot imagine the consequences of your country abandoning the current government and seeking a so-called "coalition government." The so-called "coalition government" is nothing more than a government commanded by the Communist Party, which will inevitably damage your country's important interests, and your country's position in the Far East will be blockaded and shaken. Therefore, we have to urge your country to decide on a policy and quickly provide our country with moral and material assistance, so that our country can gradually stabilize militarily, economically, and politically, in order to rejuvenate everything and become self-reliant. The timing is urgent, and assistance must be provided before the Communist Party controls our country and Asia, which would be fortunate.

### Two Managers Accused of Hoarding, Ruling of No Prosecution

[Our Newspaper] Wu Xilin, manager of Wu Xiji Yarn and Cloth Shop, and Wu Bonian, manager of Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, were previously accused of hoarding and speculation. After investigation by the Special Criminal Court, it was announced yesterday that they would not be prosecuted. The reasons stated in the non-prosecution ruling are briefly as follows: According to the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times, the hoarding of merchants engaged in their own business refers to the purchase and storage of designated items with speculative behavior, or the purchase of non-seasonal banned items, exceeding one-quarter of the annual demand. The so-called speculative behavior must be the storage of items without supplying them to the market as much as possible, or raising prices beyond legal profits, in order to constitute a crime. After investigation, the defendants Wu Xilin and Wu Bonian did not meet the above conditions and were not prosecuted.

### After the Resolution of the Customs Labor Strike, the Transport of Yarn and Cloth to the South Officially Begins

Although the Executive Yuan has ordered the lifting of the ban on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south of this city, the actual transport has not yet started due to the recent customs go-slow. Yesterday, the customs go-slow came to an end, and the work of transporting yarn and cloth to the south officially began. According to sources concerned: According to statistics, the amount of yarn and cloth transported from this city to the south in the past few years was 25,955 pieces of yarn and 7,077,707 bolts of cloth from January to June of the 36th year. From July to December of the 36th year, there were 43,864 pieces of yarn and 1,115,723 bolts of cloth. In January of the 37th year, there were 65,984 pieces of yarn and 172,682 bolts of cloth. In February of the 37th year, the government took emergency measures and announced a ban on the transport of yarn and cloth to the south, so as to fully supply the needs of this city. In April of the 37th year, the transport to the south was partially opened by the government's order. However, by the end of August, the government strengthened economic control, and the transport to the south was stopped again. It was not until now that the government ordered the lifting of the ban.

### Cotton Yarn Soars

Yesterday, with the official transport of yarn and cloth to the south, the market in this city suddenly turned prosperous, and the Guangdong gang bought Weite Jian, and the yarn shops on this street also absorbed it. In addition, the money supply was overflowing, and people were more excited than ever.

The initial call for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately rose by 700 yuan. After opening, all parties were eager to trade, and they entered as soon as they saw the fee. The market rose again by 1,000 yuan, reaching a high of 14,500 yuan. Later, due to the taking of profits at high prices, it fell back to 13,300 yuan at the close, an increase of 500 yuan from the previous day.

The initial price of 21-count Double Horse yarn jumped by 200 yuan, and the trading was in full swing. It then rose by more than 500 yuan, reaching a high of 10,5600 yuan. Later, due to floating households selling, it fell back to 10,000 yuan at the close, an increase of 200 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 300-400 yuan to 700-800 yuan.

### Cloth is Stable and Popular

Due to the soaring price of yarn, the market for cotton cloth was optimistic, and those who held the goods made special efforts. The Guangdong gang searched and bought a lot on this street.

The asking price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 400 yuan at the beginning. The transaction was smooth, and it rose to 415 yuan with a transaction. Later, due to the lack of actual sales in the door shops and insufficient replenishment, the northern gang sold at high prices due to the inverted price. At the close, it fell back to 395 yuan, a decrease of 15 yuan from the previous day. The final price of Sijunzi Yuan Biji was 390 yuan, also a decrease of 15 yuan. High-end 190 Shilin cloth was sold for 700 yuan, and low-end 635 Ka cloth was sold for yuan, and the transaction was mediocre.

### Amount of Gold Yuan Notes Issued

The National Bank Denies Exceeding 3 Billion Yuan

It is reported that according to the initial regulations for the issuance of gold yuan notes, there were five denominations of gold yuan notes: 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. The 20-yuan gold yuan notes recently issued by the National Bank were not within the scope of the initial issuance of gold yuan notes. Therefore, there are rumors that the amount of gold yuan notes issued has exceeded 3 billion yuan, an increase of 50% compared to the initial total issuance. However, there is still a lack of cash in the market, and the premium phenomenon occurs from time to time. Yesterday, a reporter from the United Credit Bureau specifically inquired about this issue with the person in charge of the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank. It was reported that the issuance of gold yuan notes has exceeded 3 billion yuan, which is completely untrue. The lack of cash is partly affected by the deposit exchange of gold and silver dollars. The issuance of 20-yuan gold yuan notes is to replace the issuance of the originally planned 50-yuan and 100-yuan large-denomination gold yuan notes, so as to avoid stimulating prices. Therefore, these large-denomination gold yuan notes are not easily seen in the market.

### Number of People Exchanging Gold and Silver Increases

Since the Central Bank and other four national banks opened the cash deposit exchange, the number of applicants was not enthusiastic at the beginning due to the lack of cash. However, the situation suddenly changed from the day before yesterday. Although it was drizzling yesterday, a long line appeared at the exchange offices of each bank. According to those familiar with the details, this is due to the recent rise in the black market for gold and cash, and there are quite a few scalpers among the squeezers.

Also, according to the National Bank's announcement yesterday, on the 25th, 3,391 taels and 7.7 cents of gold were exchanged, 399,177 gold yuan notes were collected, 36,159 silver dollars were exchanged, 361,590 yuan notes were collected, and 7,555,334 gold yuan notes were collected for fixed deposits.

### Rise in Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates

Yesterday, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates suddenly rose. At first, it was about 25.5 yuan. Later, due to the rush of importers who had obtained the quota allocation certificates to settle foreign exchange, the price soared to 27.5 yuan, and then slightly returned to 27 yuan. The transaction volume has also increased to 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.

### It is Decided Not to Relax the Seventh and Eighth Season Quotas

The Seventh and Eighth Season quotas of the Wheel Import and Export Management Committee have been announced long ago. However, up to now, industrial and commercial sectors have still requested the Wheel Management Committee to relax the import quotas for these two seasons.

Yesterday, according to the person in charge of the committee, it was decided not to relax the Seventh and Eighth Season quotas. In order to increase the import of raw materials or materials by the industrial and commercial sectors, the committee approved the early distribution of the quotas for these two seasons. Moreover, after the implementation of the import and export trade linkage, importers can find ways to import a lot of materials. In the future, the import of materials will only increase and not decrease.

### Silk Soars

Yesterday, the trend of artificial silk was sharp and the people were confident. Due to the soaring prices of yarn and cloth in industries other than the silk industry, merchants were traveling and buying actively in the market. The closing price was unanimously increased.

The closing price of spot goods at Tianqiao Gate No. 120 was 11,000 yuan. The market was not bad at absorbing goods. It immediately rose by 1,000 yuan. After the high price, the supply was still scarce, and Mujie's willingness to buy was still strong, and the asking price rose again by 500 yuan, and the sharp trend was very strong. Guan Yin's retail sales continued to sell, and the market slightly returned to equilibrium. It finally closed at 12,000 yuan, and Dongyang closed at 12,500 yuan, both of which increased by 1,000 yuan from the previous day.

Yesterday, the market for raw silk was also popular, with the same trend. The silk weaving industry on this street absorbed goods smoothly, and the supply from the same industry was very scarce. Both spot and futures prices increased by more than 1,000 yuan.

The initial spot price of D-grade 7878 uniformity was 13,000 yuan. After opening, it rose all the way, reaching a new high of 15,000 yuan. The initial market for high-quality retail was very quiet, and the asking price was high at the opening. The step-by-step market was high in the middle, and purchases by various gangs were still strong, and the trend did not seem to be inferior. The closing price was unanimously strong.

### Food Rice Arrives in Quantity and Prices Drop, Flour and Edible Oil Slightly Rise

The rice market is still on a downward trend. Although the weather is rainy, there are still many arrivals. Rice shops' purchases are still sluggish, so it is quite difficult to sell, and prices are depreciating again. The prices in both the north and south markets have fallen. The price of white japonica rice in the southern market is 450 yuan, down 10 yuan. The price of thin indica rice and early indica rice fell by 10 yuan or 15 yuan. The price of early indica rice fell below the 400 yuan mark. The sales of Yin Yuan were sluggish, and the price fell sharply by 30 yuan. The price of white japonica rice in the northern market was 5 yuan lower, and the price of early thin indica rice was also 10 yuan lower. Yesterday's arrivals were 3,728 shi in the southern market and 4,752 shi in the northern market.

The market for flour has slightly risen. Due to the continuous decline in recent days, the price has been low. This street saw the low price and replenished, and the market atmosphere was active, and the price rose. The price of old car flour was 145 yuan, and the price of the Bingchuan delivery was 140 yuan, both rising by 5 yuan. The prices of Hongfeng, Peacock, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 5-6 yuan. The factory provided bran, and the market declined. The price of large bran was 2 yuan, and the price of small bran was 64 yuan. The factory price of wheat was 185 yuan.

The prices of miscellaneous grains rose and fell. The initial opening price of Hankou Zhadou was stable. Later, due to the high price of bean cake, it turned slightly higher. The closing price was 160 yuan. The price of Pinghu Doudou was a little more than 10 yuan. The appetite of the northern gang for corn was very sluggish, and the market price fell, down 5 yuan. Due to the purchase by liquor shops, the transaction of red sorghum was lively, and the price rose by 5 yuan. Sesame turned firm, adding 10-20 yuan. The price of tea beans for picking green was stable, and the price of peanuts was flat after the initial rise.

The price of edible oil turned slightly higher. Due to the continuous decline in recent days, the price has been low, and the cargo owners strengthened their position, so the early market rose. The factory price of soybean oil was 790 yuan, and later 780 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan. The closing price of raw vegetable oil was 620 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. The original price of raw oil station, Jiangbei Jisheng oil was still 960 yuan, and the price of small cart sesame oil and cooked vegetable oil each rose by 30 yuan. The customer gang continued to purchase bean cake, which rose first and then declined, an increase of 6-7 yuan.

### Hangzhou City Changes Leaders

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 25th] Mayor Zhou Qiyu, who went to Beijing on official business, returned to Hangzhou for only two days. The old mayor, who had served for three terms and for about 20 years, resigned, and the successor was Ren Xianqun, who had served as the chairman of the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Committee and is currently the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Utilization Committee. Mr. Qiyu, we have known each other for three years. Mr. Xianqun and I have talked a lot in recent meetings. In the case of Hangzhou people's desire for change, the departure of Mr. Qiyu and the arrival of Mr. Xianqun can be said to be timely.

A Link in the Central Area

Although Hangzhou City is not a municipality directly under the central government, as the City Council requested to change it to a municipality directly under the central government, "Hangzhou City is close to Beijing and Shanghai, and connects to Anhui and Jiangxi. The wheels and rails converge, and the transportation is convenient... Therefore, it forms a link in the central area of the country in terms of economy, and its scenic spots are well known throughout the world." Therefore, the change of a mayor in Hangzhou City must be approved by the central government, and even by the president. The people of Hangzhou City also feel this way. In my three years of friendship with former Mayor Zhou, I felt that Mr. Zhou was very capable. For example, he knew that "Hangzhou relies on one spring for three winters," and the income depends entirely on tourists, so he actively rectified the tourist area, several neat asphalt roads, and renovated the scenic area, preparing for the residence and food of dignitaries. Mr. Zhou once told reporters in mid-February of the 37th year: "Now the currency is depreciating, and everything is difficult to handle. Before the war, the municipal government's annual budget was 3 million yuan, and the monthly recurring expenses were 150,000 yuan, which was more than enough to cope with. Now the numbers are too large, and there is a feeling of losing sight of the other, which is really difficult."

Is the Funding Difficult?

Afterwards, I consulted many financial and economic experts. They said: "Hangzhou is not financially deficient, and there is no need to develop tax sources or increase the burden on the people. As long as the existing tax rules are properly implemented, it can be used inexhaustibly. For example, the land debt tax stipulated in the Principle of People's Livelihood should be increased according to the increase in land value. If the reporters buy it, the government has no financial resources, but it can be rented to civilians, and the rent of the civilians can be used to repay the land benefits of the false reporters. Therefore, the problem lies entirely in the implementation." How could Mr. Qiyu not know this? Because of the familiarity of the personnel, the qualifications are too old. Because the people are familiar and the qualifications are deep, as long as Mayor Zhou makes a phone call, everything can be solved. Also, because Mayor Zhou often consults by phone, some things can be solved by talking to the mayor. There are more people looking for the mayor, and the mayor feels used to it. As long as there are no complaints locally and the central government relies on it, even if the finances are in deficit, the central government and the province can get subsidies, so there is no need to find trouble again.

The Prospect of Hangzhou City

I once talked to Mr. Zhou about the prospect of Hangzhou City. He said: "I hope Hangzhou will become the Hollywood of the East." And he also said that Jiuxi and Eighteen Streams and other places are already prepared. Later, Mr. Bray came to Hangzhou and toured the mountains and rivers with the reporter. He pointed to the stone pier on the mountain in the inner West Lake and said, "Brother Qiyu encouraged the people of Shanghai to build houses on the mountain, but it was abandoned due to the war." Of course, this was at least more than ten years ago. But more than ten years later, in a world that is not peaceful, the needs of the people are different, and the imagination of the people is also different.

Mental Depression

According to my contact with the people of Hangzhou City in the past three years, what the people need is the solution to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. They pay donations and taxes, and they see that what is repaired is the asphalt road and what is sorted out is the scenic spots. The price of rice and firewood is increasing, and there is no consolation in the spirit, which feels very depressed. The reporter once wrote "Hangzhou! Where to Go" when the City Council petitioned to change it to a municipality directly under the central government. It pointed out that Hangzhou should take building a cultural city as an indicator and a cultural city of the people as its purpose. Because what the people need is not only material, but also spiritual food, because spiritual food reflects the needs of the people, so spiritual food is also the opportunity for material food. Therefore, "the name of the municipality directly under the central government does not have to be only for political improvement, but its actual spirit is already incomparably noble." However, "suggestions are up to him to suggest." Although Mr. Chen Xunci, the former director of the Zhejiang Library, sent a letter expressing sympathy, the scholars are still just scholars after all.

Mr. Ren is Frank and Lively

Now, the new mayor, Mr. Ren Xianqun, himself said: "This is the first time to be a local administrative official," so "I will not be surrounded, I will never be partial, I will not compromise with local evil forces, and I will truly serve the people." Although Mr. Ren's contact with the reporter is shallow, under the "try something new", there must be something to do. The reporter talked with Mr. Ren, and he said: "For the administration of Hangzhou, take one step at a time, and I also agree with the construction of a cultural city." Mr. Ren is a frank and lively person, and he has a good reputation in Taiwan and Shanghai in the past. I eagerly hope that he will maintain his past glory, grasp the current demands of the people, and guarantee the future glory of Hangzhou.

### Bizarre Murder Case in Nantong: Shi Guanghua Shot Dead

[Our Newspaper Nantong 23rd] A bizarre murder case recently occurred in our county. The incident occurred at the abandoned reed field by Qifeng Bridge in the west of the city. There was a sugar-selling woman Wang Guiying from Anhui. She had a younger brother named Chenglin, who followed her brother-in-law Tan Tingguang as a orderly. On the 21st of this month, Wang Guiying was offering sacrifices for her deceased relatives. Wang Heng, a relative, accompanied Shi Guanghua (the deceased) to Wang's house in the city for a feast. At night, after the guests dispersed, Wang invited Shi to live in the house of Ge Songgao, a neighbor, to accompany her to drink. Shi became very drunk. Then he was helped back to Wang's house. As soon as he arrived home, there was a gunshot, and Shi was shot in the head and died. Two armed comrades questioned the matter. Wang's answer was hesitant, so they were taken to the general bureau for trial. The police station has now transferred the case to the district prosecutor's office.

### On Selfishness

— Wu Yong

Falseness is a major flaw in human affairs. Russell wrote a collection of skepticism, which clearly stated the principle of "Form opinion on evid-ence". Simply translated, it is nothing more than the three characters "avoid falseness". Although the entire book contains more than 200,000 words, what it repeatedly clarifies is this meaning.

Although this meaning is simple, it is difficult to do. J. Austin said: "Any revelation in human affairs is rarely the complete truth. It always has to be slightly concealed and slightly untrue." It is also sad to say this. Even in the closest relationships such as father and son, husband and wife, it is difficult to achieve complete truth in what they say to each other.

This is especially true for political, educational, and national affairs. When three or two friends gather, after tea and wine, once they involve political affairs, they often say that something must be done this way, and that a certain case should not be done that way; or they say that this will definitely not work, and that will definitely be effective. They talk eloquently, with saliva splashing, and their tone is quite certain, and their expressions are very confident, as if as long as they do so, everything can be solved easily.

In fact, most of these arguments are not due to foolishness, but must be based on selfishness. I have seen that families with many children tend to advocate birth control, while those who have only one child tend to agree to encourage childbirth; the weak often criticize "the weak are the prey of the strong" as cruel, while the strong turn to say that only by "eliminating the weak" can the country be rich and the species be strong. Other examples include domestic industrialists advocating boycotting foreign goods, hoarders opposing high-interest policies, saying that high-interest rates are enough to stimulate rising prices, professional philanthropists persuading people to donate generously and accumulate yin merits, and old upper classes preaching the benefits of honesty to partners and insisting on not cheating, etc. In fact, most of them are based on self-interest, thinking for their own pockets.

But what is strange is that a person who specializes in seeking self-interest is always despised by others. However, the same person, once he becomes a representative, a member of parliament, or an envoy abroad, at this time, it is the norm and aboveboard to strive for self-interest. The national system, voters, and countries he represents are also afraid that he will not value self-interest. The more he can strive for self-interest, the more he can win the reputation of a good representative, a good member of parliament, and a good envoy. If not, if he makes a proposition and takes the rights and interests of the other party as the goal, and regards the interests of the person he represents as unworthy of mention, such a style of work is rarely regarded as mentally ill. Moreover, even the opposing group will be surprised at his ignorance and regard him as incompetent.

I have often thought that the so-called "representative politics" of today is nothing more than gathering experts in self-interest from all walks of life, all industries, all national systems, and all classes together, and each person vigorously states his private opinions, and then compromises to make it a proposal that everyone is dissatisfied and indignant with. In order to make the "private opinions" of the members of parliament become "public opinion", they will deliberately ignore the facts that are unfavorable to themselves, and will not hesitate to cite extensively the arguments that are beneficial to themselves, so as to gain the trust of the public. In this way, wanting them to speak impartially and without selfishness and to be completely true is nothing more than climbing a tree to catch fish. Democracy, such as the United States, its so-called democratic politics, is just like this, how can there be anything else?

### Specialists in Forging Documents

— Mao Yi

Even if it's fake, it must be made convincingly genuine. In a meticulously researched film, not only must the rules, regulations, cultural artifacts match the time and space of the background, but even the signing of decrees and official announcements must be replicated with lifelike precision.

In Hollywood, there's just such a veteran "document forger": Griffith Ellis. Employed by Warner Bros., his special task is to reproduce signatures and other documents for various needs on the screen.

Ellis is already seventy-eight years old. While others have long retired, he remains diligently engaged in his unique work. His copying skills are almost indistinguishable from the real thing. He forges letters, manuscripts, memos, retail invoices, loose pages from record books, and various foreign documents. Experts say that some of his works are simply indistinguishable from the originals. His reproductions of the American "Declaration of Independence" and "Bill of Rights" are so exquisite that Warner Bros. ended up donating them to the U.S. Congress.

It takes Ellis several hours, even days, to forge a single document. When the cameras are set up, he sits nearby, making sure the forgery is flawless. He has forged the signatures of American celebrities such as Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and even Stalin's signature, and all are so convincing that they could easily be mistaken for the real thing.

Using forged documents and signatures in other contexts is illegal and could disrupt social tranquility. But Ellis is a law-abiding citizen. People often say to him, "It's fortunate that you are an honest person!" Because if he were to engage in criminal activity, the consequences would be unimaginable.

### A Story

— Jin

Recently, due to the depreciation of the gold yuan currency, many private primary and secondary schools have successively increased the "second" tuition and miscellaneous fees in order to maintain the livelihood of teachers. Teachers say that our salaries have always been low, and we are suffering from this unprecedented price inflation, which has increased dozens of times, making it impossible to sustain ourselves. On the parents' side, they believe that the gold yuan they paid at the beginning of the semester was also quite valuable, and at that time it could buy several dan of rice. Now, being asked to pay a "second" fee is a bit difficult to comply with. As a result, "strikes" and "leaves of absence" have followed one after another, forming an "unprecedented" and "serious" problem in the education sector.

I don't intend to defend either side. In fact, it's impossible to absolutely say that one side is right and the other is wrong, because this is just a small problem within a larger problem. When the larger problem is not resolved, the smaller problem can only ever remain a problem. Here, I just want to tell a story, a true story.

Let's say there is such a private middle school that is doing quite well, and the teachers' salaries are also quite reasonable. However, reasonable just means being able to make a living. With prices rising rapidly, the school wanted to ensure that the teachers could have peace of mind, so they decided to have a "second" fee collection as well. The notice was posted, and the deadline was clearly specified. The accounting office waited for a large amount of gold yuan to roll in. Unexpectedly, things didn't go as planned. The deadline was approaching, but the accounting office was still deserted. The school was anxious and secretly investigated. It turned out that the students were implementing a "joint refusal to pay," led by the highest class in the school—senior year, and the "mastermind" of the senior year was also uncovered. Therefore, following the ancient saying of "catch the thief, first catch the king," the school immediately signed a "summons" and brought the "offender" to the office, which served as a temporary court.

After questioning, the "offender's" various related circumstances were investigated. When the registration form was opened, perhaps it was a coincidence that made the case handler feel "thorny." It turned out that the "offender's" parent was a current teacher at the school! The news spread extremely quickly, and soon reached the ears of the parent and teacher, forcing this gentleman to feel "shame and anger." He cursed and made a scene in the office, saying that he wouldn't rest until the "offender" was kicked out.

The story has reached its climax here, and the following should be an ending. Unfortunately, the ending of this story is still unknown, and, judging by reason, it can only end inconclusively. One thing that can be added is that this "criminal" also enjoys free treatment because he is a "child of faculty and staff"! This point makes it even more impossible for us to determine the "merit" or "demerit" of this "criminal," because his behavior, from another perspective, is entirely selfless and public-spirited!

After reading this story, what feelings do readers have? Of course, it depends on the readers themselves. Here, I would like to raise a question: Suppose there is a teacher who has two sons (or daughters) studying in middle school. If he supports the collection of the second fee, he himself can get four or five hundred yuan, but he also has to pay four or five hundred yuan for his sons or daughters to pay. He himself still gets nothing. Then, smart readers, should he support the collection of the second tuition fee or should he oppose it?

### The Sensitivity of Animals

— Bie Qian

In the vast natural world, many animals possess superhuman senses and display amazing sensitivity, making us humans, who are supposed to be the most intelligent of all beings, look up in vain! The dog's sense of smell, the cat's vision... etc., are all well known to us. However, there are many insects and reptiles whose sensory acuity can truly reach a degree that is unbelievable.

There is a kind of fly whose taste organ is particularly sensitive, and it can taste almost truly tasteless flavors. If we humans use a cup of very weak sugar water to test our sense of taste, the maximum limit of perception is one part sugar dissolved in two hundred parts water. If this limit is exceeded, even the most sensitive tongue can only admit that it is a cup of pure plain water. However, if we compare this to the olfactory ability of this fly, it's like a small wizard seeing a great wizard. It can actually taste the sweetness in a solution of one part sugar in forty thousand parts water! Even more astonishing, there is a beautiful butterfly in America. According to multiple experiments by entomologists, it has been proven that its ability to distinguish taste can actually detect the sugar taste in a solution of one part sugar in three hundred thousand parts water.

Bees have the ability to estimate time. If we place food outside at a fixed time every day, the bees will come on time, with no more than five minutes of error, as if they had looked at a clock.

### Lyrics from Haihong Building

— Xu Shaomeng

Bodhisattva's Crown - On a Painting

Deep, deep, a sweet dream like thick clouds,
Weary weather, and drowsy waking.
Sparse willows, gentle breeze,
The boundless Yangtze River flows on.
A single sail hangs on the Yellow Sea,
Shaking hands in the night of beacon smoke.
Where is Peach Blossom Spring?
I sadly gaze at it within the painting.

Butterfly Loves Flowers - Spring Sentiment

How much spring spirit has been dispelled?
Ten-layered hills, cutting off the Lingbo Road.
A jeweled horse and fragrant carriage roam a well-governed place,
Falling flowers and wind shatter the whispers of secluded birds.
Such beautiful time is difficult to keep for long,
All is affection, and yet always misled by heartlessness!
Rain also falls like silk, clouds also float like catkins,
Exhausted, the thread of longing is woven with machinations.
