### Absorbing Idle Capital to Stabilize the Market: Short-Term Treasury Bills to Be Issued Immediately; Selling State-Owned Enterprise Assets to Strengthen Issuance Preparation; National Government Committee Approves Important Proposals

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The National Government Committee held its 24th State Affairs Meeting at 10 a.m. on the 26th. Twenty-two people including Zhang Qun attended. Chairman Sun Ke, Foreign Minister Wang, and Vice Minister Qin reported on recent diplomatic and military affairs respectively, and then discussed the proposals. (1) The Chairman submitted the Executive Yuan's proposal to formulate measures for selling state-owned enterprise assets to strengthen issuance preparation, which was resolved to be amended and approved (the original text of the eight measures is published in column 1 of page 2). (2) The Chairman submitted the Executive Yuan's proposal to adjust the treatment of civil and military personnel, which was resolved to be amended and approved. (3) The Chairman submitted a temporary proposal, which was also discussed and approved. The proposal decided to issue short-term treasury bills. The original proposal was recommended by the Governor of the Central Bank, submitted to the Executive Yuan, and then submitted to the National Government. It is now learned that the amount of the bonds is divided into five types: 10 million yuan, 50 million yuan, 100 million yuan, 500 million yuan, and 1 billion yuan, in unregistered form. The term is divided into three types: one month, two months, and three months, with a monthly interest rate of 5%, issued by the Central Bank in the open market. According to authoritative sources, the issuance of these treasury bills is to absorb idle capital and stabilize the financial market. After the proposal is approved by the State Council, it will be implemented soon. In addition, five supplementary budget proposals were approved as follows: (1) Supplementary budget proposal for the regular expenses of central agencies for the 37th year. (2) Nineteen supplementary budget proposals for the 37th year revenue and expenditure and the 36th year revenue and expenditure revised for the 37th year for various agencies. (3) Forty-eight supplementary budget proposals for the 36th and 37th year expenditures for various agencies. (4) Twenty-two supplementary budget proposals for the 36th and 37th year projects for various agencies. (5) Supplementary budget proposal for the 36th year revenue increase and expenditure increase/decrease for Suiyuan Province.

Adjusting the Treatment of Civil and Military Personnel; Decision to Increase Taxes on Salt Customs, etc.

The measures for adjusting the treatment of civil and military personnel are as follows: (1) The treatment of civil and military personnel will be adjusted monthly starting from April. (2) The standard for the monthly cost of living allowance will be determined based on the cost of living index for the previous month in different regions. The expenses for students on public funding and soldiers' rations will be adjusted accordingly. Before the standard for the cost of living index for the previous month is determined for each region, the monthly cost of living allowance will be temporarily issued according to the previous month's standard. After the standard is determined, the balance must be settled and supplemented within the current month (the cost of living allowance for April will be temporarily doubled according to the previous standard, and the increase will be settled and allocated after the regional index standard is determined). (3) The average cost of living allowance for laborers is changed to 15 yuan. (4) The cost of living allowance for employees of various civil and military agencies should continue to be reduced. However, in order to reduce the difficulty of implementation, it will be reduced by 57% from April to June and a total of 10% by December. At the same time, measures to increase revenue due to the adjustment of treatment were passed as follows: A. An additional 100,000 yuan will be added to the temporary food tax per dan, totaling 450,000 yuan including the current tax of 350,000 yuan per dan. An additional 80,000 yuan will be added to the land tax per dan, totaling 280,000 yuan including the current tax of 200,000 yuan per dan. An additional 40,000 yuan will be added to the fishery and agricultural tax per dan, totaling 140,000 yuan including the current tax of 100,000 yuan per dan, which is estimated to increase revenue by more than 80 million yuan in half a year. B. The cotton yarn tax rate will be immediately adjusted to 10% (originally 7%), which is estimated to generate 800 billion yuan in half a year. There are also adjustments to customs duties, etc.

### U.S. Senate to Debate Aid-to-China Plan Next Week; Foreign Relations Committee Submits Report Explaining the Purpose of Aid to China

[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcasting on the 26th: Washington Dispatch, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee submitted a report to the Senate on the 26th stating that the $463 million aid-to-China plan proposed by the committee aims to give the country an opportunity to "make efforts to carry out self-help programs." The aid plan will be carried out over twelve months, and the Senate debate will begin next Wednesday. The report is in line with the view of aiding China, but states that "under the current circumstances, it is impossible to formulate a practical and effective long-term economic plan for China that relies on U.S. aid. We cannot guarantee China's fate." The report also stated that "the United States is not in a position to be responsible for guiding the Chinese government and its political, economic, and military affairs." The purpose of the aid plan is to meet China's need for the most important commodities, to alleviate the suffering of the Chinese people, to curb the deterioration of China's economic situation, and to enable the Chinese government to have another opportunity to make efforts to carry out self-help programs."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] As the general debate on the House's foreign aid plan is nearing its end, signs of increasing tension in the U.S.-Soviet Cold War can be found in the House. U.S. Republican Congressman Luo Hong advocated that the United States should sign a multilateral military agreement with the sixteen European countries within the Marshall Plan and China to prevent communist aggression at home and abroad in those countries. He also advocated export controls to prohibit the transportation of military equipment, aircraft, engines, and other materials that can be used for military purposes to the Soviet Union and its vassal states.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Communist Senator Bridge said that when the Senate discusses the aid-to-China bill, he will try to expand its military aid. The total amount of aid to China is still $463 million, but he will suggest reducing economic aid from $363 million to $313 million, and canceling the provision for a $100 million military grant, and providing $150 million in military aid to China instead, with the grant method determined by President Truman. This military aid may not be granted unless requested by China, and U.S. troops may not be used for combat missions related to the aid.

They all believed that the basic problem of these issues to be resolved is the Communist Party. Therefore, the conclusion reached after the senators exchanged views was that the government should be urged to recognize the core of the problem in order to find a solution. Foreign Minister Wang also explained in detail the process of diplomatic policy implementation over the past two years at the tea party. He explained that our diplomatic policy is neither so-called detached nor neutral, but a policy determined based on national interests and world peace. Wang's report was very sincere and gained the understanding of the senators.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Presidium of the National Senate, with its mission coming to an end, will hold a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 3 p.m. on the 28th to receive senators from previous sessions.

### Military Structure in Central China Will Not Change in the Near Future

The Rumor of the End of the Xun Command is Untrue

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 26th] A senior official of the Xun Command solemnly declared: The various rumors about how the military structure in Central China will change are speculations caused by the Huazhong Pacification Conference not releasing news; in fact, the suppression agencies here are not likely to change within two months.

### Hong Lanyou Answers Reporters' Questions; National Congress Can Open as Scheduled; It is Difficult to Decide Whether to Start Deliberations Immediately After the Opening

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 26th] The First National Assembly of National Representatives will open on the 29th and will not be postponed. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, declared when answering reporters' questions at the press conference on the 26th: "As of today, the Preparatory Committee has not received any orders to postpone the opening of the Assembly. To my knowledge, the government has never considered postponing the opening of the Assembly." Hong then explained from a legal point of view, stating: Article 8 of the Constitutional Implementation Preparation Procedure stipulates that when the National Assembly representatives produced in accordance with the Constitution have been elected to reach two-thirds of the total number, they may hold legal meetings and convene meetings; as to the number of people who report reaching several times the number elected before the opening, there is no explicit provision in the law. According to general practice, it should be more than half. According to Hong's explanation, the current convocation of the National Congress is legal. The total number of representatives elected is 2,832. If the number of representatives who report reaches 1,417, it can be opened as scheduled. Judging from the reporting situation on the 26th and the number of representatives on the way to Beijing, there is no problem that those who report before the evening of the 29th will reach 1,417. Therefore, the National Congress may open as scheduled; however, whether the deliberations can be started immediately after the opening and the election of the President and Vice President and the amendment of the Constitution still need to be determined. According to Hong Lanyou's explanation, Article 8 of the National Assembly Organization Law stipulates that the National Assembly shall not start deliberations unless more than half of the representatives are present. The election and recall law of the President and Vice President stipulates that the President and Vice President shall be elected with more than half of the total number of representatives. In addition, Article 174 of the Constitution stipulates that the amendment of the Constitution shall be proposed by one-fifth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly, and may be amended with the attendance of two-thirds of the representatives and the resolution of three-quarters of the representatives present. According to this interpretation, the Assembly must have 1,523 attendees to start deliberations, and 1,523 attendees to elect the President and Vice President. As for amending the Constitution, at least 2,030 representatives must be present before a resolution to amend it can be made. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the Assembly may be opened on the 29th, and the official deliberation will begin after more than 1,523 representatives have arrived, and the President and Vice President will be elected. This Assembly may not amend the Constitution, so the limit of 2,030 people may not have much impact. (Continued on column 5 of page 2)

### The National Army of Chahar and Shanxi Takes the Initiative; Victory on the Pinggu Line, Annihilating a Bandit Regiment; Fengzhen and Changhanying in Sui are Relieved

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 6th] The spokesperson of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters declared at a press conference at the Beiping Yuan on the 25th: The war situation in northern Shanxi and southern Chahar has changed from active retreat to active annihilation starting on the 25th, but the overall war situation has not yet reached a decisive stage. The National Army is looking for an opportunity to annihilate a large group. Nie Rongzhen and Yao Zhe originally intended to use their 670,000 troops to destroy the Ping Sui Railway and then capture Zhangjiakou in one fell swoop, but since the 19th, the war situation in the past week has found that their attempt has been crushed. The local military and political organization in Chahar Province has always been very strong, so although some strongholds have been abandoned, the overall situation can still be grasped. The populace has risen to defend themselves. Zhangjiakou alone has more than 23,000 people forming a self-defense force. The center of the battle is now east of Zhen, and the remnant bandits in Changhanying have retreated. The main force of the Communist bandits is now in the area on both sides of the Sanggan River.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 26th] Military News: Victory on the Pinggu Line, one regiment of remnant Communists was annihilated. The National Army in Miyun launched a fierce attack on the Communist Independent Division entrenched in the southeast of Miyun at 5 p.m. on the 25th, and after a fierce battle, the division was defeated, and its 14th Regiment was completely annihilated.

[Another Dispatch] The situation around Datong has stabilized. The remnant bandits occupying the Yongdingzhuang and Tongjialiang two mines of the Datong Coal Mine have retreated. The mines have sent workers to clean up on the 25th. The equipment has been damaged, but it is generally good. However, it is not easy to start work for a while. Employees must still return to the city in the evening. The evacuation of important officials to Beiping is still in progress. The Datong Airport has been repaired and completed, and air transport between Beiping and Datong is frequent. Ammunition has been replenished in large quantities, and the public's morale has been greatly stabilized. However, there is a shortage of food. If necessary, it can be resupplied by air from here. The Datong Administration has decided that all people who flee into the city must carry enough food for three months before they are allowed to enter the city.

[Central News Agency, Sui, 26th] Fengzhen, Changhanying in Southern Sui was under siege for three days and nights. Our reinforcements arrived at 4 p.m. on the 25th.

In addition, fierce fighting broke out 30 miles southwest of Duliu Town, in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, on the 25th, and the remnant Communists suffered heavy casualties.

### The Constituent Assembly Delegate Should Act as the Constitutional Implementation Delegate: Vice Chairman Sun Fo Had an Early Inclination for Running Unopposed for Vice President

One of the main conditions Vice Chairman Sun Fo used as a campaign platform for the vice-presidency was: "The Constitution of the Republic of China was created by my own hand; although it has been revised repeatedly thereafter, I have personally been involved in all of the revisions. I am very familiar with every chapter and every article of this constitution, and I have great confidence that I can shoulder the responsibility of assisting the President in implementing the constitution." This condition can be said to be the most powerful condition. Isn't it the best condition for a constitution-maker to be a constitution-implementer? For Sun himself, he has worked hard for sixteen years, from having an ideal to seeing this constitution born, and he has paid a considerable price. However, this is only the formal achievement of constitution-making. For him, the outcome of the implementation of this constitution is more important, and it is even more important to experience whether his achievement is merely limited to the "formal."

Sun's candidacy for vice president also has a coincidence: his current position is vice chairman, which is equivalent to the post of vice president after the implementation of the constitution. Sun served as vice chairman to assist Chairman Chiang in promoting government orders, and the future president, although Chairman Chiang has not announced that he will run, is already very obvious, and no one else will run. Therefore, Sun's candidacy for vice president will still be to assist President Chiang in implementing the constitution. This coincidence has almost become one of Sun's natural candidate conditions.

Despite these characteristics and constraints, Sun did not formally announce his participation in the election very early. It was not until the afternoon before he publicly announced his participation in the election that the reporter, in Sun's reception room, enjoyed the first news from his own mouth that he would decide to participate in the election. Sun is obviously a very frank politician. When he heard the reporter inquiring about the election, he immediately replied that he had scheduled to receive reporters. He spoke clearly and logically to the reporter about why he participated in the election and his interest in national affairs, and explained that his candidacy for vice president and the powers of the future President of the Legislative Yuan do not conflict. He regarded the Constitution of the Republic of China as his darling, and he cherished it with such fervent emotions, cultivating its growth. At the same time, he needed to see it flourish and become great. In his tone, he was so firm and forceful: "I am confident that I understand democratic politics, I am confident in the true meaning of the constitutional provisions. The task of the first President of the Republic of China is to earnestly implement the constitution and strictly abide by the constitution, and I have the qualifications to assist the President in implementing it." He also has unique insights into his understanding of world issues and is determined to participate in resolving these problems and is not afraid to take responsibility.

He has two views on China's current problems: one is the national issue, and the other is the people's livelihood issue. He said that our war of resistance against Japan ten years ago and the current suppression of the rebellion are all for the establishment of a new country of the Three Principles of the People, and the primary task should be to establish a truly democratic country and a democratic society based on the Principle of Democracy, so as to achieve democratic politics. As for the latter, it is especially urgent to be solved. In particular, people with status, responsibility, and insight in politics should concentrate their efforts and make the greatest determination to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to solve the people's livelihood issues. When the reporter interviewed him, he asked for his political views and foreign policy. But when he was thinking for a few minutes, his wife sitting next to him reminded him that he was talking too much, seemingly worried that he would say everything that needed to be said at the press conference, so this interview ended there.

Once Sun's campaign atmosphere was unveiled, the campaign organization was immediately established. At the press conference on the afternoon of the 25th when he announced his participation in the election, it was like a constellation of stars surrounding the moon. The reception was held in the hall of the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in the capital, and hundreds of reporters arrived. There were many enthusiastic inquiries, and Sun answered them lightly, and they aroused the satisfaction of the inquirer. For example, on the issue of whether the vice president can concurrently serve as the President of the Legislative Yuan, he said that this issue has not yet occurred. If the president cannot perform his duties due to an accident and the President of the Legislative Yuan exercises his powers on his behalf, or even cannot return to the Legislative Yuan, then the Legislative Yuan also has a vice president. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan can also re-elect the president. On the other hand, if this exercise of power is only temporary, then it will not hinder the position of the President of the Legislative Yuan, because he said that the Legislative Yuan is a democratic institution, and the decision-making power of the Legislative Yuan lies in the legislators and not in the president, and the vice president also has no real power. Therefore, in peacetime, this is not a conflicting issue. Someone said: "What if Chairman Chiang does not participate in the presidential election? Will you change your candidacy to President?" He said: "We'll talk about it when that time comes!"

Sun's campaign organization is built on the legislators of the Legislative Yuan, which he has presided over for more than ten years. Therefore, when someone asked him about the campaign funds, he smiled and said, "I will respect the sacred vote of the National Assembly delegates, and I will not spend a penny."

A very enthusiastic reception, full of the atmosphere of the Legislative Yuan—because the wife of President Sun was sitting next to him in the chair. Mixed in with the group of reporters were many legislators. But swept away the ，is the beginning and the result. (Sent from Nanjing on March 25)

Regarding the issue of adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and government employees nationwide, the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 23rd of this month decided on five principles: These five principles have been passed by the regular meeting of the State Council yesterday. These five principles are: (1) Starting from April, adjustments will be made monthly according to the cost of living index of the previous month. The shortfall in subsidies for civil and military personnel in the central government and various provinces and cities in the first half of this year will be added in one lump sum during the adjustment of the special budget; (2) If the cost of living index difference is too large and the number of zones is too large, another relief method will be formulated; (3) The cost of supplementary food and dry rations for public-funded students will be adjusted proportionally; (4) The monthly base salary of public servants will be increased from an average of 13 yuan to an average of 15 yuan; (5) Various agencies will appropriately reduce employees. The method of purchasing and distributing goods in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Tianjin will be discussed later. At a time when general prices are running rampant and rising sharply without limit, and the living standards of public school teachers and government employees are declining, the government, regardless of financial difficulties, has decided to make an overall adjustment to their salaries. The principle is valuable, and the significance is significant.

The current era is an era of decline and decline for the middle class, especially intellectuals. The middle class and the majority of intellectuals live off the public school teachers and government employees, and their lives, future, beliefs, and aspirations depend on this profession and career. Due to the soaring prices, the increase in the cost of living, the hatred of society, the ridicule of the times, and the deception of the environment, the status of public school teachers and government employees is declining. Although the government has also taken into account the lives of public school teachers and government employees, stipulating that salaries should be adjusted every three months, but it can never keep up with prices, resulting in a situation of increasing hardship the more adjustments are made; especially after the cancellation of the ration of food rice, the difference between work compensation and living expenses has become a scissors shape, and public school teachers and government employees are even more trapped on the verge of poverty. Lu Hao, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, committed suicide by jumping into the Huangpu River due to his wife's serious illness and heavy debts, and then his wife, Gu Pin, also died of illness. This is a tragic tragedy that is heartbreaking. Employees of the Changshu District Court work half a day and sell cigarettes, peanuts, and melon seeds on the streets for half a day, using their meager profits to subsidize their lives. This is a portrayal of "peaceful resistance" (Gandhian spirit). The same things, the same experiences of sympathy, are full of the world. What an unreasonable and dangerous phenomenon this is!

An enlightened and progressive government cannot abandon "nurturing scholars" and "respecting scholars," otherwise the pillars of the country will be lost. What will the situation become? The Control Yuan of the National Government therefore suggested "restoring the method of distributing supplies in kind to public school teachers and government employees, and adjusting salaries monthly according to the cost of living index"; the Legislative Yuan further suggested that "the government should change the salaries of civil and military personnel to be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, distribute food rice, increase the salaries of technicians and workers, and detail the measures for layoffs and resettlement." These two suggestions are good countermeasures to alleviate the current living conditions of public school teachers and government employees. Chairman Chiang valued them very much, and the State Council discussed them several times, believing that the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury should be taken into account, and the problem of public school teachers and government employees should also be paid attention to. If the two cannot be achieved simultaneously, then of course only the former should be abandoned and the latter should be taken care of, which is in line with the national spirit of nurturing scholars. The principles passed by the Executive Yuan this time, except for "distributing food rice" which was not decided, and "layoffs" which were handled with discretion, entirely adopted the suggestions of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, paying special attention to the monthly adjustment of the cost of living index. Judging from the current economic trend, it is inevitable that salaries will be adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index. Whether the salaries for this month are paid according to the cost of living index of the previous month is in line with the actual situation is something that the accounting authorities should pay special attention to when formulating detailed measures.

According to the usual practice of the accounting authorities and the burden on the national treasury, it would be an alarming expenditure to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and government employees monthly according to the cost of living index. However, this is an unavoidable expenditure due to the circumstances. No matter how difficult it is, it must be implemented. According to the latest estimate, when the salaries of public school teachers and government employees were adjusted in January, the monthly increase in expenditure was about 30.2178 billion yuan. According to the changes in the cost of living index in recent months, it is feared that it will increase by about 40% each month. Based on this, the burden on the national treasury is estimated to be about 42 trillion yuan in February, about 58.8 trillion yuan in March, about 82.32 trillion yuan in April, about 115.248 trillion yuan in May, and about 161.347 trillion yuan in June. In these six months, the total increase is about 489.75 trillion yuan. This is certainly an alarming expenditure. If prices cannot be stabilized, this accumulated increase will only become larger and larger. Therefore, we suggest that the government, while increasing the salaries of public school teachers and government employees, should try to increase taxes, issue bonds, sell enemy and puppet assets, and strive for compensation and sell state-owned enterprises to increase the revenue of the national treasury and open up the financial difficulties.

In short, the government has now made the greatest efforts to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and government employees. The government has its sacred obligations to public school teachers and government employees. We approve of this relatively wise measure. At the same time, we also hope that civil and military personnel across the country will uphold the spirit of "ambitious people do not forget their fate in the ditches," recognize the difficulties of the times, face reality, and the more difficult the situation, the more diligent and alert they must be. This is the highest honor of public school teachers and government employees, and the criterion for serving the community.

### He Yingqin Advocates Levying Property Tax, Expresses Thoughts on Fundraising for Special Relief Donations

[Central News Agency, New York, March 8th Air Mail] A reporter, having seen news in the Shanghai newspapers of February 20th about the Supervisory Committee for Special Relief Donations designating wealthy people to acknowledge donations, and that former Chief of Staff He Yingqin was also among the top names, specially requested to see Mr. He at his office in the Chinese Delegation to the Military Staff Committee in New York to inquire about his thoughts on the matter. Mr. He was humble and sincere in his attitude and patiently answered all the questions raised by the reporter. The following is an excerpt of the questions and answers:

Reporter: "Have you heard about the recent designation of names by the Supervisory Committee for Special Relief Donations in the country?"

Mr. He smiled and nodded, replying, "Yes, I have seen it in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao."

Q: "You are listed as one of the top fifty wealthiest people. What are your thoughts on this?"

A: "The news in the newspaper has not yet been confirmed as a decision of the Supervisory Committee. According to the news, Article 4 of the donation amount review standards of the Supervisory Committee divides the property value of natural persons and the asset value of legal persons into ten levels. I have no financial resources to invest in industry and commerce and have nothing to do with the assets of legal persons. However, according to the property value of natural persons, the highest level is over 500 billion yuan, and the lowest level is over 50 billion yuan. If I am listed as the wealthiest person, it means that my family's property value is estimated at hundreds of billions of yuan, which is not in line with the facts. I have some property in the country, but its value is actually limited. In any case, I am not qualified to be called the wealthiest person."

Q: "I heard that some people in the country are rumored to have said that you have a large amount of US dollars deposited in the United States. Have you heard about this?"

A: "Before coming to the United States, I had absolutely no US dollars deposited in the United States. After being appointed to come to the United States in 1946, I first deposited the remaining 20,000 yuan from the travel expenses and special expenses issued by the government on August 7th of that year into the Washington Port Local Bank near the former headquarters of our delegation on Long Island, New York State. The account was opened under my name and official rank. This was the first time in my life that I opened an account in a foreign bank. Later, because our delegation moved to an office in New York City, I opened an account at the Bank of New York (Citibank) near the current delegation's headquarters. The bank has records of all income and expenses that can be checked. In addition, I have no other deposits in any other foreign bank, nor do I own any property in foreign countries. Moreover, during the war, I repeatedly advocated that the government should use the overseas deposits of our private citizens. I also made this proposal at the Sixth National Congress of our party, so whether I have a large amount of US dollars or not is self-evident."

Q: "Do you think the method of special relief donations is reasonable? Is it effective?"

A: "I work overseas and am not very clear about this matter, so I cannot criticize it. But in principle, if the country's finances are so difficult, the people should understand the general situation and follow the principle of contributing money if you have it and contributing effort if you have it, and enthusiastically acknowledge donations. If the government can establish and implement property tax rules through formal legislative procedures, the effect may be greater than fundraising."

Q: "Are you prepared to donate?"

A: "As one of the government officials, I should take the lead in acknowledging donations. I have already written to the Supervisory Committee to truthfully estimate the value of my existing property and acknowledge donations in accordance with the methods established by the committee. I have also decided to sell my property to pay for this donation."

Q: "You just said that levying property tax is more effective than fundraising. Do you have any specific opinions on this issue?"

A: "I have been considering this issue for a long time and originally intended to submit a proposal to the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, but the conference was postponed, so it was not submitted. In the future, I may submit it to the government for reference."

### American Investigation Team Announces US Plan to Revive Japan in Japan, Average Annual Loan of 300 to 500 Million Yuan Within Five Years, Clap and Others Fly to South Korea Today for Inspection

[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Clap announced today a plan under consideration by a U.S. Congressional Committee to turn Japan into a "Far East Factory," which stipulates that in addition to the 300 to 400 million yuan allocated annually to prevent unrest and disease in Japan, an additional 180 million yuan will be allocated immediately to revive the Japanese economy. Mr. Clap and the accompanying U.S. experts believe that under this plan, Japan's economy will be self-sufficient by 1952 or 1953. Mr. Clap pointed out that Washington believes that the establishment of a self-sufficient economy is Japan's primary goal. The Japanese revival plan is developed based on the same principles as the European revival plan. The State Department and the Army Department believe that in order for Japan to achieve self-sufficiency, a considerable amount of industrial raw materials must be provided in the short term to allow its industries to develop. Mr. Clap solemnly denied that this plan was aimed at the Soviet Union, pointing out that its purpose is: (1) to reduce the burden on U.S. taxpayers; (2) to enable Japan to become self-reliant and become a democratic country. He also pointed out that although the Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the Japanese economy should be based on the 1930-34 level, the United States believes that if Japan's own efforts show that it is possible to raise this level without endangering peace, it may be increased. The U.S. plan anticipates that the economic aid funds allocated in any one year will be limited to a maximum of 580 million yuan, but this amount will decrease gradually, and it is expected that the goal of self-reliance will be achieved by 1952 or 1953. Prior to the U.S. government submitting the plan to Congress, Far Eastern Commission Chairman McCoy informed the Far Eastern Commission of this intention. So far, the Far Eastern Commission has not made any criticisms. Mr. Clap then spoke about the plan to dismantle Japanese industry, believing that it should be implemented in a way that does not hinder economic revival. He also solemnly informed the Japanese people that the success of the economic revival plan depends largely on the self-help efforts of the Japanese people. The main key lies in increasing production, and the results of increased production will determine the living standards of the Japanese people. Mr. Clap continued: Since arriving in Japan, he has found many encouraging phenomena in the gradual development of the Japanese economy, such as the 20% increase in coal production, which is close to the goal of 3 million tons per year, and the rice collection plan has been fully successful. In recent months, the tax system has also been significantly improved. In addition, the Japanese government has also set a goal to increase food production by 10% compared to last year. However, the unfavorable aspects also include the rise in price levels, the increase in the amount of paper money in circulation, and the world's dollar panic, which reduces the purchasing power of importing countries. Mr. Clap also revealed that after arriving in Japan, they also considered the economic problems caused by the increase in the Japanese population, but have not yet found an answer. Finally, he stated that the goal of the Japanese economic revival plan is to make Japan a Far East Factory, but he does not believe that the Japanese economy will harm the economies of other countries in the Far East.

[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The five members of the U.S. Industrial Mission to Japan, led by U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Clap, are scheduled to leave here at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday to fly to the U.S. military zone in South Korea for a brief visit. The group includes Clap, former Chairman of Chemical Bank Trust Company Johnston, Chairman of Studebaker Automobile Company Hoffman, New York textile broker Hurl, economic expert Liesman, and three officers from the Army General Staff.

### Question of Returning Property Seized by Japan, Marshall Issues Statement, Partial Authorization to MacArthur Is Not to Avoid the Far Eastern Commission

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall denied on the 25th that the United States' attempt to return property seized by Japan from the Allies was to circumvent the Far Eastern Commission. He announced at a news conference that the U.S.'s recent recommendations to MacArthur regarding the distribution of this property detained in Japan can only be applied to parts of the return policy on which the Allies have no objections. In response to outside criticism of the U.S. government's direct contact with MacArthur regarding return procedures, Marshall read the following statement to the press:

"According to the terms of the Far Eastern Commission, the United States has the right to issue orders to the Allied Headquarters at any time when an emergency occurs and the event is not within the scope of the policy already established by the Commission, pending further action by the Far Eastern Commission. In this case (regarding the return of seized property), there has been an agreement on part of the return policy in the past, but because many countries harmed by Japan believe this matter is very urgent, the United States believes it is necessary to provide policy guidance to the Allied Headquarters. The instructions issued by the United States to the Allied Headquarters only include the part of the return plan on which the countries have no objections. The part of the return policy that has not been agreed upon is still under discussion in the Far Eastern Commission." At the same time, it was learned from reliable sources that U.S. Far Eastern Commission Representative McCoy informed the Far Eastern Commission that, regarding the handling of seized property in Japan, requests had been repeatedly made to grant MacArthur the authority to handle certain types of seized property not included in the current Far Eastern Commission instructions. McCoy explained the recent temporary directive issued by the U.S. government, authorizing MacArthur to have this authority, stating that some of this property, currently stored in Japanese warehouses, is being damaged. Countries occupied by Japan during the war and subjected to Japanese seizure are extremely concerned about the return plan. Representatives from China, France, Australia, and the Netherlands believe this is a matter of urgency. McCoy pointed out that the Far Eastern Commission has been engaged in negotiations on the return issue since 1946. The countries have been able to reach some agreed terms on the return of seized property found in Japan, and the intention is to merge them into their policy, which is an annex. McCoy said that the representatives of the ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission had endorsed an expanded policy, but only one country's representative did not endorse it, and the reason for not endorsing it was because the agreement omitted a provision that was of particular interest to them, rather than opposing the expanded policy endorsed by their colleagues, which also shows the extent of the consensus. Due to the consensus of the representatives, which is necessary for policy decisions, the expanded policy was not passed. Millions of People Participating in Strike

### Japanese Labor Strike Expands

Millions of People Participating in Strike

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Japan National Public Employees' Union Association announced that the number of public employees currently participating in the struggle against the government is 1.05 million. In addition, 79,000 people (all postal, telegraph, and telephone workers) participated in the nationwide public employees' union strike on the 25th, and the number reached 119,000 on the 26th. The National Postal Workers' Union has also instructed the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions to start a 24-hour strike struggle movement from the 29th, western Japan from the 30th, and other parts of the country from the 31st.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The Tokyo Municipal Bus and Tram Workers' Union has decided to participate in the strike movement, starting a 24-hour strike from the morning of the 26th. No public military vehicles are operating in the city this morning. The union also declared that it will begin an indefinite strike movement from the 27th. The citizens of Tokyo are feeling the pain of this strike.

### Tojo Appeals Again, Demanding a Declaration of Innocence

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] It was learned on the 25th that Tojo, in his final appeal demanding a declaration of innocence, will argue, based on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals, that he should only be held responsible for wartime actions within his political scope, and therefore, in a legal sense, does not bear any criminal responsibility. Tojo will use this key point as his defense.

### South Korean Elections Near, U.S. May Increase Troop Deployment

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 26th] U.S. Military Governor of South Korea, General Lerch, stated yesterday while hosting reporters: "April is a critical juncture for Korea. The Korean people should rise up for democracy and pay attention to the activities of communists." General Lerch resolutely declared that anyone who attempts to obstruct the elections through riots will be regarded as instigated by the North Korean Labor Party. A reporter asked about rumors of U.S. troop reinforcements to South Korea. General Lerch replied: "The U.S. military has no ambitions for bases in South Korea. I have heard that the U.S. occupation authorities have requested the Army Department to send additional troops, but the details are unknown."

[United Press, Seoul, 26th] According to broadcasts today on two occasions by the Pyeongyang radio station controlled by Soviet forces, the Soviet occupation forces command in northern Korea has invited leaders from right-wing, left-wing, and centrist parties in southern Korea to hold a meeting on April 14th to assist in establishing a Korean government under Soviet protection. Kim Ku, leader of the Korean Independence Party, and other political leaders who oppose the May 9th general election plan are among those invited. However, Kim Ku has not commented on this. Kim Kyu-sik, leader of the Free Party, stated that he had not heard the broadcast, but if formally invited, he would attend to see what it is all about.

### Soviet Representative Declares Maintaining the Four-Power Joint Control System in Germany, Western Allied Front Wins

[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Berlin News, The Soviet representative to the Berlin Allied Control Council withdrew from the talks last Saturday, putting the future of the Control Council in serious danger. However, today the Soviet side has indirectly yielded to U.S. General Clay. In a policy statement, a senior Soviet official announced that the Four-Power Conference would continue to be held. It is believed that Marshal Sokolovsky, who withdrew from the meeting last Saturday, will reconvene the Control Council meeting on March 30th. The Soviet statement is considered a victory for General Clay. According to reports, General Clay, together with British and French representatives, informed the Soviet side on Tuesday that the three Western powers did not intend to attend the Four-Power working group meetings until the Soviet side convened a central meeting of the Control Council.

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Lieutenant General Lukan Chenko, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government in Germany, recently stated that the Soviet Union supports the continuation of the Four-Power control system in Germany and hopes to preserve the Allied Control Council to implement the decisions of the Potsdam Conference. This is the first official statement from the Soviet representative regarding the withdrawal from the Allied Control Council meeting last Saturday, expressing hope for the continued existence of the Four-Power joint institutions in Germany. However, there was no request for the Allied Control Council to hold a meeting on March 30, the date of the next regular meeting. (According to the Allied Secretariat's charter, the holding of regular meetings of the Allied Control Council must be notified four days in advance.) Allied sources generally believe that the Soviet Union deliberately abandoned the last opportunity to convene a meeting of the Allied Control Council.

General Lukan Chenko stated, "We are willing to strictly comply with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference and the rules of Four-Power joint control in Germany. During the period when the Allied Control Council can take the most expeditious action to fulfill the goals of the Potsdam resolutions, the Soviet representative will support the Allied Control Council and its institutions in every way. However, the Soviet representative is completely opposed to using the Allied Control Council as a shield to cover up the unilateral actions of the Western occupying powers. We cannot support an Allied Control Council that is only nominally functional and is used by the British, American, and French to conceal their divisive measures in West Germany. Since mid-1947, almost no agreement has been reached on the various matters discussed by the Allied Control Council. Our conclusion is that the Allied Control Council is no longer a legislative and administrative institution, but has gradually become a forum for debate. The Western Allies bear full responsibility for the deadlock in the Four-Power control mechanism." General Lukan Chenko also stated that the Soviet Union, in its capacity as chairman, announced the indefinite postponement of the Four-Power Liaison Committee on March 23 for technical reasons.

### Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Begin

[Reuters, London, 26th] Moscow Radio reported that the delegation led by Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala held negotiations with the Soviet side yesterday on the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, chaired by Molotov.

[United Press, Helsinki, 25th] The Finnish Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party held a meeting last night to organize a joint front to fight for peace and bread. Communist leader Mrs. Koskinen said that the Czech Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party formed a joint front, which defeated the reactionaries. We can learn from this.

### British House of Commons Recesses

[Reuters, London, 25th] The House of Commons began its Easter recess on the 25th and will reconvene on April 6th to debate the budget.

### Marshall Sternly Reprimands, Soviet Plots to Disrupt Unity, Soviet Far East Elite Troops Increase Defense of Berlin

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall warned the Soviet Union today that the U.S. occupying authorities have no intention of being forced to withdraw from Berlin. Marshall stated at a press conference that the Soviet representative to the Berlin Allied Control Council has repeatedly blocked U.S. efforts to make the council an effective institution for three years. Any future attempts to undermine the authority of the Allied Control Council, such as the actions of the Soviet representative on March 20th, will be regarded as an effort to oppose the Four-Power agreement on German policy and will be seen as a unilateral action obstructing German unification. Under the international agreements binding the Four Powers, the United States will fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the Allied Control Council and will continue to be a joint occupier of Berlin. Marshall also pointed out that the German People's Congress hosted by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is a communist-controlled organization without the support of other parties and condemned by other parties. Therefore, the authorities in the West German merged zones do not allow it to operate within their borders. The so-called German People's Congress cannot claim to be representative of the entire German people.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] The Swiss "Geneva Daily" published today that the Soviet Union has stationed elite troops around Berlin, just like in 1945. The Soviet army contains superior units, such as special detachments from Tartar, Mongolian, and Kalmyk Siberian regions. Several divisions recently arrived in the Berlin area, some of which came directly from Arkhangelsk in Siberia. The strength of the armored divisions around Berlin amounts to 31,500 men. The Allied side has not increased its military strength, but it is generally believed here that the Allied air force will greatly increase its strength in the near future.

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 25th] General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, stated at a press conference here today that the crisis between the countries of Western Europe and the Soviet Union is a political event. Allied reporters asked General Clay whether he believed he could put out the fire, comparing the U.S. Army to a fire brigade preparing to rush to the scene of a fire. General Clay replied, "I am a soldier, not a politician. Soldiers are not afraid of tomorrow or the future. As for the crisis that has just occurred in Berlin, it is purely political in nature. The State Department's transfer of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany to the management of the Army Department has not changed the policy of the United States currently being implemented in Germany. The training of the troops will continue as originally planned, and the major U.S. military exercises this spring will still be carried out as in previous years."

### Czech General Election to Be Held on May 23

[Reuters, Prague, 25th] The Czech Cabinet decided on the 25th that the Czech general election will be held on Sunday, May 23rd.

### Pan-American Conference Invites the United Nations to Participate

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] UN Secretary-General Lie announced that the Pan-American Conference to be held in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, at the end of this month has invited UN agencies to participate. UN Assistant Secretary-General Bryce will lead a delegation of five secretaries to depart on Friday.

### The U.S. Announces the Implementation of Controls on the Export of Aircraft and Parts, Domestic Opposition to Shipping Materials to the Soviet Union Increases Daily

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman announced today controls over the export of all U.S. aircraft and parts.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th, United Press] Local aircraft dealer Fink testified to the House Surplus Materials Committee that he sold surplus aircraft engines and parts worth $140,000 to the Soviet Union last year and obtained permission from the State Department. Fink stated that the FBI also allowed him to ship the parts for export, but ordered him to notify the bureau of any subsequent transactions he might have with the Soviet Union or other countries behind the Iron Curtain. There is a growing demand inside and outside Congress to prohibit the shipment of materials to the Soviet Union. Secretary of Commerce Harriman said that steps have been taken to prohibit the shipment of materials that could be used for war to the Soviet Union. Senator Bridges said that such material exports are shameful and almost treasonous.

### U.S. Military Personnel Changes, General Rivers Dies

[United Press, San Diego, 25th] Naval authorities announced today that Lieutenant General Cates, commander of the Marine Corps in the Pacific Fleet, will be transferred to the position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations in April. Vice Admiral Sherman, the former Deputy Chief, took over as commander of the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-February.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Admiral Rivers, the father of the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier task force, passed away here yesterday at the age of seventy-five. He began coordinating aircraft and warships to form carrier task forces, creating the U.S. victory in the Pacific during World War II. Siamese Ambassador to London Resigns.

### Soviet Union Suggests to Siam the Exchange of Military Delegations

Siamese Ambassador to London Resigns.

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 25th] According to the local Akkarat newspaper, the Soviet Minister who arrived here last week proposed to the Siamese government that the Soviet Union and Siam should exchange military delegations in order to consolidate the good relations between the two countries. If this proposal is accepted by the Phibun government, some Siamese military officers will go to the Soviet Union to study at military academies, and a Soviet military delegation will come to Siam. The Siamese Minister of Defense is currently studying this proposal.

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 26th] Siamese Ambassador to the UK, Derek's resignation, has been accepted by the government. The person who will succeed Derek may be Naklott, the current ambassador to France. As for the Siamese ambassador to China, he has not yet been appointed.

### Foreign Submarines Appear on the West Coast, U.S. Needs to Build a Strong Navy, Navy Secretary Testifies Before Senate Armed Services Committee

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Navy Secretary Sullivan revealed while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee that several submarines not belonging to any country west of the Iron Curtain have recently been discovered off the U.S. coast. Although Sullivan did not specify the nationality, among the countries behind the Iron Curtain, only the Soviet Union has a submarine fleet. Sullivan also said, "Although I do not intend to overemphasize these incidents, we still remember that the Germans in 1917 and 1941 did scout off the U.S. coast with submarines." According to a senior U.S. Navy official, foreign submarines have recently been discovered off the U.S. Pacific coast three times. One was discovered 320 kilometers from San Francisco, one was discovered ten days ago by a U.S. aircraft outside the Aleutian Islands, and another U.S. merchant ship discovered the periscope of a submarine at Johnston Island Naval Base, 1,280 kilometers from Hawaii.

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] U.S. Navy Secretary Sullivan today asked the Senate Armed Services Committee to build a stronger navy. He pointed out that the Soviet Union has acquired dozens of new German-style submarines, including four of the latest design, equipped with "Schnorchel" equipment, which can pass electricity underwater and have a very high underwater speed. They are extremely effective in submarine warfare tactics and extremely difficult to detect or counterattack. The four major German submarine manufacturing plants are now under Soviet control. All the submarines used by Germany in the last war came from these four manufacturing plants, which have all kinds of secret drawings and the latest submarine parts. Sullivan specifically pointed out that at the outbreak of World War II, Germany had only fifty submarines, which had almost won the Battle of the Atlantic. Now the Soviet Union has 250 submarines and is more likely to manufacture a large number of the latest submarines that are more effective than those used by Germany during the war in the short term. The strategic materials needed by the United States all rely on sea lanes for entry, but so far there are no countermeasures to deal with new submarines. Research shows that a complete solution is extremely difficult to find. Sullivan advocated strengthening the U.S. Navy's strength to the permissible extent as soon as possible. If it relies solely on the strength of the U.S. Navy's existing fleet, it may cause a tragedy. The number of U.S. active-duty naval personnel is 185,000 fewer than the permissible strength, which is only enough to operate 277 combat warships and 466 small and auxiliary warships. According to the recent decision of the Florida Chiefs of Staff Conference, the U.S. Navy will build an 80,000-ton aircraft carrier.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Air Force Secretary Symington told the Senate Armed Services Committee today that U.S. long-range bombers can take off from Alaska, bomb any place in the Soviet Union, and then fly back to U.S. bases. The U.S. Air Force currently has 55 combat units. Although the organization is very complete, it is still a peacetime organization, which is weak compared to the 243 units it had during World War II, but it can also be used as the core for expansion. Symington also said that the latest B-29 Superfortress can fly straight for more than 2,000 miles, and with the latest in-flight refueling technology, it can penetrate any corner of the Soviet Union.

### Italian Printing Industry Strike Ends, Communist Group Seizes Power

[United Press, Rome, 25th] The nationwide strike of printing workers directed by the Italian Communist Party ended today, and newspapers resumed publication. The government claimed that the Communist Party instigated the strike to prevent the impact of the three-nation proposal on the Italian election, but the union denied this, saying it was purely a labor dispute.

[United Press, Rome, 26th] The Italian Communist Party declared today that if it is deprived of the "rights granted by the majority" in the April 18th general election, it will seize the government by force.

### Greece Celebrates Independence Day

[Reuters, Athens, 25th] Greece celebrated the 127th anniversary of its independence today. King Paul of Greece participated in religious ceremonies in the cathedral and then presided over a military parade. He issued a proclamation to the people, expressing that despite the current crisis, he still has full confidence in the future. Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis said that Greece is no longer isolated and without armaments and hopes to defeat the guerrillas soon. Griswold, the head of the U.S. aid delegation to Greece, broadcast to the Greeks, stating that U.S. aid is by no means temporary. The hand extended by the United States does not wear poisoned rings, and he believes that the war against the guerrillas will be won. The celebrations of the citizens of Athens included torchlight parades and fireworks.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] President Truman sent a telegram to King Paul of Greece on Greek Independence Day, saying that totalitarian forces are planning to exploit human dignity and freedom with the help of violence and terror in order to expand their power. Although Truman did not specify what the totalitarian forces were, he was clearly referring to communism. He said that free people should show courage and determination to defend their independence.

### British Prime Minister Explains Anti-Communist Measures in the House of Commons, Dishonest Civil Servants Will Be Dismissed

[United Press, London, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of Commons today that national defense secrets must be kept, especially today. The government has the right to purge dishonest civil servants, but it will not conduct a full-scale purge. It will also establish a three-member advisory committee to allow those who are purged to state their opinions before being dismissed. It is expected that very few civil servants will leave office due to the purge, but it is also a fact that some are obsessed with communism. The Communist Party is disloyal and unjust, and its consistent style is to blame others for its own mistakes. The entire House of Commons unanimously agreed with the Prime Minister's opinion, with the exception of the infuriated Communist Member of Parliament Gara, who said that the purge order was instigated by American tycoons, and the United States wanted to make Britain an outpost for American monopoly capitalists to attack Europe.

### The Fabian Society of England

— (This article by Bengeng)

The Labour Party is now in power in England, and it seems that the Party owes its current prestige to two organizations: the Fabian Society and the Trade Union. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the Fabian Society.

(I)

The Fabian Society was founded in 1884, with David Davidson, Bomore Booth and others as the initial founders. Later, George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, and others joined. Its purpose was to reform society. As to why it is called the Fabian Society, it is said to be named after the surname of a Roman general. Around 300 BC, there was a family in Rome named Fabius, which produced many famous people. Around 200 BC, a general named Quintus Fabius Maximus emerged. This general was known for his cautious tactics in his war against Hannibal. The "Fabian" in the Fabian Society is derived from the surname of this general. In 1889, the Fabian Society published a book entitled "Fabian Essays," written by George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb, Beasant, Wallas, and others. This book explained their views and also brought the Fabian Society to the attention of various quarters. Since then, more than two hundred treatises have been published successively, discussing various issues.

When the Fabian Society was founded, there was no Labour Party in England. It was not until 1893 that England had an Independent Labour Party. It was not until 1900 that England had the current Labour Party. However, at that time, in addition to the Fabian Society, there were two other organizations in England that also advocated socialism: the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist League. However, the views of these two groups were generally radical and differed from those of the Fabian Society.

(II)

Generally speaking, the Fabian Society advocates the gradual transformation of society, hoping to achieve socialism through the use of the universal suffrage system and representative government. In other words, they believe that the transition from a capitalist society to a socialist society is a gradual evolutionary process, not a revolutionary process. Therefore, although the Fabian Society advocates socialism, it is different from Marxism. Marx believed that the realization of socialism was due to the proletarian revolution, which was the result of the inherent contradictions in capitalist society. According to this theory, the more miserable the lives of the proletariat, the more ripe the opportunity for revolution. However, the members of the Fabian Society believe that various social reforms since the nineteenth century, such as the Factory Act and the Mining Act, have indicated that socialist reforms have already begun within capitalist society. Thus, they believe that the application of modern democracy can realize socialism through a representative system.

However, although the Fabian Society has the above-mentioned views, it cannot be said to be a political party in itself. First, according to its constitution, its purpose is to establish a new society in which economic privileges are abolished through public ownership, while the goal is to achieve this through political democracy. However, apart from that, they do not talk about "dogma." In the books and periodicals published by the Fabian Society, the first page always states that "this book represents the author's personal opinion, not the collective opinion of the Fabian Society." In other words, it is an organization that only seeks "universal harmony," and its attitude towards personal opinions is liberal. Second, the Fabian Society has an important position in England, but apart from publishing specialized cultural and educational works, it only helps other groups or its members to engage in political activities, and it never participates in actual political actions itself. The establishment of the Independent Labour Party in England was aided by it, and the emergence of the Labour Party in England was even more due to the help of the Fabian Society. Now, many Fabian Society members are important figures in the Labour Party, but if one were to say that the Fabian Society is affiliated with the Labour Party, or that the Labour Party is affiliated with the Fabian Society, then it is not necessarily entirely correct, although the Labour Party's views, generally speaking, are derived from the Fabian Society's views. Five years ago, the Fabian Society had only about two thousand members and a dozen local branches. Now, it has about five thousand members and more than one hundred local branches. Judging from the situation in the past five years, it can be said that it has developed not slowly. However, if one looks at the Fabian Society's sixty-year history, it cannot be said that it has developed quickly. The reason for this is simple: it is a group with political views but no political action. At the same time, the intellectual level of Fabian Society members seems to be quite high, so there are naturally not too many members.

(III)

The current work of the Fabian Society seems to be mainly focused on education and culture. In addition to frequently organizing summer schools, weekend schools, and various discussion meetings, it has two very important working departments, namely publishing and research. Regarding publishing, there is Fabian News, which is a publication that reports on the situation of the Fabian Society. There is the Fabian Quarterly, which is a publication that publishes various special studies and reports, and also serves as a forum for discussing various issues. In addition, there are "Fabian Tracts" and "Research Series." More than two hundred of the former have been published, and more than one hundred of the latter have also been published. However, such publications are often not very long. There are also other publications in book form, such as Robson's "Public Enterprise," and recently there have been several "Discussion Pamphlets." Regarding research, the Fabian Society originally had a domestic issues research department. In 1931, a New Fabian Research Bureau was established outside the Fabian Society, and it cooperated with the Fabian Society. The founders, such as Attlee (the current British Prime Minister), Cripps (the current Chancellor of the Exchequer), Dalton (the former Chancellor of the Exchequer), and Bevin (the current Foreign Secretary), are all key members of the Fabian Society. This Research Bureau officially merged with the Fabian Society in 1939. The scope of their research is very broad. Specific issues are sometimes researched by a committee, and sometimes by specific members. The results of the research are then criticized by designated members, but the focus of their criticism is not on whether the research results can be agreed with, but on whether sufficient research has been conducted from the perspective of socialists. In other words, the results of the research, whether published or not, do not represent the "Society" but only represent the "individual." This is because, in addition to striving for socialism and democratic politics, which is a common goal, the Fabian Society does not have a "party line." Under such a broad scope, differences of opinion are inevitable, and they allow for the existence of such "differences."

(IV)

As mentioned above, we can know that the Fabian Society has two major characteristics: first, it can be said to be a group of socialists, but they also believe in democratic politics; second, it is a group with political views that does not directly participate in political actions. Due to the first point, they have great differences with the Communist Party. They oppose dogma or Bible-like party programs, and they do not adopt strict organization. Under "universal harmony," the existence of individuals is allowed. Due to the second point, although they have close ties with the Labour Party, they do not have organizational ties. Their members participate in politics, but their group exists outside of politics. This approach may be because they believe that socialism is not a fixed definition, but rather a set of principles. Because they are principles, discussion and "minor differences" must be allowed. At the same time, they believe that socialism is not simply a political issue, but also includes "theory" and the daily way of life of society. This group is willing to devote itself to the socialist movement outside of politics. From our point of view, the Fabian Society can be said to be a kind of "new liberalism." They inherit some of the ideas of old liberalism, advocating democratic politics and respecting groups. At the same time, due to the development of society, they understand the necessity of socialism. Although it has a history of sixty years, it still represents a school of thought in Europe today, existing between capitalism and communism. Looking at the policies of the British Labour Party today, we can know that it has a great influence on British politics. (London, February 20, 1948)

### Truman Calls for Truce in Holy Land; Arabs and Jews Reject; Lie Says UN Reputation Largely Lost

[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] United Nations circles believe that President Truman's call for a truce between Arabs and Jews in Palestine has little or no hope of success. The Arabs have rejected it, and the Jews are vague. However, a Jewish spokesman said: The Jewish position has been clarified on March 17, which is tantamount to saying that the Jews only support the partition plan.

Moreover, it is doubtful whether the US trusteeship plan can be implemented before May 15, and if it cannot, bloodshed will be inevitable. According to reliable sources, the US trusteeship plan is based on the hope that the British forces will slightly delay their withdrawal. There are even reports that the US ambassador has discussed this matter with the British government in London.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] Council sources said recently that President Truman's unconditional support for the establishment of a trusteeship system in Palestine, and his request for a truce between the Jewish and Arab factions, have made the convening of a special session of the General Assembly inevitable. However, they also pointed out that the only factor that could cause the General Assembly to change its partition resolution would be a US guarantee to use US troops to implement the trusteeship system when necessary.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 25th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie today admitted at a press conference that the United Nations organization has lost a large part of its reputation, and the blame lies mostly with the five powers. The United Nations was originally based on the cooperation of the five powers, so the five powers should do their best to find ways to cooperate. Lie also said that the US proposal to establish a trusteeship in Palestine was completely unexpected to him. The secretariat staff of the United Nations Palestine Committee have arrived in the Holy Land and have established good cooperation with the British authorities and the Jews, but the Arabs insist on their position and completely disregard the work of the United Nations Committee.

### Authorities Hope Communists Surrender; 400 Listed on Blacklist; Nearly Half Arrested in Recent Days; Chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union Turns Himself In; Tao Yunshan and Wife Only Realize They Are "Comrades" Upon Arrival

[This newspaper report] Since the municipal military and political authorities announced the cracking down on Communist institutions, several people have surrendered to the authorities as of yesterday. Of those who held important positions in the Communist Party, and whose names have been learned by reporters, there are currently only two people. One is Tao Yunshan, and the other is Jin Yunshui. Tao Yunshan is the Chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union, serving as the secretary of a Communist branch, and also the nephew of Tao Baichuan, who is in the Shanghai Human Rights Protection Committee. After obtaining clues, the authorities went to arrest him, and initially only apprehended Tao's wife. Tao only knew that his wife was also a "comrade" after his wife was arrested, and surrendered himself to the police station. As for Jin, he was the first to surrender to the police station after the Taian case was cracked. His identity is said to be of the "municipal committee" level. Both Tao and Jin are very young, and are currently being detained in a certain institution.

It is reported that as of the 26th, the authorities have arrested more than 160 Communist elements based on the blacklist. Among them are several "municipal party committee members" and "district committee members" appointed by the Communists. More than 40 of the arrested criminals who are important have been sent to the Garrison Headquarters detention center by the Garrison Brigade. More than 100 others are being detained at the police station's various branches, and preliminary interrogations are being conducted separately. It is reported that there are about 400 criminals on the "blacklist," and more than 200 others have either fled or are in hiding. The Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau, together with relevant institutions, will continue to pursue them.

Mayor Wu specially received reporters at the municipal government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday and made a brief report, stating that after the cracking of this case, the arrest of bandits began on Monday of this week, and the press was not invited to publish it until Wednesday. The authorities did not intend to announce the truth, fearing that the outside world would misunderstand the situation and mistake it for forced conscription, causing the families of those arrested to petition, etc. Therefore, it was decided to disclose it publicly. However, because this case is still in progress, some parts of the entire case cannot be revealed yet, and it can be fully released in the coming days. The documents of the Communist bandits arrested in this case have been examined in detail by various sectors invited by the municipal government. In recent days, several people have surrendered to the authorities. Today (the 26th), two more workers surrendered to the police station, which is of great significance to the development of the entire case. I hope that all the Communists listed on the list can surrender themselves so as to obtain a new path, and those workers who are not on the list can work with peace of mind and will not be embarrassed.

### Tao Yunshan's Experience Joining the Communists

It has been found that Tao Yunshan secretly joined the Communist Party in Shanghai in 1941. At that time, he filled out a membership application and took an oath, so he was a quasi-Communist Party member, but he did not have a party card. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist bandits gave him the appointment of striving for the silk weaving industry union so as not to be controlled by the government. However, since Tao became the chairman of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union, Tao had a lot of contact with various parties in Shanghai, so the Communist bandits were extremely vigilant for fear of his turning around. Moreover, since the winter of last year, the Communist bandits have pressured Tao Yunshan to use economic struggle as a means to achieve the purpose of political struggle, but Tao opposed it, so the relationship deteriorated once. Since Tao learned of the Communist bandits' plan to destroy Shanghai by force, he surrendered himself to the police station a few days ago and confessed all the policies and routes of the Communist bandits. It is also learned that Tao Yunshan will publish a detailed confession in the coming days.

### Newspaper Industry Association Urges Prompt Determination of Paper Allocation; Seven Representatives Took Train to Beijing Last Night

[This newspaper report] The Newspaper Industry Association of this city believes that the import quota of white paper for the fifth and sixth periods to be distributed to its member newspapers has not yet been approved. The board of directors was convened a few days ago, and it was specifically decided to send Li Zikuan, Chen Xun, Lu Guang, Liu Zirun, Sun Daosheng, Chen Daoyi, Mao Zipei, and other seven people to Beijing last night to petition the President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang. Here is an excerpt of the content of the association's petition:

"Since the government managed foreign exchange at the beginning of last year, this industry has relied on your generous assistance and has been allocated import quotas for white paper, which have been approved in order, for a total of four periods. However, the quota does not meet the actual needs of various newspapers in this industry, and the quota in Shanghai has been reduced. Therefore, we have no choice but to purchase from the black market to supplement it. The difference in price is many times more, which has burdened us and made it difficult to cope. The timing of the announcement of the approved paper quota for each period is also delayed. After this industry sends the purchase contract to the Import Management Committee and submits it, it takes a considerable amount of time to apply for an import license. During this slow process of handling official documents, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted many times, causing the member newspapers to suffer a heavy burden that is foreseeable and unavoidable, affecting costs and prices. This difficulty is difficult to describe. Now, the fifth period purchase quota time is almost two-thirds over (February to April of the 37th year of the Republic of China), and the number of newspapers allocated is still nowhere to be found. In addition to hoping, we have inquired in many ways and learned that the import quota allocation office believes that the National Economic Commission advocates importing more paper pulp and must obtain its approval, making it difficult to handle immediately. The National Economic Commission has already drafted a plan and submitted it to your office for review. We believe that the self-sufficiency of newspapers is indeed a way to revitalize industry. This industry abides by national policies and promotes culture. We have no objection to this measure; however, this end industry believes that the current supply and demand situation must be taken into account. We must not wait empty-bellied for the autumn harvest, nor can we draw a cake to satisfy hunger, ignoring reality. It is found that more purchases of paper pulp for papermaking were originally planned to have a certain process. If it can be successful as scheduled, the output is still insufficient. However, to date, it has been deliberated for a long time, and the implementation plan is still vague. Foreign pulp purchases cannot be obtained in an instant, and even if the pulp arrives, it will be delivered to the factory for manufacturing, and there are various difficulties that must be resolved after a relatively long time. However, the paper stocks of the newspapers are running out and cannot be maintained. We have not forgotten that at the conference on February 7th, the National Economic Commission invited responsible persons and officials from the paper industry, the book industry, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to a meeting at the Shanghai Public Training Alumni Club. A certain papermaking expert stated that it is still difficult to manufacture one ton of white paper with one ton of paper pulp. This statement should be based on the fact that the price of paper pulp is not necessarily lower than that of finished paper, which violates the original intention of saving foreign exchange. If we make our own paper, plus other raw materials, wages, factory costs, etc., the value of one ton of domestic paper will inevitably exceed the value of one ton of imported paper by a large amount. Such a price is beyond what the domestic newspaper industry can bear. As for the import of finished paper, it will take two or three months to arrive at the port after the contract is signed. The fifth period quota was originally for the application of various newspapers in February, March, and April of this year. Now, February and March have passed, and the quota has not yet been allocated. Various newspapers have no way to order it. Even if the quota is immediately allocated, it will not be possible to arrive in three months. At that time, how will the various newspapers continue to publish without interruption? This is a serious problem that makes this industry even more uneasy and frightened. Therefore, we have sent representatives Li Zikuan, Chen Xun, Lu Guang, Liu Zirun, Sun Daosheng, Chen Daoyi, Mao Zipei, and other seven people to Beijing overnight to appeal to your leader. Please uphold justice, consider the facts, and promptly urge the relevant departments to expedite the approval of the fifth and sixth import quotas for white paper. The amount that this association should be allocated should still be the original amount from the fourth period and should not be reduced. In order to maintain the continuity of the industry's business prospects, this association has described its grievances in detail and hopes for your kind attention. Everything that is not yet complete will be presented by the representatives. We cannot express our anticipation."

### Lawsuit on Legislative Election; Part Not Withdrawn Awaits Retrial

[This newspaper report] Regarding the disputes in the legislative elections, Zhang Xiaosong, the chief executive of the Shanghai Election Office, was sued by Xie Renzhao, Ma Junshuo, Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, Xia Sungui, Dai Yun, Huang Minhou, and others, and filed a lawsuit with the High Court to confirm the election as invalid. The High Court was heard by Chief Justice Li Liangting yesterday morning. The plaintiffs Xie Renzhao and Ma Junshuo had already submitted a withdrawal of the lawsuit on the 6th of this month. In addition, the plaintiffs Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, and Zhao Zhimei also submitted a withdrawal petition in court yesterday morning, so in reality, there are only three plaintiffs, Xia Sungui, Dai Yun, and Huang Minhou. The defendant Zhang Xiaosong hired lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Huang Jiyuan yesterday to defend him in court. As a result, the retrial was postponed. Here is an excerpt of the main points of the defense: According to Article 37 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, the lawsuit should be filed against the chairman of the committee or the election supervisor. Today, the plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit against the Shanghai Election Office and listed Zhang Xiaosong, who is the chief executive, as the legal representative, and have not filed a lawsuit against the chairman of the committee. This is unreasonable and should be rejected directly. Chief Justice Li has now postponed the retrial for the part of the plaintiff who has not withdrawn the lawsuit.

### Zhou Yizhi and Others Withdraw Lawsuit; Mayor Wu Expresses Admiration

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, and others, candidates in the local legislative election, believed that there were some shortcomings in the election process. They filed a lawsuit with the court. It is now learned that after exchanging views, Zhou and others have voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit. Mayor Wu expressed his admiration for them. The conversations between Zhou and Mayor Wu are recorded separately below:

Remarks by Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhigong, and Others: Regarding the lawsuit concerning the local legislative election, we are all plaintiffs. Our intention is none other than to hope that Shanghai's electoral politics will have an opportunity for clarification and improvement in the future. We dare say that our motives are very pure. Within this past week, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council, we also frankly exchanged views with Mayor Wu. It was decided that the municipal government would convene a review meeting to thoroughly examine the various shortcomings of the past. Simultaneously, a committee will be established under the municipal government to provide opportunities to study and improve electoral politics at any time. We all have our own professional positions in Shanghai. As long as our initial aspirations are realized, we will have a clear conscience and be able to offer some comfort to the voters of Shanghai. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw as plaintiffs. Mayor Wu expressed his admiration for Zhou and others' withdrawal of the lawsuit and issued a special statement: "Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, Zhao Zhimei, and other candidates in the local legislative election believed that there were some shortcomings in the election process. Therefore, they filed an election lawsuit with the court. After exchanging views, the misunderstandings were cleared up. Now I have learned that Mr. Zhou Yizhi, Lu Meiseng, and Zhao Zhimei have voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit. This attitude of focusing on the matter and not the person is truly admirable. However, our country's implementation of democratic politics is still in its infancy. Research and improvement are necessary. In the future, an electoral politics research association can be established to recruit enthusiastic individuals to participate in discussions in order to provide suggestions to the government for technical improvements in future elections. I personally believe that when Shanghai holds various elections again, it will definitely achieve further progress as a result."

### Registration Begins for Immigration to the United States

After the case was remanded for retrial, Court President Liu Yugui of the High Court pronounced the sentence yesterday, reducing the imprisonment to four years.

### Five Suspects in the Chou Case File Appeal; Chou's Wife Declares Separation from Family; Future Lawsuits to be Filed by Elderly Mother

Furthermore, the District Court summoned Chou's wife, Chen Aizhu, yesterday. According to Chen, she has already separated from the family, and future lawsuits will be filed by Chou's mother, Yu Shi Chuanmian. She will not be named.

### Iron Newspaper Case: Wu Chongwen Prosecuted

### Car Crashes into Shop Window at No. 3

### Girl Commits Suicide by Lying on Tracks Near Kunshan Station

### Radio Registration: Applications Can Be Mailed

Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, made the following remarks yesterday regarding radio registration: "This time, we are ordered to urge all radio listeners to register their radios, specifically for the purpose of collecting statistics on the number of radios and understanding their distribution in various areas. The radio registration rules published in the newspapers some time ago were announced on January 20th of the 31st year. At that time, it was during the Anti-Japanese War, and the rules were drafted based on the situation at the time. The Ministry of Transportation is currently revising them. This urging of registration does not imply any restrictions or crackdowns. Currently, citizens are coming to apply for registration in extremely crowded conditions, and the bureau's manpower is limited, and filling out forms takes time. To avoid applicants having to travel back and forth, applicants can send a letter requesting registration. After the bureau fills out the certificates, it will send them to the applicant's nearest branch office for collection. This is more convenient."

### Supplementary Applications for Exemption or Deferment: Civil Affairs Bureau Provides Detailed Explanation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's report mentioned that eligible young men whose reasons for exemption or deferment occurred after the application period last year can still apply to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

The person in charge of the bureau explained the issue yesterday: The bureau currently only allows supplementary applications for exemption or deferment in the following circumstances: (1) Eligible young men who were not qualified to apply for exemption or deferment last year, but whose reasons for exemption or deferment occurred after the application and review period last year (for example, an eligible young man who had no reason to apply for exemption or deferment during last year's application period, but enrolled in a high school or higher this spring and can legally defer military service. If he is drafted at this time, he can submit proof from the school and apply for a supplementary review, and he can only defer military service after approval). (2) Those who applied for exemption or deferment last year but were ordered to submit supplementary documents because the documents submitted were not in compliance with the review. (3) Those whose applications were rejected but who had valid reasons for applying. Anyone who meets the above conditions can submit supplementary documents, stating the reasons, to the responsible保区 for forwarding to the Civil Affairs Bureau for review from now until April 3rd.

### Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures Re-examines Utensils Used by Rice Shops

[Our Newspaper's Report] The measuring and weighing instruments used by rice shops in the city were inspected by the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures in the 35th year. All qualified merchants were issued a certificate of qualification by the bureau as proof. Now that the policy of issuing rice according to the number of people has been implemented, the bureau is deeply concerned that newly established rice shops or newly purchased instruments have not been sent for inspection, which can easily lead to disputes. Therefore, the bureau has sent personnel to various districts to conduct a re-examination of rice shops. It is reported that a small number of rice shops have been penalized by the bureau according to law for failing to send their instruments for inspection.

### Municipal Government to Discuss Racecourse Property Rights Case Today; Owners Propose Exchange Conditions; Land Bureau Believes it Should be Mutually Beneficial and Equitable

[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of the disposition of the Race Club's property has not yet been resolved. The Municipal Government Council Office will convene relevant agencies at the Municipal Government at 2:30 PM today to hold a discussion meeting. The Municipal Council has also been invited to attend. It is understood that the Land Bureau has sorted and summarized the opinions of the Race Club and submitted them with its own comments for reference. The Land Bureau's opinion is that the Race Club's opinions can be summarized into four points: (1) The land proposed for exchange only refers to the grassy racetrack inside the venue, which covers an area of approximately 80 acres. It is said to be the Racecourse's primary property. The land requested to be exchanged for a new racecourse cannot be less than 500 acres. The expenses for constructing a new racecourse and necessary buildings will be paid by the government and deducted when the Race Club's property is acquired. (2) The Race Club's property, which is the land between the grassy racetrack and Huangpi Road, is approximately 57 acres (excluding the grassy racetrack), and the buildings (including the special grandstand office and other buildings) will be acquired by the government at a price agreed upon by both parties. (3) The land inside the grassy racetrack is said to be the property of the Shanghai Sports Foundation Management Committee. If it is desired to acquire this land, a separate contract must be signed with the Management Committee. (4) The land and buildings on the west side of Huangpi Road are said to be the property of the Jockey Club Co., Ltd. The company should be allowed to decide on its own to sell or otherwise dispose of it.

Land Bureau's Endorsement

However, according to the Land Bureau's endorsement, the first principle for recovering the Xizang Road Racecourse should be to recover the entire venue and all the buildings inside. Since the land and buildings of the Xizang Road Racecourse belong to four different groups, it seems that the persons in charge of each group should be invited to discuss together in order to solve the problem at the same time. Individual negotiations may be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. In addition, matters such as racecourse management rules, taxes, and police maintenance of order should be further studied based on the new mutually beneficial and equitable treaty and the laws and regulations of the Chinese government. There should be no special treatment because of the exchange of venues. Regarding this point, according to the reporter's investigation, the Race Club has requested: (1) The central government should definitely guarantee that the two relevant companies can not only resume business but also continue to hold irregular horse races without interference. (2) An agreement should be established to determine the limits for the payment of taxes and donations on horse racing revenue. (3) The directors of the relevant companies should be allowed to formulate all the regulations and rules applicable to horse racing. (4) At the request of the racecourse officials, the head of the police bureau must dispatch appropriate personnel to maintain the rules and order of the racecourse (there are other conditions, which are not listed in detail). It is understood that regarding the exchange of suburban land, the Land Bureau's endorsement seems to consider the original Jiangwan Racecourse the most suitable.

### City Council Praises Police Department for Success in Suppressing Ding Bandits and Sends Telegrams of Condolence to National Communist Suppression Soldiers

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the resolution of the Fifth General Assembly of the Municipal Council, the Secretariat of the Municipal Council sent telegrams of condolence to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the participating troops for suppressing the long-standing bandit Ding Xisan and eliminating the chaos, and also sent telegrams of condolence to the Ministry of National Defense to be forwarded to the national Communist Suppression soldiers. The original text is as follows:

(1) Telegram to the Ministry of National Defense, "After the Communists undermined unification, the government clearly ordered the suppression of the rebellion. Relying on our comrades on the front line, loyal and courageous, shedding blood in front of us, trekking through mountains and rivers, suffering from the enemy's weapons, or working hard in the garrison, or winning famous territories, protecting the country and defending the people, the hardships are no less than the War of Resistance. Listening to the drums and thinking of the generals, swearing revenge in rags, at a time when the moth bandits have not been quelled and the suppression of the rebellion is urgent, we especially hope that the valiant men will achieve great achievements and achieve peace together, so as to comfort the hopes. Correspondingly, we represent the 4 million citizens of the city and request the government to forward a telegram to the national Communist Suppression soldiers on behalf of the council to express our condolences, to show loyalty and righteousness, and to express our admiration."

(2) Telegram to the Songhu Garrison Command: "Congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the units participating in the suppression of Ding Bandit Xisan from the Songhu Garrison Command. The Fifth General Assembly of the Council discussed the motion No. 22 of the five-character series of temporary motions, which was to request the General Assembly to resolve to express condolences to the Songhu Garrison Command and the units participating in this campaign for suppressing the long-standing bandits and eliminating the chaos. The ninth meeting resolved to pass this motion and also telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to forward the national Communist Suppression soldiers' condolences, which are recorded in the file. In addition to telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to handle the matter separately, we correspondingly represent the 4 million citizens of the city and telegram to your command with respect and condolences, to show loyalty and righteousness, and to express our admiration, which we hope you will appreciate."

### Pan, Chairman of the Military Service Association, Writes a Letter to the Citizens on Conscription, Emphasizing Both Lottery and Volunteer Soldiers, and Immediately Responding to the Call to Defend the Hometown and Protect Oneself

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Military Service Association is scheduled to hold a regular meeting at its Tanggu Road office at 10:00 AM today to discuss the opening of the lottery for those drafted and the collection of resettlement fees for volunteer soldiers. In addition, Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the association, recently issued the following letter to the citizens regarding this year's conscription:

Dear compatriots: The conscription for this year in this city has completed all the preparatory work and indirect lottery procedures, and will officially begin implementation from April 1st. As the head of the public opinion transfer office and the military service association, I have spared no effort to refer to the actual environment and study the transformation in detail in order to not violate the central government's main purpose and to adapt to the special needs of the local situation in this city. The reasons for this process and the reasons why it must be handled in this way cannot be without the following points, which I respectfully tell to all sectors of the city:

Not Only Fair But Also Reasonable (1) The conscription of 6,000 soldiers this time is based on the principle of regular lottery and assisted by the mobilization of volunteer soldiers. These two are not only complementary but also take advantage of their advantages. Because the regular lottery is the foundation for the country to implement universal national conscription and establish military service. This method is not only fair but also reasonable. This city is the largest city in the country, and it cannot be an exception. It should also vigorously promote it as a model for other places. However, on the other hand, this city is the economic and cultural center of the country. In general, young people with enthusiasm cannot be deprived of the opportunity to volunteer to join the army and ask for orders to serve the country when they see the Communist bandits betraying the country and committing atrocities. Therefore, in order to take this into account, there is the current method of combining lottery and volunteer service.

The Henan People's Regiment is Worth Learning From (2) In order to strengthen the security of this city and give full play to the superior conditions of people and geography in combat, we have, after the group competition and discussion of the post-personnel meeting and the unanimous approval of the Reference Committee, firmly requested the Central Government to train the 6,000 new soldiers on the spot this time and allocate them to the newly created garrison brigade to protect this city, in order to meet the principle of guns not leaving people and people not leaving their hometowns. Everyone must know that suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the bandits is not only for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, but also for preserving our own lives and property and the only way to survive by protecting the hometown and saving ourselves. Today, when the flames of war are everywhere, the citizens of Shanghai are still able to live and work in peace and contentment. This must be attributed to the bloody battles and heroic sacrifices of the soldiers on the front line. But if we cannot even fulfill our responsibility to defend our hometown, then that is a great shame for the people of Shanghai. The whole country knows that the Henan People's Regiment is a strong enemy of the Communist bandits. Based on their personal experience, they shouted the two calm and firm slogans of "seeking life in death" and "destroying property to protect property", and were able to kill bandits and protect their hometown, complete the task, and the Communist bandits were ultimately unable to step into Henan. It is hoped that the aspiring young people of this city can also be like the Henan People's Regiment, enthusiastically joining the army to defend our own hometown!

Collect Real Objects as Resettlement Fees (3) The collection and regulations for the resettlement fees for new recruits this year are not only fair but also thorough compared to last year's methods. In order to practice the principle of "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength, and those who have more money contribute more money," this year's collection of resettlement fees for new recruits is divided into five levels according to the family's poverty and wealth for the draftees who participated in the lottery born in the three years from the 14th to the 16th year of the Republic. This is much fairer than last year's method of not distinguishing between levels. At the same time, in order to prevent the resettlement fees obtained by the new recruits from being affected by the depreciation of currency, we have adopted the collection and distribution of real objects. We believe that this will not only encourage young people with enthusiasm to volunteer more, but also enhance their enthusiasm for joining the army to protect the country and defend their hometown because their families have been settled and their lives are worry-free.

Compatriots: Now the military suppression of the rebellion is reaching the most tense stage, and the crisis of the situation has also reached the final juncture. We must recognize the purpose of suppressing the rebellion, which is to protect the lives and property of the people. If we do not want to sacrifice our own lives and property, then we must rise up in a timely manner and enthusiastically respond to the call to defend our hometown and protect ourselves!

Compatriots! Don't you see? Today, countless refugees are wandering in our streets without clothes or food in the bandit area. Before the Communist bandits arrived, weren't they living and working in peace and contentment like us now? Therefore, in order to avoid such a tragic encounter, we can only rise up, "those who have money contribute money, those who have strength contribute strength," "enthusiastically transport supplies," "compete to serve," suppress the Communist bandits, and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country.

### Food Talk: Reviewing Rice Distribution Work, Generally Worthy of Comfort

[Our Newspaper's Report] City Council Speaker Pan invited Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and more than 20 reporters to a "People's Food Allocation Talk" at the Council Hall on Tanggu Road at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Speaker Pan first made a speech, briefly stating: The distribution and sale of rice in March is about to end. In order to seek improvement from experience, we have invited you to review the initial trial situation.

The Effect is Extremely Obvious

Ren Xianqun then reported on the implementation of the current food allocation according to the number of people, saying: The main tasks of this rice distribution are: (1) To promote a new economic system and obtain a fair and reasonable distribution. (2) As a preliminary work to stabilize the economy, the People's Food Allocation Committee is not a relief agency, and the set price cannot be too far from the market price. In terms of wholesale rice prices, the increase rate has been only 16.8%, and the retail price has increased by 8.3%, which is far from other prices, and the effect is extremely obvious.

Shortcomings Need to be Improved

However, there are also two shortcomings: (1) Initially, due to the lack of rice sources, the quality of rice varied. (2) The convenience given to citizens to buy rice before March 13 was insufficient. Ren said: We will try our best to improve in April, but what is allocated in April is American rice, and there are also three kinds of rice quality. We are currently studying the allocation method to give citizens a choice, or the rice price will be priced and sold separately according to the rice quality, and the rice distribution certificate will be issued at the end of this month.

Future Efforts

Ren also said: The future efforts of the association: (1) How to continue this rice distribution work, (2) Gradually handle the distribution of other daily necessities in order to expand the foundation for stabilizing the economy. After Ren's report, reporters asked questions, and Ren answered them one by one. Speaker Pan also believes that this rice distribution work is generally worthy of comfort. The meeting ended at 12:00.

Last Day of Rice Sales

It is understood that as of the 25th of this month, the People's Food Allocation Committee has distributed a total of 391,392 dan, 3 dou, 9 sheng, and 8 he of rice. A total of 3,913,924 citizens have purchased rice, accounting for about four-fifths of the city's total population. Today is the last day to purchase rice in March, and citizens who want to purchase rice should go to the rice shops to purchase it as soon as possible.

### The Current Situation of the Shandong War

[Our newspaper Jinan 23rd] Before the base area in the Yimeng Mountain area is destroyed, Shandong's importance to the bandit army is second only to the Northeast. The National Army recognizes this and has always focused its main force on the Shandong battlefield. Since the end of the military operation in central Shandong, the main forces of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have broken up into smaller units and moved south one after another, Shandong has had a relatively stable situation. But not long after, the situation in Shandong became turbulent again. Since the 10th of this month, the bandit army has taken advantage of the National Army's forces being scattered throughout the province, and the military leaders in various places are attending the War Conference and Study Session in the provincial capital, a time when no one is in charge locally to launch a new offensive.

This offensive began on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, with the 7th and 9th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops as the main force, using a force of more than 62,000 people. Bandit troops in other regions have also launched harassment attacks to tie down troops. One group even sneaked into Licheng, 25 miles outside Jinan, on the 19th. Fortunately, the National Army hurried back, easing the tense situation somewhat. However, on the night of the 18th, about 20,000 bandit troops from southwestern Shandong, possibly from Liu Bocheng's forces, were discovered crossing the Yellow River from Jinkou and advancing to a place 40 miles away from Dawenkou, with the intention of cutting off the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The military believes that the bandit army will launch a major offensive on the Tianjin-Pukou Line during the National Assembly in an attempt to influence domestic and foreign opinion, and judging from the current situation, Jinan will be the target of the attack. In fact, the provincial capital is enthusiastically carrying out all defense measures. "Defending Great Jinan" is not just a slogan in the local area, but an active action.

To understand the situation in Shandong today, one must have a basic understanding that the bandit army has always maintained the ambition to occupy Shandong. Despite the disastrous defeats in southern and central Shandong, it still maintains considerable troops and supply organizations in Shandong. Before January 1946, most of Shandong Province was in the hands of the bandit army, and Jinan was an isolated city. In January, General Wang Yaowu was ordered to arrive in Jinan, accompanied only by a few staff members. The main force was still on the outskirts of Xuzhou. At that time, the area eight miles away from the provincial capital was a frequent haunt of the bandit army. The staff of the provincial government were equipped with submachine guns at night to prevent accidents. In February of that year, the main force of the National Army entered Shandong and carried out arduous military operations in the Yimeng Mountain area. At that time, the bandit army in Shandong had made long-term preparations, dividing the entire territory into six military regions: Ji, Lu, Yu, Bohai, central Shandong, southern Shandong, Jiaodong, and coastal Shandong. They cooperated and responded very quickly. The troops left behind were the Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng bandit troops, which were known for their elite status. The regular troops were more than ten columns, not including the local militia. The National Army paid a considerable price in the process of winning. The capture of Li Xianzhou and the martyrdom of Zhang Lingfu illustrate that victory cannot be achieved by chance. By September of that year, the National Army had defeated the main force of the bandit army in the battles of Nanma and Linyi. The former seized their warehouse, and the latter defeated the main force of the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th columns, causing Chen Yi's bandit troops to suffer more than 30,000 casualties. In addition, the 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th columns of the bandit troops were also hit by the National Army in the southern Shandong area. The National Army completed its mission of destroying the central Shandong base area, but it is regrettable that it was only a little short of being able to encircle and annihilate the main force of the bandit army, leaving behind the root of the disaster in Shandong today. Senior military personnel frankly stated that these were not command errors, but limitations of terrain and soldier stamina. At that time, Chen Yi's bandit troops, under the relentless pursuit of the National Army, were already abandoning their weapons along the way, changing into civilian clothes, and scattered deserters, unable to talk about having any will to fight. However, the soldiers of the Ou Zhen Corps, who were chasing and suppressing them, also broke their feet in the mountains, and some even died from overwork. Therefore, after this great battle, the bandit army was indeed dispersed and weakened, but it still remained in Shandong.

The next operation launched was the Jiaodong Campaign, which began in September and ended in December. In addition to destroying the bandit's Jiaodong base, the biggest gain was the recovery of Yantai, cutting off the bandit's most important maritime supply line. The southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway also opened to traffic from Jinan from December and has not been damaged to this day. Recalling that when Chen Yi occupied the Yimeng Mountain area, he repeatedly said, "Spend the Mid-Autumn Festival in Xuzhou and the New Year in Nanjing," and thinking back to the serious situation at that time, it is not difficult to measure the contribution of General Wang Yaowu and other officers and soldiers to the country.

After these two major blows, in addition to Liu Bocheng's forces gathering crowds to flee south and disrupt the Central Plains, Chen Yi's bandit forces were still in Shandong. At that time, the 2nd Column in southwestern Shandong and the 4th Column in eastern Shandong still had a force of 120,000 people. In the past few months, they have been working hard to reorganize and replenish their forces. Southwestern Shandong is the most important base area for the bandit army, usually merged with Handan in southern Hebei and other places to become the most important base for the bandit army within the Guan today. In this area, they have established Jianguo University, Military and Political Academy, Ordnance Factory, and Clothing Factory, and it is also a training ground for soldiers. Last winter, they produced 300,000 sets of clothes here. In the past three months, they have trained more than 100,000 new recruits. This base has its own external channel because Xiaogang Yingzikou in northern Shandong is still under the control of the bandit army. Soviet ships often visit this port. The National Army has intercepted letters to and from, proving that this is a supply port for the bandit party. Military materials from the Northeast can be transported through Yingzikou to southern Hebei and western Shandong, and from there to the Central Plains and to the bandit troops north of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the role of southwestern Shandong is a bridge connecting the inside and outside of the Guan and the Central Plains, and its position is very important. The bandit troops left in Shandong have increased to eight columns after several months of reorganization and replenishment, with a total force of more than 210,000 people, not including local armed forces. These are the capital for the Communist bandits to disrupt Shandong today.

At present, the focus of the war is still on the Jiaoji section. In the battle of Zichuan, in addition to the National Army's efforts, the local teams showed the spirit and strength of protecting their homes. Shandong Province has been committed to organizing local armed forces the earliest, and now it has proved to have achieved considerable results. Senior officials in the provincial capital have two views on the battle situation around Jinan: One view is that the bandit army does have the intention of attacking Jinan this time, because their past retreat was only a "centrifugal retreat" in military terms, and the goal has not changed. The bandit army on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway and the bandit army crossing the river in southwestern Shandong have formed a pincer offensive and can attack Jinan at any time. What is especially noteworthy is that the target of the bandit army in southwestern Shandong is Dawenkou, and Dawenkou is the junction of the Second and Tenth Pacification Zones, which is a relatively weak point militarily. The intention of the bandit army is clearly to destroy the railway and threaten the rear of Jinan. The difficulty for the National Army is that it has to maintain a 250-kilometer transportation line from Jinan to the east and a 120-kilometer railway line to the south. Within its jurisdiction, there are many large cities that must be defended, so the troops are constrained and cannot be as fully mobile as the bandit army. The bandit party understands this, so this offensive was launched, hoping to cooperate with the Northeast battlefield. Its ambition for Jinan is indeed not to be ignored. Another group of people believes that Shandong has a tight defense, especially the outer works of Jinan, which cost more than hundreds of billions. With the strength of the bandit army in Shandong, it is not enough to attack Jinan. At the same time, the offensives in the western section of the Jiaoji Railway and southwestern Shandong cannot be coordinated in time. Therefore, the main purpose of the bandit army's attack this time is probably to obstruct the reorganization plan of the Shandong Provincial Government, and the attack on Jinan is just a smokescreen. However, both groups agree on one point: the bandit army has many tricks, and the place to defend is often not where they come to attack, but they prefer to attack places that the National Army does not pay attention to, so no area, including the provincial capital, can relax. Secondly, the bandit army has now put forward the slogan of "expanding the army by a million and collecting ten thousand grains," and its ambition is self-evident. On the day its strength matures, with Shandong's important position, it will inevitably bear the brunt, and only the coordinated efforts of the military and the government can overcome the great disaster to come (Our reporter Ding Weidong)

### Shen Honglie Meets with Reporters to Discuss Zhejiang Province's Bandit Suppression Policy

Next month, plans to inspect the Ning Shao District

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 25th] Chairman Shen met with reporters at 5 pm today to discuss the issue of public security in Zhejiang Province. He said: The bandit situation in this province is still unstable. Compared with other provinces, it is clearly less serious. This time he attended the Central China Pacification Conference, and the result of the meeting was that Zhejiang Province alone did not set up a Pacification Zone, which also shows that the public security problem is not very serious. The reason for this is that this province used effective bandit suppression strategies earlier. In the future, it will adhere to the three-in-one method of suppressing bandits, clearing the countryside, and organizing and training the people, and cooperate with the construction of pillboxes, village telephones, and highway transportation to vigorously promote it. With the cooperation of local gentry, the major Communist bandits can be defeated within half a year, and the scattered bandits can be wiped out within a year. The matter rests with people, and he eagerly hopes to realize his ideals. The re-division of administrative regions, the abolition of the Pacification Office, and the increase of the commissioner's powers are all aimed at strengthening public security forces to benefit the suppression of the rebellion and the construction of the country. In order to urge the pacification work, he will again inspect the province early next month. His initial target is the Ning Shao District where Siming Mountain is located.

### Jinshan and Songjiang Counties Initiate the Establishment of a Fisheries Cooperative

### Xia Shikui, the Main Perpetrator of the Panjiaqiao Homicide in Jiading, Flees in Fear of Punishment

[Our Newspaper Jiading, 25th] A tragic murder case occurred in Panjiaqiao, Caowang Township, in the county on November 18 last year. The deceased, Zhao Heming, was the manager of the Meihua Clothing Company at 520 Lin Sen Road, Shanghai. After the incident, the county's criminal police team, together with the 6th Inspection Brigade of the Shanghai Garrison Command, arrested a murderer named Xu Liangtu and transferred him to the local District Procuratorate. On January 29, the procuratorate filed a public prosecution. As for the main perpetrator Xia Shikui, the former Chief Procurator Mao Xiqing issued a non-prosecution ruling. The murderers Li Zhiwen, Ma Zhixiang (also known as Ma Qiang), Wu, etc. are still at large. Recently, the case was transferred by the Shanghai District Procuratorate to the local District Procuratorate, where the deceased Zhao Heming's mother, Zhao Shi, accused Xia Shikui of instigating murder and Ma Zhixiang and others of committing the murder. In order to understand the development of the case, the reporter specially visited Chief Procurator Zhang Shijie yesterday, who said: Regarding the part of Xu Liangtu, the trial has been held twice, and there are already clues. The daughter of Xia Shikui's great wife also testified in court, stating that on the day of the incident, Xu Liangtu borrowed a car from her father in the morning and returned it after 5 pm that afternoon. This alone can prove the seriousness of Xia Shikui's criminal suspicion. Chief Procurator Zhang also told the reporter that the main perpetrators Xia Shikui and Yuan Ayin (Xia's wife) have fled in fear of punishment. If anyone knows their whereabouts, they can write to the procuratorate so that they can be arrested and brought to justice as soon as possible.

### Recording the Engineering Survey of the Duzhu Section of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway, a Major Artery in the Southwest (Part 2)

After September last year, due to the difficulty in obtaining dynamite, TNT and domestic yellow explosives were used as substitutes. However, the poisonous gas was too strong, and it was difficult to dissipate in the long pilot tunnel, resulting in many workers being poisoned. There was an incident where sixteen people fainted within half an hour, and it was not used continuously. It was not until the dynamite arrived in December that it returned to normal. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the tunnel was opened and joined at the same time on February 29 this year at 8 am, and the center line, height, and deviation of the tunnel at the joint were only a few centimeters because they had been carefully measured and calibrated in advance, which showed the accuracy of the measurement and construction.

Several days before the closure, the director of the Tunnel Engineering Office, Mr. Lu, and the two engineers, Mr. Shen Zhangnan, and all the workers were in a state of extreme tension. Inside and outside the cave, day and night were indistinguishable, the lights were brilliant, and there was a red light everywhere. It is said that most people were so engrossed in their work that they forgot to eat, and they were so exhausted that they did not know what fatigue was. When the two sections were closed, engineers Shen and Zhang celebrated the successful completion of this great project and happily passed one of the most difficult parts. They especially stretched out their right hands and shook them enthusiastically at a place about the size of a human face at the closed place, and then kissed passionately for five minutes. The degree of their joy cannot be described in words. Director Yuan of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Engineering Bureau issued a congratulatory telegram and ordered awards to all the contributing staff, praising it as the greatest event in China's railway construction since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

The tunnel project is huge and the pilot tunnel is too long, so 28 manholes and 3 car holes are built on both sides of the tunnel to allow pedestrians and vehicles to enter and hide when the train enters and exits. In order to facilitate the construction of the pilot tunnel opening project and to eliminate coal smoke when the train runs in the future, two straight guide wells are specially designed at the east and west ends of the tunnel. The east end is 230 meters away from the hole and is 40 meters deep. The west end is 200 meters away from the hole and is 17 meters deep. They were opened on June 11 last year. The east straight guide well is supported entirely by wooden bars because of its hard stone. The west straight guide well is lined with stone for safety because of the gushing spring water. It is not only strong but also spectacular. When our group visited this fourth largest team tunnel in the country, it took 26 minutes to walk through the cave, and there were no abnormalities. Everyone respectfully admired the engineers and workers who participated in the construction of this arduous project for their arduous and remarkable spirit. The pilot tunnel project and the straight guide well project can be carried out smoothly and successfully, in addition to relying on the great workers, but also from the Yunnan-Burma Road came two American No. 2 mountain openers, each with a ventilation machine storing 100 pounds of empty gas, starting the mountain opener and drilling into the hard, iron-like mountain stone, the two machines started at the same time, and can reach 12 meters per day, so the progress is rapid. According to Lu, the director of the Tunnel Engineering Office, the tunnel project has used 12 tons of yellow explosives and 4.7 billion yuan in expenses, and 240 working days for labor so far. One-half of the entire tunnel project has been completed. In the future, it will still be necessary to work hard to expand and bottom out the work and take the necessary measures. According to the current prices and labor costs, at least 50 billion yuan should be estimated before the entire project can be completed. That night, we enjoyed a rich night banquet in the Shaping Station, which was built on the side of the Great Tunnel of Gu Mengguan, a great building of ghost maps and divine work on the top of Yuntong Mountain, and then we carefully tasted Yun for fragrant tea with the engineers and listened to the various moving stories of the construction. This group of hardworking people who overcame the natural environment with their omnipotent hands was not only admired and respected, but also felt supremely honored.

At 8:00 a.m. on the 12th, the reporter group had breakfast at Shaping Station and then visited the

Shaping Bridge. The bridge is 100 meters long, with six piers and four holes. The bridge is 30 meters high, and the diameter of the air is 20 meters. The Guizhou-Guangxi Highway runs through the bridge. At present, 40% of each pier has been completed, but the required stone is far away from the mountain factory and takes a lot of work and time, which makes people feel strenuous. Then enter the material transportation path and arrive at the Diaowei Tunnel, which is 5 kilometers away from the Shaping Bridge. The area is surrounded by mountains and is desolate. Before construction, people rarely visited, and the ground was covered with thorns. After the engineering personnel arrived, the most difficult problem was the accommodation problem, and the food and drink needed had to be purchased by walking to a place more than 20 miles away. The tunnel pilot tunnel is 295 meters long, and the Dian work period is one year and two months. It has now been fully opened. Due to the lack of explosives, the expansion and bottoming work has been greatly affected. Although most of the eyes have been opened, it is still impossible to continue to proceed.

### Tragedy at Bengbu Station: Refugees Crushed Falling from Train Roof, Nine Dead and Eight Injured

[Our Bengbu Bureau, 24th] In recent days, Bengbu has seen a frequent influx of refugees. Every train on the Jinpu Railway is packed with refugees with gaunt faces and disheveled hair. There are also many small-time peddlers trying to make a living. The railway authorities find it difficult to control the situation. As a result, a tragedy occurred at Bengbu Station. Around 7:00 PM on the 23rd, as the 74th northbound mixed train on the Jinpu Railway was departing from the station, refugees crowded on the platform, preparing to board the train to the north. They rushed to climb onto the roof of the train as the wheels started to move, vying for space and creating chaos. Railway police tried to warn them of the danger and attempted to drive them away, but the refugees paid no heed and continued to scramble aboard. When the train passed under the overpass at the fourth track, the crowd on the roof was so dense that more than twenty men and women were struck by the bridge and fell. Their screams echoed, and blood was splattered everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Nine people, including Sun Baojun from Pixian County (including two women), were killed or crushed. Eight people, including Wang Guixiu from Kaifeng, were injured. That evening, the station sent people to take the injured to the railway hospital for treatment. The dead were wrapped in reed mats and taken to an open space to await inspection. Today (the 24th) at 2:00 PM, the District Procuratorate sent prosecutor Li Guozhen to the scene to inspect the bodies. After the inspection, the military station prepared coffins and buried the deceased.

### "West Shandong Corridor" Completely Recovered: People's Lives are Bitter but Admirable and Lovable

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th] The so-called "West Shandong Corridor," established by the Communists for many years, has now been completely occupied by the National Army. This corridor originally included the counties bordering Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan north of the old Yellow River flooded area and south of the intersection of the Yellow River and the Grand Canal. Due to the repeated impact of war, the civilian population has suffered particularly heavy losses. Yongcheng in eastern Henan and Shanxian in western Shandong have been reduced to rubble, with no houses left standing. In the past year, the Communists regarded this corridor as a base for disrupting the Central Plains. Factories for military supplies, uniforms, and shipbuilding, as well as institutions for conscription, training, and replenishment, were all located here. They often hid more than two columns of troops within it. This time, the National Army launched a full-scale campaign of suppression, not only destroying all the Communist military equipment but also driving out the remaining Communists. Currently, the scattered bandits hiding in this corridor area are only two broken regiments of the Liangguang Column, responsible for river crossing operations, and the local bandits led by Li Xuhua, Shi Xiaozhao, Zhang Taisheng, and Zhu Shiyue. In addition to controlling the crossing points on the right bank of the Yellow River to prevent the Communists from returning, the National Army is also conducting extensive rural pacification operations to protect farmers during spring plowing. According to the collective opinions expressed at a symposium held by Dangshan Party and government cadres who survived the fighting and the Jinghu journalist delegation, the government should seize the current opportunity to completely eliminate the local bandits in the corridor area. The Communists' policies of seeking food, clothing, and soldiers all rely on the local bandits as vanguards and scouts. Eliminating the local bandits would eradicate the future threat of a Communist comeback. Although the people in the corridor area are now scarred and even eat wild vegetables and tree bark to survive, their hatred for the Communists and their determination to fight against them remains unwavering. After inspecting a corner of this corridor area, the Jinghu journalists deeply felt that the people are indeed suffering greatly, but they are not pitiful but admirable and lovable.

### Legislative Yuan Routine Meeting Discusses the Organization of Special Criminal Courts, Leading to Heated Debate

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 25th] At the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the 25th, heated debate arose during the discussion of the draft regulations on the organization and trial procedures of special criminal courts for suppressing bandits. Sun Jiulu, Liu Butong, Tan Tiwu, Liu Tong, Chen Ruxuan, Liu Zhiping, and others continued to express their opposition, arguing that such special legislation not only violates the principle of protecting human rights but also destroys the integrity and independent dignity of the judicial system, and does nothing to solve practical problems. Liu Kejun, Sun Ke, Lin Bin, Zhang Banghan, Chen Haicheng, Liu Zixun, and others argued that special criminal courts are a practical necessity. As long as the legislation is carefully crafted regarding their organization and trial procedures, the protection of human rights will not be affected, and it should be passed.

Sun Ke emphatically stated that we are currently in a period of turmoil and cannot view today's measures from a peacetime perspective. The Communists do not love the country, and there is no room for leniency or forgiveness. To endanger national security in the name of democracy is unacceptable. Ultimately, it was decided that the revised regulations on the organization and trial procedures of special criminal courts had taken into account the integrity of the judicial system and the seriousness of the trials, and were therefore amended and passed. After the Presidential Palace Organization Law was discussed and passed, Liu Kejun began to report on the three reviews of the case by the Legislative Committee, listening to reports from representatives of the Judicial Administration Department and the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and the process of the amendments made. He briefly stated that in terms of organization, it was changed to a two-level system. In addition to establishing a number of higher special criminal courts in various places as needed, a central special criminal court would be established in the capital, with the higher special criminal courts under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Administration Department and the central special criminal court under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan, parallel to the ordinary high court and the Supreme Court, respectively. As for the trial procedures, the proposed system of one-trial finality should be changed. In addition to allowing those sentenced to more than five years in prison to apply for review, it was also stipulated that prosecutors could apply for a retrial within a certain period of time if new evidence was discovered. Procedures not covered by the regulations could follow the special criminal case litigation regulations. After Liu's report,

Sun Jiulu took the lead and loudly called for the integrity of the judicial system and the independence of the judicial spirit, stating that he fundamentally opposed the establishment of special criminal courts. He said that ordinary courts could expedite the handling of Communist cases and impose heavier sentences without the need to establish separate special agencies. He urged the attendees to pay attention to the Shanghai Bar Association's opposition to the case and the criticism from domestic and foreign public opinion, and argued that the preliminary establishment of the Shanghai special criminal court had the suspicion of coercing legislation.

Liu Butong continued by pointing out that the dance hall disturbance case, the National Bank sit-in case, and the student unrest case in Shanghai were all ordinary events, but the security authorities wanted to hand them over to the special criminal court for jurisdiction, which would only create chaos. He argued that this trend had the suspicion of following in the footsteps of fascism.

Tan Tiwu criticized the measure as a backward step, taken at a time of constitutional government and disregarding the people's freedom.

Liu Tong also opposed the reappearance of special institutions in the judicial system. At this point, Liu Kejun explained again that the judicial system was extremely busy with general court cases, and that the organization and trial procedures of the special criminal court could be amended to protect human rights.

Liu Butong, Tan Tiwu, and Liu Zhiping emphasized that improving the efficiency of general courts was essential, and that setting up special criminal courts was unacceptable. They pointed out that even cases of heinous treason had not been handled by specially established courts.

Chen Ruxuan sharply pointed out that the name "special criminal court" violated the legal principle of the universality of justice, and that the parliament of a democratic country had never passed special laws. Only the parliament of an autocratic and dictatorial country would make such a decision that disregards human rights.

Chen Haicheng evaded the question of whether special criminal courts should be established and argued that special criminal procedures must be applied to Communist cases.

Sun Ke believed that there was a need to establish special criminal courts. His reasons were that the revised organizational regulations did not allow the establishment of special criminal courts to undermine judicial integrity; and that special laws were necessary due to practical needs, such as prohibiting speculation and smuggling. He also pointed out that the United States had special courts such as divorce courts and juvenile courts. Sun also said that the handling of treason cases by ordinary courts was after the victory, when the threat of traitors had been eliminated. The current target of special criminal courts is the Communists, and the Communist forces are currently rampant and cannot be ignored. We cannot be lenient towards those who endanger the country and the government.

Lin Bin pointed out the urgent need for special criminal courts in areas close to the war zone, where ordinary courts are often unable to handle the cases. If the military authorities were to take full control, it might be too strict and would not protect human rights. He advocated for more research on the organizational and trial techniques of special criminal courts and for careful legislation.

At this point, Liu Zhiping and Liu Butong again rose to deny any intention of being lenient towards the Communists and continued to oppose the separate establishment of special criminal courts, which would undermine the judiciary and disturb the people. Chen Ruxuan pointed out that juvenile courts were established because of the special mental and physical condition of children and were not comparable to special criminal courts, and resolutely opposed special legislation. However, due to the length of the debate, several committee members believed that the revised organizational and trial procedures had taken into account judicial integrity and the protection of human rights, and therefore proceeded with the discussion of the articles.

### Soochow Law School Establishes International Law Group This Semester

[Shenzhou News Agency] Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, Dean of the Soochow University Law School in this city, was commissioned by the Legislative Yuan last year to travel abroad for research. He has returned to China this spring to resume his duties in the Law School and, based on his research experience, is determined to make improvements starting this semester. Dean Sheng told reporters yesterday that in the past ten years, European and American countries have recognized law as a very important vocational education, so they have established law schools independently, without attaching "Political Science" or "Economics" departments. In general, the content of the courses, administrative law and tax law, has been changed from elective to required courses. In addition to the judicial field, special attention is paid to the cultivation of first-class international political leaders. The United States has now raised the pre-requisite system. Anyone entering law school must first complete two years of university courses. It is estimated that the entire study period will take about five years or more. Soochow Law School will establish a new International Law Group this semester and hire senior figures in the judicial field, such as Guo Yun'guan, president of the Higher Law School, Cha Liangjian, president of the District Court, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang, Director Yu Shuping, and Section Chief Sun Kui, to teach. Sheng has also collected more than a thousand copies of the latest versions of legal codes from sixteen countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Switzerland, of which more than 700 volumes have already arrived and will be used to enrich library equipment. In addition, he is also in contact with five universities in the United States, including the University of Virginia, the University of Michigan, Northwestern University, the University of Southern California, and the University of Washington, to hire visiting professors from these universities to teach in China. Starting next semester, Soochow Law School will generally raise its standards and reduce the number of new students admitted.

The conference is scheduled to continue for one day starting at 9:00 AM this morning and will discuss in-kind lending and priority receipt of commodities. If the meeting time is insufficient, it will be extended by one day if necessary.

### Sugar Prices Fall Again and Again

The sugar market remained sluggish yesterday, continuing to decline. The guild quoted spot prices at 245,000 yuan for coarse white sugar and 250,000 yuan for fine white sugar, and 205,000 yuan for medium granulated white sugar, already entering the 400,000 range. Stack order transactions initially amounted to over 100,000 yuan, but slightly improved in the afternoon. Due to hindered sales to the north, the domestic sugar market was sluggish, and Shantou refined sugar was even weaker, with prices at 2.75 million to 2 million yuan, and small sales at 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Diaoging was only 2.5 million yuan, 200,000 yuan less than Wednesday. Hainan red sugar was the cheapest, opening at 2.05 million yuan, down another 50,000 yuan. It is reported that at this time, rock candy is sold together with special cotton white sugar, but the sale of rock candy is very limited, making it difficult to sell, so some sellers in the market yesterday were reselling it at a discount of more than 10%, which can be described as extremely weak.

### Rice Market: Both Arrivals and Sales are Scarce, Coarse Grains are Flat and Weak, Oil Market Turns Upward

Yesterday, the rice market was firm in the south and weak in the north, but the fluctuations were not significant. The People's Food Distribution Association sold Japonica rice at 3.4 million yuan in the South City Market, selling 510 stones, but in the North City Market, it was sold at a price reduced by 50,000 yuan (3.35 million), and it was less accepted. At the opening of the South City Market in the morning, the price was raised by about 100,000 yuan because the price had fallen too much the previous day, and the owners were unwilling to sell at a lower price. Moreover, the arrival of goods was still scarce. The owners tried to reverse the downward trend, but although the price was reluctantly raised, the sales route was still ordinary. Moreover, affected by the sale of rice by the People's Food Distribution Association, the sales route became narrower, and the market returned to weakness later. White Japonica was 3.55 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan, but the market was even weaker at the close, and there was essentially no difference from the previous day. In the North City Market, white Japonica and early rice each fell by 50,000 yuan due to sluggish sales routes. Yesterday, a total of 6,318 stones arrived and were sold in the north and south markets.

The flour market was initially firm but then weakened. The morning opening price had already reflected much of the decline, and the owners tried their best to raise the price, but with sluggish actual sales, the northern merchants did not accept it, and retail investors had limited appetite, so there was a lack of power to rise. The market declined later, and grinding was reduced. Old cars were ground flat, warships were 5,000 lower, and Red Bee and Jiancheng were 20,000 lower. Lilang foreign flour was delivered at 2.1 million yuan for 70 pounds. Bran fell by another 25,000 yuan, and the factory quoted a low of 2.1 million yuan for wheat.

Coarse grains saw a slight recovery, as they had fallen so much that they were below cost, and the owners could not bear to sell at a low price, so they tried to support the price. Oil factories absorbed more soybeans at low prices, and prices rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Corn was also tightly controlled upon leaving the market, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Green beans were slightly sold in this street, rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Sesame supply turned quiet, and the market turned firm and stable. Raw peanuts were slightly displayed, adding about 100,000 yuan. Only selected green and red beans fell by 100,000 yuan.

Edible oil prices rose as raw materials such as soybeans rose slightly, and the owners also shouted higher prices. People's hearts had changed from weak to strong. Many people waited and watched for many days, and some took the opportunity to add to their holdings, so the market was still strong. Dachang and Xin and other factories opened soybean oil at 7.4 million yuan, and re-turned goods were from 7.3 to 7.35 million yuan, each rising by about 200,000 yuan. Raw oil was traded with an increase of 200,000 yuan, and then another 50,000 yuan was added. Qingdao Ji barrels of raw oil were 8.95 million yuan. Raw rapeseed oil, Dade Xin, first opened at 7.15 million, and then opened at 7.2 million with a large surplus, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Small car vegetable oil rose by 150,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 120,000 yuan.

### Communications Bank Formulates Loan Plan to Assist in Coal Production Increase

Coal is the source of power for industrial production. At present, coal mines in Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China are either at a standstill in production or are hindered by transportation, resulting in a shortage of coal supply, which has a significant impact. In view of this, the Bank of Communications has formulated a loan plan to assist in increasing production and has drafted a loan plan for assisting coal production increase in the 37th year. The main points are as follows:

(1) Loan targets: Major coal mines in the three regions of Central China, South China, and Taiwan will be given loans separately. State-owned coal mines include Jiangxi, Xiangjiang, Xiangshui, Yongshao, Nanling, and Taiwan coal mine companies, and their eight mines. Private coal mines are East China, Huainan, Zhongxing, Jiangnan, and Hunan mines.

(2) Loan methods are divided into working capital loans and equipment increase loans. All mine production is handled by the competent authority for unified distribution and sale.

(3) Loan amount: The estimated amount is 2757 billion yuan in national currency and 1.6 million US dollars.

(4) Loan effectiveness: The annual coal production of various mines in Central China last year was about 2.8 million tons. Production can begin to increase after the loan in July, and it can increase to more than 5 million tons by the end of this year. The supply of coal in the region will be barely self-sufficient. The annual coal production of the Nanling mine in South China last year was more than 20,000 tons, and the target for this year is to increase to 54,000 tons. The annual coal production of various mines in Taiwan was about 1.2 million tons last year, and production can be increased by 500,000 tons this year. The above will supply Central and South China.

(5) Smaller coal mines will be approved for loans individually at any time depending on the actual increase in production in the future.

### Buying Houses Take Advantage of Low Prices, Cotton Yarn Market Turns Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw few new buyers active due to the approaching holiday, and procurement by customer groups was also sparse. Only arbitrage trading by exchange members remained active, keeping the market stable. The price of 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn initially jumped to 7,000,000, reaching 177,000,000 yuan. It briefly dipped to 3,000,000 yuan mid-session, but towards the close, strong players took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price back up to 190,000,000 yuan at closing, a significant increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 109,000,000 yuan, and subsequently, as the financial situation of colleagues eased slightly, various groups also bought whenever they saw selling, causing the asking price to climb, ending at a high of 128,000,000 yuan, also a rise of 18,000,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count yarns of various grades rose by more than 10%, while 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 2,000,000 to 5,000,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with small amounts of replenishment from Shanxi groups, and customer channels in Xuzhou and Bengbu also absorbed supply, leading to strong buying interest. Simultaneously, shops also entered the market to buy. "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose directly from 3,950,000 yuan, breaking the 4,000,000 yuan mark again, with transactions reaching as high as 4,001,000 yuan. However, around 10:30 AM, cloth merchants began selling off, and shops also cut losses, causing transactions to become scattered, and the price retreated slightly to 3,980,000 yuan at closing. This was a rise of 10,000 yuan from the previous day, but a drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the off-exchange price of the day before yesterday. The final transaction price was at 3,950,000 yuan. The performance of other grades of fine cloth was mixed. In addition, serge, thick tribute cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth softened by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, while the market for Shilin cloth and blue cloth remained stable.

It is also reported that purchase orders for "Dragon Head B" fine cloth supplied by the Fangjian Company were sold with a discount of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan, but towards the end, the price had to be increased by 10,000 yuan, hovering around 3,660,000 yuan.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday (the 26th), Fangjian Company opened for sale cotton yarn as usual, totaling eleven types. There were 233 applications, totaling 575 pieces, equivalent to 908.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. The opening prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count "Fairy Maiden" 107,000,000 yuan, 6-count "Deputy Sunlight" 55,000,000 yuan, 8-count "Sunlight" 57,000,000 yuan, 10-count "Lima" 59,000,000 yuan, 32-count double-strand "Fairy Peach" second-grade 143,000,000 yuan, 32-count double-strand "Harvest Year" 163,000,000 yuan, 40-count "Sunlight" 148,000,000 yuan, 40-count "TK Colored Ball" 183,000,000 yuan, 42-count double-strand "Colored Ball" 174,000,000 yuan, 60-count "Sunlight" 212,000,000 yuan, 60-count double-strand "Sunlight" (singed) 320,000,000 yuan.

### Ten Major Manufacturers in This City Jointly Establish an Export Organization

Ten manufacturers in this city, including Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Hongda Yarn Tube Factory, Yongxin Raincoat Factory, Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, Dazhong Industrial Cooperative, Meilin Canned Food Factory, Standard MSG Factory, and Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, jointly organized an export promotion office on the 14th of this month at Room 75, No. 110 Sichuan Middle Road. Yao Junyuan and Xu Yu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and Wu Shuchen, Gu Shiqi, and Nuo Jun were elected as executive directors, with Qian Chengxu as manager. The office began operations immediately. In addition to handling the export affairs and procedures of the ten factories, the office will also seek to establish contact with major international import and export merchants and financial institutions to facilitate cooperation. It is reported that the office has already begun its overseas promotion work, and some results may be achieved in the short term. In addition, it also intends to suggest to the government the adoption of government procurement principles and the encouragement of private capital investment in industrial production. After the products are completed, the investors will be responsible for exporting them. If exports are unfavorable, the government will purchase them to prevent production from being interrupted.

### Tea Market Fluctuations

The buying interest in both domestic and export tea remains strong from all parties, but the market inventory is still as scarce as morning stars, so holders regard it as extremely rare and are bent on hoarding. Prices have risen repeatedly. However, for certain varieties, amidst the general tightness of funds, those who are short of funds are rushing to sell, resulting in a situation that is somewhat ambivalent. In the end, the market remained at its original level. As for the pre-Qingming new Longjing tea of this year, which has always been valued by this street, since the first batch arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, a few days ago, it has been in short supply due to the small amount of goods arriving, leading to a situation of "more monks than porridge." It is now understood that tea shops such as Tongtai Xiang are planning to send personnel to the production areas to purchase tea to meet the actual needs.

### Industrial Oils and Fats are Remarkably Popular

Among industrial oils and fats, coconut oil has seen a very strong price surge in its origin area, Hainan Island, reaching as high as 15,000,000 yuan per dan. There is not much stock in Hong Kong, and major players who have it are hoarding it and not selling, so transactions are extremely rare. Soap factories are using fresh lard instead due to the high price, so the market for lard is also high. Tallow is also an important raw material for soap factories. Chemical industrial merchants are buying it to make toothpaste, etc. Local oil has risen to 14,500,000 yuan per sima dan, while Tianjin oil is at 14,000,000 yuan, but the cost of transporting it from the production area to Shanghai would be 19,000,000 yuan. Recently, due to tight credit conditions, the price is actually lower than in the production area.

Asphalt is also one of the raw materials for soap and candles. As other oils and fats rise, its market is also rising. Heben oil has been pushed up to 11,000,000 yuan per market dan. Other oils such as Caixuejian and sesame oil have also risen to 10,350,000 yuan, a rise of more than 10%.

### Shanghai Stock Exchange Held Its Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The first shareholders' meeting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange was held at 4 PM yesterday in the meeting room of the exchange. The meeting was presided over by Du Yong, Chairman of the Exchange. General Manager Wang Zhixin reported on the general business and financial situation of the past year, as well as various measures taken, and proposed to focus on the following in the future: (1) Increasing the listing of good securities, (2) Considering market needs and changing trading methods, and (3) Constantly encouraging good brokers to improve their social status. Subsequently, Supervisor Gu Kemin reported on the final accounts for the 35th and 36th fiscal years, and the profit distribution plan was approved. Finally, the supervisors were re-elected, with Zhao Hua, Sun Rui, Gu Kemin, Peng Xingsheng, Wang Benzi, Hu Huichun, and Zhang Bingsan being elected.

According to the Exchange's published annual report for the 36th year, as of the end of last year, there were a total of 210 brokers in the Exchange, including 160 individual brokers and 50 corporate brokers, trading 32 types of listed company stocks. From the opening of the Exchange on September 16 of the 35th year to the end of last year, the number of shares traded, excluding inter-broker transfer transactions, was 85.6 billion shares. Among them, 45.5 billion shares were traded for spot, and 40.1 billion shares were traded for forward delivery. The transaction amount, excluding internal transfers of 7,753.3 billion yuan, was a total of 34,499 billion yuan, of which 12,875.7 billion yuan was for spot and 21,623.3 billion yuan was for forward delivery. The actual settlement amount was 4,667 billion yuan for spot and 3,236.5 billion yuan for forward delivery, totaling 7,903.5 billion yuan.

Literature and History

### Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's Policy of Stabilizing the Throne and Its Relationship with Yao Chong

— Wang Jian

One of the Micro-Studies of the Political History of the Xuanzong Dynasty

In this short article, only one point is discussed, the main purpose of which is to clarify that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang adopted Yao Chong's policies, stabilized his throne, and thus laid the foundation for the Kaiyuan Era.

(I)

To understand Xuanzong's urgent need for the stabilization of his throne in the early years, it is necessary to first know that there was a phenomenon of frequent political changes at that time. Let's take a look:

In the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era (705 AD), Zhang Jianzhi and others overthrew the rule of Wu Zetian and supported Emperor Zhongzong's restoration.

In the seventh month of the first year of the Jinglong era (707 AD), Crown Prince Chongjun plotted to kill Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, but failed because he could not enter the Xuanwu Gate.

In the sixth month of the first year of the Jingyun era (710 AD), Emperor Zhongzong was poisoned to death by Empress Wei. Empress Wei decided to make Prince Wen, Chongmao, the crown prince and became the Empress Dowager ruling from behind the scenes.

In the same month of the same year, Xuanzong quelled the rebellion of Empress Wei and supported Emperor Ruizong's enthronement.

At the end of the seventh month of the same year, Prince Chongfu of Qiao plotted a rebellion in the Eastern Capital. In the eighth month, he was pacified by Cui Rizhi, the magistrate of Luoyang.

In the seventh month of the first year of the Xiantian era (712 AD), Emperor Ruizong abdicated in favor of Xuanzong.

In the seventh month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era (713 AD), Princess Taiping secretly plotted a rebellion and was executed by Xuanzong. Emperor Ruizong retired to the Baifu Hall.

From the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era to the seventh month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era, it was only eight and a half years. In this short period, the emperor was replaced four times, and political changes occurred seven times. What a dangerous atmosphere! In such a turbulent political situation, how severe must Xuanzong have felt the pressure!

Why did the political situation at that time have such an undesirable phenomenon? The answer we might get is: "This was caused by Wu Zetian's political revolution."

First, the succession to the throne has always been a major issue in Chinese political history. The system of succession by the eldest son of the嫡 (di, principal wife), established by ancient sages and worthies, could not completely eliminate the desires of ambitious individuals in the royal family. The struggle between Emperor Taizong and Crown Prince Jiancheng during the Wude years of the Tang Dynasty, and the struggle between Prince Wei Tai and Crown Prince Chengqian during the Zhenguan years, were sufficient to show the seriousness of the issue of succession to the throne. Moreover, Wu Zetian's ascension to the throne as a woman further complicated the issue. Establishing a son or establishing a nephew seemed reasonable, so princes and relatives all participated in the power grab. Subsequently, Empress Wei, Princess Taiping, and Princess Anle also entered the whirlpool of disputes, the reason for which was also the realization that women could also hold political power.

Second, in order to eliminate obstacles to establishing a lasting dynasty, Wu Zetian had to overthrow the old ruling group. In order to meet the needs of governing the world and winning people's hearts, she had to adopt a new electoral system. Through her two methods of opening imperial examinations to select scholars and appointing people beyond conventional practices, Confucian scholars from old families and impoverished scholars were able to rise to the court through their literary talent. Unscrupulous monks and ruffians from the marketplace could also seek official positions through unorthodox channels. In this way, the number of people seeking official careers increased, and the factions in the court became increasingly prevalent. Thus, we can conclude: "Wu Zetian's political revolution affected the fluctuations of social classes at that time, and this change in social class created political instability in a short period after Wu Zetian."

Unstable courtiers had to attach themselves to an empress, prince, relative, or princess as their future backing. Ambitious empresses, princes, relatives, or princesses also had to gather a majority of courtiers as tools for political struggle. In this way, the union of factions had the secret seizure of the throne as its goal. As a result, the atmosphere of usurpation emerged from time to time. Wu Zetian initially started this frenzy, but in the end, her imperial power was inevitably swallowed up by this trend. At this time, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's regime was actually generated in accordance with this trend, so of course, he had to pay attention to how to curb the resurgence of this wave.

(II)

In the first month of the second year of the Jingyun era (711 AD), when Xuanzong was still a prince, Yao Chong (then Zhongshu Ling, or Chancellor) and Song Jing (then Libu Shangshu Tong Jiacheng Shumen Xia Sanpin, or Minister of Personnel with the title of Deputy Chancellor) jointly proposed a policy to stabilize the crown prince, with the content divided into three articles.

First, send Prince Song and Prince Bin out to serve as governors.

Second, dismiss the left and right Yulin armies of Prince Qi and Prince Xue, and make them left and right officials to serve the crown prince.

Third, settle Princess Taiping in the Eastern Capital.

Originally, Prince Song, Chengqi, was the eldest son of Emperor Ruizong, and Prince Bin, Shouli, was the eldest grandson of Emperor Gaozong. Although they themselves might not have had any ambition to covet the throne, their unique status in the royal family could easily be used by conspirators as an excuse to launch political struggles. Therefore, according to Yao Chong and Song Jing's suggestion, these two princes had to be sent out as governors.

The key to the success or failure of the power struggles in the Tang Dynasty often depended on the allegiance of the Northern Gate Imperial Guards. Therefore, Yao and Song believed that Emperor Ruizong's policy of having his sons, Prince Qi Longfan and Prince Xue Longmeng, jointly command the Yulin Imperial Guards had to be changed at this time.

Princess Taiping was Wu Zetian's beloved daughter, and Emperor Ruizong's only surviving full-blooded sister. During the reign of Emperor Zhongzong, she had already been building a public party extensively. Since participating in the quelling of Empress Wei's rebellion, her power had become even more prominent. She inherited her mother's legacy, and her conspiracies and ambitions were very terrifying. Her repeated attempts to shake the Eastern Palace were an open secret, but her underlying intentions were probably far greater than this. Therefore, in the eyes of Yao and Song, only by letting her leave the capital could the safety of the crown prince be somewhat guaranteed.

Emperor Ruizong largely accepted these three suggestions and tried to implement them. However, except for the second one, which could be done smoothly, the other two actually encountered obstacles. The orders for Prince Song and Prince Bin to serve as governors were revoked after a few days, and Princess Taiping's trip to Puzhou ended in May. As a result, Yao Chong and Song Jing were accused of alienating flesh and blood and were demoted to governors of Jiaozhou and Chuzhou, respectively, on the day of Jiaxu in the second month.

On the surface, the frequent political changes since the Shenlong era ended with Xuanzong's campaign to eliminate Princess Taiping as a turning point. But in reality, the consolidation of Xuanzong's imperial power after this was probably due to several important measures he took in the early years of the Kaiyuan era. These measures seemed to have Yao Chong as their chief strategist.

After Princess Taiping was eliminated, in the tenth month of the first year of the Kaiyuan era, Xuanzong secretly summoned Yao Chong to the Wei River. At that time, he appointed him as Minister of the Army with the title of Deputy Chancellor until the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era when he was dismissed from his position as chancellor. During these three years, two points are worth noting.

First: The first plan proposed by Yao Chong during the reign of Emperor Ruizong was realized at this time. The Old Book of Tang, Book Eight, Xuanzong Ji:

(In the sixth month of the second year of Kaiyuan) On Dingji day, Prince Song Chengqi, who was opening the mansion with the same authority as the Three Dukes, was made the governor of Qizhou, Prince Shen Chengyi, who was the Situ, was made the governor of Junzhou, and Prince Bin Shouli, who was the Sikong, was made the governor of Guozhou, entrusting the affairs to the upper aides. (Omitted) (On Yimao day in the seventh month), Prince Qi Fan, the Taichangqing, was made the governor of Hua (Jiang?) Zhou, and Prince Xue Ye, the Secretary of the Palace Library, was made the governor of Tongzhou. (According to the Tongjian 211, it also ordered Prince Song and others to enter the court every quarter in pairs, alternating continuously.)

Prince Shen Chengyi was Xuanzong's second elder brother, and Prince Qi Fan and Prince Xue Ye had participated in the campaign to eliminate Princess Taiping. These three, either because of their geographical proximity or their great prestige, were regarded as the same as Prince Song and Prince Bin. Since Prince Song, Prince Bin, Prince Qi, and Prince Xue could not stay in the capital for a long time, it was naturally difficult for a political revolution to rise again in the central government. In addition, Xuanzong allowed them to "entrust the affairs to the upper aides," in other words, he did not give them the real power of governors, so there was no need to worry about political revolutions in the local areas. This measure was actually more thorough than the suggestion Yao Chong had made during the reign of Emperor Ruizong. Yao Chong had proposed the suggestion of sending princes out as governors during the reign of Emperor Ruizong, and the sending of princes out as governors happened to be truly implemented during the period when Yao Chong was in power. Who assisted Xuanzong in completing this task? Isn't it very clear?

Second: The ministers who supported Xuanzong in eliminating Empress Wei and Princess Taiping were also expelled at this time. The Old Book of Tang, Book Ninety-Seven, Biography of Liu Youqiu:

Soon after, he was appointed Junior Guardian of the Crown Prince and dismissed from knowing political affairs. Yao Chong was always jealous of him, so he奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) that Youqiu郁快 (yu kuai, unhappy) in his secular, scattered position and had resentful words, so he was demoted and appointed as the governor of Muzhou. The same book and same volume, Biography of Zhong Shaojing:

He was promoted to Zhan Shi of the Crown Prince. At that time, Yao Chong always hated Shaojing's character, so he奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) that Shaojing's words were resentful, and he was demoted to the governor of Guozhou. (Mian? Guo?) The same book and same volume, Biography of Zhang Yue:

Soon after, he was framed by Yao Chong and sent out as the governor of Xiangzhou. (According to the case, Zhang Yue was sent to Xiangzhou from the position of Chancellor, and Liu Youqiu was also dismissed from the position of Chancellor and made the Junior Guardian of the Crown Prince at the same time. Liu's dismissal was related to Zhang.) The Old Book of Tang, Book Ninety-Eight, Biography of Wei Zhigu (can refer to the 次柳氏舊聞 (Ci Liushi Jiuwen)):

Yao Chong was deeply afraid of him and secretly added slanders, so he was appointed as Minister of Public Works and dismissed from knowing political affairs.

The Tongjian 211, Xuanzong Ji:

(In the second month of the second year of Kaiyuan) On Wuzi day, Youqiu was demoted to the governor of Muzhou, and Shaojing was demoted to the governor of Guozhou. Wang Ju, the 紫微侍郞 (Ziwei Shilang, a high-ranking official), who was on a military mission on the border and had not yet returned, was also implicated in Youqiu's party and demoted to the governor of Zezhou.

Liu Zhong, Zhang Wei, Wang and others all had merits in the two campaigns to eliminate Empress Wei and eliminate Princess Taiping, and they were all either dismissed from their positions as chancellors, demoted, or exiled in the end of the first year of Kaiyuan and the second year of Kaiyuan, that is, when Yao Chong first became chancellor. There must be a major background to this case, and it cannot be explained simply by Yao Chong's jealousy of merit. Originally, Xuanzong, during the period of his struggle for power, of course wanted to use them as wings and claws. Now that his goal had been achieved, and at that time there was a trend of members of the royal family colluding with ministers to launch political changes, of course he had reason to change his perspective and see them as poisonous insects and serious diseases. Here are two examples to illustrate:

The Old Book of Tang, Book One Hundred and Six, Biography of Wang Ju:

Someone奏 (zou, reported to the emperor) to Xuanzong, saying, "Those Wang Ju and Ma Sizong are treacherous and unrestrained scholars. They can be used to tread on danger, but they cannot be allowed to be successful. Now that the world has been settled, it is appropriate to seek pure and simple scholars who are versed in the classics." Xuanzong then estranged them. Although this matter may not be related to Yao Chong, it can be seen from this that Xuanzong had a psychological fear of this group of people.

The New Book of Tang, Book One Hundred and Twenty-Four, Biography of Yao Chong:

However, he was by nature treacherous. At the beginning, he was the governor of Tongzhou. Zhang Yue used to have a grudge against him and讽 (feng, indirectly advised) Zhao Yanzhao to impeach Chong. When he was in power, Yue was afraid and secretly went to Prince Qi to confess. Chong went to court another day, and the crowd rushed out. (Omitted) (Chong) said, "Prince Qi is His Majesty's beloved younger brother, and Zhang is a testifying辅臣 (fu chen, assistant minister). But he secretly traveled by car in and out of the prince's house. I am afraid that he will be misled, so I am worried about it." Therefore, he sent Yue to Xiangzhou.

This matter is related to Yao Chong, and it can also be seen from this how Yao Chong used Xuanzong's fear of ministers at that time to exclude dissidents. Moreover, Yao Chong's request to demote Liu Zhong was denied and questioned by both the正文 (zhengwen, main text) and the 考異 (kaoyi, textual research) of the Zizhi Tongjian, and his framing of Wei Zhigu's dismissal from the position of chancellor was also narrated very tactfully in the Ci Liushi Jiuwen. Probably later historians could not help but be somewhat biased towards this well-known sage chancellor. In fact, putting aside Yao Chong's personality, just in terms of his political achievements, Yao Chong's actions are a very important point in his career as chancellor. Because the foundation of the Kaiyuan Era was at least partially laid on Xuanzong's stable regime, and Xuanzong's regime was able to become consolidated precisely because of the two drastic measures of sending princes out as governors and demoting meritorious ministers in the early years of the Kaiyuan Era.

Finally, there are four points that must be explained in passing.

First, between the eighth and ninth years of the Kaiyuan Era, the princes who had been sent out as governors were successively recalled to the capital, and the demoted ministers were also partially re-employed. This was because Xuanzong's throne had become stable, which not only does not contradict the main idea discussed in this article, but can also mutually clarify it.

Second, the so-called ministers who supported Xuanzong in this article do not include the meritorious officials of the Longwu Army and the close attendants of Xuanzong when he was a藩王 (fan wang, a prince with a fief). The matter of the meritorious officials of the Longwu Army should be discussed in "The Commanders of the Imperial Guards during the Xuanzong Era."

Third, Yao Chong and Song Jing's presiding over the cessation of 斜封墨勅官 (xie feng mo chi guan, officials appointed by secret imperial edicts) and the closing of the road to seeking advancement through luck is quite relevant to the main idea discussed in this article, but because it belongs to the scope of clarifying the administration of officials, it is also omitted in this short article.

Fourth, Song Jing succeeded Yao Chong as chancellor, largely following the old rules. Regarding the task of stabilizing Xuanzong's throne, Yao Chong had already assisted Xuanzong in completing it beforehand, so although Song Jing also showed a tendency to suppress Xuanzong's old officials and meritorious officials, it can also be omitted in this article.

### On “Song of West Island” with Mr. You Gu'en

— Ye Yuhua

The third issue of this publication (Shen Bao, December 20th) published Mr. You Gu'en's great work "Talking about Song of West Island," believing that the opening two lines of "Song of West Island": "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island, Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei," "is the tone of a man." It also says, "This poem begins with a 'remembering' character," so the entire piece is about a man living in Jiangbei remembering his lover. Only the final four lines: "The sea of dreams is vast and endless, Your sorrow is my sorrow too. The south wind knows my heart's intent, Blow my dreams to West Island," he believes "are more appropriate as a woman's tone." Mr. You also mentioned: "The woman lives in West Island, while the man lives in Jiangbei." Therefore, he further knows: "Since the man lives in Jiangbei, the woman's West Island must be in Jiangnan." This is how Mr. You interprets this poem. In my humble opinion, it is precisely the opposite. The entire “Song of West Island” is from the female character's perspective, she is thinking of the loved one who lives on West Island, and West Island is in Jiangbei. Judging from the situation described in the poem, she lives upstream of the river, on the south bank. She and her loved one met joyfully during the plum blossom season. After the loved one left her to go to West Island, it was not easy to meet again. When it was plum blossom season again, she "picked plum blossoms" and asked someone to send them to him. That's why it begins by saying:

Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island, Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei. Simple dress of 

apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color. My explanation of these four lines is this: Remembering the past plum blossoms when you (referring to the man) went downstream to West Island in Jiangbei, this time I specially picked plum blossoms and sent them to Jiangbei. When you see the plum blossoms sent, it is as if you see the former "simple dress of apricot red, double temples, crow chick color." Here, the first line says "West Island" is a place name, and the second line says "Jiangbei," referring to its location. From these two lines, it can be inferred that the female character sending the plum blossoms is on the south bank upstream of the river. The third and fourth lines simply mentioning "simple dress" and "double temples" is nothing more than hoping that the other person sees the flowers as if seeing the person.

Following "Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei" with "Simple dress of apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color" seems disjointed at first glance, but upon closer examination, the importance of the three characters "apricot red" becomes clear. "Apricot red" describes the color of the plum blossoms and also resembles the color of the "simple dress," thus linking "apricot red" from the color of the plum blossoms to the "simple dress." Initially, it goes from the plum blossoms to the color of clothing, and then from the color of clothing to the appearance of "double temples, crow chick color," which is a very logical association. The entire poem is from the female character's perspective, with each line connected before and after, without any doubt.

If we interpret the opening four lines in the following way, it also works: "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island"—thinking about whether the plum blossoms should be sent (the meaning of "下" is similar to "下書", meaning "to send") to you there, on the Jiangbei shore of West Island? "Picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei—Simple dress of apricot red, Double temples, crow chick color"—the person picking plum blossoms to send to Jiangbei is the one who used to wear an apricot red simple dress, with double temples like the color of a crow chick. The tone of the first line seems a bit uneasy, deeply afraid that something unexpected might happen and the plum blossoms wouldn't reach West Island, so the fifth line "Where is West Island?" immediately follows with an anxious question, and the following line "Crossing at the bridge head with double oars" says that one can go there with just "double oars," and the heart is slightly relieved. Written all the way through, the words are tactful and completely express the female psychology, so I think it is the female character's tone.

"Where is West Island? Crossing at the bridge head with double oars, At dusk the shrike flies, The wind blows the Chinese tallow tree." The above says "beneath West Island," this continues by saying "Where is West Island," and then says "Crossing at the bridge head with double oars," saying that although West Island cannot be seen, the "double oars" can send one to West Island. The mention of the "shrike flying" here symbolizes the meaning of separation and distance. At that time, the double oars at the bridge head are urged, you go to West Island, but where exactly is West Island? I only see the wind blowing the Chinese tallow tree, I cannot see West Island. What is the situation after separation?

Beneath the tree is the doorway, Through the door, exposed jade hairpin.

Opening the door, the lover does not arrive, Going out to pick red lotus.

The separation took place at the tallow tree in front of the door. After you left, I often looked out from the door for your return. Opening the door, I don't see the lover arrive, so I can only pick lotus to relieve my boredom. The following:

Picking lotus in the south pond in autumn, Passing the flowers over people's heads.

Lowering my head, playing with lotus seeds, Lotus seeds are as clear as water. Placing the lotus

in my sleeve, The lotus heart is thoroughly red.

This specifically elaborates on the matter of picking lotus, with endless emotion in the words. Since I cannot see you, I often miss you. So then it says:

Remembering the lover, the lover does not arrive, Raising my head, gazing at the flying geese. The geese fly all over West Island, Hoping for the lover on the green tower, From the tower, I cannot see, All day at the balustrade. The balustrade has twelve turns, Hanging hands bright as jade, Rolling up the curtain, the sky is naturally high, The sea sways empty green.

This says that the flying geese can still fly all over West Island, I can only climb the tower and look far away, watching the flying geese go by, unable to fly to West Island like the flying geese. So, stroking the balustrade in sorrow, rolling up the curtain to look into the distance, the swaying sea only increases the sorrow. Then, the final four lines follow:

The sea of dreams is vast and endless, Your sorrow is my sorrow too.

The south wind knows my heart's intent, Blow my dreams to West Island.

The end says that this vast and endless sea makes people sad, thinking that both you and I have this feeling. It is truly not easy to meet. I hope the south wind blows my dream clouds to you there, on the Jiangbei shore of West Island.

This kind of explanation seems much simpler, without needing to go in circles. The poem begins by saying: "Remembering the plum blossoms beneath West Island" is what the female character remembers, and in the middle, "Remembering the lover, the lover does not arrive" is also what the female character remembers, consistent from beginning to end. The "you" in "Your sorrow is my sorrow too" refers to the man, and "I" is the female character referring to herself, connected from the previous text in one breath, without needing to separate the two lines "The sea sways empty green, The sea of dreams is vast and endless," saying that the top line is the man's words and the bottom line is the woman's words. The "south wind" in the poem is the wind blowing from Jiangnan towards West Island in Jiangbei. What Mr. You believes to be problematic can all be easily resolved here, without needing to waste words. I have briefly written this out as I could at the moment, taking time out of my day, to solicit corrections from Mr. You. This explanation may have problems, I dare not dogmatically assert that West Island is in Jiangbei, and I still ask Mr. You to investigate. However, I would like to state that the river mentioned here should not be limited to the Yangtze River, there are many river names in the Jiang, Xiang, Wu, and Yue areas of southern China.

### Altruism · Interest · Selfishness

— Bo Yong

It's probably correct to divide all behaviors into the three categories mentioned in the title, right? The highest level is altruistic, the lowest is selfish, and being indifferent to the world is about interest. Ellis, a major British expert in sexual psychology (the one who wrote about sexual psychology), said in his book "The Dance of Life":

"The playful nature of the Chinese character and its culture is known to anyone, whether they only look from afar or get close to China. It has always been said that the Chinese invented gunpowder long before the Europeans, but it was only used for firecrackers and nothing else. In the West, this seems like a great mistake, burying the precious use of gunpowder. Only recently has a European dared to point out that 'the proper use of gunpowder is obviously to make firecrackers, creating beautiful things, and not to kill people.' In short, the Chinese can indeed fully understand this proper use of gunpowder. We hear that 'one of the most obvious characteristics of the Chinese is their love of firecrackers.' The most solemn people and the wisest are busy making firecrackers. If Bergson's writings were translated into Chinese - with many firecracker metaphors inside - we can believe that China would produce many familiar Bergsonians!"

Ellis is an eccentric person, and this passage can also be called an eccentric article. Under all heaven, there are people who express respect for the Chinese's senseless setting off of firecrackers, isn't that extremely strange and special? According to the Chinese, setting off firecrackers looks like it's for fun, but the real purpose is to worship gods. Worshipping gods means asking gods to help us get rich. For example, the God of Wealth probably wouldn't descend unless there were five thousand or ten thousand firecrackers, so every New Year you can hear stores competing to set off firecrackers. How can this kind of mentality be considered fun? The Biography of Humor in Records of the Grand Historian says that Chun Yufeng advised King Cheng of Qi to seek help from Zhao with a hundred catties of gold and a carriage of ten horses to repel Chu, with words like: "Now, I came from the east and saw someone plowing in the field beside the road, holding a pig's trotter and a wine cup, and praying: May the basket be filled, the cart be filled, the five grains be ripe, and the home be filled." Extremely expressing that "what is held is small, but what is desired is extravagant." This thinking can probably be considered to have been around for a long time. The slogan of "small investment, big profit" has been around since ancient times, and is even more so now! Not studying the means, but focusing on the purpose, then one should be a merchant but must be a fraud, and one should be an official but must be corrupt. This is all the difference of a single thought of setting off firecrackers to worship gods.

Therefore, China is a country that values ​​selfishness and self-interest. Some people are so indignant that they even say the words "China will not perish, there is no justice," although the principles of heaven are unknowable, the disasters of people are visible, and one cannot relax and act like Ah Q just because there is no perishing. Speaking of a playful attitude, the Chinese have never lacked it, but they are unwilling to use play for play itself, but instead use it for important state affairs. In ancient times, the owner of Banxian Hall lost the country by the cricket pot, and in modern times, there are those who lost three provinces in one night of dancing. Li Yishan's poem says it well: "Jinyang has fallen, no need to look back, let the king hunt for a while," and so, Xiao Lian's jade body was lying horizontally at night, and it had already been reported that Zhou Shuai had entered Jinyang! The Later Lord Li was never unkind, but specializing in flirting with the concubine-sister was not a proper thing after all, no wonder some people scolded him. In the days when the temple was empty, those who shed tears were only palace maids. Where was the ancestral artifact placed? We literary people often think that those who say these kinds of words are too demanding and don't understand human relationships, but speaking from a political standpoint, one must change one's attitude. Looking back again, the Chinese are serious and earnest about real play. During the warlord era, a game of mahjong could cause a big fight, or because you were a subordinate and held a white card so that the marshal didn't win under a full set, you would be reprimanded and even fired. Look, aren't our compatriots in the casino braver and more responsible than in the office? This is completely because they see —— that is, play —— as much more interesting than listening to sermons last week and reading newspapers and chatting in the office, so they go all out to do it. Just imagine if one day we could be so serious about things that benefit others, wouldn't there be a big turning point? It's not that we can't do it, it's just that we don't want to do it! We can't help but sigh.

Why are we willing to be serious about play? There are winning and losing relationships, that is, there are gains and losses for the self. Japanese and Americans both like to play mahjong, but in the Club, they see it like playing chess, ping pong, or billiards, not to make money. A competition of skills doesn't necessarily require money to be happy, but the Chinese think this is meaningless, "Why doesn't it make money? Boring!" Most people leave looking disappointed. Recently, playing cards emphasizes wild cards, completely overturning the previous skills of pure suit and great honors, requiring only speed and quick wins and losses, and doubling the payouts, which can fully realize the spirit of "small investment, big profit." This is truly a portrayal of the entire nation's morality heading towards speculation and trickery, and it is the prelude to the total collapse of social morality. Foreigners play bridge, which is to see a person's demeanor, bearing, mind, and skills, while the Chinese specialize in appreciating crab, Russian, and pai gow. What else can we say! Many ancient games have been lost, such as backgammon and equestrian chess. Thinking about it, it's probably because they were too technical and required too much brainpower? Go is no longer very popular today, and maybe after fifty years, even Chinese chess will be finished, or mahjong may also be eliminated. So, looking at it from these aspects, are we really as Ellis said, full of playful nature in our character and culture? Jimei was strict and Ba Shang was child's play. In contrast, the difference is clear. In fact, most of today's things are like Ba Shang, serious matters are treated as child's play, and child's play becomes serious. This reversal is not due to interest, but precisely because there is no interest. Generally speaking, our big problem is poverty. Poverty makes us want to desperately get money, and the so-called interest is chased away by the stench of money. How many people in the office today don't have stocks, cotton yarn, US dollars, and gold bars swirling in their heads? So it's no wonder that they see public affairs as chewing wax - assuming that these public affairs can't directly make them rich. What is incomprehensible here is that even people who have money and are very rich still have no interest. Zu Shishao loved money, could it be that their interest is only in the yellow gold bars?

People who don't even have enough interest, what else is there besides selfishness?

### The First Book

— Li Li

Li Zhizao and Xu Guangqi's joint translation of "Euclid's Elements" in six volumes is the first book in Chinese about Western mathematics.

Li Zhizao's "Guowen Suanzhi" is the first book in Chinese that translates Western arithmetic.

Tang Ruowang's "Explanation of the Telescope" is the first book to introduce Western optics to China.

Li Zhizao and Chuan Fanji jointly translated "Mingli Tan" in ten volumes, which is the first book to introduce Western logic to China.

### Cultural Scarcity

— Lei Hong

Hearing the news that newspapers are reducing their pages, I can't help but feel a vague sense of loss. In the years of war, we only see the gradual destruction of complete construction, and we do not see an increase in production volume, so people should eat two bowls of rice per meal, reduced to half a bowl or one bowl. In terms of spiritual food, this is the saving of paper. And the situation in China is even more pitiful, not only is there less paper, but the price of paper is expensive. Publishers feel that "finished products" are not as easy to maintain capital as "raw materials," and on the contrary, there is a risk of losing money. Therefore, the publication of books and newspapers is reduced as much as possible, delayed, and even enters a state of semi-stagnation, forming a phenomenon of cultural scarcity. Speaking of it, it is sad enough.

The situation in China is like this, and the Western publishing industry has also encountered the same situation, especially in the American magazine industry, which dumps to the world, even an embroidered pillow has revealed the straw core of decline. The Saturday Evening Post reduced its pages several months ago. Although the number of pages reduced has not been checked, it has changed from a thick book to a thin book, and the estimated total number of pages has been reduced by about a quarter. The novella that originally occupied one column has been deleted, and has been replaced by a novel that is continuously published in three or four issues. Collier's magazine has also reduced its pages in the same proportion, becoming a large "shallow" magazine. The situation seems more tragic than the "Saturday Evening Post".

American magazines originally emphasized both quality and quantity. Since the price of paper has risen in Luoyang and the printing cost has increased, on the premise of not wanting to increase the price to increase the burden on readers, they have had to emphasize quality over quantity, and have gone the way of deleting pages.

The Crown magazine, published in March, broke the tradition of not publishing advertisements, leaving a small part for some advertisers to publish advertisements, so that under the current economic exhaustion, it is a way to maintain the original level without increasing the selling price. I remember when Crown magazine was first born more than ten years ago, it was gorgeous and luxurious, and it could be called one of the best small magazines. After the war, in order to meet the general needs, Crown did not hesitate to lower its status and change its direction, becoming a "digest" type magazine that was not an excerpt, making it more popular and easy to understand. Recently, due to the times, it has added advertisements. Although the number of Gangwen pages has not been reduced, it can also be seen how the American publishing industry is struggling to make a profit in the thorny jungle of sales.

The situation of cultural scarcity is becoming more and more serious. If culture can bow its head in the economic environment, then I cannot bear to imagine what the even more tragic consequences will be.

### Wandering Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13: Trying to Remedy (110)

Xiao Bai paused and said: "You can't go either of these two paths. In the end, you can only go your own way and get divorced! The ending is so tragic, it's better not to plant the cause, so you won't bear the fruit. This time, I'm not trying to tear apart your good marriage, but because this marriage will never have a good ending. I'm breaking up this ill-fated relationship for you two. Now, Qiyun has gone to Shanghai to act in a play, so she has a way out. You don't have to worry about her. She will definitely gain both fame and fortune in the future. You should also move forward. You are a married man. You should cut out all delusions and go home to live a good life with your wife and be filial to your parents, so you won't let down my good intentions!" Zhu Zhai felt that sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness were intertwined in his heart. He didn't know if Xiao Bai's words were reasonable or unreasonable. His psychology was affected by his emotions, and he felt that Xiao Bai's idea was too poisonous. He just lay on the bed and kept crying. After a while, he asked Fan: "How did Uncle know about me and Qiyun? Who told Uncle?" Xiao Bai paused for a while and said: "Who doesn't know about this? No one told me, I heard about it a long time ago." Zhu Zhai said: "Did Zhang Yunqing tell you?" Xiao Bai bound his shoulders for a moment, paused for a while and said: "She is a young lady, how would she know about things outside! How can you suspect her?" Zhu Zhai couldn't say anything when he was asked. Xiao Bai said: "Don't think wildly. What Qiyun, what Zhang Yunqing, in short, none of them are your object. As the ancients said: A wife who has weathered the storm should not be abandoned, and your wife is very good. Hurry up and go back, I won't keep you here." Saying that, he patted Zhu Zhai on the shoulder and said: "You have to listen to me, you won't be wrong!" Zhu Zhai knew Xiao Bai's temper. If he asked him to leave, he couldn't help but leave. He had to stand up and say goodbye. He went out the street door and hired a car. His psychology was chaotic and mixed. He wanted to go back to the dormitory, and he also wanted to go home to see Feng Sheng. He thought for a while in the car, and finally decided to listen to Xiao Bai's words for the time being and go home to see what Feng Sheng's attitude was like. What Uncle Xiao Bai said was also right, a wife who has weathered the storm should not be abandoned. Feng Sheng has always been diligent and thrifty in managing the family. Originally, she had no faults. Because of Qiyun, I had the heart to divorce her. Speaking of which, it was still my fault, especially in the last two months, I didn't even send her monthly expenses on time. She didn't ask me in a questioning manner either. Her cultivation skills are indeed good. Her biggest problem is that she is not fashionable. Just now, Uncle Bo had also said that Qiyun is a fashionable woman who likes to spend a lot of money. Can I afford to support her? This is indeed the truth, I can't afford to support her, and I can't look to her for support. In the end, it will still be unfinished and end in bad results. It's better to stick to Feng Sheng, this yellow-faced woman, so that we can share the advantages and disadvantages and work together through hardships.

### Reprimanding "It's Very Far"

— Nian Hong

Those who owe people money and want to get rid of it mostly don't say blunt and rude words like "I won't pay it back," but instead use the method of prevarication or delay. They clearly intend to owe it to the end, but verbally they always use phrases such as "I'll pay it back tomorrow," "next month," or even "in the future" and "I'll talk about it when I have it," so that the creditor has some hope of possible repayment, but this paper check can never be cashed even in the slightest.

Putting everything off to the future is indeed a clever way. Blind fortune tellers wandering around often say sweet words and embellish the customer's "tomorrow" with flowery words, allowing these down-and-out and frustrated people to immerse themselves in the beautiful vision of the future, temporarily forgetting the current pain, and finally voluntarily take out the only money they have and send it to the hands of the fortune tellers. Anyway, blind men do not bear any legal responsibility for whether the fortune telling is correct or not. If it hits, it is naturally fulfilled; if it is unfortunately wrong, then there is absolutely no reason to go back to the blind man to recover the fortune telling money.

What's more, after tomorrow, there is still tomorrow, and long-term checks cannot be written endlessly. Since the final conclusion has to be reached after the coffin is closed, then during the time of living, one can always continue to delay. This phenomenon seems to be very common recently.

For example, someone asked if China, as a country, would have a day of peace and prosperity? Although there are many answers heard, there are few affirmative replies. Most people think that there will be a day of peace and prosperity, but it is very far away, very, very far away. Twenty years later? No, no, thirty or forty years, no, no, maybe it will be even further away.

That kind of perfunctory saying that is close to owing a debt is really not worth a penny. Of course, the person answering will also give many seemingly correct evidences for the sake of supporting his "it's very far away" theory. Just like saying that the inferior nature of the Chinese people cannot be eradicated, the educational level of farmers is not qualified, the selfish atmosphere is difficult to shift, the feudal forces are deeply rooted... Things like that, it seems that he has really put in hard work and has a deep and unique study of Chinese society. But the listener believes it to be true, and so either is pessimistic and negative, thinking that it is difficult, it is difficult; or anyway, "it's very far away," what does it have to do with me, I might as well be drunk today and live a life of debauchery.

An anesthetic containing toxins is often exploited by people, so this theory has been spread very widely recently, replacing the "China will surely perish" theory, but it has also dampened the courage of people to face reality and work hard. The fact is very clear, long-term checks cannot be cashed, and now is no longer the time to be perfunctory and evasive. We know that if we put in one point of effort, we will definitely get one point of harvest. This harvest will not be in the distant future, but is right now. Anyone with a little historical knowledge knows that the strength of European and American countries is only a matter of the last few decades. Before the determined rectification, like the United States, the educational level and unity of these colonists who moved to the New World before and after the revolution were very backward and weak.

Everything, everything, lies in grasping today. The nonsense of "very far away" and "the future" which is a matter of the unknowable sky can be ignored, and we can give it a disregard.

### Professor Commits Suicide

— Zhong Ming

According to a Reuters dispatch from Guilin on the 12th: Professor Du Su of National Guangxi University, due to poverty and illness, unable to make a living, committed suicide by jumping from a building in the hospital. This news has aroused sorrow and mourning in society. However, the most deeply affected are public education personnel, especially university professors who are in the same situation as the deceased.

Speaking of university professors, people generally have a sense of respect because they are the pioneers in the national education field and authorities in the academic world. Their importance is enough to influence the lifeline of national education. Before the war, university professors had a good life. Today, countries around the world are also trying their best to improve the lives and status of university professors. But what year is it today? University professors are actually in a state of "poverty and illness" and "unable to make a living," and in the end, they resort to suicide. It is really impossible not to cry aloud for the university professors across the country and the future of Chinese education!

A dignified university professor cannot even feed himself or support his children. How can he research anything good?

Professor Du Su's death is just a microcosm of university professors across the country and a signal of the crisis in Chinese education. The salaries of public education personnel will be adjusted next month. I hope that in the future, we will no longer see such heartbreaking news.

### Sea Red Building Poetry Collection

— Xu Banmeng

Sent to Lingxiao in Beiping

Self-proclaimed desolate old man, living desolately in Beiping,
His writings fill the world, while his love of bronzes and inscriptions comforts his life.
Longing for past events after a long separation,
His letter expresses his true feelings,
The years are like a dream,
Watching the mulberry fields turn into the sea again.

The chaotic world is like a chess game,
The broken scales of justice have not yet rested,
The universe grieves at the short hair,
The wind and rain weep in the same boat;
Searching for old tiles in the north (you recently obtained a green-skinned tile to use as an inkstone),
An old worn-out fur coat in the south,
The tears of wandering poets,
Flowing endlessly for the war.

Sunset

At sunset, dense clouds cover the chaotic mountains,
Pale phosphorescent lights flicker in the secluded passes,
The heart dwells in the ancient times of Emperor Xi,
Dreams surround the vastness of the earth and sky;
A million sorrowful souls are red in the overcast rain,
Three thousand strong armors are stained with blood,
Killing people is as common as grass, the sound is cut off,
The yellow dragon is nowhere to be seen, not even a lone horse returns.

Frosty Wind

The frosty wind is sharp and cold in the autumn on the great river,
I pawn my cold clothes to go to the wine shop,
Listening to the sounds of war, the heron and clam fight,
The universe is like a mayfly!
Puppets on stage all wear court robes and hats,
The clothing and hats of the world are mostly skulls,
The cycle of the ages is the same,
How can I stop the traveler's hair from turning white.

### Ink Musings

— Feng Xuexueyuan

I purchased a purple inkstick at Changdian, delighted by its uniqueness. On it were engraved white characters on a shaded background, saying "People grind ink, ink grinds people." Reciting this over and over, I was profoundly moved, and I believe it would resonate with those of us who pore over words. The poet Kenren once said, "What in this world makes people age? Half of it is the sound of carriages, half the sound of horses' hooves." This refers to the fact that people spend their lives chasing fame and fortune, running about busily. It is indeed a sobering thought, but it is a general observation. As for those of us who work with literature and art, we sit by our inkstones, using ink as our livelihood. We do not need to run around busily to make a living, so it seems that we are not bothered by the sounds of wheels and hooves. However, the writing implements before us are constantly being used up, and as we grind the ink, the time that is like an arrow flies by, never to return. Ink is an object, obedient to people. On the surface, "people grind ink," but in reality, the ink grinds people. Since my youth, I have immersed myself in the sea of words, and now I have white hair and a wrinkled face, and I am greatly weakened. Reading these six characters, I am filled with boundless sorrow and cannot restrain myself.

Since inkwells became popular, inkstones have been used less. Since there are specialized shops selling ink, selling by the bottle, and grinders are also in the trade, men of letters need not grind ink themselves. Since fountain pens and ballpoint pens have become popular in schools and newspapers, people often abandon Chinese writing implements and use foreign products even for writing letters and manuscripts. As a result, the use of old ink has gradually decreased. Roughly speaking, the users are: (1) calligraphers, (2) document departments of various government offices, (3) old-fashioned shops and old-school literati, (4) calligraphy classes in various primary and secondary schools, etc. College students all have ballpoint pens, and even when writing Chinese essays and taking notes, they rarely use Chinese writing brushes. However, when writing slogans and pasting propaganda, foreign pens are useless, and only writing brushes will do. The ever-increasing number of "wall newspapers" in various schools is actually helping native ink merchants maintain a portion of their business. It is indeed a way to promote national products, which can elicit a smile.

The value of antiques increases as their practical use decreases. Porcelain bowls, dishes, vases, and cups for eating and drinking, if decorated and treasured, become like waste. The same is true of writing implements. When I look at the ink catalogues of the famous ink makers of the previous dynasties, such as Cheng Junfang and Fang Yulu, their forms and patterns are varied, even including the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, heaven, earth, people, ghosts, and gods. Reading through them one by one is like visiting a museum or reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas, forgetting that they are ink for writing. Merchants then try their best to imitate them, making the forms extremely refined and lifelike, but the quality is gray and渣, and they are absolutely unusable, completely "having the appearance but not the substance." If you question them harshly, they will honestly and impolitely say, "Even if it is real ink, many gentlemen only use it for display and not for practical use, so what does it matter if it is real or fake?" This remark can also elicit a smile and is also the truth. The addiction to antiques is originally a foolish hobby.

The "imperial ink" of the former Qing court and the specially made ink of artists were of course of extremely good quality in both literature and substance, but genuine products are becoming increasingly rare, and ancient ink from the Song and Ming dynasties is even more precious. The late Yuan Taishi (Lizhun, from Changzhou, a Jinshi in the Wuxu year) was most fond of this pursuit and collected many exquisite items. Banmeng mentioned in his letter yesterday that he recalled that when Wu Liuyu (Guanyin) was the chief editor of the Zhengfeng magazine in the 14th year of the Republic, he hosted a banquet for literary and artistic friends. Jiang Jun Yiyun (from Fujian, a well-known figure in the French Concession) was present and spoke of Yuan's collection of ink from the Northern Song Dynasty by Li Weiyi. Jiang Jun immediately wrote a short article that was published in Zhengfeng, saying: "Formerly collected by Wu Changshuo, later acquired by Yuan Juesheng. The ink is four cun six fen long, one cun six fen wide, and seven fen thick, weighing six liang three qian. One side is a picture of a red gate, with the words 'Valorous Family' written beside it. On the right side, a banana plant is partially visible within a enclosure, and a small hut is in the corner. A tall building rises in the distance, with golden rafters and vermilion pillars, incomparably magnificent. Outside are tall wu trees, with precise structure and ancient colors. The other side is a seal character with red gate, similar to the Daguan Post, imitating the style of Wang Xizhi, with a seal below that says 'Why Imitate the Ancients' in four characters. Two dragons coil around the edge of the seal. Comparing it with Shen Zifeng's (Zeng Tong's) book on ink from the Ming Dynasty, it is known that Li Weiyi was an ink official during the Zhenzong era, and his family had held this position for generations since the Southern Tang Dynasty. A small portion of the corner of the ink is slightly worn, like fine steel just emerging from the whetstone." It is not only excellent in form, but also extremely good in substance. This is a treasure. Being an ancient object that has passed through the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, it is also worthy of admiration. However, when I read what Qian Mei of Meixi said about making ink, "The ancients said that brushes are better when old like grass, and ink is better when old like treasure. It is desirable for it to be a few years old, to slightly remove the fire nature. This does not necessarily mean that ink from the Tang and Song dynasties is considered old. Today, when people talk about ink, they always mention Li and Pan, or Cheng and Fang, and even each inkstick costs tens or hundreds of gold, but in reality, they are all useless. I have seen Zhijin Zhai's master and Liu Wenqing all use ancient ink, but they all smear the paper, as if it were stained with dirt. This is because ancient ink loses its glue, and when it loses its glue, it cannot be used, no matter how fine the smoke and how exquisite the packaging, it is only placed on the desk for decoration." This is a general theory.

My pursuit of this path is purely based on my interest and ability, and I have gained some small achievements. I obtained a square Qianlong inkstick (octagonal, with five hundred arhats, with five hundred different appearances. They have already been scattered, so I was able to obtain one or two at a low price, unable to seek completeness, and also not seeking completeness. I also obtained three of the one hundred views of the summer resort, all extremely beautiful and pure. I also obtained several inksticks of cinnabar ink and gold ink, with exquisite and playful patterns and styles. I am satisfied with this. I have never coveted ink from the Ming Dynasty or earlier, as I do not have the strength or the spirit.

The famous ink shop in old Beijing was Hu Kaiwen's, located in Liulichang, which still exists today. Their ink is divided into "Old Hu" and "New Hu." Old Hu are all products of several decades, and although they are not as exquisite as imperial ink, they also have artistic value. "New Hu" is inferior in both materials and workmanship, and is used by contemporary painters and calligraphers. The price is also not low, because this industry and this craft are becoming increasingly rare.

The reason why the ink industry of the previous dynasties was so prosperous was due to the imperial examinations, especially the palace examinations, court examinations, Hanlin examinations, examinations for assignments, and examinations for censors, chapter clerks, and secretaries, etc. Although these were examinations of essays, most of them judged based on the quality of calligraphy. Calligraphy did not need to be ancient, but rather elegant, luxurious, smooth, and even. The so-called "academy style" and "palace style" writing could not be accomplished without good brushes and good ink. The emphasis on ink materials, especially "pine soot," was because it was smooth but not floating, fine but not broken, black but not stagnant, and the characters written had an elegant and serene beauty. Those who have seen old "white folders" and "large scrolls" can all appreciate this to some extent. At that time, examinations occupied an overwhelming advantage, so the development of brush and ink crafts followed accordingly. This was an inevitable trend.
