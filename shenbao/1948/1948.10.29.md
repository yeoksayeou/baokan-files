### Government Decides to Continue Price Controls; Economic Control Commission Agrees on New Plan; Executive Yuan to Discuss and Pass Tomorrow Before Announcing; Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Appoints Nine to Draft Proposal to Stabilize Currency Value

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After two days of thorough discussion by the authorities, supplementary new measures for financial and economic reform were finalized on the 28th. A plan is to be formulated and is expected to be announced and implemented on October 31st or November 1st. The Economic Control Conference convened by Premier Weng was held all day on the 28th, from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, with a break for lunch, and resumed at 4:00 PM, ending at approximately 7:00 PM. The conference formulated a comprehensive and concrete strategy to improve the current economic situation and remedy the problems discovered in the implementation of economic controls after the currency reform. A draft of these new measures has been prepared during the conference. Premier Weng has scheduled a special Executive Yuan meeting on the 30th for discussion. Once formally approved by the Executive Yuan, it will be immediately promulgated. The draft is currently being compiled and transcribed. Before being submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting, it will first be submitted to the Central Political Committee for discussion. All parties are striving to maintain secrecy regarding this decision before its official announcement, refusing to reveal its contents. However, it can be reported that the government will not abandon price controls, but will flexibly apply price limits in implementation to resolve the issues of hoarding and lack of goods, and to stabilize the people's livelihood. At the same time, a decision has been made to improve the salaries of civil servants. The plan also includes provisions for controlling supplies, implementing rationing, increasing production, and setting prices for state-owned public utilities.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao summoned Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan and some members of the banking community at 10:00 PM on the 28th for consultation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held its regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, chaired by Ma Chaojun. During the meeting, a wide-ranging discussion on current economic issues was held, with various committee members expressing their opinions. However, no conclusion was reached, and the matter will be discussed by the Central Political Committee after Premier Weng Wenhao and the Economic Control Commission formulate the supplementary measures for economic reform. During the meeting on the 28th, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, reported in detail on the economic situation in Shanghai.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Finance and Economics Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a plenary committee meeting on the morning of the 28th.

Ultimately, Wang Menglin and eight others were appointed to be responsible for drafting a plan, to be reported to the committee for discussion within a short period.

### Correction Proposal on the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties in Shanghai Approved in Principle; Supervisory Yuan's Two Committees Appoint Three Committee Members to Draft the Text

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The correction proposal submitted by Supervisory Committee members Yu Peihou and Ni Bi of the Su-Zhe District Administrative Office regarding the sale of enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai was reviewed at a joint meeting of the Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Food Committee and the Internal Affairs and Land Administration Committee at 3:00 PM on the 28th. Chairman Liu Pingjiang presided over the meeting, which was attended by more than 30 Supervisory Committee members. In addition to the proposers explaining the reasons, many people spoke. It was decided that the correction proposal was approved in principle, and Liu Pingjiang, Leng Pudong, and Yu Peihou were appointed to draft the text. The principles are two: (1) The valuation was too low. (2) The method of sale was incorrect. Representatives of public opinion organs should participate in the valuation committee. The three committee members are scheduled to draft the text starting on the 29th and submit it to the Executive Yuan for processing. According to the original case, the reasons were: "The Executive Yuan's administrative meeting passed on October 13th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948), the methods to accelerate the sale of enemy and puppet real estate. Its measures actually maintain private interests and damage national rights. According to Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 23 of the Supervisory Law, a correction proposal is submitted." The facts stated therein are extremely detailed, listing the Executive Yuan's repeated changes to the deadline for the sale of enemy and puppet properties, the low price of the sales valuation, all of which disregarded the government's credibility and national interests, specializing in facilitating private individuals and harming the country, and that the so-called custodians (i.e., those occupying enemy and puppet houses) were a small number of officials, big and small, and relatives, friends, and old acquaintances of most of the receiving personnel. The method of sale did not adopt open bidding, but allowed custodians to have priority in purchasing. Shanghai's houses are worth an ounce of gold for every inch of land, and custodians have occupied garden houses in Shanghai for several years for nothing. The original case also contained the following warning: "Is the so-called priority purchase method not encouraging occupation and fostering corruption?" "The government disposes of stockpiled real estate, and is helpless against these custodians who improperly profit. How can it implement the equalization of land rights and implement the Principle of People's Livelihood?" It also stated: If the sale of enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai were handled through open bidding, the total value could reach approximately 1 billion gold yuan, but with the previous legal valuations, the government could not receive 200 million gold yuan. The entire case is thousands of words long, detailing the accumulated abuses. Yu said at the meeting that he believed this matter had not received the attention of the central government, and that if a correction could be submitted to the Executive Yuan before it was handled, the country's revenue would certainly be substantial.

### Deficits in Grain Rationing Figures

Yao Jian Reports to Legislative Yuan's Grain Administration Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] According to the Grain News Agency: Yao Jian, Director of the Allocation Group of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, attended the Legislative Yuan's Grain Administration Committee on the 28th and reported on the general operations of urban rationing and the actual situation of grain fund deficits. He classified and explained the actual funding needs for costs and distribution fees, stating that the cost of each long ton of rationed grain was 246.34 gold yuan, including transportation commissions of 8.26 gold yuan, bank handling fees of 10.65 gold yuan, transit losses of 6.47 gold yuan, sack depreciation of 5.50 gold yuan, and interest on overdraft funds of 8.51 gold yuan, totaling 285.73 gold yuan. The expenses required for distribution included warehouse rent, insurance, and delivery expenses totaling 6.616 gold yuan, grain area handling fees of 7.94 gold yuan, Civil Mediation Committee business management fees of 7.94 gold yuan, and receiving bank handling fees of 2.44 gold yuan, totaling 24.93 gold yuan. Adding the Emergency Procurement Committee business management fee of 1.43 gold yuan, the total cost was 312.09 gold yuan. However, the revenue from selling each long ton was only 145.22 gold yuan (the selling price was 10 gold yuan per shi, 50% lower than the market price), resulting in a deficit of 166.87 gold yuan, an average subsidy of 12 gold yuan per shi.

Editorial

### Shanghai's Household Census

The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Economic Supervision Office, in order to reissue national identity cards and ration purchase certificates to comprehensively implement rationing and purchase plans starting next month, have decided to conduct a citywide household census on the eighth of next month. They have also promulgated implementation guidelines, notifying citizens to pay attention to three items: (1) During the census, all members of the household must be gathered inside the house, maintaining a state of stillness, and the census taker will check each household and each person one by one, stamping the newly issued national identity card photos on the spot and issuing them by name. (2) Citizens who have not yet obtained an identity card must fill out an application for a national identity card in advance, attaching two photos. If they have not yet applied for household registration, they must first fill out an application for household registration. (3) The "Jia" is the basic unit of the household census, with two census takers assigned to each "Jia." A total of 56,000 people are needed for the entire city. The authorities will mobilize 70,000 government employees and students to assist in the process. This shows that the scale of the household census being conducted in Shanghai this time, and the extent of its mobilization, is an unprecedented event in our country's modern household administration.

The household census should be called a population census. Its significance lies in investigating the static population at a specific point in time. The resulting statistics should be called static population statistics. This is a measure used in practical politics that is employed by sociology and statistics, and is highly valued by general progressive countries and good citizens. However, a population census is slightly different from household registration administration. Household registration administration records population dynamics and should fall within the scope of household registration law. The purpose of the household census being conducted in Shanghai this time is to issue "national identity cards" based on static population statistics, calculating by household and by head, and the identity card is also to certify the people's domicile and identity, to prove personal rights and to determine obligations. The legal basis for the "National Identity Card" is the new Household Registration Law. Therefore, this time, Shanghai's population census, technically speaking, is a census of the static population within a specified time in the entire city, and then, based on static statistics, in accordance with the provisions of the Household Registration Law, issue new "national identity cards" by household and by head. The procedures are complicated and difficult, and it requires patient and meticulous work to avoid errors. In particular, when conducting the census, it is necessary to comply with the law and academic principles, paying attention solely to the population census itself, without involving anything else, in order to avoid harassment, to leave a better impression of the "new administration" on the people, and to ensure that it does not cause conflicts in its effectiveness. This is a very important matter.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Kunming conducted a non-standard household survey, and Chongqing also conducted a trial identity registration survey, issuing "Resident Identity Registration Certificates" to the city's population, which was the predecessor of the current National Identity Card. The experience of Kunming and Chongqing in those years can serve as a reference for this Shanghai household census. The Kunming household survey placed more emphasis on academic significance than on administrative significance. Before the survey, it mobilized elementary school teachers throughout the city to receive household survey training, and then used them as investigators to conduct the survey. There are three points worth noting in the Kunming survey: First, it divided the city into 150 survey districts and had inspectors to conduct random checks; second, it first surveyed ordinary households and then concentrated its efforts on surveying public households (such as schools, institutions, and the military); third, the publicity was good, and the citizens had few misunderstandings. The Chongqing identity registration, on the other hand, placed more emphasis on administrative significance than on academic significance. It established a special agency, mobilized a large number of military police, and based the survey on quite numerous survey forms, taking six months to complete. From a strict point of view, the Chongqing registration survey met the requirements of strict effectiveness; from an economic point of view, Chongqing was indeed wasteful. This time, Shanghai is holding a population census, with the active purpose of facilitating rationing and purchasing, and the need is pressing, and the preparations are rushed. We hope to achieve strictness on the principle of non-wastefulness and to achieve accuracy and universality in a quick time. And we hope that the good citizens of the entire city will enthusiastically support this matter, which is related to their own rights and obligations, and not misunderstand it, causing trouble. This is very important.

Shanghai's household census has been scheduled to take place from 9:00 PM on November 8th to 1:00 AM on November 9th. During this short preparation period, it is hoped that the relevant agencies' preparation work will be serious, meticulous, and thorough. In law and technology, the household census portion should be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the "Population Census Law," adapting to the time and place. The issuance of national identity cards should be in accordance with the provisions of the "Household Registration Law" regarding identity registration, paying special attention to personal origin, age, and occupation, so that the issuance of this identity card can have the effect of certifying personal identity, thereby protecting personal rights and determining personal obligations. Finally, it is hoped that the investigators will be particularly diligent and humble when conducting the survey and will not disturb the people, so that the citizens will have faith. As for the rumors of attaching a survey of "underground warehouses," this kind of mixed and chaotic approach is absolutely unacceptable. Because general progressive countries regard the population census as an educational topic, using it to train people to abide by the law, it is necessary to start with the investigators themselves strictly abiding by the law. In the past, when India held a population census, it fully achieved the goal of people's self-governance education. The five million citizens of Shanghai have a higher level of knowledge, and whether ordinary households or public households, they should enthusiastically support and assist the government in completing this great work with contemporary educational significance, as a demonstration for the national household registration. And the 70,000 people responsible for the survey, in particular, are responsible for the smooth and effective implementation of the new administration, and need to be particularly humble and diligent, to establish a new style of politics. This is our greatest hope for this Shanghai household census.

### Engineers Association Closed Today, Next Session Decided to Be Held in Guangzhou; Many Proposals Recommended to the Government Were Passed

[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 28th] The General Assembly of the Engineers Association elected five members of the next selection committee at around 6 PM. Mao Yisheng, Wu Yun-chu, Hu Shuhua, Yang Jiayu, and Hong Lingxun were elected, and it was also decided that the next annual meeting will be held in Guangzhou. The General Assembly is scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 29th, and some members will leave Taiwan on the "Zhongxing" ship on the morning of the 29th.

[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 28th] The Engineers Association discussed proposals this afternoon, chaired by Ling Hongxun. A total of thirty-three proposals were received. The main points are as follows: (1) The current Engineer Law is not applicable to engineers. The draft Engineer Law proposed by the Wuhan branch was passed and submitted to the board of directors for revision, and then submitted to the government to remove the industrial and mining engineer section from the current Engineer Law and regroup it into the Engineer Law separately. (2) It is recommended that the government complete the Chongqing-Rongchang section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule and quickly repair the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway. The board of directors will first formulate a plan before submitting it. (3) A committee will be formed by the General Assembly and the Shanghai branch to study Japanese reparations and recommend that the government carry out planned construction. (4) It is recommended that the government use the Southwest region as a heavy industry center and develop it as soon as possible. (5) Please ask the Ministry of the Interior to cancel Article 7 of the Regulations on the Management of the Construction Industry. (6) Please strengthen the automatic machinery industry inspection agency, and the Automatic Machinery Society will draft a plan to recommend to the government. (7) Please ask the government to reward the automobile manufacturing industry. (8) The association will invite experts to discuss ways to improve highway engineering, and please ask the government to adopt them. (9) Unify the names of the metric units of measurement and ask the government to adopt them. (10) Please unify engineering terms. The General Assembly also had an important proposal, proposed by eleven branches including Shanghai, recommending that the government should have domestic engineers or engineering institutions preside over important projects and engineering designs. The General Assembly specially invited Engineer Hu Ruixiang, who had just returned from the United States, to explain this. He said: "Regarding the use of special funds for US aid construction, the government signed a contract with the United States, which must be supervised by them, and the aid recipients have all spontaneously invited consultants or engineering technicians from major US engineering companies. In fact, the government agreement does not have this stipulation, so if a bad precedent is set, the status of Chinese engineers will decline and become irreversible, which will also damage national interests," etc. After enthusiastic speeches from various members, it was decided to present a request to the Executive Yuan, ordering the US Aid Council and aid recipients to handle the matter in accordance with the original proposal. The General Assembly also passed a resolution to pay tribute to Taiwanese engineers.

[Another Cable] At this morning's General Assembly of the Engineers Association, chaired by Yun Zhen, a joint special topic discussion was held: (1) Yang Qing gave a lecture on "Taiwan's Construction and Coordination with the Mainland," and (2) Yan Yancun gave a lecture on the possibility of industrial development in Taiwan.

(2) The fuel oil quota for ships is too small, and ships are forced to reduce the number of trips, affecting transportation. (3) The ticket price is frozen at the August 5th figure, which is less than half of the cost, resulting in excessive losses and difficulty in maintaining operations. (4) Foreign exchange is not available for ship parts, materials, insurance, etc., making repairs and operations extremely difficult. (5) There are too many passengers who do not buy tickets, and the ships must provide free meals, the order is extremely bad, and the military police's crackdown is ineffective, making passenger ship operations particularly difficult, leading to a crisis in passenger transport. After the representatives earnestly stated the above points, President Weng and others promised to quickly find a solution to maintain shipping.

### China and Britain Propose Joint Recommendation Urging Jewish Troops to Withdraw from Occupied Areas If They Refuse, Sanctions Will Be Considered

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 28th Broadcast: After the representatives of various countries in the Security Council spoke and debated the Sino-British proposal on the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Soviet representative, Malik, requested time to consider the proposal and suggested that the Security Council postpone the vote until the next meeting. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, proposed postponing the vote for two days. When Manuilsky's suggestion was put to a vote, the result was four votes in favor, four votes against, and three abstentions. Chairman Austin announced that there was no need to postpone the vote for two days. Finally, Malik proposed adjourning the meeting until the 29th, and with no objections, Austin announced that the meeting would be adjourned until the next day for voting.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] The Chinese and British delegations submitted a proposal to the Security Council on the 28th, requesting that the Jewish side be ordered to withdraw from the newly occupied territories in the Negev area. If refused, possible economic and political penalties on both sides would be considered immediately. A spokesperson for the US delegation said that the United States would support this proposal. The proposal requires: (1) Israeli and Egyptian forces should withdraw simultaneously and restore the pre-war status of the Negev region; (2) The Security Council's subsidiary committee should consider possible economic and diplomatic penalties against any party that refuses to withdraw its troops. When British representative Jebb presented this proposal, he warned that the Security Council could not allow the Jewish side to maintain the territory it had captured in the Negev area. Jebb spoke after a report by UN Special Mediator for the Holy Land, Bunche. He said that the Security Council could not ignore the recent Negev war. He criticized Jewish military action in the Negev, saying that the Security Council could not allow it to maintain its newly occupied territories, and the Security Council could not appear weak and incompetent, as this might lead to the recurrence of a full-scale conflict. In his report, Bunche also warned the Security Council that the situation in the Negev had jeopardized the Holy Land truce. He urged the Jewish side to withdraw from its new occupied territories in the Negev and urged the Security Council to take action to ease the situation. Bunche and Jebb engaged in a heated debate with Israeli representative Eban, but Eban did not indicate that the Israeli army was prepared to withdraw from the Negev. He said, "Restoring Egypt's position would be the greatest chaos in the world. Every Egyptian soldier in Palestine is a symbol of violation of the UN Charter." The joint Sino-British proposal would be the first step in possible forceful measures.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 28th] According to the official announcement on the 28th, Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok invited Egypt to peace talks to resolve all differences. This invitation was sent to Israeli representative Eban in Paris, who then passed it on to the Egyptian representatives attending the UN General Assembly.

### Hope for Resolving Berlin Problem is Dim Soviet Attitude Remains Tough Stalin Accuses West of Inciting War

[Our Dispatch] Moscow, 28th Broadcast: Stalin, in answering questions from a Pravda reporter regarding the Berlin dispute, said, "The instigators of a new war will inevitably suffer a crushing defeat.

### Foreign Minister Wang Discusses Sino-British Relations Deeply Believes that the Suppression of the Rebellion Will Not Divide China

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] On the eve of our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's arrival here, The Times published a half-page report by its correspondent at the United Nations, interviewing Wang. The report stated that Wang has been extremely concerned about the construction problems in the United Kingdom since he led a Chinese delegation to visit the United Kingdom during the war, and now expects that there will be a great future for Sino-British trade. Wang said: The economic recovery of the United Kingdom and the political attitude shown by the British government towards the people of Asia have left an excellent impression in China. British people currently staying in China are more likely to be well-liked than British people staying in China at any time in the history of Sino-British relations. In terms of economy, the prices of high-quality British goods sold in China are lower than those from other places. In terms of politics, the various actions of the British government in the past three or four years have left a deep impression not only on Chinese intellectuals and businessmen, but also on the majority of the Chinese people. Wang then discussed the problems in China and asked Westerners to correct their mistaken notion that China would be divided into two countries in the current anti-communist struggle. Wang said that he personally firmly believed that China would not be divided. Wang said: After thirteen years of conflict with Japan over the Northeast issue, the national consciousness of the Chinese people has become extremely strong. He did not believe that communism could suppress this kind of consciousness, and said that the personality and tradition of the Chinese people made it extremely difficult for communism to take root in the hearts of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the treatment suffered by the Chinese people in the communist-controlled areas has made them automatically oppose communism. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people who have been forced to flee from the communist areas are beginning to organize themselves spontaneously, hoping to fight back to their homeland. This movement is rapidly expanding. Wang believed that Chinese communist theory is no different from Western European communist theory, and believed that not only are the revolts of Eastern communists related to each other, but these revolts are also closely related to Western strikes. All communist actions are not accidental, but will contribute to a major offensive. This situation must be prevented.

### 9,000 US Marine, Army, and Air Force Personnel Conduct Landing Exercise The Scale Exceeds World War II

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The United States recently conducted the largest "Army, Navy, and Air Force" joint exercise since the war at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, with 9,000 people and 500 aircraft participating. The purpose is to instill the strategies and tactics of World War II into officers of senior military academies. The exercise included a landing operation under a joint land, air, and sea offensive. First, the air force bombed, followed by the naval artillery roar, and then the landing of parachute troops and amphibious troops to establish a beachhead, resembling a reenactment of the Normandy landing. The weapons, artillery, and aircraft used in the exercise were the same as those in World War II, but the following weapons have recently been introduced: (1) Jet aircraft. (2) 4,000-pound earthquake bombs dropped from B-29 Superfortresses, twice as heavy as the largest bombs used in World War II. (3) Jet-powered B-45 Superfortress, with a speed of 450 miles per hour. Only one of these aircraft participated in this exercise. (4) 12-inch rockets, which appeared at the end of the war but were only available in small numbers. These rockets are mounted on F-82 twin-barrel fighters "like a tiger with wings." (5) Some aimable rocket launchers and aimable bombs.

Undersecretary of the Navy Edes, in New Orleans, said: The US fleet in the Mediterranean is ready to act at any time and can react faster than any aggression that occurs in the region.

At the same time, the worker resumption movement has been increasing in the southern and central provinces of France today.

### The United States is Deliberately Considering Joining the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty Political and Military Authorities Advocate a Term of Five Years

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference this morning, "The US government has not yet discussed the issue of the North Atlantic security system, but the semi-official planning for this issue has concrete results. This result may enable the US government to make a quick decision on the North Atlantic security issue. After the signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty submit concrete proposals to the US government, the US government can propose a final answer regarding US aid, but this will still take considerable time, because all departments of the US government must have deliberate discussions.

### The Authorities Today Allocated a Large Amount of Yarn and Cloth in Exchange for 500,000 Shi of Rice and Wheat Each Expected to be Completed within 20 Days for the Next Month's Rationing

In order to smooth the source of grain and strengthen the supply, the authorities decided to allocate 6,000 pieces of yarn and 60,000 bolts of cloth to the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee to exchange for grain. The batch of materials can be received by the Grain Purchase Committee today, and will be transported to the production areas by the Agricultural Bank of China, the Jiangsu Agricultural Bank, and the Cooperative Treasury. The exchange ratio is 40% in kind and 60% in cash. It is estimated that 500,000 shi of rice and wheat can be exchanged for the next month's rationing in this city. The exchange work is expected to be completed within 20 days.

Regarding the October rationing in this city, in addition to the 290,000 shi that have already been distributed, the remaining 260,000 shi are scheduled to be sold on the 10th of next month and have been arriving in batches up to date. The Grain Storage Committee's allocation plan has been largely completed. However, the biggest difficulty at present is that although the source of grain has been arranged, it is difficult to transport it to Shanghai as planned due to the obstruction of the local authorities. In recent days, the Grain Storage Committee has received dozens of telegrams from various production areas, all stating that even with the release certificates from the competent authorities, they are still unable to transport the grain. This is the main reason why the rice supply for households in this city is not continuous. In order to ensure that the people's food supply is worry-free in the future, the unreasonable phenomenon of local authorities acting independently must be eliminated.

### Economic Police Brigade Cracks Two Major Gold and Foreign Currency Cases Involving International Backgrounds; Three Foreign and Chinese Suspects Detained

[Our Report] The Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade cracked two major black market gold and foreign currency cases yesterday, one of which involved an international background. The total amount of U.S. dollars seized in both cases was approximately over 10,000. Out of caution, the brigade has refrained from releasing any information until the investigation of both cases is concluded. However, according to reliable sources, prior to the crackdowns, Chinese and foreign personnel were mobilized to investigate, but were initially unable to proceed due to the involvement of certain parties.

### Cleveland Receives Reporters and Reviews ECA's Aid to China, Aiding the Chinese People to Improve Living Conditions

[Our Report] Mr. Cleveland, the Director of the China Program of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), has been in China for four weeks to inspect the work of the ECA's China Mission. Yesterday morning, Mr. Cleveland held his first press conference at the Cathay Hotel in this city. Mr. Stulman, the Director of the ECA's Industrial Construction and Accessories Survey Group, and Mr. Griffin, the Acting Director of the ECA's China Mission, were also present. After delivering his written statement, Mr. Cleveland answered reporters' questions, saying, "The ECA's current aid programs to China will not be delayed or changed due to the current changes in the domestic situation in China. The American aid work should still be promoted as much as possible in the areas under the current jurisdiction of the Chinese government."

Mr. Cleveland also stated, "So far, the ECA has not engaged in any direct negotiations with local governments or authorities in China. Everything is still concentrated on contacting the central government of China."

Mr. Stulman, in answering reporters' questions, stated: (1) The funds for the restoration of the Panyang Power Plant have not yet been allocated, and the plant has not yet hired engineers. However, the plant's restoration plan will proceed according to the planned steps. (2) The ECA is currently investigating the possible supply and prices of antimony, tungsten, and tin, etc., to be purchased in China.

The following is a summary of Mr. Cleveland's remarks:

Striving to Promote Work Goals

Mr. Cleveland pointed out at the meeting that half of the $204,000,000 allocated for the purchase of goods has been handled, and approximately $100,000,000 worth of goods have already arrived in China. He said that in the industrial sector, $70,000,000 has been allocated for accessories and construction plans, of which $60,000,000 has been handled. In addition, $275,000,000 has been allocated for rural construction. The U.S. Congress has allocated a total of $275,000,000 for the ECA to carry out aid to China within a year.

Mr. Cleveland, after inspecting the various activities of the ECA in China for the past four weeks, emphasized that the ECA is currently making every effort to promote its work goals in China, which is "to help the Chinese people, through the Chinese government, improve their lives as much as possible, and to enable the Chinese people to form an environment in which they can live and work."

We firmly believe that all plans and controls established in the implementation are to enable the ECA's funds to obtain the highest value in the following uses: to assist the Chinese people and various institutions, and to support the Chinese government in increasing production and stabilizing the economic situation. However, the current situation in China makes it impossible for us to measure the progress of the ECA's plan solely by the narrow effects obtained by direct beneficiaries. Moreover, the effects it brings—that is, the entire contribution of the ECA and other factors that promote the overall situation—are even more encouraging.

Two Principles of Aid Programs

Ultimately, an aid program can only produce a small effect in the country it is mandated to assist. Therefore, when implementing the aid to China program, we particularly adhere to the following two principles:

(1) The prices and exchange rates related to the aid program must be realistic. The allocated goods must be sold at prices stipulated by market conditions. The same applies to cotton textiles and petroleum products. This principle also applies to coal, electricity, or any other enterprise that directly or indirectly receives ECA aid. It should be known that aid programs are inherently different from subsidy programs.

(2) In order for the Chinese people to generally benefit from the aid program, the ECA must ensure that its aid serves as a supplement to the Chinese government's production and supply of materials, rather than a substitute. This is the "self-help principle" repeatedly emphasized by Mr. Lapham.

The fate of the ECA's aid to China program will naturally depend on the development of the current situation in China. Our purpose of aiding China is still to assist the Chinese people through the Chinese government, to improve their living conditions in any possible way, and to help them create an environment for survival and work.

### Zhan Peilin and Zhan Yutian, Suspected of Hoarding Paper, Indicted by Special Criminal Court

[Our Report] Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the Paper Industry Association, and his brother Zhan Yutian were arrested by the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau and transferred to the Special Criminal Court for hoarding and profiteering. The case has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Zhu Cheng and was prosecuted yesterday. The following is an excerpt from the original indictment: "The defendant Zhan Peilin opened the Yiji Xinghao Paper Store and is also the chairman of the Shanghai Paper Industry Association. He hoarded a large amount of paper and stored it in his own warehouse. (1) 2,532 pieces of various sizes of paper were stored on the third floor of 21, Lane 131, Guangdong Road. (2) Approximately 1,130 pieces of various sizes of paper were stored at 5, Lane 135, Jiangxi Road. (3) Approximately 1,000 reams of various sizes of paper were stored at the sales department at 127 Shandong Road. (4) 504 reams of white paper were stored in the Fuxing Bank at 137 Guangdong Road, totaling 3,662 pieces and another 1,504 reams. In addition, 725 pieces of paper were stored on behalf of the Maotai Enterprise Company of Hankou Road. The defendant Zhan Yutian opened the Yizhong Paper Mill and hoarded 870 rolls of various paper blanks, with another 200 rolls stored in the transportation warehouse. The Shanghai Police Bureau's Economic Brigade has confirmed the facts. In addition to ordering the above-mentioned paper to be kept in custody, the defendants were arrested and transferred to the court for investigation.

### Applicable Legal Articles

Evidence and applicable legal articles: The defendant Zhan Peilin admitted to storing the above-mentioned paper, but insisted that he had no hoarding or profiteering behavior. However, according to the defendant's confession during the interrogation, the paper was purchased after the victory, one or two years ago. Since the victory, due to speculation and profiteering by illegal merchants, prices have fluctuated rapidly. The defendant stored a large amount of paper, failing to supply the needs, which undoubtedly violated the government's control of daily necessities. Although the defendant Zhan Yutian claimed that the raw materials could only supply three months and that there was no hoarding behavior, the Economic Police Brigade reported that the factory could only produce more than ten reams of paper per day due to equipment and electricity limitations. Therefore, the quantity of stored raw materials far exceeded the amount needed for three months. Therefore, it can be determined.

### Regulations for Foreign Exchange Asset Management - Two Points Amended and Supplemented by the Ministry of Finance

[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously formulated four regulations regarding the number of foreign exchange assets that holders are allowed to retain, and these have been announced and implemented. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has drafted two supplementary measures, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The contents are as follows:

(1) The salaries and special office expenses earned monthly by Chinese government personnel stationed abroad (including those in national banks) from September of this year onwards, are exempt from registration and transfer.

(2) For nationals of the Republic of China residing abroad, their foreign exchange deposits, in addition to being handled according to the Central Bank's regulations on foreign currency deposits and payments, may be drawn upon with the approval of the respective embassies and consulates if the retained amount is insufficient for expenses or other urgent and legitimate needs. However, applications for withdrawal of deposits by the responsible person themselves should be reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval, and each consulate should submit a list of approved cases in duplicate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification by the Ministry of Finance.

### Matters Concerning Capital Increase of Native Banks - Ministry of Finance and Taxation Moderately Relaxing Standards

[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Central Bank regarding the opinions presented by the National Federation of Native Bank Associations concerning the adjustment of capital for native banks, the payment of exchange guarantee deposits, and the issue of interest rates on arrears. The approved measures are as follows:

(A) (1) The minimum capital amount for native banks in each region should still be in accordance with the original regulations and cannot be changed.

(2) The deadline for capital increase is still limited to two months, but the start of the deadline shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the legal enforcement date regulations.

(3) The regulation that the entire amount of cash increase must be stored in the Central Bank for three months should still be handled in accordance with the original regulations. In the future, if each native bank has a legitimate purpose and requests not to use it, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations on the use of funds. If the cash increase portion exceeds 50%, the use of the exceeding portion will be approved by the Ministry on a more lenient basis. The funds stored in the Central Bank will also be allowed to pay interest in accordance with the deposit reserve requirements. In areas where there is no Central Bank branch, the local branch will negotiate with the Central Bank to handle it.

(4) (1) For the asset appreciation portion purchased after 1938, the national wholesale price index for June 1948 in the original calculation formula should be recalculated to the first half of August 1948, referring to Clause C of Item 4 of the Supplementary Measures for Fiscal Reorganization. (2) The original request to allow shareholders to use assets other than cash to offset the payment of shares cannot be approved. (3) When the remaining assets still have estimable value, they will be handled in accordance with the "Interpretation of Measures for Adjusting Capital of Commercial Banks."

(B) Regarding the issue of exchange guarantee deposits, the exchange guarantee deposits will still be paid in accordance with the regulations of the Central Bank, but during the capital adjustment period, they may be deducted from the amount of cash increase deposited in the Central Bank. The exchange guarantee deposit portion will not be returned after the three-month period.

(C) Regarding the issue of interest rates, a separate order will be issued. After the Central Bank receives the telegram, it has telegraphed its regional branches and offices to check accordingly.

### Frozen Egg Export Business Completely Stalled

According to news from frozen egg manufacturers yesterday, due to the August 19th price controls, various materials are flowing into the black market, and even at high prices, they cannot be purchased. The price of eggs has now risen to 2 jiao per egg, increasing costs and making it impossible to export. The UK has repeatedly ordered frozen eggs from our country and hopes to increase supply. However, the UK only offers a price of £210 per ton of frozen eggs, which translates to over 2,500 Gold Yuan. However, the total cost of producing one ton of frozen eggs is currently around 5,000 yuan. If frozen eggs are sold to the UK, each ton will result in a loss of 2,500 yuan, and the government cannot subsidize it. Therefore, our country's frozen egg industry is currently in a state of complete standstill.

### Funds Flowing South in Large Quantities - Total Reaching Five Million Gold Yuan

After the announcement of the measures for clearing imports of goods ordered abroad with payments already made, merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach due to domestic price controls and are not importing. However, recently there has been much talk of negotiated prices, and merchants in general are excited again. According to insiders, major merchants have been selling goods and accumulating Gold Yuan, but they cannot restock. However, rumors of changing to negotiated prices are rampant, and large amounts of real gold are flowing south. In the past few days, the outflow of funds to the south has suddenly increased, estimated to be around five million Gold Yuan. It is generally speculated that there are two destinations: one is to exchange the funds for foreign currency after going south to maintain the value of the currency, and the other is to order large quantities of goods in Hong Kong and Macau and then import them. Although the current measures for clearing imports of goods ordered abroad with payments already made are limited to orders placed before August 19th, merchants can still find ways to obtain invoices before August 19th after purchasing goods in Hong Kong and other places and can apply for import. This not only maintains the value of the currency but also allows for profit.

### Construction and Building Textile Company Starts Selling Cotton Cloth - Applications Still Very Enthusiastic

Yesterday, the Construction and Building Textile Company opened the distribution of cotton cloth as usual, including 12-pound Longtou B-grade fine cloth, priced at 25.9 yuan per bolt, and Jinlian Miaowu Yuan wool crepe, priced at 27.6 yuan per bolt. Second-grade printed colored tops were priced at 18.8 yuan per bolt, all limited to purchase at retail stores. Second-grade 30-yard wool crepe greige was priced at 23.8 yuan per bolt, limited to application by dye factories. There was also American cloth 013 printed cloth, priced at 1.1 yuan per meter, and 012 printed pongee, priced at 1.4 yuan per meter, and 014-11 printed twill, priced at 1.5 yuan per meter, all limited to application by retail stores. There were also cotton wool shirts and pants, Jianguo hemp yarn, etc., and many people applied to purchase them.

Also, the Cotton Cloth Association, acting as the agent for the dyeing industry's fourth phase, second batch of cloth distribution, had a total of only 9,860 bolts. There were 1,343 applicants, and each household was allocated 10 bolts. The remaining number of households was eliminated by lottery. Therefore, 986 households obtained cloth distribution in this phase, including 10 households whose applications were rejected due to non-compliance with purchase regulations, and another 347 households were eliminated by lottery. They will have priority in the next phase of distribution.

### Silk Farmers Use Autumn Cocoons to Reel Earthen Silk - Purchase Work Difficult to Start

This year's autumn cocoon purchase in Liangzhe (Zhejiang) is difficult to start because the authorities set the price too low. Generally, silk farmers believe that the price is insufficient to cover costs, and they mostly reel earthen silk. After selling the finished product using the old method, they can still obtain ideal profits compared to selling to the government. Therefore, this year's autumn cocoon purchase work is not as satisfactory as expected.

According to information from the silk industry, the global supply of raw silk is now turning scarce. Although countries such as the UK, the US, and France all hope that our country will increase exports, the prices offered are too low, and domestic prices are rising everywhere. The raw materials allocated to each factory are very few. Currently, it is already difficult to purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt to raise labor and food, and it is impossible to expand exports. Therefore, the export prospects for silk fabrics are not optimistic.

### Rice Arrivals Slightly Increased - Retail Sales Overcrowded

Rice arrivals have slightly increased. The North and South city markets have a total of 2,209 dan (石) of rice, with 1,276 dan arriving at the South city market and 933 dan arriving at the North city market. Most of the arrivals are indica rice. Although there are no transactions in the market, market quotations have not changed. Rice store retail sales are extremely crowded, so even though there is a slight supply to the market, it is quickly bought empty.

Grain transactions are completely stalled. Gold is still not being distributed. Inventory owners hope to exchange for industrial products first and then exchange for soybeans in the production areas to be shipped to Shanghai.

### Tea Market Quiet but Firm

Yesterday, the market for black and green tea, which has been traded for a long time, still did not see a recovery. The reason is that dealers are aware that goods in the production areas are scarce and prices are high, and it is increasingly difficult to purchase all the subsidiary raw materials for reproducing boxed tea. Therefore, their attitude is even more reluctant to part with them, and the supply is becoming more and more elusive. Although traders still come to think and want to make a profit, they ultimately find it difficult to find a single leaf, and the process is difficult to clarify. The market atmosphere is quiet but firm. According to news from local shops, since the panic buying trend occurred in Taishi (太市), all industries have felt a shortage of demand, and tea is no exception. Therefore, all shops are currently planning to increase stocks to meet retail sales.

### Tight Credit - High Black Market Interest Rates Unprecedented

Yesterday, the credit market in the city remained tight. As the end of the month approaches, the market demand is eager. The market interest rate rose to 2 jiao 7 fen, with the highest reaching beyond 3 jiao, which is unprecedented since the currency system reform. Many industry banks and shops are short of funds, and turnover is very difficult.

### Subsidizing Farmers' Losses by Purchasing Cotton and Distributing Gauze

Regarding the issue of cotton farmers in the production areas being unwilling to sell raw cotton at controlled prices and spinning earthen yarn themselves, the cotton spinning industry in this city is paying close attention to this. It has recently been learned from the Joint Cotton Purchase Office that they have already taken effective countermeasures to avoid affecting the purchase of raw cotton. In addition to distributing gauze in the purchase price category to increase cotton farmers' profits, they will also telegraph local governments to assist in persuasion. According to the people at the Cotton Purchase Office, the reason why cotton farmers are unwilling to sell raw cotton at the prescribed price is that the gap between the purchase price and the price of daily necessities is too large. Therefore, the situation can be improved after adopting a partial barter system in the future.

### This Week's Rayon Distribution Temporarily Suspended - China Trust Bureau Maintains Controlled Price

The China Trust Bureau's Italian barter rayon has been shipped in succession to 4,400 boxes. Some customs clearance procedures have not yet been completed, and this week's distribution is temporarily suspended. The 240 boxes scheduled to be distributed on the 27th will also be distributed next time. As for the distribution price, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the distribution price will definitely maintain the August 19th controlled price, and the finished products manufactured by the manufacturers should also be sold at the controlled price. There is no reason for the reseller stores to increase prices. As for the black market that has occurred in the market, it is beyond the bureau's power. It is hoped that the competent authorities will crack down on it. Also, 2,200 boxes of Italian rayon will arrive at the port on the 29th.

Also, the raw silk market is sluggish abroad, hovering around US$3 per pound. Domestic black market price is surging, converting to 1,530 Gold Yuan per dan, while the actual cost is over 2,000. The black market exceeds the actual cost by a factor of one. Therefore, raw silk exports are extremely difficult, and export business has been suspended. According to industry authorities, the foreign demand for our raw silk is more urgent in the winter, and it will definitely turn firm and strong at that time, so the future is still optimistic.

### Linghu Construction

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 26th] Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Chen Gongxia said to the people of Linghu: "The direction of Linghu's current construction is correct. I hope you continue to do well and become a model for Zhejiang Province."

Linghu is a town under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County. In the old administrative system, it governed fourteen surrounding townships, called the Linghu District. The entire district covers an area of approximately 225 square kilometers, with a population of over 120,000. Waterways crisscross the area, and the people are mostly engaged in agriculture, with silk being the most important product. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total area of mulberry fields in the district reached over 50,000 mu, with a total of over 15 million mulberry trees. Before 1926, the total amount of raw silk could reach about 8,000 loads. Other major products included fish, water chestnuts, and wool. During the Anti-Japanese War, Linghu became the site of the most intense guerrilla warfare due to the favorable waterway terrain. Agricultural production declined, and the town's commerce plummeted. Half of the town's houses were destroyed by artillery fire. The population sharply decreased, with only over 8,000 people remaining in Linghu town.

A New Beginning

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Pan Gongzhan, a native of Linghu in Shanghai, aspired to revive his hometown. With the efforts of Zhang Rongchu, a businessman in Shanghai, the small town of Linghu was revitalized.

Linghu began its new construction in October 1946. They first established a Linghu Construction Association in Shanghai. Then, Zhang Rongchu funded the construction of factories, schools, and other large-scale new buildings, and began to operate various businesses.

Regarding the agricultural sector, in 1946, the association purchased 700,000 mulberry seedlings and gave them to farmers unconditionally, and also provided improved silkworm eggs. In 1946, 14,000 sheets were given away completely, and 6,000 sheets in the autumn were also given away completely. In the spring of 1947, 25,000 sheets were provided, charging a nominal cost. In the autumn, 5,000 sheets were given away completely. In the spring of 1948, 60,000 sheets were provided, charging a nominal cost, and in the autumn, 13,000 sheets were offered at a 30% discount based on cost. To help poor farmers, they also provided silkworm egg loans, cash loans, and rice loans, and also sent people to provide free guidance on joint rearing of silkworms, and shared nurturing of young silkworms.

Fisheries Sector

Regarding the fisheries sector, the Linghu District Fish Farming Production Improvement Association was established, with thirteen sub-associations. The number of members has increased from 500 to over 1,300. They also negotiated low-interest loans with the Farmers Bank of China, totaling 130 million yuan in legal tender, and negotiated interest-free loans with the Central Fisheries Laboratory, totaling 180 million yuan in legal tender. They also collectively purchased a large number of fish fry. For fish farming techniques, the Central Fisheries Laboratory sent personnel to strengthen guidance on improvement in conjunction with the association. Due to low-interest loans and research guidance, production has increased dramatically. In 1945, 50,000 mature fish were transported and sold to other places, while in 1947, this number reached 137,498. Recently, 70 million fish fry were also transported. Regarding farmland water conservancy, 28 sections of embankments have been repaired, a rice cultivation experimental farm has been established, and 20 small water pumps have been purchased. Regarding the industrial sector, the Linghu Silk Reeling Factory has 250 kilowatts of electricity. In addition to supplying the silk reeling factory, it also supplies electricity to the entire town. There is also a chemical acid manufacturing plant that produces calcium carbonate using anthracite coal and tender stones from Dongting Mountain. The product is Hongji brand precipitated calcium carbonate, used as raw materials for manufacturing cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other products. Another product is Lanji brand, used as raw materials for manufacturing rubber, paper, paint, ink, and other products. The monthly output is 5,000 bags, which are transported and sold to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, and other places. The factory employs 175 workers.

Silk Reeling Factory Situation

The silk reeling factory began operations in June of this year. The current equipment includes three boilers, one multi-layer drying machine, and 408 vertical silk reeling machines. The source of fresh cocoons is the silkworm eggs supplied by the association. In the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, the factory purchases them with its own funds. Starting in the autumn of 1948, the factory implemented a system of encouraging farmers to exchange fresh cocoons for factory silk, in order to eliminate the reeling of local silk. The current daily output is about 8 loads. However, many Linghu farmers are still accustomed to old habits and still make their own local silk, unwilling to exchange cocoons for factory silk. Therefore, the factory may not be able to operate year-round. If it were to operate year-round, for eleven months, it would need over 26,000 piculs of fresh cocoons. The factory also has a plan to convert local silk to factory silk, and is currently experimenting with implementation. The factory employs 1,009 workers.

Farms, Etc.

There is also a stone powder factory, which is smaller in scale, that grinds white stone into white powder for rice milling and cosmetics manufacturing. It currently produces over 20 tons per day. Regarding the education sector, there is the Qing Shu Middle School, with over 50 faculty and staff members, 122 middle school students, and 1,084 elementary school students. All students are exempt from tuition fees. The school's funds come from 600 mu of Ikeda land and funds deposited at the Wuxing County Bank, as well as monthly donations from Yi Rongchu. Other facilities, such as farms and hospitals, have also been established. The farm has a total area of over 740 mu and employs 42 workers. It raised over 300 pigs, but unfortunately, they died due to swine fever and improper care. Other businesses are in the trial stage. The hospital is temporary, and a permanent Qing Shu Hospital is under construction. According to Zhang Rongchu, he also wants to improve the town's streets. He originally wanted to build some houses first, move the old street shops there, and then demolish the streets to widen them and build new roads with new-style houses before moving them back. However, some people in the local area do not agree with this, so it is still under consideration. There is also the Linghu Lingshan Park, designed by Ms. Tang Guanwang, which is currently under construction.

Overcoming Obstacles

During our half-day visit to Linghu, we saw the tall, spacious, new-style factory and school buildings, which made us admire the spirit of the hard-working builders. The builders first started by improving rural life and rural economic conditions, and then developed industry, which was especially gratifying to us. However, according to Yu Shuluan, the district commissioner who went with us, "Mr. Zhang encountered opposition from local people when he first started his business. Some even gathered crowds to throw rocks into Mr. Zhang's house. Now that the business has been established and society has recognized the benefits, there are still many people who are taking a wait-and-see attitude or are not very happy." Yes, we know that there are many obstacles to starting a business, and it takes perseverance to overcome them. However, we are even more eager for Mr. Zhang to use his generosity to call on those who oppose and are indifferent to join the Rongjian Association organization, so that they understand that this is also their own business and have the opportunity to speak and make suggestions. This may lead to smoother development.

[Our Dispatch] The Jinhua City Defense Command has decided to establish itself on November 1st. It is rumored that the commander will be concurrently held by Zhou Zhenqiang, commander of the Western Zhejiang Garrison District.

Songjiang

[Our Dispatch] The county's conscription and grain borrowing have not been completed as scheduled. Conscription is difficult because the settlement fee exceeds the prescribed amount, so it is difficult to raise funds. Therefore, statistics show that the county is short of 2/10 of the quota. Pre-borrowed military grain is also short because there is no rice available for purchase locally. According to the price limit, each city stone of brown rice is 16.3 yuan. Purchasing from other places is impossible due to the large price difference. Therefore, the shortage is still far from the allotted 15,000 stones. Currently, efforts are being made to supervise the situation separately.

Yixing

[Our Dispatch] Recently, the government has purchased a large amount of firewood and grass, causing much public concern. County Magistrate Li solemnly stated that the county is organizing the collection of firewood and grass under the command of Wuxi. Eleven counties are doing this at the same time. Some unscrupulous people are intentionally spreading rumors to disturb the people. Investigators have been dispatched to investigate and severely punish them in accordance with military law.

### The World of Cotton - Nantong, 24th

— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu

The Evil Wind of Hoarding

Yarn and Nantong people have a special relationship. The Nantong Yarn Industry Association has over 900 members, but only two-thirds are actually engaged in the yarn business. Walking on the streets of Nantong, you can see that porcelain shops, cloth shops, or electrical supply stores also have signs that say "×× Yarn Shop," but you can't see a single bag of yarn in the store. Most strangely, almost every family in Nantong has yarn. Wealthy shareholders hoard yarn, and even a civil servant will use their hard-earned monthly salary to buy yarn. Rickshaw pullers and barbers also use their savings to buy yarn. If the head of the household doesn't have yarn, the wife might have it. If the wife doesn't have it, the maid might have it. The main reason for this phenomenon is that prices have fluctuated too drastically in the past. Everyone is afraid that the money will depreciate if kept at home, so they have to buy materials. Buying rice and grain can lead to worms and mold, and buying other things is inconvenient to store or difficult to sell immediately. Only cotton yarn is the most convenient. If you need money today, you can sell it immediately. Not only are city people like this, but many families in nearby rural areas with a little extra money also hoard yarn. After the currency reform, this phenomenon may improve somewhat. Some families have already sold some to meet their daily needs. However, it is estimated that there are at least 12,000 households inside and outside the six towns of Nantong. Even if each household stores one bag of yarn, the total is 12,000 bags, or 300 bales.

Supply of Yarn

What is the supply situation of yarn? In the past, 70% was supplied by the Dasheng No. 1 Factory and the remaining 30% by Jiangnan. Now, no yarn comes north from Jiangnan, so it is completely dependent on the Dasheng Factory. According to Deputy Factory Director Si, the two factories can produce 140 bales of yarn per day, of which 40 bales must be reserved for their own weaving. Of the remaining 100 bales, 50 bales must be shipped to Shanghai for the government's commissioned spinning. Therefore, only 50 bales can be allocated to the market. On weekdays, this number is sufficient to maintain the market's needs, but now, during the peak season for local cloth, the supply is insufficient. In the past week, it has been rare to see a bag of yarn placed on the shelves of yarn shops "for sale." The shopkeepers say beautifully: "Sold out, waiting for allocation!" In fact, in addition to a portion that has been sold to local cloth weaving households, the rest has been "transferred." Recently, during the material registration, many yarn shops only reported storing ten or twenty small bags of yarn. Is this really all they have? The Fuda Yarn Shop outside the South Gate only registered 50 small bags. The Iron Construction Team received a tip and searched the shop on the eve of Double Ten Day, and found that the yarn stored exceeded the registered amount. Merchants are clever, they pile up cotton yarn to make a bed to cover it.

Since there is no yarn on the market, the weaving households buy the cloth and are unwilling to be idle for a day. They go everywhere to find yarn. If it is not available on the market, they go to the merchants in the back streets and alleys who do not sell yarn, or to the residents who do not open stores. They buy it back at a price higher than the limit price in order to earn a small profit. Of course, there are inevitably "scalpers" taking advantage of the situation.

Unpopular Local Cloth

Local cloth is a major product of Nantong. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is considered the peak season. Recently, because Fujian, Taiwan, and Ningbo merchants have come to Nantong to lower prices and buy in bulk (there is no price limit on local cloth), and because local cloth is not on the list of prohibited goods, speculators in Shanghai have been taking advantage of this unpopular item, using local cloth as an intermediary to escape to Taiwan or Southeast Asia. This has caused the price of local cloth to rise sharply by 30% to 50%, creating a special boom in the quantity of products. The sharp increase in the number of local cloth products has led to a sharp increase in the demand for yarn, causing a major yarn shortage panic. It is said that this also involves a work of procurement by the bandit army. From autumn to winter, the bandit army needs a large number of fabrics to make winter clothes, so they encourage farmers to sell cloths with inappropriate widths for making winter clothes and extract cotton yarn, which is transported back to the rural areas to weave fabrics suitable for use by the bandits. This is also one of the reasons for the crowding in the cloth market.

Pay Attention to Loopholes

Yarn is closely linked to the cloth in Nantong. To break the current deformed relationship, we must crack down on hoarding on the one hand, and dredge the source of raw materials on the other hand. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the rationality of supply, so that there are no loopholes, and that there is no opportunity to profit from procurement. This is not only a matter of economic control, but also requires political and military cooperation for further progress.

As for silk cloth, wool, department stores, cigarettes, etc., they are all dependent on Shanghai. Although there is currently a "shortage," as long as concrete measures are taken for Shanghai's overall consumption and supply control, and merchants are given legitimate profits, the "shortage" phenomenon is not difficult to solve. Merchants calculate profits on the up and down, and unscrupulous profiteers do not hesitate to withdraw goods from the market and transfer them to the black market for profit. If they happen to meet a patron with a sentimental attachment to the past, they praise the black market goods and are grateful that no one is willing to report the "friend" who helped them, causing them to fall into prison. This makes the black market even more rampant. While the management authorities should punish merchants who sell on the black market, it seems that customers who buy black market goods should also be given appropriate punishment. Make the people know that anti-profiteering and stabilizing prices are their own business, and that they must all work together.
