### He Yingqin Possibly to Head the Executive Yuan; Intense Persuasion Continues Late into Last Night; Zhang Qun Takes Ten Days Leave and Flies from Nanjing to Chongqing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The selection of the new Premier of the Executive Yuan is receiving active attention from all sides. Political activities in the capital on the 21st also appeared to center on this issue. However, as of midnight, the selection of the Premier had not yet been finalized. Judging from the trends on the 21st, He Yingqin has a high possibility of assuming the post of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan under the constitutional government. However, Mr. He himself continues to express firm refusal, and various parties are currently engaged in intense persuasion. Zhang Qun's departure from Nanjing for Chongqing at noon on the 21st indicates his determination not to assume the post of the new Premier of the Executive Yuan. However, this does not necessarily mean that Mr. Zhang has no possibility of being nominated. Nevertheless, the results of the informal vote among Kuomintang legislators on the morning of the 21st confirmed that He Yingqin has already gained the support of a larger number of legislators. Mr. He's residence was crowded with visitors throughout the day on the 21st, and some legislators also visited him to urge him to form the new cabinet. However, Mr. He still followed his doctor's orders on the afternoon of the 21st and visited Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, only returning in the evening. When a reporter visited him at 11 p.m. on the 21st, Mr. He still stated that he had not considered this matter, and his will seemed very firm. The Legislative Yuan, which is awaiting the President's nomination of candidates for Premier so that it can discuss whether to agree, adjourned throughout the day on the 21st. No session has been scheduled for the morning of the 22nd. If the President's message of nomination for Premier can be submitted before noon on the 22nd, the Legislative Yuan will prepare to hold a plenary committee meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd so that it can be quickly approved. It is understood that Zhang Qun will stay in Chongqing for about a week. After the nomination of the new Premier is proposed and passed, he will still return to Nanjing to handle the handover of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke paid respects to the President three times on the 21st. When he paid respects at noon, he was accompanied by Wu Tiecheng to report on the opinions of the Kuomintang legislators' discussion meeting regarding the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Sun was also extremely busy throughout the day, and he was still meeting with Wu Tiecheng at midnight. The activities of Chen Lifu were all centered on the formation of the cabinet when he visited He Yingqin at 7 p.m.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Kuomintang legislators gathered at the Central Party Headquarters at 10 a.m. on the 21st to exchange views on the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. Sun Ke presided over the meeting and immediately reported that the President believed that the exercise of the right of consent approved by the Legislative Yuan on the 20th might be difficult to implement and hoped that the party members would make some remedies. Regarding the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the President had solicited the opinions of Zhang Qun and He Yingqin. Both Zhang and He expressed humility, so he also hoped that the party legislators could provide candidates for Premier for reference. Subsequently, the legislators spoke one after another. Some legislators believed that Article 55 of Chapter 8 "Exercise of the Right of Consent" of the Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan stipulates that "If the plenary committee meeting deems it necessary, it may request the President to notify the nominee to submit policy opinions," which can also be interpreted as not necessarily requiring the submission of policy opinions. In case of difficulty, the original provisions can still be used flexibly. As for the candidate issue, the legislators did not have strong objections to the two candidates, Zhang and He, proposed by the President. Sun Ke then proposed conducting a secret ballot to determine the opinions of each legislator. The legislators then proceeded with the vote. The results were not announced, but it was rumored that He Yingqin received the most votes, followed by Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng. This result will be reported by Sun Ke to the President for reference.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 21st] Zhang Qun, accompanied by Zhou Junliang, flew from Nanjing to Chongqing at 5 p.m. on the 21st. The purpose of his trip was to visit his 85-year-old mother, who has a leg condition. She recently broke her leg and came to Chongqing from Chengdu for treatment. Before leaving Nanjing, Mr. Zhang paid respects to President Chiang, who approved his ten-day leave. Executive Yuan affairs will be handled by Vice Premier Wang Yunwu. He firmly declined to organize the new cabinet and hopes that General He Yingqin will assume this important responsibility. Whether he will go to Chengdu is currently undecided.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Zhang Qun answered reporters' questions on the 21st regarding his return to Chongqing and the nomination of the first Premier of the Executive Yuan during the constitutional period: "I left Chongqing in February of last year and it has been 15 months since then. During this period, I am very pleased that the construction of the city has progressed rapidly due to the efforts of all parties. Over the past year, the Executive Yuan has had heavy tasks, and I feel physically and mentally exhausted. Three months ago, I suffered from tracheitis, which interfered with my sleep. Because I could not rest, it has not healed yet. Now that the constitutional government is about to begin and the Executive Yuan is about to be reorganized, my mother has arrived in Chongqing, and I very much hope to return home to visit her. Therefore, I asked the President for ten days of leave to return to Sichuan Province to visit my mother and rest briefly. After the leave, I will still return to Nanjing. During my absence from Nanjing, Executive Yuan affairs will be handled by Vice Premier Wang. Now that the country is undergoing a period of great change and the government is being reorganized, the people of the country are seeking new ideas and changes. The country's politics should adapt to this requirement and seek progress through change. The future tasks of the Executive Yuan will become increasingly heavy. I have felt very tired over the past year and my health has declined. I have firmly declined the nomination for Premier of the Executive Yuan."

Editorial

### Opposing Draper's Non-Reparations Theory

U.S. Under Secretary of the Army Royal issued a report on May 19th regarding Draper's inspection of Japan and Korea. The key points are as follows: First, Draper proposed reducing Japanese reparations to 165 million U.S. dollars. Second, he requested immediate large-scale economic aid to Japan to revitalize its production and develop its trade, especially emphasizing Sino-Japanese trade. After the release of this report, in addition to unanimous warm welcome from all sectors in Japan, it was attacked by relevant countries in the Far East. Wu Banchen, the head of our reparations team in Japan, issued a statement on the 20th, severely criticizing its absurd content. According to the New Asia News Agency in Tokyo, the U.S. State Department may not adopt the opinions in the report. However, regardless of the U.S. State Department's attitude, the blatant support for Japan in the "Draper Report" is a fact, and it is the most noticeable in a series of facts about the U.S. support for Japan. We in China cannot remain silent about this.

First, let's talk about the origin of the Draper Report. After the war, U.S. policy toward Japan was decided separately by the Department of the Army and the State Department. In recent years, the Department of the Army has been more dominant and has gained considerable decision-making power. For a period of time, the Japan policies of the Department of the Army and the State Department differed slightly. On February 26th of this year, the State Department suddenly announced the dispatch of policy committee member Kennan to Tokyo to investigate the situation in Japan. After Kennan returned home from his investigation, the newspapers did not mention a word about his views on Japan. Then, the Department of the Army sent Under Secretary of the Army Draper with a delegation, including some Japanese entrepreneurs, and they arrived in Tokyo on March 20th, went to Seoul on the 28th, and left Japan for the U.S. on April 2nd. Draper's activities in Japan, its grand scale and shocking discussions, turned into the "Factory of Asia" plan, causing Hitoshi Ashida and a thousand others to be overjoyed. The secretary of the current investigation team) drafted the report. Roundston is a member of the "Overseas Survey Association," and his views are the same as those of Strack: the United States must support Japan, reduce Japanese reparations, and develop Japanese industry and trade. Although we have not seen the full text of the Draper Report, we can judge by observing his person and his words that this report is nothing more than an extension and expansion of the Strack Report.

The Draper Report was released by Secretary of the Army Royal. In terms of authority, the Department of the Army does not have the authority to release this document. Since Royal resolutely released it, making it known to the world, the spirit of this report fully represents the intentions of the U.S. government, at least the intentions of the U.S. Department of the Army. As for the essence of this report, first, it is to reduce Japanese reparations to 165 million U.S. dollars, and it advocates that "Japanese assets abroad, such as assets in the Northeast, Taiwan, and other regions that have fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union and China, should be formally recognized and written off." It also states that machines and industrial equipment within Japanese military factories should be transferred for reparations under limited conditions. Second, the report advocates large-scale economic aid to Japan, because Japan currently lacks raw materials and food. If Japan's industrial level can be improved (the report points out that Japan's current industrial level is less than 45% of the 1930-34 average), all countries will trade with it. In the end, it will not only benefit Japan, but also benefit the United States and other countries. The recovery of Japan's economic life after disarmament will help increase opportunities to maintain peace in the Pacific and other regions." Third, the report strongly advocates the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade. It says: "If China and Japan can resume active trade, U.S. financial aid to the two countries can be used very effectively. China can sell various raw materials to benefit Japan, and Japan also has various commodities and equipment needed by China." Fourth, the report explains the importance of aid to South Korea and the unity of Japan and South Korea. Undoubtedly, the scope of the Draper Report is more in-depth and broader than the "Strack Report." It is full of strong political implications.

Next, let's talk about our views on the Draper Report. Judging from the main points of this report, the U.S. policy of supporting Japan has obviously undergone drastic changes. If the State Department also takes completely the same steps, then the efforts of the United Nations in the war against Japan and the spirit of the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission after the war will be completely in vain. The reparations requested by various countries in the Far East will immediately become nothing if implemented according to this report. Japan only needs to pay 165 million U.S. dollars in cash or use "assets" in the Northeast and Taiwan as compensation, and it can be safe and sound. This is a further step than Strack's anti-reparation theory. This not only violates the "in-kind reparations" spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, but also transfers "returned materials" to be used as reparations, misrepresenting the facts and completely eliminating the political significance of reparations. We do not agree with Strack's anti-reparation theory; we reject the "Draper Report's" non-reparation theory. We believe that it is very inappropriate to unilaterally support Japan before the peace treaty is concluded. The relevant countries in the Far East are feeling anxious about the U.S. policy of solely controlling Japan. If the U.S. government takes the "Draper Report" as the center of its policy toward Japan in the future, the countries in the Far East will turn from anxiety to fear. The reason why the countries in the Far East are unanimously attacking this report now is based on this cautionary psychology.

In short, the reparations, industrial level, and trade issues suggested in the "Draper Report" are mostly unreasonable opinions. It is more unreasonable than the suggestions in the Strack Report. Therefore, there have been rumors recently that the U.S. State Department will reject this report. We believe that most American politicians and diplomats are wise and decisive, and they will not easily adopt such absurd opinions. For the sake of China's own security, and also for the sake of the United States' position in the Far East, we still hope that the U.S. State Department will consider it carefully!

### China Does Not Adopt a Retaliatory Approach to Japan; Ashida Expresses Extreme Gratitude; If China Agrees, Japan is Willing to Send a Business Delegation to China; The Far East Commission Plans to Reduce Japan's Industrial Level

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida told the Central News Agency reporter today that the Chinese government's policy toward Japan as revealed in President Chiang's inaugural address, which reiterated China's lofty view of not adopting a retaliatory approach toward Japan, is extremely grateful to the Japanese people. Ashida said: President Chiang's statement revealed the hope for common cooperation between China and Japan. He pointed out that Japan is seeking to restore normal trade relations. Japan is currently sending business delegations to France, India, the United States, and South American countries. If there is any expression in China that welcomes such delegations, Japan will be willing to send a similar business delegation to China. Ashida also said: If the Chinese government invites Japanese cultural and scientific figures to visit China and cooperate with Chinese scientists and cultural leaders, Japan will immediately dispatch a delegation. Ashida said: Chairman Chiang's statement at the end of the war had created a profound impression among the entire Japanese people, but recent contrary remarks in Chinese newspapers have caused unease in Japan. President Chiang's reiteration of this policy at this time is when the Japanese people are most impressed by this policy. The reporter asked whether Japan expects Chinese imports to occupy an important position in the recently announced five-year economic recovery plan. Ashida replied: Even without the five-year plan, Japan would welcome Chinese iron sand, coking coal, industrial waste, and other raw materials. He also said: At the same time, China may also be willing to import certain kinds of industrial products from Japan.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that the Japanese government is preparing to re-establish diplomatic relations and free trade immediately after the signing of the peace treaty. Although it is not yet known when the peace treaty will be concluded, Japan must be prepared to restore diplomatic relations and free trade at any time. However, the establishment of consulates in foreign countries to protect the interests of the Japanese people is unlikely to be realized for quite some time.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission today began discussing the problem of Japan's post-war industrial water pond in order to instruct MacArthur to implement it. According to responsible sources, the draft instruction is virtually the same as the committee's temporary instruction several months ago, which designated approximately 1,000 factories for compensation. However, the temporary instruction was not implemented, and only a few mother machines were moved. The new instruction is virtually the same as the various suggestions made by the United States a year ago. The new instruction has been discussed in the committee's small groups for a year, but it was not submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion until today. The representatives said that they had consulted their respective governments several months ago, and some representatives are still awaiting replies, asking whether the Japanese industrial level stipulated in the new instruction is lower than that recommended by the US inspection teams after their independent inspection of Japan. Generally speaking, the United States tends to favor a higher level, allowing Japan to retain more mother machines for industrial recovery. The other Pacific allies favor a lower level to ensure that Japan cannot be militarily revived and to delay Japan's commercial recovery, lest Japan's economic recovery endanger the industrial development of their own countries.

### Britain Urges Opening of Various Conferences on Japan; Hopes that Fourteen Related Countries Will Participate; United States and Japan Pay Attention to China's Attitude

[Reuters, London, 20th] In his speech at the Labor Party's annual conference today, Foreign Secretary Bevin stated that in order to show its sincerity, the Soviet Union should immediately hold a Japanese peace conference with all related countries, and should not insist that the task of drafting the Japanese peace treaty can only be undertaken by the four powers. Bevin said that there is currently a test of whether it is sincere or not, that is, whether the Soviet Union, Britain, and other countries immediately agree to hold a Japanese peace treaty conference with fourteen or fifteen related countries, believing that then the Far East problem can be resolved. This is an extremely important matter. The fourteen or fifteen countries referred to by Bevin are probably the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission plus Pakistan, South Africa, Myanmar, and so on.

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Although the local newspapers have disclosed the full text of the new president's inaugural speech in China regarding the policy toward Japan, none of them have made criticisms. However, several newspapers simultaneously published a United Press International news report from Washington stating that China will require the following in the Japanese peace treaty: (1) Abolish the emperor system; (2) Organize an international police force to supervise the implementation of the Japanese peace treaty; (3) China should receive half of the total amount of Japanese reparations; (4) Ban Japan from rebuilding the metal industry, chemical industry, etc.; (5) Japanese territory should be limited to Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido; (6) Return the Ryukyu Islands to China; (7) Restrict the export of raw materials that can be used for military industries to Japan. The last paragraph of the news report stated that such demands have been opposed by the United States and Western European countries from the perspective of restoring Japanese industry and international trade. However, the US occupation authorities will consider various opinions on the Japanese peace treaty before the Japanese peace treaty is concluded.

### The United States Advocates Anti-Communism; Japan Follows Suit

Considering Banning Communists from Holding Public Office

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida announced in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that Japan may ban communists from holding public office. This statement was released on the same day as the news that the US House of Representatives passed the anti-communist bill. According to the new Japanese constitution, communists are not prohibited from holding public office. The Japanese government is currently considering this matter, but no decision has been made. Observers speculate that Ashida may be attempting to advance in line with the US anti-communist policy and secretly show foreign investors that as long as he is the prime minister, he will keep the government free of communists. Ashida also announced to the Foreign Affairs Committee at the same time that Japan is prepared to resume diplomatic relations with other countries immediately after the establishment of the peace treaty.

### Vietnamese Provisional Government; Nguyen Van Xuan Elected Chairman; Selected Hue as the Capital

[Central News Agency, Saigon, 21st] The three-celebrity conference in Vietnam was held here and elected Nguyen Van Xuan as the chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Central Government. The candidate for chairman was originally decided in Hong Kong, so today's election was purely formal, and the result was expected by all parties. The ancient royal city of Hue has been selected as the future capital of the central government, but in order to appease special elements, central government offices will be established in Saigon and Hanoi. The provisional government of southern Vietnam will be replaced by an administrative committee.

Bao Dai's Restoration; Rumors Rampant

[United Press, Saigon, 20th] The new provisional government of Vietnam has been established, with the pro-French Nguyen Van Xuan set to become the prime minister. The new government's announcement calling Annam's deposed King Bao Dai "Your Majesty" has made the rumors that Bao Dai will be restored to the throne even more credible. The new government is opposed to the Republic of Vietnam led by Ho Chi Minh, and Ho's troops have been fighting the French army for two years.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 21st] It was recently reported by Vietnamese republican sources that the Chinese government will conduct informal contacts with Ho Chi Minh's Republic of Vietnam. Ho's representative, Nguyen, has arrived in Nanning and is en route to Nanjing. Nguyen denied the claim that the Vietnamese Republican Army participated in the Chinese Communist Party's disturbances in the Chinese border and hopes that Vietnamese right-wing leader Nguyen Hai Than will cooperate with Ho Chi Minh. Since the French side cannot suppress the Vietnamese army by force, it is urging Annam's deposed King Bao Dai to be restored to the throne.

### Truce Committee Advocates Sending Troops; Greets the Holy City's Ceasefire Order; The Five Powers Appoint Bernadotte as the Special Mediator for the Holy Land

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 21st Radio: Lake Success News, The United Nations Truce Committee, which is currently withdrawing from Jerusalem, today appealed to the Security Council to send neutral troops from the Allied powers to the Holy Land to enforce the Jewish-Arab ceasefire order in the Holy City. The committee warned that otherwise, they would have to let them fight to the end. According to a telegram sent by the committee from Paris, staff members of the committee were injured while inspecting the ceasefire work in Jerusalem.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] The Security Council continued to discuss the US proposal on the 21st to declare that the situation in Palestine has constituted a threat to peace and should take action in accordance with Article 39 of the Charter. Britain has submitted an amendment to this proposal, requesting the deletion of the section "threat to peace" and advocating that the issue of the Security Council imposing sanctions should not be considered. Most other council members have also expressed opposition to the original US proposal.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 21st] China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union decided today after a seven-minute meeting to appoint Swedish Red Cross President Bernadotte as the United Nations mediator in Palestine. The member may exercise any administrative powers that the warring parties are willing to let him exercise.

### Delicate British-Arab Relations

Unwilling to Stop Military Aid to Arab Countries

So Oppose the US Proposal in the Security Council

[Reuters, London, 20th] London diplomatic sources believe that Britain's unwillingness to support the US resolution in the Security Council, to declare that the situation in Palestine has constituted a state of disruption to peace, is because it is unwilling to stop supplying military aid to Arab countries. And the supply of such military aid is originally Britain's treaty obligation to Egypt, Iraq, and other countries besides Jordan. The British Foreign Office declared two days ago that before being declared illegal by the United Nations, Britain would continue to supply Arab countries with weapons, officers, and funds based on the treaty. If the Security Council passes the US resolution to take action under Article 39 of the Charter, and the Security Council takes military action to stop the war in Palestine, it will inevitably declare Britain's supply of weapons to Arab countries as illegal before taking such action. Diplomatic sources also believe that if the Security Council does not order a ban on the supply of weapons to both sides warring in Palestine, the United States will revoke the arms embargo on the Middle East. The Jews in New York State have already launched a movement to demand the revocation of the ban, and Mrs. Ma Yisheng, the political minister of the Jewish Public Association, has also arrived in Washington to urge the US government to order the lifting of the ban.

### The Families of the US Occupation Forces in South Korea; Ordered to Prepare for Withdrawal; The News of Kim Ku's Retirement Has Been Confirmed

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Officials recently announced: The families of US military personnel have begun to withdraw in preparation for the possible full withdrawal of the US occupation forces. A spokesperson said that all personnel may leave Korea before August 1. According to statistics, the total number of families of occupation forces personnel is currently 2,310. According to the recommendations of the United Nations, the occupation forces must withdraw within 90 days after the establishment of the new government. This preparation will make the withdrawal of the US military after the formal establishment of the government organized based on the South Korean election on May 10 more smooth. The Communist Party has been chanting the slogan of the US military's withdrawal for a long time. In the open letters exchanged between Wallace and Stalin this week, it was also said that the withdrawal of the occupation forces in Korea can promote world peace.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 20th] It has been confirmed that Kim Ku, the leader of the Korean independence movement, has retired from political activities and will go to Magok Temple to recuperate.

### Still Hesitating

[United Press, Paris, 20th] The Irish Parliament hotly debated the issue of recognizing the State of Israel today and then decided to send a telegram to congratulate the establishment of the new country.

[United Press, Tunis, 21st] Tunisian Arab leaders sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Schumann and Foreign Minister Pidur today, stating that all Arabs in Tunisia believe that France's recognition of the State of Israel is a hostile act against the 25 million people in North Africa. The French government should pay attention to the unfortunate consequences it has caused in Tunisia and France's future relations.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 20th] Epstein, the acting representative of the State of Israel in Washington, has been appointed as Israel's first ambassador to the United States. According to a report from Prague Radio, Israeli Foreign Minister Schertok has notified the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Appoint Ukpe Perul as Israel's diplomatic representative to the Czech Republic.

[Reuters, Munich, 21st] Hoffman, the person in charge of the Jewish labor union here, said that the State of Israel will soon establish consulates in Munich, Frankfurt, and Berlin to assist Jews in going to Israel. There are one million Jews in Europe and Africa, all of whom want to go to Palestine.

### Pakistan Protests; US and Soviet Union Recognize Jewish State

Karachi City Strikes Citywide

[Our Newspaper News] London, 21st Radio: Pakistan's Karachi City fell into a standstill today. Shops were closed and transportation stopped. The government has declared today as "Palestine" Day to protest the US, Soviet Union, and other governments' recognition of the State of Israel.

### American Jew Traveling to Holy Land Detained in Lebanon

U.S. Government to Formally Protest

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Washington Report, State Department spokesperson Mr. McTeer announced that the United States has warned all Arab nations to refrain from discriminating against holders of U.S. passports.

[United Press International, Haifa, 20th] Sixty-nine Jewish passengers aboard the American vessel "Gat Pura," including 41 American Jews, were forcibly detained in Beirut. Jewish officials formally notified the U.S. Consulate last night. Another 51 Jewish passengers, mostly women and children, as well as several elderly individuals, were permitted to continue their journey to Haifa. (According to a statement issued by the Lebanese government in Beirut, those detained were sent to concentration camps because they were of military service age.) Washington is awaiting a detailed report before lodging a formal protest.

### Four Powers' Disputes Irreconcilable; Austrian Treaty Negotiations Collapse; Soviets Insist on Yugoslav Territorial Claims

[United Press International, London, 20th] The American delegation here announced late tonight that the four-power talks on the Austrian treaty between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France have completely collapsed. For two years, the four countries have been discussing the Austrian treaty, but the disputes between the U.S., Britain, and France on one side and the Soviet Union on the other have proved irreconcilable. The talks were recently suspended for two weeks. Until yesterday, the chief representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet Union held private talks to explore whether there was any hope of breaking the deadlock. The Soviet representative stated that he had received instructions from Moscow to insist on Yugoslavia's territorial and compensation claims against Austria, prompting the U.S. to decide to suspend negotiations indefinitely. Yugoslavia is claiming about 800 square miles of territory in the southern Austrian provinces of Carinthia and Styria.

### Israeli Aircraft Deployed for First Time; Major Battle in Galilee; Jewish Forces Besieged in Jerusalem Plead for Reinforcements

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 20th] Haganah announced today that Jewish military aircraft were deployed for the first time, bombing Arab artillery positions and armored vehicle convoys in the Galilee area of the northeast. All aircraft safely returned to base after completing their missions.

[Reuters, London, 20th] The entire situation in Palestine may be affected by the major Jewish-Arab battle currently underway in the Galilee Sea area. This marks the first time that Jewish and Arab forces have engaged in direct combat. If the participating Iraqi, Transjordanian, and Syrian forces can achieve a decisive victory in this battle, the Egyptian forces advancing from southern Palestine will be able to launch a full-scale offensive against the main Jewish forces around Tel Aviv. If the Jewish forces can withstand the offensive by the Iraqi, Transjordanian, and Syrian forces, the Egyptian army's willingness to rashly attack the 50,000 Jewish troops concentrated near Tel Aviv will require careful consideration. The offensive by the Arab allied forces south of Galilee, under the cover of aircraft and armored vehicles, is advancing southward to attack Jewish settlements in the Jordan River Valley, with the strategically important city of Beisan in northeastern Palestine as the main target. If Beisan is captured, the prosperous Jewish settlements in the Plain of Armageddon will lose their shield, and the Arab allied forces will be able to join forces with other Transjordanian forces waiting in the Jordan Mountains. The recent situation on other fronts in Palestine is as follows: Southern Front - Egyptian Forces: The Egyptian forces have advanced from Beit Hanoon, north of Gaza, where the Egyptian command is located, in two wings. The left wing has occupied Deir Suneid, ten miles north of Gaza, and the right wing has occupied Beersheba, a major southern city on the road to Jerusalem. Northeastern Front - Syrian Forces: After occupying Samakh, at the southern end of the Sea of Galilee, the Syrian forces have advanced further south, occupying a Western Jewish village three miles away. Eastern Front: Jewish forces are advancing in a fan-shaped formation north from Allenby Bridge to confront the Iraqi and Transjordanian forces. Northern Front: There have been no reports of advances by the Lebanese forces.

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Eighty percent of the Old City of Jerusalem has been occupied by Arab forces. The fighting is nearing its end, and the Arab forces are currently launching a fierce assault on the last Jewish strongholds.

[United Press International, Correspondent with Troops in the Holy City, 21st] Arab forces stated on the 21st that the Arab forces that broke through the Old City of Jerusalem have already occupied the Zion Gate, trapping the 4,000 Jewish troops within the Old City without any hope of rescue. The Jewish forces have sent an urgent telegram to Tel Aviv requesting assistance, stating that they will be forced to surrender unless reinforcements arrive immediately. This message has been intercepted by the Arab forces. The battle for the Holy City is only taking place within the Old City.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The Arab forces have issued a final ultimatum to the Jewish forces trapped in the Old City, demanding surrender by the afternoon of the 21st. A Jewish communique stated that fighting continues within the Old City of Jerusalem, while at the same time, Transjordanian forces have positioned their artillery and are threatening a full-scale attack if the Jewish forces refuse to surrender. It is reported that neutral consuls in Jerusalem have urgently telegraphed the King of Transjordan and Tel Aviv, appealing for the preservation of the Holy Land. It is generally believed that only a direct telegram from Truman to Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok, ordering the Jewish forces to accept the Arab forces' final ultimatum, can avert the disaster befalling the Holy Sites.

### Oregon Republican Primary: Dewey and Stassen in Fierce Competition

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] More than 300,000 Republican voters in Oregon (the largest number ever registered in the state's history) voted today in the Republican primary to choose between Dewey and Stassen. The Oregon Republican primary will be the last major political battle before the Republican National Convention, scheduled to be held in Philadelphia on June 21st. Both sides are trying to win Oregon's delegation of twelve representatives who will vote at the Republican National Convention. In other words, either Dewey or Stassen will win all twelve delegates, or neither will win any. There has never been such an intense campaign in Oregon's history. Both candidates have traveled thousands of miles by plane and car, and have visited most of the cities and towns in Oregon. These places have never before seen a visit from a presidential candidate. The winner of today's primary will undoubtedly increase their chances of winning at the National Convention.

### X-Ray Telescope Magnifies Brightness 500 Times; Can See Heart's Activity

[United Press International, New York, 20th] The Christian Hauck Institute announced today that 32-year-old physicist Courtland has discovered an X-ray telescope that guides X-rays into the human body, projecting an X-ray image onto a fluorescent screen that is 500 times brighter than current ones, allowing doctors to see the internal organs of the human body in detail. Dr. Chamberlain, the original designer, believes that this will make it easier to quickly locate cancer and tuberculosis, study heart activity, and diagnose kidney disease early. This X-ray device is called a telescope because it can magnify brightness. After passing through the human body, the X-rays are converged by a mirror tube and converted into electrons, which strike the fluorescent screen at a speed of 5,000 miles per second, producing a bright image. The images produced by current X-rays are only one-30,000th as bright as white paper under ordinary light, and hundreds of photos must be taken to show the activity of organs. The new mirror tube can see objects down to 5,000th of an inch. Although the method of increasing brightness by 500 times has been invented, it will still take several months to actually manufacture the mirror tube. Currently, only brightness can be increased by five times. Once realized, the exposure time for the human body and the observation time for doctors can be shortened to avoid harming the human body and reduce the inconvenience of doctors peeping in the dark. In addition, it may be possible to see three-dimensional images, and to transmit them electronically, so that experts in distant places can easily make diagnoses based on them.

### Wallace Expresses Willingness to Meet Stalin

[Agence France-Presse, San Diego, California, 20th] Wallace told reporters today that he would be happy to go to Moscow to talk to Stalin if it would help achieve peace. He stated that he supports Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that any dispute that is likely to endanger peace should be resolved through negotiations by all parties. He said that if the United States and the Soviet Union could begin negotiations in the spirit of the Charter, the danger of war could be averted. Wallace criticized Truman and Marshall's reaction to the Smith-Molotov exchange of notes, saying, "This best proves that American foreign policy fears a peace offensive and continues the Cold War."

### Norway and Denmark Request U.S. Arms Aid

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Washington Report, State Department Press Officer Wilde stated today that "almost every country" is seeking to purchase arms from the United States, and confirmed reports that Norway and Denmark have requested to purchase U.S. arms. These two countries have recently been criticized by Soviet newspapers.

### Soviet Union Refuses Compensation for British Plane Crash in Berlin

[United Press International, London, 20th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the Soviet Union has notified Britain that it refuses to pay compensation for the collision between a British transport plane and a Soviet fighter jet over Berlin on April 5. The spokesman also said that Britain's requests for compensation for the families of the fourteen victims and all other conditions have been explicitly rejected. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has made a counter-claim, demanding that Britain compensate for the loss of life of the Soviet pilot and the loss of the fighter jet.

### 103 Theaters Jointly Appeal to Authorities for Protection; Resolution to Temporarily Deposit Tax Payments in Bank Starting This Month

[Report from This Newspaper] One hundred and three theaters in Shanghai recently jointly appealed to the authorities, requesting that they be given effective protection because they could not stand the disturbances of illegal elements, their venues were repeatedly vandalized, and even their employees were often beaten to death or injured. According to Zhou Jianchou, chairman of the Theatrical Industry Association, the business tax, stamp tax, and entertainment tax collected on behalf of the government that Shanghai theaters pay each month are quite substantial, and they believe that it is unfair to only have the obligation to pay taxes without the right to be protected. The association has now resolved that the tax payments that each theater should pay to the Bureau of Finance on the 23rd of each month will be temporarily deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Bank starting this month, and that they do not intend to transfer the payments to the Bureau of Finance until effective protection measures are obtained from the authorities. However, they do not consider this to be an act of "tax resistance." Furthermore, if this matter cannot be satisfactorily resolved within the month, the theaters have decided that their next step will be to no longer collect entertainment tax on behalf of the government starting next month, and will use a "non-cooperation" approach as a protest. It is reported that in theaters such as the Tianchan Theater, where reserved seats are sold, there are often dozens of disputes every day because seats are forcibly occupied and ticket holders cannot enter temporarily. In addition, in some small theaters that can only accommodate 400 spectators, those watching free shows often occupy as many as 300 seats, and if they are slightly dissatisfied, beatings ensue, and the theater can become a battlefield.

[Another Report] The Municipal Council authorities stated that they deeply sympathize with the industry's current difficult situation and intend to seek a reasonable solution to improve the business environment of the theaters, but they believe that the measure of suspending tax payments is inappropriate.

### May Subsidy for Public and Private School Staff: 2,728,000 Yuan for Staff; Summer Ration Distribution to Begin on the 10th of Next Month

### To Settle Refugees in Guildhalls, Alternative Sites Will Be Selected for Building Houses

[Report from This Newspaper] Since refugees occupied various guildhalls in the suburbs last winter, the Municipal Government Meeting decided that the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Land Administration would be responsible for selecting sites near the major guildhalls to build civilian villages to accommodate these refugees. However, after consultation between the Bureau of Land Administration, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Bureau of Public Works, it was determined that there was no vacant land near the guildhalls that could be used to build houses. Therefore, it was decided that after the three civilian villages planned to be built by the Municipal Relief Association are completed, the Bureau of Land Administration will survey any remaining land, and then the Bureau of Public Works will design and build houses. The funds are planned to be allocated from the surplus funds from the charity lottery issued last winter.

### Enlistment Settlement Fee Paid by Check; Army Association Secretary Explains Advantages and Disadvantages

[Report from This Newspaper] The payment of enlistment settlement fees in this city began to be issued by the Conscription Service Association the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a report stated that volunteers claimed that there were malpractices in issuing checks and hoped to be given cash. Lei Kenan, the secretary of the association, explained that in order to take care of the interests of the volunteers, the association's committee had seriously discussed the matter in a meeting and decided to issue checks, which could not be changed by any individual will. The checks issued must be signed by the new recruit himself before they can be cashed. If they are lost, they can be reported to the Municipal Bank. Furthermore, in order to prevent new recruits from gambling, issuing checks is better than issuing cash. This decision was based on the experience of last year's handling. The best thing is that it can avoid accidental harassment and numerical errors, and new recruits can get real benefits. As for the lack of comfort items, it is because there is no such expenditure in this year's meeting and it has not yet been handled.

Over 800 guests attended, along with several hundred middle and elementary school students. The garden was filled with bright sunshine, and the United Nations flags suspended throughout the area fluttered in the breeze, creating a lively atmosphere and an unprecedented spectacle.

The garden party began with the sound of music. Fang Zhi delivered a speech as the host, stating: "From beginning to end, the Kuomintang has held the determination to return power to the people, because our party cannot always be Zhuge Liang. We must enable our 450 million A'dous to stand on their own two feet as soon as possible. However, on the other hand, the responsibility we bear for the country in the future is even greater, and each of our comrades should work harder to complete this important task of nation-building. This is what each of our comrades should currently recognize. Today, in the celebration of the inauguration of the President and Vice President, I have three additional points to offer for our common encouragement and practice."

Fang Zhi Offers Three Points of Advice

"First, we must fight for our ideology. We have all seen that in yesterday's inaugural address, the President repeatedly mentioned the three major issues of reforming politics, stabilizing the economy, and stabilizing society. All loyal comrades of our party must strive to realize the President's great call to reform politics, stabilize the economy, and stabilize society. Second, we must fight for the people. The foundation of our party lies in the people. Party members must stand on the side of the people, speak for the people, relieve the suffering of the people, seek the welfare of the people, and serve the people and fight for the people at all times and in all places. Third, we must fight for the government. You must know that our government was created with great difficulty, through the bloodshed, sweat, and sacrifice of the party members and the people of the whole country. The current government is the people's government, supported by all the people of the country. Therefore, the comrades of our party must support the constitutional government, actively promote government orders, assist in construction, strengthen the work of suppressing rebellions and bandits, unite as one, and be loyal and brave to fight for the government."

### The Public Opinion Survey Committee Will Adjust the Price of Food Rice Supplied to the Market at Any Time, But the Principle Is That It Should Not Be Higher Than the Grain Price in the Production Area

According to the Civil Survey Committee, the market price of white grain in this city on the 21st was 5.8 million yuan per stone in the Nanshi Market and 5.9 million yuan in the Beishi Market.

As for Xian rice, the Shanghai market price was 5.9 million yuan for Yangxian and 5.6 million yuan for Duxian. The Hankou market price on the 20th was 6.2 million yuan. In short, the prices in the production areas, whether white japonica or xian rice, are higher than those in Shanghai. In order to prevent the reverse flow of grain, the Civil Survey Committee plans to make reasonable adjustments to the supply price at any time with reference to the grain price in the production area, so as to ensure that it is not higher than the production price, and will supply it without restriction to ensure the livelihood of the people.

Flour rose, and cargo owners held on to their prices because the prices in the mainland were not low.

(2) In case the government must adopt a guarantee method, please use a bank guarantee instead of a cash guarantee.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The weightlifting performance, co-organized by the Modern Gymnasium and the Youth Association's Sports Department, is scheduled to take place this Sunday (the 23rd) from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM in the Youth Association's gymnasium. Most of the performers are Shanghai athletes who scored in the recent National Games, as well as police representatives. The organizers, recognizing that while weightlifting is common among Chinese people, many are unfamiliar with the rules of the Olympic Games, resulting in disqualification from competitions, which is regrettable. Therefore, this performance emphasizes education, explaining the three basic styles in detail to improve the overall level of weightlifting. Additionally, the performance will also include bodybuilding displays and boxing matches. Those interested in attending can obtain tickets from the Youth Association. Tickets will not be sold separately and are limited to 700.

### National Games Table Tennis: A Complete Success

Recently, the table tennis scene in this city has been flourishing, with numerous teams and talented individuals emerging. Since the victory, under the leadership of the City Sports Association's Table Tennis Committee, remarkable achievements have been made. Each competition draws thousands of spectators, creating a lively atmosphere, unprecedented in the past.

In this National Games, table tennis was included as a championship event for the first time, attracting as many as 23 participating units, demonstrating that table tennis has become a popular fitness activity in provinces and cities across the country. This should encourage sports leaders nationwide to change their past perceptions, pay more attention, and promote table tennis, ensuring its unlimited future development.

Among the various ball game competitions in this National Games, table tennis proceeded most smoothly, with no forfeits, no protests, and no incidents of assaulting referees, maintaining a harmonious atmosphere throughout. All the referees, under the leadership of head referee Wang Yi, including Chen Linsheng, Li Longbiao, Hu Jiankun, and Shen Baihong, performed their duties diligently, arriving on time and never being absent. They were the best performing referee group in the entire National Games. Among the table tennis referees, Chen Linsheng's dedication to service, promoting table tennis tirelessly for twenty years, has earned him the unanimous respect of the table tennis community. Wang Youxin from Taiwan, the table tennis champion of this National Games, was discovered by Chen several years ago and has indeed surpassed all competitors, taking the top spot. Recently, Chen is compiling a book titled "Table Tennis Studies," documenting his twenty years of experience in the table tennis world, which is sure to be warmly welcomed by the table tennis community upon its publication.

### The Influence of Buddhism on Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty

— Ji Xianlin

This is indeed a "big topic," but I can only "make it small." The influence of Buddhism on Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty is significant; this has almost become a universally recognized fact, and no historian of philosophy would deny it anymore. However, almost all the attention is focused on the influence in terms of thought. Mr. Feng Zhisheng (Youlan), in his "A History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume Two," twelfth chapter (page 800), discusses the thoughts of Han Yu and Li Ao, concluding:

"From what has been said above, the foundation and outline of Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism were established in the Tang Dynasty by Han Yu and Li Ao; and Li's contribution is even greater than Han's, and the influence of Buddhism on his doctrines is even more evident." Xie Wuliang, in his "A History of Chinese Philosophy, Third Part, Volume One," page one, also says:

"The great Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty often interacted with Buddhist monks, and their discussions on the nature of life and destiny were bound to find common ground; only in matters of human affairs and ethics did they hold different views." Both are talking about the influence of Buddhism on Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism in terms of thought. Jiang Weiqiao and Yang Daying, in their "An Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, Volume Two," page four, say:

"Scholars have always said that the deep relationship between Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism and Buddhism lies in their fundamental ideas, but we believe it lies only in their methods. The similarity in methods leads to some superficial resemblances; in reality, the two schools of thought, one being a worldly philosophy and the other a transcendent philosophy, are fundamentally incompatible."

I do not understand what he means by "methods." Furthermore, numerous scholars, both Chinese and foreign, have discussed the relationship between Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism, almost always focusing on the relationship between the two schools of thought from a broad perspective. I cannot list them all here.

In this short essay, I cannot, and dare not, discuss the major issues of thought. I only want to point out a small matter that seems to have gone unnoticed in the past, to draw everyone's attention. Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, in addition to discussing philosophical issues, mostly practiced a certain amount of self-cultivation, and one of these practices was to conquer selfish desires. In the "Selected Sayings on Learning Regulations" by Yin Mingshou of the Qing Dynasty, Volume One, "Ways to Enter Virtue," in the section called "Conquering and Rectifying," he quotes Zhu Xi as saying:

"Zhu Xi said: 'Those who wished to purify their thoughts in the past would place two containers in their sitting place. Every time a good thought arose, they would throw a white bean into one container; every time a bad thought arose, they would throw a black bean into the other container. At first, there would be many black beans and few white beans, but later there would be no more black beans, and finally, there would be no more white beans either. However, this is just a rigid method. If one were to add the effort of reading and investigating principles, then it would be easy to get rid of those improper thoughts.'"

I do not know how many people actually practiced this method, but I remember seeing Neo-Confucian scholars practicing this method in other books, which shows that there were quite a few who practiced it. When we first see this method, probably no one would think that this is not a "domestic product." I also initially thought that only China, and only Chinese Neo-Confucian scholars, could have invented this comical and clumsy "rigid method." But later I actually found its origin in the Chinese Tripitaka. In the tenth chapter of the "Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish," (67) "Chapter Sixty: Upagupta," there is a story about Ananda's disciple Yequian Datuo, who upheld the Buddhist Dharma. He heard that a certain layman had a child, so he went to ask the layman for the child, "wanting him to enter the Way." The layman refused. Later, he had another child, and he still refused to let him become a monk.

"This Yequian Datuo was an Arhat, possessing the three clarities, able to know the roots of people. Seeing that these two children had no affinity with the Way, he stopped his intention and did not diligently ask. Later, that layman had another son, whose face was beautiful and whose appearance was extraordinary. Then Yequian Datuo went again to ask for him. The layman said: 'The child is still young and cannot serve yet, and the family is poor and cannot afford to send him gifts. Let's wait and give him to you when he is older.' As he grew older, his talent and ability increased. His father entrusted him with wealth and had him sell goods in the market. Then Yequian Datuo went to his side and preached the Dharma to him, teaching him to maintain mindfulness, using white and black stones as counters. Place white stones for good thoughts, and black stones for bad thoughts. Upagupta received his teachings, and whenever good or bad thoughts arose, he would throw the stones. At first, there were many black stones and very few white ones. Gradually, through cultivation, the white and black stones became equal. When the bad thoughts ceased, there were no more black stones, only white ones. As good thoughts increased, he attained the first fruit." (Taisho Tripitaka, Volume 4, page 442, bottom)

This method of "maintaining mindfulness" is completely the same as the method used by Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholars, except for the slight difference between black and white beans and black and white stones. If Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholars had never come into contact with Buddhist scriptures at all, we might still be able to say that this was a coincidence; but in fact, their relationship with Buddhist scriptures was very deep, so we can only say that this was an intentional borrowing. This method, which looks like an authentic Chinese product, was originally transmitted from India along with Buddhism. From this small example, we can see that Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism was not only influenced by Buddhism in terms of major ideas, but also in many minor details that people usually do not pay attention to.

### Fundamental Problems in Indian Grammar Theory

— Jin Kemu

To trace the theory, we have to go back before Panini. Although Panini is regarded as an unrivaled ancestor by later generations, he was only the rear guard who compiled previous achievements. According to the custom of circulating Indian texts, once a doctrine accumulates and becomes a fixed form, there is a book that wipes out all the previous levels and replaces all the predecessors as a "Sutra." In this situation, the "Panini Sutra" has become the only surviving book of this type, and there is no way to trace its origin. However, in addition to grammar, ancient India also had etymology, which was one of the "Six Limbs of the Vedas," the orthodox learning. Etymology is the so-called "Nirukta," and there is a book of the same name that still exists today. Although that book, like the "Panini Sutra," does not necessarily belong to the original "Six Limbs of the Vedas," and it is only another incomplete glossary of difficult Vedic words, the so-called "Nighantu," which is a commentary on it, it still preserves a record of the discussion on the fundamental problem of grammar theory. The author of the "Nirukta," Yaska, was before Panini, so this is the oldest extant material on this issue.

In the discussion in the first chapter of "Nirukta," Yaska acknowledges that there are four types of words: nouns, verbs, particles, and interjections. (The term "particle" is translated using Xuanzang's translation in the sixth volume of "Vijnaptimatrata-siddhi," the rest are tentative.) Verbs can be divided into six types: birth, existence, change, increase, decrease, and destruction. But this is the view of one person and one school; only four types of words seem to have been the common opinion at the time. Among the four categories, "particles" and "interjections" naturally do not change themselves, while "nouns" and "verbs" still have to have changes. The changes of these two are the main content of grammar, and the relationship between the two, that is, the problem of the origin of all words, becomes the basic topic of grammatical theory.

Yaska first gives a definition, (Punna edition of 1940, some explanations are based on the commentator Rajavade, the same below.) saying:

"All these [words] are four 'classes of sentences': nouns, verbs, particles, interjections. Among these, nouns and verbs resemble each other. 'Action' is the basis, which is the verb 'likeness'. 'Existence' is the basis, which is the noun 'likeness'. Among these, the two are combined, with 'action' as the basis. The 'action' done before and after is called 'action', which is shown by verbs, [such as] walking and cooking, starting at the beginning and ending at the end. Once fixed as 'existence', it is named [shown] as 'existence', [such as] walking and cooking. 'This' is to show all 'existence' [same likeness]. Cow, horse, person, elephant, [showing different likenesses]. 'Action' [showing] the 'action' [same likeness]. Sitting, lying, walking, standing, [showing different likenesses]." (Chapter 1, Section 1. Words in square brackets are added to the translation, the same below. "Action" is translated according to Kumarajiva's translation of the "Madhyamaka-karika," which is the "actionlessness of the sage" and the "actionlessness of great elegance," which is contrasted with "existence" here. In fact, this word is also "existence" in Chinese, but in Sanskrit, they are two different word roots, with very different meanings. The problem of "existence" is very interesting, and I have another article discussing it. "Same likeness" and "different likeness" could have been translated as "common likeness" and "unique likeness," but I avoid using them here to avoid confusion.)

"Action" and "existence" both refer to being, but the former refers to the process of an action, and the latter refers to the completion of an action. The former observes the movement of change, while the latter views the static state of the whole. Therefore, the former is expressed by "verbs," and the latter is expressed by "nouns." If an action has distinct before and after stages, then it is a movement, and it must be expressed by "verbs." A movement has a beginning and an end. If it is fixed and completed, then it is a thing, not a movement, and it must encompass the whole, expressed by "nouns." The "walking" and "cooking" in the former are verb forms, and the "walking" and "cooking" in the latter are noun forms. "This" is also considered a noun, but it is actually a pronoun, which can replace everything. "Cow and horse" are specific designations. "Action" is also a general name for all actions and behaviors, and "sitting and lying" are used to distinguish them. "Existence" is Being, and "Action" is Becoming, which are two types of existence.

Now let's look at the principle that "verbs come from nouns" and its opposing aspects. Saint Saska said:

"The four 'sentence classes' listed as such are: nouns, verbs, particles, and interjections. Among these, all nouns are produced from verbs, according to Sakatayana and Nighantuka. Not all, according to Gargya and some grammarians." (Chapter 1, Section 12)

To clarify this debate, I will let them speak for themselves in easy modern language. Yaska first records Gargya's reasons for opposing:

"Meaningful words derived from sounds and forms (augmentations) according to grammatical rules, if they are consistent with the meanings derived from the roots, are recognized words. [Roots that do not conform to the meaning of the word cannot be considered the source.] Such as cow, horse, person, elephant. If all "nouns" come from "verbs," then those with the same behavior should have the same names. All those occupying the road should be called horses. All those that can sting should be called grass. If "nouns" come from "verbs," then there should be as many names as there are actions. Then, the pillars should also be called "sleeping holes" (standing in holes) or "tight connections" (supporting beams). Moreover, "nouns" created from actions according to grammar should clearly express their meanings, and the forms of person, horse, and grass should be changed. (Examples omitted.) Moreover, we must carefully consider [words] that are already in common use (recognized). It is said that "earth" is "spread out." Who spreads it out? What supports [the person who spreads it out]? Moreover, words whose meanings do not match, Sakatayana mixes and matches halves from these words and those words. (Examples omitted.) Moreover, everyone says that existence precedes action. It is unreasonable to call something that existed first by a later action. Therefore, this argument is unreasonable." (Chapter 1, Sections 12 and 13)

The reply from the Nirukta school:

"Alas, what are you saying! You say: 'Meaningful words derived from sounds and forms according to grammatical rules, if they are consistent with the meanings derived from the roots, are all words derived from the roots.' According to this, this does not refute [our theory]. For example, you say: 'Those with the same behavior should have the same names.' We see that some people who do the same things have the same names, and some do not. (Examples omitted.) From this argument, your later refutation is also answered. For example, you say: ''Nouns' created from actions according to grammar should clearly express their meanings.' Some words, although derived from only one word and using direct suffixes, are rarely used. (Examples omitted.) For example, you say: 'We must carefully consider [words] that are already in common use (recognized).' [We] originally study the structure of words that are already in common use. You say: 'Earth' is said to be 'spread out.' Who spreads it out? What supports [the person who spreads it out]?' Seeing that it is spread out there, [we call it spread out], even if there is no one else who spreads [it]. According to you, everyone who names things after seeing them should be blamed. For example, you say: 'Someone mixes and matches halves from these words and those words.' It is the one who mixes and matches without regard for the meaning of the words who should be criticized. This is the criticism of that kind of person. For example, you say: 'It is unreasonable to call something that existed first by a later action.' We see that some things that are already born are named after later actions, and some are not. (Examples omitted.)" (Chapter 1, Section 14)

The opposition ultimately failed. The etymologists conquered the grammarians. "Nouns" come from "verbs," and everything is named because of action. This principle became the creed of the grammarians. The "Panini Sutra" takes verb roots as the basis, and "particles" are no longer independent, and "interjections" are only considered "nouns" with dropped endings. Therefore, from the traditional 1,943 verb roots, changing according to 3,996 "sutras," it includes all the phenomena of standard Sanskrit (and even the exceptions of Vedic language).

(Continued)

The merits and demerits of this grammatical theory, and the causal historical relationship between it and the study of grammar and etymology before and after it, need not be discussed here. What I want to point out is just a little seed of Indian thought lurking in this theory.

"Nouns" come from "verbs," and all roots are verbs. What exists is ultimately the synthesis of action. After the grammatical theorists analyzed the confusing language phenomena layer by layer, based on the sounds actually living in the mouth, they did not obtain abstract concepts, but only obtained the ever-changing behavior. What is static is only the synthesis covering it, or the completion of the action and the inseparable whole. There is no formal, mathematical, or logical thinking, only the analysis and synthesis of concrete phenomena. Movement is divisible, and static is synthesized and indivisible. Taking movement as the foundation, if it develops in the direction of analysis, it can reach the multiple "atoms" that cannot be further divided, etc., or it can be broken again to obtain an extremely impermanent movement, and even go beyond movement. If it develops in the direction of synthesis, it is possible to see permanence above impermanence, and to see the transcendental indivisible in the divisible. Because of seeing movement, we emphasize seeking "quietude." However, no matter how it develops, it starts from the concrete phenomena of movement, not from conceptual, mathematical, or formal logic. Although the philosophical theory of the later so-called grammarians is only in other aspects, from this fundamental problem that was debated in the early stages, we can see a line of thought that is related to the entire Indian thought, and thus is in direct contrast to the starting point under the Western logical concept. As for China, perhaps we can jokingly say that India believes in the mantra of spoken language and the secret signs of finger movements, while Chinese Taoists believe in the talismans of brushstrokes. Perhaps the old Chinese etymology was in the opposite direction of India? (Zheng Qiao mentioned the distinction between emphasizing sound and emphasizing form.)

However, I have already spoken too far. To discuss further would involve too much, and it would be difficult to determine right and wrong, and I would inevitably invite ridicule from experts. So, I will leave this point aside. To know what we often say about verb roots was like at the beginning of the discussion, what kind of system made it possible to become the foundation, and how this system differs from systems based on abstract concepts and logic, may not be without benefit. (The End)

### Regarding "Wang Tao's Death Year"

— Peng Zeyi

Xu Guangmo's "Wang Tao's Death Year," published in the fifteenth issue of Shen Bao's "Literature and History" weekly, based on the preface of Miao Shaochu's Meishu Yin Cao, contends that Wang Tao died in the winter of the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You. Mr. Hu Shi specifically stated in the editor's postscript that someone had also told him of a similar contention. However, because he had forgotten who made the contention, he hoped that someone would point it out and that the Shen Bao office could check the old newspapers of the time to "make a final conclusion" on Wang Tao's death year. After checking the Shen Bao, there seemed to be no result.

Last September, when Mr. Luo Xianglin came to Nanjing from Guangzhou, he kindly sent me a copy of "Sun Yat-sen's University Days." There were several minor errors in the textual research of the book, such as the section discussing the relationship between Wang Tao and Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which stated:

"Although Wang Tao was known for his deep understanding of foreign affairs in the early years of Guangxu, according to Mr. Chen Shaobai's 'Essential History of the Revive China Society,' it is said that when Sun Yat-sen went to Shanghai in the twentieth year of Guangxu, he met Wang Tao and presented a letter to Li Hongzhang, which Wang Tao helped him revise... According to Chen Guosong's 'The Taiping Scholar Wang Tao' in 'Yi Jing' issue 33, Tao died of illness as early as the sixteenth year of Guangxu. Whether Sun Yat-sen ever met Wang Tao is questionable. It is suspected that another friend, Zhu Bi, whom Sun Yat-sen met at Zheng Guanying's house and introduced to Luo Fenglu in Tianjin, was mistaken for Wang Tao. If so, then the letter to Li Hongzhang has nothing to do with Wang Tao."

I told Mr. Luo that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, and the material cited in the book, which stated that he died in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, was incorrect. Mr. Luo said that the book was written in Chongqing during the war, and it was difficult to collect historical materials in detail. This was the actual situation. At the time, I also told him that Chen Shaobai's account of Wang Tao's revision of Sun Yat-sen's letter to Li Hongzhang was credible and that the facts were so and did not detract from Sun Yat-sen's greatness.

At that time, I said that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, based on Mr. Xiao Yishan's "Register of Writings by Qing Dynasty Scholars" and Wu Jingshan's "A Brief Study of Wang Tao's Deeds" (published in the Republic of China twenty-fifth year edition of "Shanghai Research Materials"), which were materials that Mr. Xu Guangmo and Mr. Hu's friend Roswell S. Britton had not seen. Wu Jingshan compiled a chronicle of Wang Tao's life, stating that he was born on the fourth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the eighth year of Daoguang, Wu Zi, and died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You, at the age of seventy. He died in April at his Caotang (thatched cottage) west of the city. "According to Yao Wenxuan et al.'s 'Supplementary Shanghai County Records,' volume 30, 'Miscellaneous Records,' Wang Tao 'bought a house in the western city in his later years, naming it Caotang west of the city.'" It can be seen that he died in his Shanghai residence in April of the twenty-third year of Guangxu.

It is regrettable that the Supplementary Shanghai County Records were compiled in the early years of the Republic of China and published in May of the seventh year of the Republic of China, with events "ending completely with the documents of one era from the tenth year of Tongzhi to the third year of Xuantong" (as stated in Wu Xin's preface). The record of Wang Tao in the book is so brief, and the reason why the chief editor mentioned him in the "Miscellaneous Records" at the end of the volume is that he wrote "Ying Huan Zhi Lue in six volumes, which describes the events of Shanghai in great detail." The Wuxian County Records compiled by Cao Yunyuan in the Republic of China also did not mention him, only listing some of his books in volume 57, the literary examination section.

Wu Jingshan recorded the year and month of Wang Tao's death, drawing on "Cai Erkan's Zhutiegang Reading and Writing Jottings Manuscript," which is a rare and valuable historical material. The author of the manuscript was a native of Shanghai with good Chinese and Western literacy. Most of the publications of the early Society for the Diffusion of Christian and General Knowledge in China were translated by him, often under the name "Lou Shu Xian Shi Cai Erkan," who was a famous writer in Shanghai. In the first year of Guangxu, Shen Bao imitated the Jujin edition and published Wang Tao's "Weng Guan Yu Tan" (eight volumes), and Cai Erkan wrote a long preface for him, showing their deep friendship between the lines. Therefore, what he said about the year and month of Wang Tao's death must be extremely reliable.

According to the above, Wang Tao's birth year was the fourth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the eighth year of Daoguang, which is November 10, 1828 in the Western calendar. This is consistent with Roswell S. Britton's record in Arthur W. Hummel's "Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period" (Ibld., 11, P. 836). As for the year of death, it is also consistent with Mr. Xu Guangmo's contention based on the preface of Meishu Yin Cao that he died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, Ding You, which should be no problem. However, the months are different, one in the summer (April) and one in the winter. Although the sources of these two claims are both from Wang Tao's friends, one of them must be wrong. I would like to tell Mr. Xu about the results of this research and hope to conduct further discussions.

(March 28th, 37th year, Nanjing).

Postscript

In the fifteenth issue of this journal, Xu Guangmo's article "Wang Tao's Death Year" was published. At that time, I wrote a postscript, saying that I had heard in Shanghai the year before last that someone had determined that Wang Tao died in the twenty-third year of Guangxu, at the age of seventy, and had recorded the results of this research in a world chronology, but had not noted the source or who had determined it. Therefore, I very much hoped that someone would point out the source and basis of this claim and make a final conclusion on Wang Tao's death year. Later, while traveling in the South, I received articles from Mr. Zhang Tiansong, Tan Zhengfeng, and Peng Zeyi, all of whom pointed out that the first person to determine Wang Tao's birth and death was Mr. Wu Jingshan's "A Brief Study of Wang Tao's Deeds," published in "Shanghai Research Materials." Now, Mr. Peng's article is published here, and I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Tan Zhengfeng and Zhang Tiansong.

### The Spirit of Shang Yang

— Sun He

Recently, an employee of a cooperative (？) in a domestic government agency was sentenced to life imprisonment according to law for embezzling three tubes of toothpaste and one shirt, with a value approaching "more than 1,000 yuan" for the crime of "embezzlement".

Many people believe that this is adhering to the old laws of ten years ago and that it is somewhat "excessive" in terms of human sentiment.

But I don't think it's indefensible. The spirit of the rule of law is "trust". In order to gain the trust of the people, Shang Yang practiced the implementation of a heavy reward of one thousand gold for the people's movement of a stick to show the strictness of the unwritten law. Similarly, it is overcorrection, but in a country that is not accustomed to the rule of law, and wants to implement the rule of law strictly, it is indeed necessary to do a few things that are overcorrected and not close to human sentiment to show the rigidity and inviolability of the spirit of the rule of law and to show the iron fist for both big and small matters, so as to achieve the propaganda effect of reforming the stubborn and establishing the timid.

Therefore, although we sympathize with the misfortune of this toothpaste and shirt embezzler, we also feel that if it has the effect of thoroughly arousing the spirit of the rule of law, it is not necessarily a joyful thing, and it is not necessary to feel sorry for one or two people.

However, the spirit of Shang Yang cannot be imitated without reservation. For example, "The crown prince commits a crime, and his teacher is punished" was considered to be an incredible impartiality at the time, but even today, it still means "the noble is not punished," and to the extreme, it is still not exempt from punishing those who steal hooks, while those who steal countries are still lords. And for the need to strictly implement the rule of law in China today - punishing corruption is exactly what is taboo, a slight difference, and it will often be wrong by a thousand miles, inevitably receiving the opposite effect. Showing that one does not dare to touch the tiger's whiskers is to help the tiger grow its power. "Killing the chicken to scare the monkey" is okay, but scaring the tiger is not.

A few days ago, Ling Xiaohan, the owner of the pavilion, talked about the old diplomat Shi Zhaoji. Shi's style in the diplomatic circle is different from others. Taking this opportunity, I will talk about Shi's brief history in the diplomatic circle.

In modern times, Zhejiang has a great number of talents in the diplomatic circle, such as Wang Daxie, Sun Baoqi, Hu Weide, Shen Ruilin, Huang Fu, Shi Zhaoji, Wang Zhengting, etc., who are the best of the best.

Shi Zhaoji, alias Zhi Zhi, is a native of Hangxian, Zhejiang, and is currently 69 years old. He is the son of Shi Zejing, a former Qing scholar. After graduating from St. John's University in Shanghai, he went to the United States to study, first entering Washington High School, and then Cornell University. He studied in the United States for ten years and obtained a master's degree. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, he returned to China and served as the foreign affairs secretary of Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Huguang. The following year, he served as the supervisor of students studying in the United States and went to the United States. Soon after, he served as the first-class counselor to the minister for inspecting the political affairs of various countries. At that time, the Qing court was sending Zaize, Dai Hongci, Xu Shichang, Duanfang, Shaoying, etc., to various countries in the East and West to inspect the constitution. Soon after, Shi returned to China and successively served as Wang Shi of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, Chief Supervisor of the Jinghan Railway, and Binjiang Customs Daotai. In the third year of Xuantong, he was transferred to the post of Jilin Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Zuo You Cheng of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Soon after, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, Mexico, Peru, and Cuba, but he did not go abroad because of the Wuchang Uprising in the autumn of the Xinhai year.

In the first year of the Republic of China, Tang Shaoyi served as the first prime minister of the cabinet, and he served as the Minister of Transportation. However, because most of the officials in the ministry were old officials from the Ministry of Posts and Communications, he was unable to control them and had to resign and was transferred to the post of Grand Master of Ceremonies of the Presidential Palace. In June of the third year of the Republic of China, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United Kingdom, where he served for more than six years. In October of the ninth year of the Republic, he was transferred to the post of ambassador to the United States. In January of the twelfth year of the Republic, Zhang Shaozeng promoted the policy of peaceful reunification and proposed that Shi serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Because he did not receive the approval of the National Assembly, he did not take office and was replaced by Huang Fu. After a while, Zhang's cabinet thought about overthrowing Li Yuanhong because of the Tianjin and Baoding factions, saying that there were still members of the Li faction in Zhang's cabinet, and advocated overthrowing Zhang's cabinet. Therefore, Zhang's cabinet fell after a short time. Due to the political turmoil, Shi once again served as the ambassador to the United States. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, he served as the plenipotentiary representative of the Tariff Conference. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Zhili faction restored its power, and Yan Huiqing served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and also acted as the President of the Republic. Shi was once appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but he did not take office. When the National Government was established, he took office as the ambassador to the United Kingdom.

When the "September 18th" Incident in Shenyang occurred, the Japanese seized the Northeast, and our country appealed to the League of Nations. He served as the representative of our country to the League of Nations, accusing Japan of occupying the Northeast. It is a violation of international law and infringes upon Chinese sovereignty. Please ask the member states to advocate justice and provide assistance, which has won international sympathy.

In October of the twentieth year of the Republic, the government appointed him as the Minister of Foreign Affairs again, but he did not take office. In January of the twenty-second year, he was appointed as the ambassador to the United States, and in the twenty-fourth year, he was promoted to the ambassador plenipotentiary to the United States. He resigned in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic, and Wang Zhengting succeeded him.

In summary, he spent the most time as a diplomat in the United Kingdom and the United States, and he did not take office for several times as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in China. Comparatively speaking, it can be said that he was both fortunate and unfortunate.

He is very honest and belongs to the steady faction. He does not take risks or claim credit. He is the kind of person who is down-to-earth.

### Regarding "Loving Mother"

— Nian Xin

It is common in the world to use "strict father" and "loving mother" as different names for parents, such as "my late father" and "your esteemed mother". There is no objection to the former, but the term "loving mother" is not actually referring to the legal wife or biological mother. Gu Tinglin's Daily Knowledge Records, Volume 5, item "Loving Mother Like Mother" says: "What is a loving mother? When the child is young and the mother dies, the child is raised by the father's concubine. When the father dies, the child mourns for three years to repay the kindness of raising him." The reason why a loving mother mourns for the legal son is because of the labor of raising and nurturing him, so the mourning should be "like a mother", and the mourning must be ordered by the father and cannot be decided by himself. Secondly, Wang Renqiu's "Stories with Xiang" says: "The mother of Prince Gongzhong was the loving mother of Emperor Wenzong (Xianfeng). Empress Dowager Quan entrusted her to Concubine Kangci, and Concubine Kangci gave up her son to breastfeed Emperor Wenzong, so she was like a close sibling with the Prince." The term "loving mother" originally had practical content, but the reason why the world uses "loving" to replace "mother" may be because women are often kind and amiable. However, in Li Lingbo's (Mi) "Memorial of Emotions," there is a phrase "Six months after giving birth to a child, the loving father passed away," then the word "loving" can still be used for the father, which is the opposite of "strict father". Could it be that Li's father was also not his biological father? In my opinion, based on the long-standing habit of today, it may be okay to use a single word "loving" (such as "your late loving mother"), but it would be wrong to directly replace the legal wife or biological mother with "loving mother".

### West Point's New Style

— Jiu Jiu

First, let me give a note: This "West Point" is the United States Military Academy, the oldest military academy in the United States, not the "West Point" of "cream West Point".

World War II caused a major revolution in strategy and tactics, so West Point, which is responsible for training army cadres, has adopted a completely new teaching method. The American army will soon undergo a complete transformation, sweeping away the habits of old-fashioned soldiers and becoming a stronger, more scientific, and more down-to-earth team.

For example, in World War II, many young officers with higher education often commanded combat in a gentle, easy, and extremely firm and brave tone, unlike old-fashioned officers who shouted, "An order is an order, and soldiers should only obey!" But in fact, those young officers were often able to win the love of their soldiers, while those old-fashioned officers who specialized in putting on airs were often complained about in the troops, greatly reducing efficiency. The American military authorities are very clear about this situation, so West Point's education method has also taken a new direction.

In the past, West Point's upperclassmen could order around underclassmen, almost as if they were servants. Now, this tradition of more than 140 years has been completely broken. The entire military education at West Point has abandoned the formalistic style of the past. West Point Superintendent Taylor said: "We will not tolerate those who are unqualified among our officers. The task of our soldiers is becoming more and more difficult year by year. The officers we need must be first-class leaders; more importantly, they must have a deep understanding of human nature and be good at dealing with personnel problems. We are now going to train this kind of officer."

In the eyes of old-fashioned officers, this is completely nonsense. They only know how to work hard - at the expense of gaining a reputation for being arbitrary and self-willed in order to maintain their prestige. But times have changed, and there is no place for old diehards. West Point's most important subject right now is "Military Leadership Psychology." The instructors responsible for teaching this subject clearly tell the students: In battle, no matter who it is, there is always some fear in their hearts. At this time, the commander must try to suppress his own fear and deal with it calmly; if he can give the soldiers something to do, he can reduce some of their fear.

The instructor repeatedly urged his students that when issuing orders, the wording must be precise, and there must be absolutely no ambiguity, exaggeration, or impatience.

Once in class, the instructor asked a question and asked the students to answer. The question was: If you are a battalion commander, several important people are coming to visit your stationed position, and maybe they will inspect it. And one of the soldiers in your battalion, named Harris, is usually willing to work hard, but whenever he is inspected, he is always overly nervous and his steps cannot be uniform. Now, you need to find a way to keep Harris from participating in this inspection, but also save his face. How should you deal with it?

Then, he assigned a student to be the battalion commander, and he himself played Harris. He said: "Suppose you are the battalion commander and just called me in - start now."

The "battalion commander" hesitated for a long time and said: "Tell you - about this inspection - the regimental commander said that you can be exempted from participating. Anyway, several trucks will also be assembled for inspection, so you can sit in the truck and take a look."

Then there was a discussion. The students expressed great dissatisfaction with this "battalion commander". According to his method, first, Harris's mood must not be happy, and second, it is not smart to push the responsibility for not wanting Harris to participate onto the regimental commander.

The second "battalion commander" was different. He first said to Harris, "Please sit down," and then gave him a cigarette. Then he sincerely said: "Harris, you probably already know that several important people are coming tomorrow. I am now assigning you to be their adjutant and represent our troops to entertain them. This is an honor, and I think I don't need to say more. When they inspect, you will be by their side. I believe you will give them a good impression."

This method was immediately praised by everyone.

Do you say that it is not worth the effort to work on these minor details? When you are in danger, you will know how important these "Harrises" are! Most of West Point's 2,000 students have experienced battles in World War II, and they unanimously believe that this education of "winning the love of soldiers" is the most valuable subject!

### Spring Tour Grass Three

— San Mu

Singing at the Summit of the Misty Peak

In the past, climbing and visiting cost a lot of candle wax, and I always hated that mountains and waters were difficult to combine. The Yandang Mountain Xiangyan Lake is truly amazing, and the Taiwan Sun Moon Lake is also described. Is it possible to use mountains and waters as a means? As if making a cup from the flexible willow. Stone Man Mountain is like a towering hungry tiger, with a peak rising straight into the clouds. Braving thorns and new thorns, passing through the steep slope, I tried to imitate the snake's winding body. Pressing my eyebrows and lowering my head for more than a hundred steps, suddenly my breath was clear to the blue sky. The chaotic rocks are densely arranged and steep, the strong wind shakes the stone, and the thunder roars. People are like mice lying down, and the stone people stand. At this time, the wonderful fun is hard to express. Looking up at the primordial chaos, and looking down at the universe, the vast smoke fills the air. The lake waves are thirty-six thousand acres, rippling and swirling around each other. Seventy-two peaks are all crawling, like lying dragons and crouching toads. A touch of distant green connects the sky, and the sails are clearly arranged like stars. Climbing high and enjoying the scenery is enough to satisfy, and sitting down, I regret the past years of barren travel. Now the armor is full of heaven and earth, and the world looks to the empty clouds and mountains. Is this question suitable for a place to avoid Qin? People say that the hidden grass is deep in the dust! Alas! I want to return now, but I can't return. Even if I return, I am afraid that there will be many mistakes. The Lingwei Sushu cannot be seen, and there is no way to dry the hot tears of mourning.

### Automobiles in Germany

— Zhang Lianshi

Selling and buying cars is a business that is easy to make money in Germany. In Berlin, some American officials often sell their own cars because they are ordered to return home soon, which is inconvenient to carry on the journey, and they often get unexpected income.

An American military interpreter bought a light American-style car for 1,500 yuan (US dollars) six months ago. During these six months, the car traveled about 10,000 miles for him. Now that he is about to return home, he decided to sell the car, and as a result, it was sold for 2,350 yuan. Not only did he ride 10,000 miles for free, but he also made 850 yuan.

An American liaison officer bought a large bus for 2,200 yuan a year ago. During this year, he traveled 30,000 miles. When he sold it a month ago, in addition to the capital of 2,200 yuan, he also made a profit of 1,550 yuan.

An American sergeant bought a 1939 two-door light car (made in Germany) for 375 yuan six months ago, but now he sold it for 1,000 yuan.

When the war ended, there was a strange story of "Cigarette Automobile" in Germany. At that time, 50 boxes of American cigarettes could be exchanged for a streamlined light car.

Recently, the US military authorities, in view of the serious shortage of German cars, have implemented a strategy of importing a large number of American cars. At the same time, it is strictly forbidden for US military officers and soldiers to sell cars, and it is forbidden for returning US military personnel to obtain undue profits when selling their own cars. If a returning US military personnel sells his own car and makes a profit of more than 1,200 yuan, if it is found out, he will be fined to return all the profits to the owner of the car.

An American second lieutenant named Johnson was one who had bad luck. Before returning home, he sold his own car and made a profit of 1,500 yuan, which exceeded the limit stipulated by the authorities. As a result, he was investigated and had to return 1,500 yuan in full to the buyer of the car in accordance with the law. Since the law was enacted, he was the first person to be punished.

### Check

— Hong Xian

The popularity of checks did not start today, but it is most popular today. Just look at the so-called upper class, which person's pocket does not have a checkbook?

Ask the merchants, they are very welcome to creditworthy checks, because that can reduce a lot of trouble.

So the bank invented traveler's checks because of this, and the post office imitated it, and as a result, drafts, bank drafts, and checks are simply three in one, and it is much more convenient to use.

Unfortunately, the banknotes and stamps we use have not adopted the check-style blank, otherwise, wouldn't it be more labor-saving to fill in them as you use them?

### Supplement to the Old People of this Newspaper

— Zheng Yimei

The previous article recorded the old people of this newspaper in the past, but there are still some pearls left behind. Now I will collect them again to supplement the talk.

Liu Shipei from Yizheng, Jiangsu, alias Shenshu, flaunted national studies, recited the revolution, and once founded the National Studies Preservation Association in Shanghai with Huang Huiwen, Deng Dimei, and others, publishing the National Essence Journal. Shenshu lived in the association and also served as the pen government of this newspaper. He had a broken old bus to travel back and forth, writing an essay every day without signing his name. What he discussed was to the point, and people spread it widely. Jin Jianhua, alias Yongliu, was good at writing lyrics and served as the pen government of this newspaper for a long time. It is said that he is still alive today. Sun Dongwu and I were friends of the year. He was thin and long, spoke the light Wu dialect, and traveled all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. He was in charge of the editorial of this newspaper, writing fluently and freely, relying on the horse to wait. He was versed in old learning, and his words were carefully considered, and his writing was particularly elegant and readable. He also signed his name as Dongwu Old Sun. In his later years, he was addicted to opium, and his body became weaker and weaker. He died during the Anti-Japanese War. Wu Juemi was good at writing humorous articles and was the editor-in-chief of Freedom Talk for more than a year. Chen Diexian was in charge of Freedom Talk and the Home Knowledge column, which was very popular among readers. When Diexian solicited articles for Freedom Talk, he divided them into A, B, C, and D for remuneration. Someone copied a relatively unpopular and unfamiliar article from Liu Hedong's anthology, signed a name at will, and sent it to Diexian. It was published the next day and classified as C. Someone wrote a letter saying that this was an article by Liu Liuzhou, and deliberately did it as a test of the judge's judgment. Liu Liuzhou's article was C, then who is worthy of A? Diexian forcibly blamed himself and cancelled the grade. In addition, the illustrator was Qian Binghe from Wuxing. Binghe was first the director of the pictures of the three newspapers Min Hu Min Yu Min Li. The Three People's Daily advocated revolution, and its sharpness was unparalleled. Therefore, he was known as the old revolutionary painter. He entered this newspaper to make satirical paintings for many years. Because of his difficult situation, he believed that the name was unlucky, so he changed Binghe to Zhenhe. How could he know that the situation was even worse? In his later years, he also changed his name to Shichao, and ended up in poverty, which is very pitiful.
