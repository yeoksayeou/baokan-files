### Du Yuming's Three Army Corps Take Firm Stand Near Yongcheng; Liu Zhi to Return to Nanjing for Duty Report in Two or Three Days

[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] The current situation of the three army corps under the command of Du Yuming clearly indicates that it is no longer the key point on the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield. Because the unit has been able to stand firm near Yongcheng, the authorities have also dispelled the plan to send troops to attack north and planned for the unit to go south. The unit is northeast of Yongcheng, with Li's army corps as the rear, Sun's army corps as the left flank, and Qiu's army corps as the right flank, forming a triangular position. Because there are too many wounded soldiers and depleted weaponry, it is more difficult to move south. It is also learned that since the pressure of the bandits on the northern front has been reduced, some remnant bandits have fled to the southern part of Henan. At the moment, the military here is quite concerned about the situation in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway.

[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] Military news: There is no change in the battle situation here. The Communist Anhui North Independent Brigade has fled to the vicinity of Baojiaji. The Jinpu and Huainan Railways have been clear for days.

[Our Bengbu Correspondent, 26th] It is learned that since the Bengbu-Suzhou battle came to an end, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi is still stationed here, planning new deployments. Now that the mission has been completed, he will return to Nanjing in two or three days for a duty report.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 26th] Well-informed sources said today that the Eastern China Nationalist Army Headquarters will merge with Tang Enbo's Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters after relocating south from Bengbu to Chuzhou. It is expected that Liu Zhi will serve as the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist Army.

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] Three government armies arrived in Nanjing on the 26th after moving east from the Bengbu front and were reported to be heading to the canal area in northern Jiangsu to reinforce defenses. These three armies were the 39th and 54th Armies of Li Yannian's 6th Army Corps, and the 18th Army of Huang Wei's Army Corps, led by Hu Lian. These three armies were transported by train from Bengbu to Nanjing and are currently undergoing replenishment and rest in the suburbs of Nanjing in order to return to the front. The Xiaguan ferry and Pukou railway station are filled with these soldiers who fought fiercely with the Communist army for a month and returned fully equipped. It is believed that these three armies will head north to strengthen the government's defenses to prevent the Communist army from spying on the Yangtze River. Soldiers and officers of the three armies marched across the snowy streets of Nanjing on the 22nd to temporary barracks in Tangshan. One soldier replied to a question that they were relieved in Bengbu North by several new armies, including the 20th Army, and came to the Nanjing area for rest. According to reports on the 26th, the lines were quiet to the north of Bengbu and southwest of Xuzhou due to poor weather and muddy battle roads.

### Crossing the Fire Line to Visit Yenching University; Foreign Reporter Reports That Situation is Normal

[United Press Reporter Jean Lyon, Beiping, 25th] Forty hours ago, this reporter crossed the Nationalist-Communist fire lines in an attempt to visit Yenching University, six miles from the city, and ended up spending 24 hours in a Communist army headquarters besieging Beiping.

On the morning of the 24th, this reporter obtained permission from a Nationalist army commander on the front line to cross the Nationalist army outposts and proceed to the Communist-occupied area. On the way, I met a Communist soldier who helped me safely pass through the Communist-occupied towns and reach Yenching University, where everything was normal and the music never stopped. This reporter had a brief conversation with Acting President Dr. Lu Zhiwei, who said that the Communist army had not yet entered Yenching University, and that the faculty and students were free to move in the suburbs. The Communist political representative in the area once visited the school to speak to the students. Foreign professors are safe and able to continue lecturing with complete freedom. In this reporter's judgment, the foreign professors at Tsinghua University are also safe.

While at Yenching University, this reporter came into contact with a young Communist political worker and was able to enter a Communist army headquarters attacking Beiping. This reporter was taken by Communist Jeep at night to the headquarters in a small village in the mountains north of Beiping, where I met with a senior Communist political worker and stayed until noon on the 25th before returning. While at the headquarters, the Communist side treated this reporter with courtesy, and the food and accommodation were good. We chatted casually without any restrictions, but I was told not to reveal the location of the headquarters, military symbols, or any other information before being allowed to return to Beiping. However, this reporter refused to answer, and at noon on the 25th, I returned to the area near Yenching University by Jeep.

This reporter saw many Communist heavy artillery units in the area, indicating that the Communist army could fire into the city if necessary. When this reporter asked whether the Communist army would shell the city of Beiping, the Communist army refused to answer. This reporter also saw that the Communist army had many light machine guns, machine guns, and light field guns. In the villages where this reporter stayed and where the Communist army was stationed, the situation was normal, and Communist slogans were posted on the walls, including "Down with British and American Imperialism" and "Protect the Lives and Property of Foreigners."

### Legislative Yuan Scheduled to Hold Routine Meeting Tomorrow Morning; New President to Take Office at the Same Time; Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng to Host Tea Party and Reception Today to Entertain Legislators

### Washington Observation: Peace Treaty with Japan Unlikely to Be Established in the Short Term; No Concrete Expression of Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 26th] As the year hurries to an end, the new year brings with it countless international questions, and Japan is becoming increasingly important in American strategic thinking. Inevitably and naturally, China is linked to this thinking. In Washington's view, the future of Japan is intertwined with China. When reviewing the relationship between Japan and Asia at the end of the year, two major questions arise: one is the peace treaty with Japan, and the other is Japan's position and technology in the overall policy. A third question arises from this, namely, the possibility of Japan becoming an obstacle to communism. The results of discussions between United Press and various government departments indicate that the current view in Washington is as follows: a peace treaty with Japan is absolutely impossible to be established in the short term.

The four powers have not yet indicated any change in their positions that would allow the peace treaty to be drafted. The United States originally advocated a two-thirds majority system for passing the draft of the peace treaty, but China and the Soviet Union strongly opposed it, insisting on retaining the power of veto. Reliable sources say that this situation remains the same, and neither side is willing to compromise. Well-informed sources compare the situation in Japan with that in Germany. Both need a peace treaty, but both are unlikely to get a peace treaty while the East-West "Cold War" continues at its current level. They say that, on the contrary, if the tense situation between the Soviet-dominated world and the Western democracies can be improved to some extent, all aspects of the situation can be improved proportionately. If there is hope for a peace treaty with Germany, a peace treaty with Japan can also be achieved easily, and vice versa. Failure in one will lead to failure in both.

The second question is the United States' policy towards China. It is extremely difficult to point to a certain stage in Sino-American relations and say: "Look, this is the policy towards China." When asked to explain the United States' policy towards China, State Department officials advised the questioner to refer to the statements made by Truman, Marshall, and the State Department since 1945, as well as the measures taken by Congress on aid-to-China bills. Whether publicly or privately, officials refuse to make concrete statements. Undersecretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference that U.S. policy remained unchanged, and would continue to be based on the decision of Congress, which recognized the Nationalist government and implemented certain special assistance. Luo repeatedly emphasized to the inquirer that the United States had not changed its policy towards China, but he was unwilling to say more. One reporter said that, to the best of his recollection, the most recent U.S. policy statement advocated cooperation among all parties in China, including the Chinese Communist Party, to which Luo said his memory was incorrect.

### Calling on the Netherlands to Ceasefire Immediately

The Netherlands, disregarding the truce agreement, launched a fierce offensive on the 18th of this month against Yogyakarta, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, with its elite troops. This reignited the flames of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, which has lasted for three years, causing indignation among peace-loving people around the world and condemnation from public opinion in various countries. Even the Netherlands' ally, the United States, cannot but denounce the Netherlands' actions in the East Indies as an act of aggression. The United Nations Security Council, meeting in Paris to discuss the Dutch-Indonesian problem, heard representatives of various member states condemn the Netherlands in strong terms. The Soviet representative called for "sanctions" against the Netherlands, and the Australian representative strongly advocated expelling the Netherlands from the United Nations. The Security Council ultimately passed a resolution endorsed by China and the United States, ordering both the Netherlands and Indonesia to cease fire immediately, and decided to include this issue on today's agenda to investigate whether the Netherlands is complying with this ceasefire order.

In today's world, where the United Nations has not yet become an effective institution for maintaining world peace, it is understandable that the Security Council can only make this resolution. However, whether this order can turn hostility into friendship within Indonesia depends on the attitudes of both the Netherlands and Indonesia. According to a United Press report from Batavia on the 25th, the Indonesian Republican government has proposed five conditions for accepting the ceasefire order: (1) Immediate release of Indonesian Republican leaders; (2) Withdrawal of troops to the defense lines before December 18; (3) Recognition, de facto and de jure, of the sovereignty of the Indonesian Republic in the three states of Java, Sumatra, and Madura; (4) Organization of an independent Indonesian state free from Dutch interference; (5) Complete withdrawal of Dutch troops to their home country after the establishment of the new government. From whatever perspective we observe the five conditions put forward by Indonesia, they can generally be considered "reasonable"; moreover, we believe that these five conditions are not only prerequisites for a ceasefire, but also the premise for whether the Dutch-Indonesian conflict can be resolved rationally. Therefore, whether the flames of war in Indonesia can be extinguished immediately depends entirely on the attitude of the Netherlands.

Although the Dutch military authorities used the three services of the army, navy, and air force to attack Yogyakarta, the capital of Indonesia, under the pretext of "anti-communism," the Netherlands cannot cover up the truth from the world. The essence of the Indonesian movement is a national liberation movement that demands freedom, equality, and independence, not an international communist revolution. This is known to the world. The Dutch government cannot refuse to accept the Security Council's ceasefire order on the grounds that it "will be exploited by the communists." However, the Netherlands, relying on the superiority of its army, navy, and air force, still holds a colonial attitude towards Indonesia. Having lightly initiated war, it is difficult to expect it to readily accept a ceasefire order afterwards. The Dutch cabinet will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the Security Council's ceasefire order, but it is feared that it will still maintain a stubborn attitude to the end, with no signs of remorse or a willingness to abandon the war and seek peace. Therefore, we cannot but worry about the Indonesian people, and we cannot but express infinite concern for the countless overseas Chinese in our country who will suffer collateral damage.

Putting aside the Dutch-Indonesian problem itself, in terms of its impact on Southeast Asia and even the entire world, if the Netherlands refuses to accept the Security Council's ceasefire order, its consequences will be unimaginable. First, if the Security Council's resolution cannot take effect in the Netherlands, its credibility will be completely lost. Who will be willing to believe that it is an effective institution for maintaining world peace in the future? In order to maintain its credibility, the Security Council will inevitably consider the issue of imposing sanctions on the Netherlands. If it does, the United Nations organization will again encounter an unprecedentedly serious test. Second, looking at the situation in Asia, it is already extremely serious, and the flames of war in Indonesia cannot be allowed to reignite. Everyone knows that today's Asia has hardly any peaceful land left. Northeast Asia is already under the control of the Communist International, China is on the verge of "reddening," and Southeast Asia has also felt the threat of the Communist International. If great international politicians do not start from the aspect of "peace and prosperity" to promote the stability of Southeast Asian countries, then Southeast Asia will inevitably fall into the "iron curtain" sooner or later. Although the Netherlands' use of force against Indonesia is under the pretext of "anti-communism," the result of its use of force may be counterproductive, merely making Indonesia more suitable as a hotbed for communism. Therefore, for the sake of the stability of Southeast Asia, and at the same time for the sake of the entire Asia avoiding catastrophe, we must call on the Dutch authorities to immediately accept the Security Council's ceasefire order, and then seek a rational solution to the Dutch-Indonesian problem through peaceful methods and diplomatic channels!

### If Dutch Troops Withdraw to Original Positions, Indonesia is Willing to Order a Ceasefire; Mediation Committee Finds Mission Difficult

[United Press Batavia, 26th] The Indonesian interim government radio announced today that if Dutch troops first withdraw to their pre-offensive positions, Indonesia will respond by ordering a ceasefire. The Dutch troops should also release the detained Indonesian President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta. According to Indonesian sources, the interim government is located on the island of Giroepo, and had been entrusted by Prime Minister Hatta.

[Associated Press Batavia, 26th] The UN Mediation Committee cabled the Security Council on the 26th stating: "Although the Security Council has ordered the Mediation Committee to monitor military actions in Indonesia, in reality this is extremely impossible. The cable pointed out that the demarcation line no longer exists, and the Mediation Committee is unable to accurately distinguish between Dutch-Indonesian military actions and Dutch security measures." The cable stated: "The Committee will do its best to execute the powers granted to it..., but if negotiations replace warfare, the Committee unanimously recognizes that certain unavoidable difficulties must first be overcome..., the members of the Committee only slightly disagree on the weight of the aforementioned difficulties.... In fact, at a time when the demarcation line no longer exists, the position of the Indonesian Republican Army is truly impossible to determine, as the Dutch troops have captured the Indonesian supreme command. Therefore, the Committee may have to pay attention to any military actions throughout the three islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura. This in itself makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between Dutch security measures and the war between the Dutch and Indonesians." The cable also accused the Dutch of violating Article 10 of the ceasefire agreement, as the Dutch declaration of war was delivered to the American Commissioner in Batavia, and not directly to the Chairman of the Mediation Committee stationed in Kaliurang. It also stated: "At that time, the Chairman of the Committee had been notified and knew that 'Dutch troops had been operating in the Republic for more than three days after crossing the status quo line.'" The Mediation Committee also accused the Netherlands of not notifying the Republic of military actions in accordance with the ceasefire agreement. The cable pointed out that "the notice delivered to the Secretary-General of the Republic's delegation was not in the form of a note as stipulated in Article 10, especially since the Dutch government had cut off communication with the Republic, and therefore the content of the Dutch letter could not possibly be made known to the government of the Republic. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary-General himself was arrested..." The Mediation Committee's cable concluded: "While the ceasefire agreement was still fully in effect, the Dutch government did not provide effective notification when abolishing the agreement, and Dutch troops immediately crossed the status quo line and launched hostile military actions against the Indonesian Republic."

### Dutch Disregard UN Ceasefire Order, Announce Occupation of Madiun, Thus Dutch Control All Major Cities in Java

[United Press Batavia, 25th] Dutch troops today disregarded the UN ceasefire order and occupied Madiun, the last major city of the Indonesian Republic, and now control almost all of Java. Most of Sumatra has also fallen into Dutch hands. Indonesian troops have retreated into the mountains.

[Associated Press Batavia, 25th] The Dutch military headquarters announced on the 25th that it had occupied Madiun. Madiun is the location where the Indonesian Communist Party uprising occurred twelve days in September, located about 335 miles east of Batavia, and is an important intersection of highways and railways in Central Java. Since occupying Madiun, the Netherlands now possesses all the major cities and highways throughout Java. The Dutch military headquarters also announced that the Dutch troops have begun large-scale mopping-up operations in the entire area occupied in the past week, which indicates that the Java war has now become a war between the Dutch troops and mobile guerrillas.

[Agence France-Presse Batavia, 25th] The only area currently fully controlled by the Republican Army is the Madiun area of East Java. Since the Dutch launched a full-scale offensive, the Republican Army in Madiun has cooperated with the Communist forces to offer strong resistance to the Dutch troops. The commander-in-chief of the allied forces is Tayamuraka, who gave a broadcast speech on December 21st, emphasizing resistance to the end. On the other hand, it is highly doubtful whether the Dutch are willing to obey the Security Council's ceasefire order before they have fully achieved their goals, that is, completely eliminating the Indonesian army.

### Sukarno and Hatta Escorted Away From Yogyakarta

Possibly Detained on Another Small Island

### Indian Prime Minister Nehru Visits the Nizam of Hyderabad

Related to Political Organizations in the State

[Central News Agency New Delhi, 25th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru and the Nizam of Hyderabad held their first courtesy visit to each other in Hyderabad. The Nizam of Hyderabad visiting the Indian Prime Minister at the former British official residence broke a century-old custom of Hyderabad, and Nehru paying with a coin when the Nizam agreed to meet was also an exception. It is customary for distinguished guests visiting the Nizam of Hyderabad to make a donation. It is widely believed that Nehru's visit to Hyderabad is related to the political organizations in the state. The Socialist Party in the state will submit a memorandum to Nehru, signed by 4,000 comrades, demanding the immediate abolition of the Nizam. The Congress Party in Hyderabad wants to organize an interim government as soon as possible to replace the military government in the state.

[Agence France-Presse New Delhi, 26th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru addressed 500,000 people from the grandstand of the Hyderabad Fanteh Grand Square on the 25th, stating: Hyderabad should end its current military rule and establish an interim government, with all power in the hands of the people themselves, and the people should realize this responsibility. In reviewing the situation in India, Nehru attacked the Communist Party for constantly making arrogant and provocative statements to the people, inciting them to take the path of riots and revolution.

### Security Council to Meet Today to Discuss New Situation in Palestine; Fierce Artillery Battles Between Egyptians and Jews in Negev

[Agence France-Presse Tel Aviv, 25th] Israeli representative to Paris, Fish, stated that when the Security Council reconvenes on Monday to discuss the Palestine issue, Israel does not intend to send a special representative to attend.

[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 26th] The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today denying the Israeli government's accusation that the Egyptian government had taken free action in the Negev after refusing the Security Council's resolution and being unwilling to sign a permanent truce agreement.

The Egyptian statement strongly stated that Egypt had already announced its acceptance of the Security Council's resolutions of November 16th and December 4th, but the counter-proposal put forward by Egypt was that the Jewish forces must also comply with the provisions of the two resolutions. The statement concluded by requesting the Security Council to immediately convene a meeting to review the new situation arising from the Jewish aggression.

[Associated Press Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian Minister of Military Affairs stated today that fighting in the Negev desert area is continuing, and Egyptian forces shot down an Israeli aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. According to the Ministry of Military Affairs' communiqué, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, and Egyptians and Jews exchanged artillery and rifle fire throughout the day.

### Soviet Union Establishes Five Air Routes to the Holy Land

### Egypt Sends Envoy to Spain to Promote Friendship Between the Two Countries

[Associated Press Cairo, 26th] It was revealed on the 26th that the Egyptian government, disregarding the UN ban, has appointed Fatheya So as its ambassador to Spain. He was previously the ambassador to Iran. Observers pointed out that the Arab countries are preoccupied with Palestine and urgently need the support of the world, so Egypt and Lebanon have recently been working to promote friendly relations between the Arab countries and Spain and South American countries.

### Allied Personnel in Tokyo Agree That the US Should Join the Far East League; Confident that the Soviet Union Will Not Risk War in Asia

[Associated Press Vice President Vaughn, Tokyo, 26th] The report that Commonwealth leaders are considering holding an "Eastern Conference" to plan for the united resistance of Asian democratic countries against the aggression of the Communist Party and Soviet totalitarianism has been received here with great interest. Allied leaders in Tokyo have long discussed the need for such a meeting informally, and some Americans undoubtedly agree with this proposal and believe that the United States should also participate. They pointed out that Washington has a moral obligation to defend Japan and the Philippines and is extremely concerned about both countries. If such a conference is to be held, and the United States and the Philippines participate, Manila may be suggested as a suitable location. If such a conference is purely held by the countries belonging to the Commonwealth, then Singapore or Kuala Lumpur may be chosen. Due to the competition between India and Pakistan, the meeting will not be held in New Delhi or Karachi. Senior observers here do not believe that China will be completely communist, and that any assistance given to the Chinese government will trigger a crisis of war with the Soviet Union. These observers are confident that the Soviet Union is determined not to risk war in Asia at this time. They insist that the Soviet Union is clearly not prepared to fight in Asia.

### Eisenhower Views the World Situation: War Can Be Avoided for Now

If the next world war comes, its devastation will be unprecedented.

### Drafting of North Atlantic Treaty Proceeding Smoothly; Turkey Strongly Argues for the Need to Participate in the Treaty

However, according to diplomatic sources familiar with the matter, the negotiations are proceeding very smoothly.

[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 25th] Semi-official newspapers here, which can reflect the views of the Turkish government, have recently strongly argued that Turkey should be allowed to participate in the Atlantic Treaty. Currently, there is a consensus in Turkey that if the Soviet Union knows that Turkey will participate in the war, even if it is not directly attacked, it must closely unite with other countries, then the Soviet Union will not dare to launch a war rashly.

### British Ambition to Establish New Trade Agreement is of Great Significance; Britain Assists Yugoslavia in Completing Industrialization Plan

[Popular News Agency Belgrade, 26th] Diplomatic circles say that since the British-Yugoslav trade agreement was formally announced on the evening of the 25th, Tito is even more fearless in his fight against the Cominform. The new British-Yugoslav agreement is for a period of one year, stipulating the exchange of goods worth 120 million yuan, and was signed in London on the 23rd. Two weeks ago, Britain and Yugoslavia also signed another agreement, stipulating that a British company will assist Yugoslavia in establishing a five-year plan to expand and modernize Yugoslav industry. They pointed out that the Yugoslav delegation's negotiations in Moscow have not made any progress so far, so the new British-Yugoslav agreement is all the more important.

### Our Country's Muslim Pilgrimage Group Expected to Return to Shanghai Today

[Our Reporter] Our country's Muslim pilgrimage group, a party of two hundred, embarked from Shanghai in mid-October of this year and arrived in Mecca, the holy land of Islam in early October. After holding a grand pilgrimage ceremony on "Loyalty and Filial Piety Day," they took the "Hunan" cargo ship to return home and are expected to arrive in port this morning. The Chinese Islamic Association has sent Director Ding Zhenting and Acting Director Jin Hongkui to Shanghai to jointly handle the reception matters with the local Muslims. According to the Association, this year a total of 350,000 Muslims from various countries participated in the pilgrimage, which was an unprecedentedly grand occasion. Pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam. Muslims who have some economic means should make a pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime, gathering in one place every year, living together with pure hearts, which is truly a symbol of human peace and world harmony, they said.

### Distribution Period for November Accumulation Point Certificates to be Decided Soon

[Our Reporter] After the Bureau of Materials Supply completed the distribution of accumulation points for October, there has been no news about the distribution of accumulation points for November. Public education personnel are all concerned about this. According to Director Jiang of the bureau, he told reporters yesterday: The distribution of accumulation points for November could have followed October, but the Ministry of National Defense needs to allocate a large batch of materials from the bureau for the supply of materials to the soldiers at the front, so it is currently checking how many materials are still in the bureau. After the Ministry of National Defense extracts the materials it needs, the remaining materials can be distributed proportionally to the public education institutions with special November accumulation point certificates. It is expected that the distribution of accumulation points for November will be decided before Wednesday of this week. As for the rumors that the bureau currently only has mirrors, peach wood medicines, and glasses, this is not true. However, since most of them are materials that have been selected and left over, it cannot be guaranteed that everything will be practical, he said.

### Second Annual Meeting of the Chinese Technology Association Opens; Group Visits to Major Industrial Institutions Today

[Our Reporter] The second annual meeting of the Chinese Technology Association officially opened at Jiaotong University yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. More than 300 members of the association registered and attended. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Tai City Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zeng Shirong, Deputy Director of the Two Roads Bureau, Wang Zhizhuo, President of Jiaotong University, Zhao Guoliang, Director of the First China Textile Factory, agricultural expert He Shangping, and others also participated. It can be called the last grand event of the academic world in the city this year.

### Building a New China is Everyone's Responsibility

After the meeting opened, Song Mingshi, Chairman of the Technology Association, reported on the association's affairs, saying: The second annual meeting of the Technology Association and the industrial technology exhibition are being held here at the end of the year, which is a major review of the work of all members. In the two or three years after the victory, members in various places have been working hard at their posts for China's construction cause. Although the environment is difficult, talented young technicians should shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new China, and it is their unshirkable responsibility. In the future, they should strengthen unity and mutual assistance, and step up learning, so that the spirit of overcoming obstacles can be implemented in daily life and work, so that the entire construction cause can be completed and developed in hardship, and the country can stand firm in the wind and rain. Then Zhao Zukang delivered a speech, saying that the complete realization of China's Three People's Principles depends on the success of the implementation of three tasks, namely, nationalism depends on health, democracy depends on education, and people's livelihood depends on construction. At present, China's health care, education, and construction work have not reached the ideal level, so he hopes that all members of the Technology Association should promote the construction movement from urban areas to rural areas, hospitals, schools, and factories in the future, so that the Three People's Principles can establish a foundation through the efforts of the Technology Association.

### Backward Production is the Source of War

Then Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, delivered a speech, emphasizing that technical talents should have the cohesive force of "cement." Zhao also put forward three points to indicate the direction that technical talents should follow. He said: First, "Backward production is the source of war": China has been in deep water for the past fifty years, and has been seeking freedom and equality, but in reality, it has always been unattainable. The main reason is that production is backward and there is a lack of technology. The lack of technology leads to backward production, which is a vicious cycle. If we only look at the technical point of view, the reason why production is backward and there is a lack of technology is that the general public has not recognized the importance of technology, and the technical personnel themselves have not recognized their responsibility to the country. In today's era of artillery fire, talking about using technology to save the country is certainly not empty talk to solve national problems, but it should be recognized from now on that it is important to develop production and develop technology. Implement it resolutely, because the current war will inevitably stop one day. In the past, because production was backward, there is today's war. If we want to ensure that there will be no more wars in the future, we should develop production and develop technology.

### Unity to Realize the People's Livelihood Plan

Second, "Technical personnel should strengthen unity and realize the people's livelihood plan": If China is to develop production, all technical personnel must unite and carry it out with collective strength. From our own experience and the experience of others, we have realized that we can only use the method of "planned economy" to develop production and solve the people's livelihood, which is the most effective way to quickly achieve results. This is the so-called "catching up" method. Therefore, in order to cooperate with solving the people's livelihood through a "planned economy," we technicians should unite under one goal to make that "plan" come true. In other words, let us promote that "plan." What our country lacks is unity in national interests and national interests. Most technical personnel still retain the traditional concept of "taking care of themselves" and cannot practice "unity." We must correct this shortcoming in the future.

### Striving for Technology, Freedom, and Equality

Third, "Use technology to strive for freedom and equality": The meaning of technology is "utilizing resources for the betterment of life." Here, "life" refers to "people's livelihood," and also "human life," its connotation being extremely broad. In other words, technology should serve all of humanity; this is its highest goal. However, in its development process, it should start from one's own country. Because the purpose of technology is for "people's livelihood" and not for war, it can then be extended from one's own country to the world, which is the world of Great Harmony. The world of Great Harmony is "everyone contributes their best, everyone takes what they need." The former is "giving," and the latter is "taking," and they should be mutually treated. If we only "take" without "giving," it indicates that we are not yet independent and can only be others' "vassals," and the world of Great Harmony will never be reached.

### Post-Meeting Technical Symposium

In addition, guests such as Zeng Shirong, Wang Zhizhuo, and He Shangping also delivered speeches. He Shangping called on the government to grant farmers the rights of heaven, land, and people, to protect them from disasters and all artificial exploitation, so that agricultural production can be greatly increased.

The annual meeting concluded at noon, and all members immediately began discussing association affairs and held a luncheon. In the afternoon, a technical experience symposium was held, and those in charge of technology from major factories in the city attended. Today is the second day of the association's annual meeting. All members will be divided into groups to visit major industrial institutions in the city. Tomorrow afternoon, the Industrial Technology Exhibition will still be pre-exhibited at Jiaotong University. All exhibits have been properly arranged, and the content is extremely rich. Annual meeting presidium. From the right: Song Mingshi, Zhao Zukang, He Shangping, Wang Zhizhuo, Zeng Shirong, Zhao Guoliang. (Reported by this newspaper)

### Difficulty in Conscription of Laborers, Decided to Adopt a Hiring Method for Compulsory Labor Service

In order to complete local construction projects in the coming year, the city is preparing to implement compulsory labor. The original plan was to conscript eligible laborers between the ages of ten and forty-five in accordance with central government regulations. It is now learned that the municipal authorities and local public opinion organs have carefully studied the matter and believe that the method of conscripting laborers for compulsory labor may provoke public reaction in the current turbulent situation. It has now been decided to adopt a hiring method, and temporary workers will be recruited in the suburban areas, with each person receiving remuneration, tentatively set at four yuan per work unit. The fundraising for this expenditure will be the responsibility of the Engineering Committee, and the city's districts and neighborhoods will be assisted in soliciting donations from eligible laborers. A reporter from the East China News Agency learned that the hiring method for compulsory labor is not only easier than rigid conscription, but also may achieve the expected plan in terms of engineering technology, because for general projects, if unskilled laborers are used, the actual progress will inevitably encounter many difficulties.

### National Bank Has Already Exchanged Gold and Silver, Only Accounting for One-Twentieth of Inventory, Central Authorities Are Carefully Studying New Methods for Deposit and Exchange

[Reported by this newspaper] The new method for depositing and exchanging gold and silver is still under careful study by the central authorities and may be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval within a week. Major banks and bureaus in the city have submitted a large amount of information to the Ministry of Finance for reference. In addition, the Central Bank is currently compiling statistics on the exact amount of gold and silver sold nationwide since the handling of deposit and exchange business, and it will be officially announced within days. According to related sources, the amount exchanged accounts for only one-twentieth of the inventory, so the reserves are extremely abundant, and under a planned and restricted deposit and exchange method, there is no fear of scarcity.

### Scalpers Exchange Gold for Profit, Apply for Reissuance of ID Cards, Civil Affairs Bureau Decides to Strictly Review

According to news from the Civil Affairs Bureau: The Central Bank is handling the deposit and exchange of gold and silver. In order to prevent scalpers from squeezing for profit, those who exchange must hold a national identity card, and after the exchange, the identity card will be stamped for identification. The bureau recently received reports that district offices in various districts have been applying for new identity cards in large numbers recently. The reason is speculated to be that most scalpers reported the loss and reapplied for the original national identity cards that had been stamped with "Exchanged Gold and Silver," or destroyed and re-applied for new identity cards. The bureau has specifically ordered district offices that in the future, the issuance of new national identity cards must be reviewed by Director Zhang himself, in order to stop abuses.

### Night Trains on Two Lines to Turn on Heating from Today

### Jiangya Steamer Aftermath Committee Raised 100 Sets of Cotton Clothes and Trousers

### Culprit Apprehended Based on Footprints, Worker from China Textile Factory No. 27, Chopped Colleague with Knife in Late-Night Robbery

[Reported by this newspaper] At approximately 10:30 PM on the 25th, Song Zhetang, a farmer in the vegetable garden near the Wengjiazhai manure factory on Guiyang Road, Hejian Road, in Pudong, suddenly heard cries for help from the vegetable field to the east. He rushed out to inspect and found a man lying on the vegetable field, with three knife wounds to his head, appearing very serious. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau, who urgently summoned an ambulance to send the victim to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. After investigation, it was learned that the victim was named Song Jingnian, 33 years old, from Liyang, and a worker at China Textile Factory No. 17, residing in a shanty in Wengjiazhai, Hejian Road, with no number. His wife was summoned to the bureau for questioning, and she revealed that her husband, Song Jingnian, had 2,000 yuan in new Central Bank serial-numbered ten-yuan banknotes and had been robbed. The sub-bureau chief Wang ordered section chief Ji Bingquan to supervise officers Ni Zhihong, police officers Yang Liangdong, Shi Borong, Li Xumin, and Zhang Shaoying to rush to the scene for investigation and found an axe used in the attack. Based on the footprints left behind, they tracked and arrested a suspicious pedestrian at Pingliang Road and Linqing Road. They were intercepted by patrol officers No. 4088, 1071, and 2160 from the sub-bureau. The man's speech was hesitant, and his behavior was flustered, so he was taken to the bureau for interrogation. He claimed to be Qu Hongxi, 26 years old, from Yangzhou, a worker at China Textile Factory No. 17, residing at No. 259, Lane 14, Tongxing Workshop, Zhoujiapai Road. However, he flatly denied the attack on Song Jingnian and the robbery of the new banknotes. After comparing the footprints left behind, they matched perfectly, and 2,000 yuan in gold yuan, all in serial-numbered new banknotes, were found on his person, at which point he confessed. According to his confession: He and the victim were originally colleagues at the same factory. In July of this year, I gradually owed Song one stone and five dou of rice, and he often asked me for it, so I harbored resentment. This morning, Song received a wage bonus of 2,000 yuan at the factory, and I deceived him into going to the Bund Central Bank to exchange it for gold, but unexpectedly, the exchange had been suspended. We spent the whole day together, and when we returned at around 10 PM, when passing through the vegetable field of the manure factory, I took out the hidden axe while he was unprepared and struck his head three times. He immediately fell, and I thought he was dead, so I took all 2,000 yuan from his pocket. The sub-bureau reported the case to the General Bureau to send the suspect and the stolen goods to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Commissioner Infatuated with Waitress, Disregards Wife and Daughters, Accused of Abandonment

Hong Runxiang, 51 years old, from Anhui, a commissioner stationed in Taiwan by the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications Shuyu Enterprise Company to purchase salt, is being sued for abandonment by his wife, Hong Wang Linna, with the court, because he is infatuated with Gao Meixiu, a Japanese waitress at the Shanglinhua Restaurant in Taipei, Taiwan. The plaintiff is requesting the court to notify the Taiwan Provincial Court and order the arrest and bail of Hong for trial. According to Wang's complaint, "When I married Hong in Changsha twelve years ago, Hong was still penniless and taught at Changsha No. 1 High School. After the victory, Runxiang was appointed as the commissioner stationed in Taiwan by the Trust Department of the Bank of Communications Shuyu Enterprise Company to purchase salt. In less than half a year, he became extremely wealthy and became infatuated with Gao Meixiu, a waitress at the Shanglinhua Restaurant in Taipei, and cohabited with her on the third floor of the Tianxing Pharmacy at No. 118, Taipingmachi, Taipei, acting like husband and wife. He not only disregarded his wife, but also constantly sent letters to provoke her. In July of this year, Runxiang returned to Shanghai from Taiwan with Gao Meixiu and forcibly moved into the house at No. 70, Yonglefang, Sichuan Road, forcibly occupying it. Linna negotiated with him, but was scolded and beaten by him. The China Relief Society for Women and Children mediated and stipulated that the five rooms of the above-mentioned house and the furniture should be used and disposed of freely by Linna, and Runxiang would permanently end his relationship with Gao Meixiu. Unexpectedly, after only a few days, he cohabited with her in Taipei again, and did not care about the family at all. His daughter, Wang Lili, is 17 years old and suffers from severe lung disease. She has no money for medical treatment and mourns her father, while Runxiang is far away in Taipei, hiding beauties in his house, leading a life of extravagance."

### When Will Elementary and Middle Schools Have Vacation? The Education Bureau Has Not Yet Decided

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the academic calendar stipulated by the Ministry of Education, the city's elementary and middle schools must end at the end of January next year. Regarding the rumor that the municipal middle schools have decided to start the vacation one week earlier, Education Bureau Director Li Ximou told reporters that this is not true. The Education Bureau has not yet made any decision on this matter. Although it was discussed at the bureau's meeting last week, no conclusion was reached. When asked of Mayor Wu, the mayor also made no decision. Director Li believes that according to the closing date stipulated by the Ministry of Education, it must be before the Lunar New Year. Therefore, the request to start the vacation one week earlier is also reasonable in sentiment. However, at this time and in this place, all measures should be taken with caution to avoid affecting people's hearts. Therefore, regarding whether or not to end this semester early, he will seek the opinion of the Ministry of Education in a private capacity before making a decision.

### Failure to Repair After Being Damaged Will Eventually Lead to Trouble, Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries School Alumni Association and Others Report on the Fishery Kang Ship Accident

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Fishery Kang (formerly known as the Connaught Irongen) ship of the Fisheries Administration was lost, the families of the sailors repeatedly asked the Fisheries Administration to handle various aftermath matters as soon as possible and investigate the issue of responsibility, but there has been no concrete solution. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries School Alumni Association and representatives of the families of the victims hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city, reporting on the events before and after the accident and appealing to the public for support. Briefly stated: The ship sailed out of Shenjiamen on October 15, led by acting captain Que Zhaoyuan, and collided with the Fishery Xin ship, causing damage and leakage in the bow. After slight repairs, acting captain Que inspected on the 21st and found that there was still leakage and telegraphed the chief captain's office to request a return to port for major repairs, but it was not approved, so it continued to fish. Afterwards, Captain Wang Jingsheng of the ship requested repairs again, but was still not approved. On the 2nd of this month, he was ordered to reluctantly go out to fish. Before the trip, Captain Wang expressed his dissatisfaction to his superiors for not allowing repairs and ordering the damaged ship to go out to sea to fish, disregarding the safety of the fishermen. He said that he would resign after this return trip.

Unable to Withstand the Waves, Three Telegraphs for Help

The ship then sailed out of Shanghai on the 11th of this month. On the 13th at 6:30 PM, the Meteorological Observatory of the Fisheries Administration routinely reported weather forecasts that the wind force was 10-8 knots, which is a very common wind force at sea. On the morning of the 14th, the wind force was slightly stronger, and the waves were also gradually higher. Captain Wang warned the captains of the Fishery Hui and Fishery Su ships, which were operating in the same area, by telephone that the climate was deteriorating, the wind and waves were gradually increasing, and they should be prepared, hoping to pull up the nets and avoid the wind. He said, "Please go first, and I will go one hour later." This proves that Captain Wang had abundant experience. At about 9 o'clock, when the net was pulled up, the scars on the bow could not withstand the waves, and cracks leaked water. He then issued three emergency calls for help at 10 o'clock, 11:15, and 11:40, but the radio station of the Fisheries Administration did not receive any of them once. At 2 PM, the Fishery Jin ship, which was operating in the Northern Ocean, reported to the Qingdao branch of the Fisheries Administration that the Shanghai Fishery Kang ship had encountered an accident and had called for help. Only then did the Fuxing Island Radio Station of the Fisheries Administration accidentally hear it. At this time, the chief captain was temporarily at a loss. One mistake led to another, and the ship was finally lost and sunk.

Calmly Changed Clothes Awaiting Death, Proving a Slow Sinking

According to the Fishery Kang ship's last call for help at 11:40, by 5 PM, the old sailor Qi Aying, who was on a sailboat in the same sea area, saw that it had not completely sunk, and the crew members were all gathered on the deck of the wheelhouse waiting for rescue, which proves that the sinking speed was slow. And from the observation of the body of the sailor Jiang Axiang, who was salvaged, the outer and inner clothes he was wearing were all newly changed, and he was wearing new leather shoes, all of which were not the clothes worn during operation, which proves that at the time of the accident, he had tried his best to save himself. Until the final despair, he calmly changed into new clothes and waited for the arrival of death. This fact is also clear evidence of the slow sinking, but the Fisheries Administration only notified the fishing boats on the sea to rescue on the morning of the 15th. It is said that they entrusted the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Taiwan flight to assist in the search by plane. According to the company, a sunken ship was found at 122 degrees 45 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 45 minutes north latitude, and it was said that there were two white lights at the bow and stern. However, since it was said to be a sunken ship, how could there be white lights? Obviously, the news was inaccurate, and the chief and deputy captains Liu Jinghan and others mistakenly regarded it as good news, thinking that the ship could escape the danger, one mistake after another. By the 16th, not only was rescue hopeless, but also the bodies could not be salvaged. The representatives also commented that the creation of this unfortunate incident was extremely related to the unsound personnel of the Fisheries Administration. The radio station staff of the chief captain's office should be held responsible.

List of Deceased Crew Members

Attached is a list of the deceased crew members: Captain Wang Jingsheng; Chief Mate Zhu Zijun; Fisheries Officer Gao Tongde; Chief Engineer Wang Hang; Second Officer Xin Yebao?; Fisherman Leader Jiang Guoliang; Fishermen Jiang Axiang, Jiang Rusheng, Lang Xuecheng, Shen Laiche, Wu Kunxing; Intern Shi (a graduate of Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School who boarded the ship for internship).

### Various Industries Basically Reach Satisfactory Resolutions on Year-End Bonus Disputes, Most Agreements Reached Independently

Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for various industries this year, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from labor and management to form a year-end bonus handling committee to be responsible for mediation. According to the person in charge of the committee, although the industrial and commercial sectors are in a state of recession this year, both labor and management have a spirit of mutual understanding on the issue of year-end bonus distribution. Not as many factories in various industries have applied to the handling committee for mediation as in the previous year. For example, industries such as cotton textiles and department stores have reached a solution after mediation by the committee. As for those still under mediation, the committee is persuading both labor and management to accept based on the established laws and regulations, in order to seek a fair resolution. Some industries are still discussing the distribution method independently. There have been no strikes or work slowdowns due to year-end bonus disputes. This is a manifestation of workers' compliance with government laws and regulations. It is predicted that the year-end bonus disputes in various industries this year will not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily.

### Dispute Arises Over Bus Ride, Ticket Seller Assaulted

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, the No. 10 public bus from a certain number on Changning Road, West Shanghai, near the gate of Zhongshan Park, was about to depart when a platoon leader-ranked officer arrived with two soldiers. They insisted on boarding the bus by forcing the door open but were refused. They then assaulted the ticket seller, number 947. Shortly after, more and more public buses gathered at the scene, and drivers and ticket sellers congregated. The offending soldiers then left westward together. Soon after, the soldiers returned with thirty or forty companions. Without asking questions, they took Li Yonghui, the ticket inspector number 61 on the side of the road, to their company headquarters. Drivers and ticket sellers were enraged and reported the incident to the French Concession Police Sub-Bureau. Bureau Chief Shao then ordered Section Member Zhu Yuanzhang to lead police officers to the company headquarters to mediate. He also reported the incident to the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command's Third Division. Division Chief Yan Jinwen personally went to the company headquarters to investigate the truth of the incident. The assaulting soldiers were taken back to the division for questioning and then released to the company for disciplinary action according to regulations. Normal public bus service was not restored until after 8 PM.

### Two Major Air Currents Meet, Snow Possible Today

[Report from our Newspaper] A mixture of wind and rain has hit Japan, bringing severe cold. According to the weather bureau's prediction, it may snow today because a Siberian cold front is currently enveloping the entire country, while a Pacific low-pressure system has swept across the Sea of Japan and is moving northwest. The two major air currents are meeting downstream of the Yangtze River. As a result, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places had heavy snowfall yesterday. The climate in this city is unlikely to improve in the next day or two. Yesterday's temperature: lowest 2.3 degrees Celsius (36.1 degrees Fahrenheit), highest 5.5 degrees Celsius (41.9 degrees Fahrenheit).

### The Mystery of the Grain-for-Cash Conversion in Jiaxing

— Our Reporter Chen Jianxiong

[Report from our Newspaper in Jiaxing on the 23rd] Recently, a mysterious case of land tax conversion to currency occurred in Jiaxing. Although the people petitioned the assembly, and assembly members sent letters to the speaker and deputy speaker requesting the grain administration authorities to make a public announcement, the issue has been developing for more than two months. However, the grain administration authorities have consistently adopted an "ignore and don't ask" attitude, delaying clarification. Their stance has caused widespread surprise and suspicion among various sectors of society.

Rice Grain Sprouts an Inch Long

Just as the early rice harvest season was approaching in the autumn, the weather turned unfavorable, with continuous wind and rain. The river water flooded the rice paddies, making it impossible to drain the water in time. As a result, the fully ripened ears of rice fell over, and the grains sprouted an inch long after being soaked in water. Farmers in the early rice-growing areas were immediately alarmed and petitioned the county government. In addition to providing comfort and conducting investigations, the authorities were deeply concerned about the assessment ratio for the new tax collection. According to the investigation results, 127,000 mu of rice paddies (in the early rice-growing areas) were affected by the flood, resulting in a reduction of 180,400 dan in harvest. (Note: The total area of paddy fields in the county is 1,094,744 mu, with an average yield of four dan per mu, totaling 4,377,598,876 dan).

Paying Taxes in Currency Brings Joy

Since the townships in the early rice-growing areas suffered such a severe disaster, and the "sprouted grain" did not meet the standards for tax grain stipulated by the ministry, farmers were unable to pay land taxes because they simply had no grain. Therefore, the county's Land and Grain Bureau was ordered to begin collecting new taxes in the early rice-growing areas on September 1st, which was effectively hindered. In order to find a remedy and accept the opinions of local people, the county's grain administration authorities requested approval from the provincial government to allow tax payment in legal currency. The provincial government, in consideration of the difficulties faced by farmers, approved the request, but stipulated that the amount of currency conversion should not exceed 30,000 shi, with each shi converted at a price of 8.1 yuan in gold yuan. Although local people at the time believed that the conversion price was too high and requested a reduction, they did not strongly advocate for it, perhaps fearing being seen as "taking an inch and wanting a mile." In this way, both the grain administration officials and the farmers were delighted.

Distributing According to Tax Quotas

At that time, the county's Land and Grain Bureau allocated the 30,000 dan of tax grain converted to currency proportionally according to the tax quotas borne by each township in the early rice-growing areas: Fengqiao 12,500 shi, Qihuang 8,000 shi, Zhudian 4,800 shi, Buyun 2,500 shi, and Chengdong 2,200 shi. Because the collection period coincided with the "August 19th" price controls in mid-October, the price of rice at that time was only 16.67 yuan in gold yuan per shi, which was not far from the conversion price of 8.1 yuan per shi of paddy rice. (However, the black market price of coarse grain had already exceeded 20 yuan.) Therefore, paying land taxes with paddy rice at 8.1 yuan per shi was indeed considered a good deal. According to reports from various receiving warehouses, taxpayers were very enthusiastic, and the quotas for each township were quickly filled within a few days.

Rumors Accuse Scalpers of Manipulation

That's where the problem started. Rumors arose from various sources, making numerous accusations, such as claims that the receiving warehouses were being "manipulated by scalpers." Some wondered "with the current personnel in each receiving warehouse, how could they collect the full amount in just three days?" In fact, these rumors could have been immediately dispelled if each receiving warehouse had simply publicly posted the list of grain households who paid the tax. However, the grain administration authorities did not do so, remaining "silent and feigning ignorance," without making any statements. This further fueled suspicions from all sides.

Grain Administration Authorities Make No Response

Behind the rumors, actions began to take place. On November 19th, a petition to the assembly from "an ordinary citizen who is not afraid of trouble" appeared in two local major newspapers. The petition was lengthy and completely accused the many malpractices of this conversion. Finally, it suggested three points: (1) The grain administration authorities should promptly announce the list of grain households who paid taxes in currency. (2) The amount of money and the number of mu should be written under the name of the household. (3) Investigate and correct the illegal behavior of the tax collectors. Subsequently, on December 13th, a public letter from Assembly Member Zheng Songling to the speaker and deputy speaker was published, stating: "...It is heard that the collection of land taxes in currency by the Land and Grain Offices in the early rice-growing areas was very short, and it was immediately declared that the quota was full, resulting in many rumors from outside. It is said that the actual number of stones collected in this currency conversion was only over 12,000 shi. The number that was claimed as full appears to have been fraudulent. It is not known whether this rumor is true or false, but for the sake of smooth tax collection, it is proposed to suggest that the county's Land and Grain Bureau order the Land and Grain Offices in each early rice-growing area to promptly announce the names of each grain household that paid taxes in currency and the actual number of stones collected, in order to show great credibility."

However, the grain administration authorities have consistently maintained an attitude of "turning a deaf ear" in the past, ignoring the situation. Now, the new person has taken over the job, and the personnel of the Land and Grain Bureau may be changed in the future. When will this "mystery case" that has been put on hold be revealed? This is truly something that all sectors are "eagerly awaiting!"

### Guizhou Province Implements New Methods for Planting Tung Trees

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Report from our Newspaper in Guiyang on the 21st] China has a very long history of planting tung trees. As early as the Tang Dynasty, the "Supplement to the Materia Medica" recorded: "The yingzi grows in the mountains, and the tree is similar to the wu." The so-called yingzi is a type of tung tree. By the Song and Ming Dynasties, cultivation became more widespread. Chen Jian of the Song Dynasty wrote a book called "Tung Tree Manual," which consists of ten chapters, pioneering the study of tung tree cultivation. In the Ming Dynasty, Hongwu ordered the planting of tung, lacquer, and palm trees on the sunny side of the Hammer Mountain in Nanjing, covering 500,000 mu. This shows that the rulers already knew its importance and promoted it.

Tung trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family and the Vernicia genus. They are deciduous trees with many varieties. The Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has selected more than 500 varieties. The tung oil extracted from tung fruits is also complex, generally divided into four types: tung oil, light oil, hong oil, and xiu oil. Among them, tung oil is further divided by color. White tung oil produced in eastern Sichuan, western Hunan, and northeastern Guizhou is the most famous for its excellent quality, mostly sold abroad. Its export value holds a high position in China's total commodity export value, remaining strong since the victory of the War of Resistance.

Hilly Areas Are Most Suitable for Planting Tung Trees

Tung trees are economic crops of hilly areas and are not found in vast plains. Their altitude is limited to 2,000 meters above sea level, and the minimum altitude must be above 200 meters. In eastern Sichuan, the most common altitude is between 250 and 1,500 meters. In western Hunan and northeastern Guizhou, the altitude is between 400 and 1,500 meters. Therefore, the terrain, soil, and temperature of this triangular area are more suitable for the growth and abundant fruiting of tung trees than any other region in the country.

Wujiang River Basin Is the Tung Oil Production Center

In Guizhou, tung trees are distributed throughout the province. According to the survey and research conducted by the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the area of tung tree cultivation in Guizhou Province in 1947 was approximately 400,000 mu, and the tung oil harvest was more than 256,000 dan. The eleven counties in the Wujiang River Basin, such as Xiuwen, Yanhe, and Sinan; the eight counties in the Jinjiang and Qingshui River Basins, such as Tongren, Zhenyuan, and Jinping; the seven counties in the Yunwu Mountain area, such as Guiding, Duyun, and Luodian; the seven counties in the Beipan River Basin, such as Zhenfeng, Guanling, and Ceheng; and the two counties in the Chishui River Basin, such as Renhuai and Chishui, are all well-known tung-producing areas. Among them, the Wujiang River Basin area is the most important, and it is the center of tung oil production in Guizhou. The distribution markets of tung oil in Guizhou are also mainly concentrated in this area, which transports the tung oil north to Chongqing, east to Changde, or south to Wuzhou for export year-round, benefiting the rural economy. This is even more significant than the booming American tobacco cultivation industry in recent years.

Assisting the Province in Investigation and Research

Chairman Gu Zhenglun was concerned that the people of the province relied on the supply of cotton yarn from Hunan for their needs. At the beginning of his administration, he made increasing the production of tung oil and rapeseed oil, the province's specialty products, the primary goal of production and construction. Within three years, he set the ambitious goal of planting 50,000 tung trees throughout the province. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had previously established a Tung Tea Experimental Farm in Meitan County, northeastern Guizhou, in 1940 to experiment with new planting methods, which proved to be effective. In order to cooperate with the provincial and local authorities' decision to increase the planting of tung trees and produce tung oil, the ministry specially dispatched Inspector Deng Zhaohua to Guizhou to assist in the investigation and research, with the hope of achieving the goal ahead of schedule.

New Methods of Cultivation Achieve Remarkable Success

According to Zhu Yuanlin, the director of the Meitan Tung Tea Experimental Farm, and Deng Zhaohua, the farm has been conducting diligent research for the past nine years and has achieved remarkable success in implementing the selection and breeding of superior varieties and experimenting with new cultivation techniques in the Wujiang River Basin. In terms of varieties, the successful ones include Zhongnong No. 33, a two-year tung tree, and Zhongnong No. 10, a three-year tung tree. The two-year tung tree can begin to bear fruit in the second year after planting and reaches its peak in the third, fourth, and fifth years, with a lifespan of at least 15 years. The three-year tung tree begins to bear fruit in the third year after planting and reaches its peak in the fifth, sixth, and seventh years, with a lifespan of up to 30 years. These two types of tung trees have been cultivated in Meitan County for nine years and have grown very well, with no diseases. They are very popular among the people in the local and nearby tung-producing counties. Some tung farmers in eastern Sichuan and western Hunan even travel hundreds of miles to steal tung seeds and seedlings. In terms of cultivation techniques, new methods such as budding and grafting can be used to advance the fruiting time and increase the yield and oil content of tung fruit. The farm is also continuously experimenting and researching other related technologies.

Mechanical Oil Extraction Improves Oil Quality

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to launch a campaign to increase the production of tung trees and tung oil throughout Guizhou Province next year. The provincial government's newly established Materials Production and Marketing Company also aims to develop the province's tung oil export business as one of its three major foreign trade objectives. Regarding the new-style pressing and processing equipment for tung oil, plans are currently underway to establish a factory in Zunyi County, near Meitan, to use mechanical oil extraction to eliminate the old-style wooden presses, thereby increasing efficiency and improving oil quality. It is reported that the Director of the Construction Department, He, went to Guangzhou to discuss this matter with the Guangdong provincial authorities five weeks ago, and this was also one of his tasks.

### Siming County Government to Be Established on New Year's Day

In addition to temporarily setting up a national section, two district offices, Miyanyan (formerly part of Yin County) and Xiaguan (formerly part of Shangyu County), will also be established.

### Many Wind and Snow in the Cold Season, Refugee Students Relocate Again

Relocating to Qingpu, Jinshan and Pinghu

[Report from our Newspaper in Wujin on the 25th] During the period of enemy occupation in Shandong, the Dainan Middle School and the first and second branches of the Lunan Joint Middle School that moved to this county have recently been ordered by the Garrison Headquarters of Jinghu to relocate again from the 28th. Dainan Middle School is designated to relocate to Qingpu, the first branch of Lunan Joint Middle School to Pinghu, and the second branch of Lunan Joint Middle School to Jinshan. It is also stipulated that this county will bear the relocation expenses: 25,000 yuan for Dainan, 12,000 yuan for the first branch of Lunan, and 13,000 yuan for the second branch. The principals of each school will directly contact the county government to receive the funds. Transportation will be assisted by the 51st Army stationed in Changzhou. In addition: Recently, the weather has been cold, and there is wind and snow everywhere. The City Defense Department decided to send a letter to the Winter Relief Association to allocate funds for relief, and to discuss other relief measures, regarding the miserable situation of the refugee students in each school.

### Honored Guests Visit Guilin City, Some Laughing, Some Sighing

— Our Special Correspondent Yushan

[Report from our Newspaper in Guilin on the 20th] It is now midwinter, with continuous rain and mist. Looking at the muddy roads with mud splashing in the south and north of the city, it is heart-wrenching to see groups of travelers on the road.

Gusts of north wind blow in the southward-bound geese that were forced away by the cold wave. Every day, the Xiang-Gui Road has added a few more carriages of southbound travelers. Many fashionable honored guests from thousands of miles away in the north and south of the Yangtze River have suddenly appeared on the quiet streets. In their eyes, Guilin is much less attractive than in previous years, with its uncoordinated old and new houses, rotten roads like those with smallpox scars, and unreliable electric lights.

Even so, there are still places here that they long for. No matter the weather, they visit the Seven Star Cave, Wind Cave, Dragon Hidden, Crescent Moon, and Putuo in groups every day. Although prices here are already causing people to complain, they seem extremely cheap to them. In tea houses, restaurants, and entertainment venues, you can hear conversations like this at any time: "It's really cheap, a dan of rice is not even the price of one meal!" In the midst of this common conversation, prices suddenly jump again, and the people of Guilin can only sigh in frustration!

### Legal Clarifications

[Question from Mr. Song Zhizheng] I am a bachelor and share a room with two colleagues. Recently, my girlfriend came to my dormitory early in the morning to see me. Some people saw a woman come to the men's dormitory early in the morning, which inevitably aroused some curiosity. Afterwards, they asked my two colleagues about it. Their answer was: "She slept here last night!" As a result, the news spread like wildfire. Suppose this news reaches her parents' ears and they issue a warning to me. How should I deal with it? Have they committed the crime of defamation under the law? Can I file a complaint? I hope you can give me some guidance!

[Answer from Mr. Tang Mingshi] In the West, men and women enjoy freedom in their interactions, but freedom has certain boundaries. For example, when visiting, a girlfriend should never enter her boyfriend's bedroom or dormitory. Like a melon field or plum tree, one should be self-restrained to avoid gossip. The same applies to a boyfriend visiting a girlfriend. In conservative European countries, girlfriends are often accompanied when visiting, and boyfriends are often supervised by their parents when visiting girlfriends to avoid suspicion. Your girlfriend's actions are somewhat lacking in prudence.

### Editor's Mailbox

To Mr. Zhang Zhinian and others: Regarding your inquiry about the conscription of new soldiers and the recent collection of family allowances in various districts, this column has forwarded your request to the Conscription Association for an answer. The association has provided a detailed explanation, which you can refer to on the fourth page of this newspaper on the 25th. Also, please be sure to indicate the location in future letters, otherwise they will be discarded. Do not blame others. If it leads to negotiations, you can only blame yourself and cannot vent your anger on others. If you are innocent, you are not afraid of gossip. Why panic? As for filing a complaint, it is feared that you will only be causing trouble for yourself! Be careful in the future and avoid suspicion. This is the best course of action.

### Postal Q&A

### Banks Will Adjust Domestic Exchange Rates Today

The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks and Two Savings Banks will be revised today (27th) as follows: Xiamen, Fuzhou: 150 yuan each; Ningbo: 20 yuan; Guiyang: 100 yuan; Kunming: 100 yuan; Tianjin: 150 yuan each; other places unchanged.

### Improved Procedures for Delivery of Treasury Payment Orders

Since the implementation of the newly revised National Treasury Cash Management Accounting System, the inter-branch transfer procedures for district treasuries have been improved. However, the mailing of payment orders and the handling of stop-payment and re-appropriation procedures are still too complicated and difficult to coordinate with the new system.

It is now learned that the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has discussed and decided with the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance that, starting from the 38th year of the Republic, the mailing of all payment orders will be changed so that the National Treasury Department directly sends them to the district branches for processing, instead of being sent by the National Treasury for forwarding, except for the areas of Hebei, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Anhui, which will temporarily continue to be handled as before. As for stop-payment, re-appropriation and other procedures, the fund-receiving agencies in each district will also directly discuss with the department and inform the district branches for processing, without the need to submit them to the general treasury for review, in order to simplify the process.

According to a statement from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation representative, the second batch of Taiwan sugar transported to Japan, totaling 20,000 tons, has now been completely shipped. The last portion of 1,500 tons arrived in Japan within the past week. They are currently preparing the third batch for transport and sale. Furthermore, recognizing that weeding expenses account for a significant portion of sugarcane cultivation costs annually, and that weeds in sugarcane fields grow rapidly between May and July, making them difficult to manage, the company is seeking to reduce the cost of Taiwan sugar sales in order to expand sales channels and compete with sugar production in the international market and other countries. A special plan has been initiated to use herbicides instead of manual labor. They have already begun investigating the types, forms, growth conditions, and distribution of weeds in sugarcane fields in various production areas. Upon completion of the trial, it will also be a major contribution to agriculture in our country.

### Difficult Transportation; Shaanxi Cotton Plummets

[Xi'an Correspondence] Cotton prices, which had been hovering around 470 yuan per dan (unit of weight), plummeted to 400 yuan per dan in the past week. Meanwhile, air freight rates have increased by 50 percent, effectively ending air transport of cotton. The prospects for Shaanxi cotton exports suddenly appear bleak.

It is reported that since the establishment of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office in this city, the planned purchase volume of Shaanxi cotton was estimated to be 600,000 city dan. Subsequently, due to the lifting of price controls, it was changed to free purchase. In this city, only the Central Bank, the China Textile Company, and Yongxing Company participated in the joint purchase. The initial batch of purchase certificates amounted to 40,000 dan, but due to funding issues, they were temporarily suspended before the purchase was completed. Most of the cotton purchased this time comes from the Jinghui Canal area. They are currently busy with packaging and transportation work. The cotton purchased in Weinan has all been sent to the Weinan packaging factory for repackaging and direct transport to Baoji. In order to save time and avoid losses, those purchased in the Jinggang Canal area have signed a contract with the Provincial Highway Bureau to transport the cotton to Xianyang for repackaging, and then directly to Baoji for consolidation.

For transportation from Baoji to Chongqing, in addition to the contract already signed with the Fifth District Transportation Office, the ten new vehicles purchased by the Provincial Highway Bureau in Nanjing will also join the transportation effort after they arrive in Baoji. Land transport is based on Chongqing as the final destination. With the increase in vehicles, exports should not be a problem. However, it is said that water transport from Chongqing to Shanghai is often difficult due to the shortage of riverboats. Shaanxi cotton concentrated in Chongqing cannot be transported to the east as much as possible, which has caused many purchasers to remain on the sidelines, affecting the price of Shaanxi cotton and making it difficult to improve the situation.
