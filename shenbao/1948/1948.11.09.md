### President Chiang Analyzes the Military and Political Situation, Economic Difficulties Being Remedied, Collecting Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency "Taken from the People, Used for the People," Encouraging the People to Unite and Struggle Long-Term

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held an enlarged weekly memorial service for the Premier at 9:00 AM on the 8th. More than a thousand responsible comrades from various central ministries and commissions, as well as members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans of our party, attended. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting and provided a detailed analysis of the current military, political, and economic situation. On the military front, the President acknowledged that the loss of important strongholds in the Northeast such as Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou was indeed a serious setback in the revolutionary process. However, frontline commanders such as Liao Yaoxiang and Li Tao acted generously to achieve benevolence, fully demonstrating the spirit of revolutionary soldiers. Regarding the economy, since the currency reform, various difficulties have arisen due to the deliberate sabotage by the communists and the impact of military operations. The government is already taking measures to remedy the situation. The government deeply regrets that patriotic people who supported the national policy during the currency reform, exchanging their hard-earned gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan, are now suffering losses due to price fluctuations. However, the government will adhere to the principle of "taken from the people, used for the people," and adopt practical measures to comfort the patriotic and law-abiding people. President Chiang concluded by stating clearly: "The current war is actually an extension of the War of Resistance. The disruption of national peace is due to the communist rebellion. The government can only achieve peace by eliminating the communist rebellion. All current rumors of peace are merely propaganda offensives by the communists. The government's policy has long been set: to strive for final victory with all our strength. It must be understood that the suppression of the rebellion is a nationalist war, a long-term war. We must prepare for another year of long-term struggle with the determination and spirit of the War of Resistance, unite as one, concentrate our strength, sacrifice and struggle, and then the situation can surely be turned from danger to safety, from defeat to victory, and achieve final victory."

Original Address

President Chiang's original address is as follows: Recently, important strongholds in the Northeast, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang, have fallen in succession. Furthermore, the communists are spreading rumors everywhere, inevitably causing psychological unrest among the people nationwide. Everyone still remembers when the September 18th Incident occurred, and the three northeastern provinces were lost. At that time, not only was the nation shocked, but all countries around the world were also stunned. Now that the military in the Northeast has suffered such a serious setback, it will naturally cause the same psychological reaction among compatriots as the September 18th Incident. However, from the perspective of the entire revolution, a temporary setback has no major impact on the success or failure of the entire revolution. In 1945, the Northeast Headquarters went to Changchun to prepare to receive sovereignty over the Northeast and encountered various obstacles. Later, when we were ordered to retreat to Shanhaiguan, some responsible comrades said that the Northeast had been lost for fourteen years, and we still could not receive sovereignty, but we were determined to complete the goals of the War of Resistance. Even if the Northeast were to fall again for fourteen years, we would still fight to the death to recover the entire Northeast. This Northeast campaign is the biggest lesson in our revolutionary history, as well as the biggest setback and the most magnificent sacrifice in our revolutionary process. We must never forget it. Our frontline commanders, Commander Liao Yaoxiang and all levels of officers below him, resolutely embraced the determination to live or die with their positions and had reported to me that if they could not recover Jinzhou, they would never return to Shenyang. Later, under the combined encirclement and fierce attacks of the communist troops, Commander Liao and Army Commander Li Tao and others finally died in action with their entire army, achieving a magnificent benevolence. This truly demonstrated the spirit of our revolutionary soldiers, doing justice to the nation and the people, and also proved the importance of the Northeast campaign in the overall communist suppression military operations, leaving an indelible memory for our national revolution.

Secondly, in terms of economy, the government's policies of currency reform and economic controls have encountered various difficulties in implementation due to the deliberate sabotage by the communists and the impact of military setbacks. The government is now trying to remedy the situation, but everyone knows that there is no perfect solution in the world, and the scope involved in economic reform is particularly complex, and there can absolutely not be only benefits and no drawbacks. As long as we, on the one hand, discover abuses and correct them, and on the other hand, strengthen economic warfare against the communists, so that communist spies cannot create black markets in our cities and villages and snap up materials, then I believe that currency reform can still achieve the effect of stabilizing the economy. What the government particularly regrets is that after the implementation of currency reform, patriotic people, in order to support the national policy, exchanged their hard-earned gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan, and now they are suffering property losses due to price fluctuations. The government is very pleased and concerned about these patriotic and law-abiding compatriots. The government will definitely adhere to the principle of taking from the people and using for the people, and take effective measures to give them comfort. At the same time, we also hope that compatriots in general will not listen to rumors, will not disrupt their own steps, will abide by government laws and regulations, and strive for economic stability.

### No Matter How Difficult the National Affairs, the Lines of Right and Wrong Must Be Established, All Peace Rumors Are Just to Promote Communist Propaganda Offensives

Since the military setback in the Northeast, the intensity of the communist rumor offensive has reached its extreme. Not only have the general public been incited by rumors and felt panicked, but even intellectuals cannot recognize the true interests of the country and have wavered psychologically. A few days ago, a small number of intellectuals in Nanjing openly published articles proposing peace, which is truly a loss of national spirit and is entirely the act of surrenderists. When the Premier was dying, he said, "You must never compromise with the enemy." This was said to Wang Jingwei. Later, Jingwei not only compromised with the communists, but also compromised with the Japanese, thus not only ruining his personal reputation, but also causing great losses to the entire revolutionary cause. Today, these people obliterate the interests of the country, lose the standpoint of the people, respond to the communist rumor offensive, and advocate surrendering to the communists, which is not only making themselves willing slaves of the communists, but also harming our entire Chinese nation to be slaves and livestock of foreign races forever. Recently, the communists have instructed a general following to put forward two slogans, one is "seek warmth and sustenance," and the other is "seek peace." This is entirely copying the three slogans of "land, bread, truce" from the Soviet civil war era. They want to use this to confuse compatriots across the country and disintegrate the spirit and strength of communist suppression. In fact, compatriots across the country all know that China's current environment is completely different from the national conditions of the Soviet Union at that time. Since the party has been led by the Premier in revolution, realizing the Three Principles of the People has been the only goal, which is also to seek the independence and unity of our country and the survival and freedom of the people. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain domestic peace and engage in national construction, the government did not hesitate to compromise and tolerate and repeatedly negotiated with the communists and repeatedly issued orders to stop the conflict. The facts are all there for everyone to see, but the communists finally disregarded everything and rebelled in an all-round way. Today, who is making war and who is preventing the people from being warm and fed? The people of the country should see very clearly. If these intellectuals are not willing to be tools of the communists, then they should go to the communist areas to seek peace and seek warmth and sustenance from Mao Zedong. In fact, communist leader Mao Zedong is vigorously refuting the middle road line and openly advocating world revolution. What peace can be said to be possible with these traitors who are intent on destroying the country and the nation. The national army's policy of suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the communists has long been determined, and it will definitely be implemented to the end. All current rumors of peace are just to promote the communist propaganda offensive and will never affect the determination of our government, military, and civilians to eliminate harm for the country. No matter how difficult or dangerous the national army is, the lines between right and wrong must be established. All responsible comrades in our party, government, and military, and the general public, all have this responsibility.

### Compatriots Should Raise Vigilance

The Communist Party's "Lenient Policy" Is a Deceptive Conspiracy

Again, we compatriots must also raise our vigilance against the communist's deceptive conspiracy of the so-called "lenient policy." Recently, the communists have repeatedly propagated that they will no longer implement land reform, no longer struggle for liquidation, and claim to protect private property in the occupied areas. Since the fall of Jinan, this disguised lenient propaganda has become even more active. However, we must tell compatriots across the country that the communists' talk of not struggling and not liquidating is only a means of anesthetizing the newly occupied areas. Once they occupy for a little longer, and military violence can control the entire community, they will definitely expose their hideous faces and implement a cruel policy of killing to eliminate dissidents. For example, before Jinan fell, the communists adopted a so-called lenient policy towards the people of Weixian. Before Zhengzhou retreated, they also adopted the same means towards the people of Luoyang, but after the fall of Jinan and the retreat of Zhengzhou, the people who escaped from Weixian and Luoyang said that they had suffered the same tragic fate as their compatriots on the north bank of the Yellow River. All food and materials were plundered by the communists, and the people's livelihood and freedom were arbitrarily slaughtered. Everyone can ask the people who have escaped from the communist areas about these facts. If our compatriots are not vigilant, and do not unite under the leadership of the government to fight for the foundation of the country and for personal survival, then once they are controlled by the communists, there will be no day to turn over.

### Central Political Committee Reviews the Situation, Believing That the Current Goal Should Be to Fully Support the Military

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee held a temporary meeting on the morning of the 8th after the central memorial week. President Chiang personally presided, and Li Zongren, Zhang Zhizhong, and others participated. At the meeting, He Yingqin and Wang Shijie gave separate reports on military and diplomacy. The military report briefly explained the Northeast war and the deployment of the Xu-Beng line. He stated that the deployment of the Xu-Beng line was well-prepared, and if the communists invaded, it would not be enough to shake it. The diplomatic report covered the attendance at the UN General Assembly and diplomatic policies. Then, the members spoke to review the current situation. In the end, a conclusion was reached that the current goal should be to fully support the military and seek military victory. The diplomatic policy part will be studied later, and then the meeting adjourned. No other proposals were discussed at the meeting today.

### Difficult and Dangerous Situation Can Be Turned from Danger to Safety, The Northeast Will Be Recovered With All Our Strength

Finally, everyone must recognize that the current war is actually an extension of the War of Resistance and is a long-term national war. In February 1946, I once said to compatriots in Shanghai: "Our War of Resistance has been victorious, but we still have to go through a long and arduous struggle for years to truly seek the independence of our country and the freedom of our nation." Our nation's past eight years of resistance and three years of communist suppression were for the purpose of recovering the Northeast and safeguarding our country's lifeline. Even if the Northeast is temporarily lost, we will eventually use the strength of our entire nation to recover it. I want to tell everyone today that although the Northeast military has failed this time, the foundations of politics, economy, and military in the interior have not been shaken in the slightest. Compared with the strength of the communists, we still hold the advantage. The current problem is whether we can strengthen our confidence internally, unite as one, and whether we can boost our spirits and concentrate our strength. If we continue to allow communist spies to spread poisonous propaganda, causing mental distraction and psychological wavering, then the communists, who originally have no strength, can still use various methods to threaten us. Conversely, as long as we can unite our spirits and concentrate our strength to deal with the communists, then no matter how dangerous and difficult the situation is, we can still turn danger into safety and turn defeat into victory. Everyone should recall how rampant the reactionary forces of the communists were in undermining the National Revolution between 1924 and 1925, but we did not waver in our confidence and finally subdued them. Looking at the revolutionary history of these past twenty-odd years, we can believe that my words are absolutely correct. At this time of turbulent situation, the only essential condition is to first seek stability. Only with stability and calmness can we consider new solutions. I hope that responsible comrades in various central departments will be patient and calm, uphold the principle of military first, support the overall decision-making, and conscientiously implement it together. In this way, not only can the overall situation be restored, but the communists can be eliminated sooner. Now the communists are doing everything for the military, and their party, government, and military are all implementing a wartime system, while everything on our side is still in a peacetime state, loose, complicated, and uncoordinated. How to strengthen wartime awareness and implement a wartime system, how to concentrate energy, save time, and seek coordination of work and uniformity of steps, is a question that all comrades should seriously consider. As long as this question can be resolved, then we will definitely be able to break through the difficulties and save the situation. My personal attitude towards doing things in my life is that I will not start a thing unless I have to, and once I start, I must strive for its success. I will not easily undertake any duty, and once I undertake it, I will decide to be responsible to the end. Especially in the past thirty years, I have always solemnly decided before launching any battle, and once launched, no matter what setbacks, difficulties, and failures I go through, I will definitely fight to the end to carry it out to the end. The future communist suppression war, like the War of Resistance, will have to go through countless hardships, but in the end it will definitely achieve its goal. Everyone can believe that I am certain of turning danger into safety, and must strengthen common belief, establish self-confidence, and also believe that the invincible power of the Three Principles of the People and the national spirit will surely lead to the final victory. (End)

Editorial

### How to Prevent Further Economic Deterioration

Since the lifting of price controls, prices have been like a wild horse that has broken free, galloping and jumping wildly, and have become completely unmanageable. In the past few days, the situation has become increasingly severe, causing Shanghai citizens to feel threatened in their daily lives, filled with unease and anxiety. Although only a short seven or eight days have passed since the lifting of price controls, the prices of rice, cooking oil, flour, coal, and other daily necessities have increased tenfold, and prices vary from morning to evening. The alarming rate of increase has truly caused ordinary people to tremble with fear.

The main reasons for this situation in the Shanghai market are roughly as follows: (1) Market prices are soaring, increasing several times a day; (2) There seems to be planned panic buying of goods such as cotton cloth and cigarettes, making it impossible for merchants to cope, forcing some to temporarily suspend business; (3) Interest rates are too high, making it impossible for legitimate industry and commerce to progress; (4) Large quantities of certain goods are flowing out, and local reserves are dwindling daily; (5) The daily necessities such as rice and oil are not only rising sharply in price, but also in short supply. In fact, when taken together, these boil down to three issues: the price of goods, the supply of goods, and the financial situation. Therefore, to effectively solve the problem, it is necessary to prescribe the right medicine and quickly devise countermeasures to address these issues.

According to the supplementary regulations, future prices should have a portion rapidly determined as a base price, while the remainder should be left to free trade. The so-called base price should be handled by the central government for some goods, and by the local government for others. After a long period of rigid price controls, whether they are goods with a base price or goods subject to free trade, a considerable adjustment must be made due to various real-world reasons. Although this is an inevitable result, we believe that if the goods with a base price can be quickly determined, announced, and implemented one by one, and at the same time, the determined prices can be coordinated and effectively supervised and enforced, then it will not be difficult to quickly establish a new level of prices for all goods. The market is currently in a state of chaos, resembling a burnt-out mess. In addition to strictly prohibiting panic buying, cracking down on hoarding, and maintaining normal order to reverse this chaotic situation, it still seems necessary to follow the above-mentioned approach to quickly seek remedies in order to stabilize prices. Otherwise, the goods subject to free trade, due to the lack of constraints, will indeed run wild like a runaway horse, while the goods with a base price will all use the excuse of being at a loss as to what to do and engage in widespread discussions, seeking exorbitant profits, or openly suspending business and enjoying the benefits of hoarding. If things continue in this way, it is hard to imagine what kind of situation the market chaos will evolve into.

The issue of goods supply includes two important factors: increasing production and streamlining the source of supply, with the latter being even more crucial in the current emergency situation. Specific measures, in addition to facilitating transportation, subsidizing funds, and immediately abolishing the bans on goods leaving the area, should focus on the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Because after a long period of price controls and requisitioning, farmers have suffered greatly and are unwilling to bring various agricultural products to the market, either storing them at home to wait and see, or delaying harvesting to avoid excessive taxation, or imitating the fashionable slogans popular in the city, calling for bartering. Implement a policy of exchanging surplus rice for surplus cloth. As a result, cities are empty, unable to hoard, and even less able to meet the needs of large cities. Rice and grain are now allowed to flow freely, and the unauthorized bans on exports between various regions have also been effectively cracked down on, but large cities and inland cities are still generally suffering from food shortages, precisely because this main problem has not been solved.

As for the urgent shortage of money, there are too many reasons, and there is no need to analyze them further here. However, if the fundamental problem of an abundance of idle capital is not resolved, then the shift in the direction of money laundering and the prosperity of national savings will inevitably fluctuate, tightening and loosening alternately, making it impossible to effectively control. Therefore, the fundamental solution lies in regulating issuance and contracting currency to stabilize the financial market. If, due to time-sensitive relationships, merchants have too little capital, hindering their legitimate business, then it is the duty of the national bank to consider how to use surpluses to help deficits, open up loans, and regulate market interest rates, which should not be without solutions.

In short, since the revision of economic policies, the adverse effects that have occurred in all aspects have been too profound, causing the general public to re-enter a state of confusion. If this situation is allowed to continue and is not quickly remedied, it is feared that it will escalate from economic problems to social problems and even public security problems, which is truly an event that cannot be ignored! It is hoped that all relevant responsible authorities will quickly take the necessary actions to prevent the economic situation from deteriorating further!

### Far East Tribunal Announces Verdict - Itagaki Identified as Chief Culprit of Aggression Against China - Ranked as One of Two Principal Offenders Alongside Doihara

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch] The International Military Tribunal for the Far East has formally determined that September 18, 1931, was the beginning of Japan's aggression against China, and that the "September 18th Incident" was also the spark that ignited World War II. In the final verdict announced by the Tribunal today, it was specified that Japan was the aggressor in the fifteen-year Sino-Japanese War, that the September 18th Incident was premeditated by the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, and that this plan was clearly part of Japan's "overall plan" to control China. The Tribunal announced today that Itagaki Seishiro and Doihara Kenji were the two principal offenders in the September 18th Incident, and that several incidents subsequently created by Japan were also carried out by them, ultimately leading to the Sino-Japanese War. The Tribunal's verdict contains two lengthy sections narrating Itagaki and Doihara's various misdeeds in the history of Japanese aggression. Others, such as Araki Sadao, Umezu Yoshijiro, Muto Akira, Hirota Koki, Oshima Hiroshi, Umezu Yoshijiro, Tojo Hideki, Kido Koichi, Minami Jiro, Hashimoto Kingoro, Okawa Shumei, Matsui Iwane, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Koiso Kuniaki, were also named in the verdict as principal figures in the aggression against China. The verdict also stated that Japan began to invade China after the Tanaka Cabinet came to power in 1927. Extreme nationalist organizations such as the Black Dragon Society also supported this policy, and Itagaki, Doihara, and leaders of the Japanese political and military circles, such as Hiranuma, Koiso, and Araki, were all related to these organizations. The Tribunal also declared that Itagaki Seishiro was the first Japanese military man to publicly advocate the military occupation of Northeast China. Itagaki's policy was approved by Minami Jiro and executed with the assistance of Doihara. Doihara was the chief advisor and coordinator of this plan, and Itagaki and Doihara were also the main planners for the establishment of the puppet governments of "Manchukuo" and Wang Jingwei. The Tribunal also specifically emphasized that the people of Northeast China and the headquarters were not demanding a movement to establish a new government.

### Sichuan Sugar City - Zizhong

— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Chengdu, 3rd Day Airmail] Sichuan is the largest sugar-producing area in our country. The Tuo and Fu River basins cover 46 counties, with over 8 million *mu* of sugarcane planting area. According to a Taipei telegram from Taibao on the 3rd of last month, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to develop the sugarcane industry in Sichuan and Guangdong, decided to jointly establish the Sichuan Sugar Factory in Yinshan Town, Zizhong, Sichuan, with the Ziyuan Committee. Because of this exciting news of developing the sugarcane industry in Sichuan, our reporter took advantage of the clear autumn weather to come to Zizhong, the second largest sugar city in Sichuan located in the heart of the Tuo River basin, and spent half a day quickly observing the recent sugarcane production situation in Sichuan.

The Sugar City's Hardships – Natural and Man-Made Disasters

Zizhong is located more than 300 *li* east of Chengdu and is the second largest sugar-producing area in Sichuan, second only to Neijiang. Generally, when speaking of Sichuan sugar, Neijiang is often taken as the representative. However, in terms of future development, Zizhong possesses far more conditions than Neijiang. Stepping into this beautiful sugar city surrounded by rivers on three sides, sugarcane forests are lush everywhere, and chimneys stand tall, presenting an extraordinary scene under the autumn sun and twilight. There are about 800 large and small sugar workshops throughout the county, with sugar-producing areas including Yinshan, Qiuxi, Taiping, Longshan, and more than ten towns. There are more than 200 sugarcane production cooperatives. Statistics show that last year's total sugar production was over 57 million *jin* (catty). According to surveys, in Zizhong, which spans over 100 *li* and has a population of 300,000 to 400,000, about 70% to 80% of the people directly or indirectly depend on the sugar industry for their livelihood. The reporter arrived in Zizhong just in time for the annual harvest season, but due to the summer floods and the overflowing of the Tuo River, the sugarcane production suffered greatly. Furthermore, coupled with the currency crisis in the autumn, Zizhong was hit by the price surges in Chengdu and Chongqing. The capital represented by sugar workshops and the labor represented by sugarcane farmers are generally in a recession. Everyone wears a worried and bitter expression, with feelings of desolation and depression. This indicates that Zizhong's sugar industry this year is facing an unprecedented contraction.

Production Decline - Two Reasons

The current situation of the sugar industry in Zizhong represents the general recession of the sugar industry in Sichuan. According to the opinions of people from three levels – sugar workshops, small refineries, and sugarcane farmers – the fundamental reasons for the recession are: First, the sharp rise in prices and economic turmoil have caused a disconnect between production costs, sugar prices, and commodity prices. For example, in January of this year, the price of sugar was 80 million *yuan* (legal tender) per 10,000 *jin*, and in October it rose to 5,000 gold *yuan* (equivalent to 15 billion legal tender). However, the fluctuation of grain prices far exceeded this, and sugarcane farmers' income from growing sugarcane was far less than the profit from miscellaneous grains. As a result, some sugarcane farmers switched to growing sweet potatoes this year. Secondly, loans are difficult to obtain. For example, this year's sugarcane loans in Zizhong totaled only 45 billion, averaging 1.5 million per *mu* (equivalent to 0.5 gold *yuan*). At the same time, Sichuan provincial banks recently stopped sugar loans due to capital increase issues. With rising prices and high sugarcane prices, sugarcane farmers feel unable to maintain their livelihoods and switch to other occupations, while small refineries and sugar workshops reduce production due to their inability to raise funds. The sugar industry naturally falls into recession. The second reason is the lack of coordination between labor and capital. The three levels of sugarcane production – sugarcane farmers, small refineries, and sugar workshops – previously adopted the "selling green sugarcane" system of pre-selling autumn sugarcane. Now, the "evaluation policy" is adopted, but both sides have conflicts of interest, and their feelings are not harmonious. For example, the "Zizhong Sugar Riot" that shook Sichuan last year, in which sugarcane farmers destroyed the county government, is an example. Due to the different paces of these three aspects, they have failed to work together for progress, which has limited the sugar industry's production significantly.

Outdated Methods - Awaiting Improvement

As a major obstacle to the progress of the Sichuan sugar industry, there is also the outdated production method. Walking around Zizhong, it is difficult to find a modern sugar factory. The sugar-making process is purely old-fashioned. The process is: First, the sugar workshop presses the sugarcane into juice and boils it to produce raw sugar. Second, the small refinery further processes and refines it to produce refined sugar. The tools are stone mills, iron pots, earthenware bowls, mud, and animal power, relying on the experience of old-fashioned "sugar-boiling masters." From pressing the sugarcane to producing sugar, it takes more than a month, making both cost and time uneconomical. It is truly difficult for Sichuan sugar produced by this extremely old-fashioned method to compete with mechanized sugar production.

Another factor is the limitation of climate and soil. Sugarcane is a tropical product. Looking at the sugar-producing areas around the world, such as Cuba, India, Java, and our country's Taiwan, Guangdong, etc., the latitude is below 25 degrees, and the average temperature is above 20 degrees. Sichuan's latitude is above 26 degrees, and the average temperature is below 17 degrees. Due to the colder climate and shorter growing season, coupled with the fact that more than two-thirds of Zizhong's sugarcane soil is mountain soil (mountain soil is better than plain soil), and the land is located in a hilly area, it is not easy to concentrate sugarcane. Due to these two limitations, Zizhong sugarcane farmers mostly use the seedling planting method, with a two-year rotation. Natural development is greatly hindered.

When discussing the improvement of Sichuan sugar, Zizhong sugar industry personnel place unlimited expectations on Taiwan Sugar Corporation's establishment of a factory in Zizhong. It is generally believed that the improvement of Sichuan sugar should focus on: First, improving production methods. Second, transplanting superior sugarcane varieties and improving cultivation methods.

Sichuan sugar has a long history of nearly 300 years. In the past, its output was the highest in the country, selling throughout the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the northwest and Kangzang areas. During the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of the rebellion, it made glorious contributions to the people's food supply and the national tax revenue in the rear areas. Sichuan sugar should have a future. Taiwan Sugar Corporation's establishment of a factory in Zizhong undoubtedly brings a bright future to the development of Sichuan sugar.

### The United States is Considering Various Diplomatic Issues; New Policies to be Adopted Towards China; Truman Flies to the Little White House for Vacation

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The United States is apparently prepared to take various steps to join the North Atlantic Military Alliance. This is the result of a series of White House foreign policy discussions over the weekend. During his short stay in Washington, Truman met with Undersecretary of State Lovett three times. It is reported that Lovett briefed the President on major foreign policy issues, including the situation in China. The President apparently approved Lovett's continued negotiations to complete the North Atlantic defense plan. Although there are rumors of personnel changes among senior U.S. foreign policy officials, it is generally expected that Truman will retain the current officials, at least until the next Congress approves his foreign policy program. The program may include: (1) Asking the Senate to approve the North Atlantic Military Alliance; (2) New measures to deal with the critical situation in China; (3) Allocating funds for the second year of the European Recovery Program, while stipulating new military lend-lease assistance methods. Friends of Secretary of State Marshall say that Marshall's intention to resign is firm and there is no question, but if the President insists on him remaining in office for a period of time, Marshall will undoubtedly agree. At the same time, if Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Lovett are retained by Truman for a month or two, they may also agree. Regarding the next steps in advancing the North Atlantic Treaty, the State Department will likely consult with Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic Senator Connally within days. Connally is expected to become Chairman of the Committee in the next Congress. Meanwhile, the five Western European countries are drafting a treaty to present to the United States within a week or ten days as a basis for substantive negotiations.

[Central News Agency, Key West, 7th, United Press] The entire city turned out to welcome President Truman, who was re-elected. In this election, the city supported Truman by a ratio of ten to one. The President came here to vacation at the Little White House at the submarine base. Military bands and victory parades proceeded along the way, and the crowds on the roadside cheered. One road has already been renamed "Truman Street." The President arrived here on the "Independence" special plane at 3:50 PM Eastern Standard Time. On the way, he made a short stop in New Bern, North Carolina, to attend the worship service at the First Baptist Church, which has a history of 100 years. Several members of the President's staff accompanied him on this trip. However, Truman told reporters that this trip was indeed for vacation and that there would be no rest for several days. His first goal is to rest and relax, and the vacation is scheduled for two weeks. However, Truman will release important news before the end of the vacation.

### Hopes for Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations; Secretary Marshall to Return Home for Consultation; Argentine Foreign Minister to Confer with British Counterpart to Resolve Berlin Crisis

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the anniversary of the revolution yesterday was moderate in tone, and diplomatic circles here are speculating that there may be hope for improved U.S.-Soviet relations. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall may return home this month to consult with President Truman on everything.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is now in England to confer with Foreign Secretary Bevin on resolving the Berlin issue. It is reported that Bramuglia advocates that the four major powers should hold consultations to resolve the Berlin issue in order to obtain the preconditions for an agreement. It is reported that Bramuglia may convene a meeting of representatives of neutral countries in the Security Council in Paris on the 10th. According to some sources, Bramuglia will suggest that the Berlin issue should be discussed directly by the four major powers.

### U.S. Secretary of Defense Announces Retirement Next Year

Douglas May Become Secretary of State

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Secretary of the Navy Sullivan were photographed by reporters at the White House today.

A reporter asked if Forrestal planned to leave the Truman administration, and his aide replied, "He probably has no intention of staying in office for another four years." [United Press, Washington, 7th] If U.S. Secretary of State Marshall insists on resigning, U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas became the best candidate favored by members of Congress to become Secretary of State on the 7th. Douglas has the support of many members of Congress, and their opinions will likely carry significant weight when the time comes to choose a Secretary of State. Douglas visited President Truman on the 6th to prepare to return to London.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] The Soviet bloc representatives in the United Nations Political Committee on the 8th struggled to change the action against Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for aiding Greek guerrillas. This even led to a personal dispute between Soviet representative Malik and Yugoslav representative Bebler and Political Committee Chairman Spaak. After Bebler failed in a series of actions to prevent the vote of Western countries, he accused the Political Committee of siding with one side.

At this point, Spaak roared, "We cannot tolerate insults!" Bebler did not dare to show weakness, frequently waving his finger and saying in fluent French, "It is our country that has been insulted." The final vote on the Balkan issue will be postponed to the evening of the 13th.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] UN General Assembly President Evatt today sent a telegram to Greek King Paul and Prime Minister Sophoulis, requesting a stay of execution for the ten labor leaders sentenced to death by the Athens military court.

### Most of This Year's World Rice Crop is Abundant

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported today that world rice production this year has almost reached pre-war levels. The harvest for 1948-49 is estimated at 7.3 billion bushels, compared to 7.1 billion bushels last year and a pre-war average of about 7.45 billion bushels. The increase in production this year is mainly due to more abundant harvests in most rice-producing countries, especially Japan, Korea, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. The above-mentioned countries have made progress in restoring pre-war planting levels. China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Ceylon also had abundant harvests. The total production in Europe, Africa, and North America is also comparable to last year's record. The world's rice planting area has increased by about 3% compared to pre-war levels, but the average yield per *mu* is inevitably lower than before due to fertilizer shortages and poor soil in some areas. Political unrest in Vietnam has prevented a large increase in planting area. Siam is the only rice exporting country in Asia, and the planting area has been continuously increasing since the end of the war.

### Authorities to Hold Emergency Meeting Today to Sell Off Goods and Contract Currency; Principle Decision to First Sell Off Part of the Cotton Yarn and Sugar

[Our Report] The degree of price fluctuations in the city in the past three days can be described as unprecedented. The reasons for this, in addition to the impact of the Sulu war on people's minds, another important factor is the large influx of hot money from North China. The amount of hot money arriving in Shanghai every day exceeds 100 million gold yuan at the highest and is at least 50 million or more at the lowest, and the only outlet for this batch of hot money is to snap up goods. It is learned that the relevant authorities in the city intend to re-adopt the method of selling off goods and contracting currency in order to cope with the situation, but some modifications will be made technically. Director Wu Kaixian visited Yu Jilu, chief secretary of the Economic Inspection Committee of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, chairman of the Goods Adjustment Committee, yesterday morning to make preliminary consultations on this matter. It was decided in principle to first allocate a portion of cotton yarn and sugar from the Central Bank and implement the sale starting today. As for the source of the goods to be sold off and the detailed implementation methods, they will be decided at today's Goods Adjustment Meeting.

[Another News] The Shanghai Economic Supervisor's Office, in order to regulate the Shanghai market's goods and review various negotiated prices in order to stabilize prices, will hold a temporary emergency meeting at the National Bank Supervisor's Office at 9:30 AM today (9th). It will be personally presided over by Supervisor Yu Hongjun. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy President Liu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others will be invited to attend. Important decisions will be made on the financial economy and prices in Shanghai in the future.

Mayor Wu Kaixian, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Shanghai Supervisor Tao Baichuan, Chairman of the City Local Association Du Yuesheng, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, and other people concerned about the food and price issues of the citizens of Shanghai, yesterday morning at 9:00, discussed how to solve the current difficult issues. It has now been decided that in addition to dredging the source to smooth its flow and bartering goods to strive for balance, the city relief association will start the porridge factory this winter early to benefit the poor.

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Advocates Distributing Flour Day and Night

[Our Report] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian said yesterday: The authorities have discussed and decided to start with contracting currency and supplying food as much as possible to deal with the current crazy prices. Taiwan Sugar Corporation and China Textile Corporation will sell off sugar and yarn in large quantities starting today, and all inventory of the Goods Supply Bureau will also be put on the market as much as possible. Regarding the food problem, the supply of household rice in October is insufficient, so flour will be temporarily used instead. There is a lot of flour in storage, so the supply can be guaranteed. Rice merchants are also transporting rice purchased from producing areas to Shanghai one after another. Currently, because people are panic-stricken, the queues in front of distribution stores are extremely crowded. He will suggest concentrating several distribution points in each district to distribute day and night to reduce crowding. Director Wu said: The government has issued distribution certificates and will definitely be responsible for distribution. Even if it is overdue, it can still be collected. Therefore, he hopes that those with stored grain will not rush to squeeze, so that citizens without overnight grain can receive it first.

### 7,000 Loads of Rice Allocated in Advance for College and University Students

[Our Report] The food problem in the city is serious. Due to the large number of resident students in major colleges and universities, procurement is difficult, and there is a danger of running out of food. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, more than 30 presidents of public and private colleges and universities, including Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Li Shouyong, Ou Yuanhuai, and Wang Yukai, visited Mayor Wu Kaixian to request assistance in solving the difficulties. After Mayor Wu and the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Food Allocation Committee negotiated, they decided to take emergency measures and allocate 7,000 loads of rice for counting heads for November in advance for the schools to eat. The presidents of major colleges and universities decided to discuss the distribution issues at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 10:00 this morning and exchange opinions on the current situation.

### Hoarded Rice Ordered to be Unsealed and Distributed for Food Supply

[Our Report] The police bureau previously seized more than 4,800 bags of hoarded rice during the general inspection of goods.

### Concrete Measures Obtained to Divert Rice Sources

Dispatching Police to Protect Rice Shops and Wharves

In order to dispel the city's panic about the rice shortage, Mayor Wu summoned Police Bureau Chief Yu Shuping, Director of Civil Food Allocation Office Lu Guixiang, rice industry representative Wan Molin, Head of the Social Bureau's Food Section Ji Mingqi, and more than ten others yesterday morning to discuss measures to divert rice sources to supply the market. Concrete results have been achieved. The mayor also instructed the police bureau to dispatch police to protect various rice shops and wharves, such as Fengji Wharf in the Nanshi area, both sides of the Suzhou River at the Sichuan Road Bridge, the Datong Road Fuxin Wharf area near the Wujin Road Bridge and Hengfeng Road Bridge, the entrance of the Seventh Factory, the Lao Zha Bridge pier, and Shihuigang, among other places. The Rice Industry Association will be responsible for designating several rice shops in each district for centralized supply. It is generally believed that the distribution of household rice and the order of ordinary rice supply will improve from now on.

### Authorities Issue Solemn Statement That There Are Absolutely No Problems With Water and Electricity

Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread in the city, saying, "The British-owned water and electricity companies in this city will suspend water and electricity supply starting today due to a shortage of coal." The municipal authorities issued a solemn statement, saying, "The city has sufficient coal reserves, and we have purchased a large amount of coal from home and abroad, which will be shipped to Shanghai successively. There is no need to worry about shortages. Water and electricity supply is absolutely no problem. The above rumors are obviously spread deliberately by bandits, hoping to confuse people's minds and disrupt social order. We hope that citizens throughout the city will not believe them easily, in order to shatter the bandits' rumor-mongering scheme."

### Pork and Vegetable Prices Continue to Rise Sharply - Mayor Summons Both Industries and Orders Monitoring of the Market

[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu, concerned about the continuous rise in pork and vegetable prices in recent days, which poses a significant threat to people's livelihood, summoned the responsible persons of both trade associations yesterday morning for talks. According to the responsible persons of the associations, the price increases are not caused by the associations but by retailers, because there has been no phenomenon of daily price increases at the wholesale level. Mayor Wu ordered them to be responsible for monitoring the market from today. If any retailers are found to be attempting to make excessive profits, they should be reported. From today, the wholesale price will be determined daily by the association, and the retail price will be the wholesale price plus legitimate profit. If there are any further incidents of disrupting the market or raising prices, the association will be held responsible, and severe punishment will be imposed if necessary. The responsible persons of both associations accepted this. However, the Vegetable Industry Association requested a postponement of implementation until tomorrow due to the general household inspection held yesterday, which was agreed to by Mayor Wu.

### Export Trade Completely Stalled - Merchants Hope for Restoration of Loans as Funds Are Difficult to Procure Goods

[This newspaper report] Seventy days after the currency reform, the export industry has completely stalled. According to the opinions of people in the export industry, the way to save the situation is to adjust the exchange rate and restore the certificate of exchange system, and it is also necessary to restore export usance and packing loans in order to be effective. The reason is that the price of export goods is rising too fast. The funds obtained by exporters for selling exchange certificates are not enough to purchase goods in the production areas in terms of time, so it is necessary to restore various export loans to make up for this. Another difficulty to be overcome is that farmers in production areas, due to their knowledge, value goods and belittle currency. Since the currency reform, purchasing merchants often convert legal tender into gold and silver as payment tools. Today, gold and silver have been nationalized, so this method is no longer applicable, but the farmers' concept remains unchanged, and how to solve this in the future remains to be planned. At present, the market for export goods is almost completely stalled. In Shanghai, there is a market but no transactions, and prices often fluctuate at low levels. Taking the market price of tung oil as an example, it was only 260 yuan last weekend, and transactions could not be carried out. The extent of the price increase of tung oil in Hankou and Chongqing last weekend was far below that of other goods. Another major export commodity, bristles, suffered from the tightening of the battle situation in northern Jiangsu last weekend, and the source of supply was cut off. The owners held on to their goods and refused to release them, and transactions were stalled. Tea leaves had a slight uptick in transactions last weekend, but transactions have now stalled again. In summary, judging from the current situation of the export industry, unless the government takes strong action on the exchange rate and other aspects, it is difficult to expect a revival in the short term.

### Report From City Executive Reporter - Rice Sources Are Not Expected to Be Interrupted - 80,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Can Be Shipped Soon - Telegram Sent Requesting Speedy Allocation of Rice From Taiwan to Meet Emergency Needs - Those Who Gather to Seize Rice Will Be Severely Punished

[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu, concerned that the rice market in the city has been extremely chaotic recently, and that there were incidents of rice seizure in various places yesterday, met with reporters from various newspapers at the city government office at 6:00 PM yesterday to report that rice sources are not expected to be interrupted. The city has ordered 80,000 tons of foreign rice, including 60,000 tons of US aid rice and 20,000 tons of rice from the Central Trust Bureau, all of which have been purchased separately and are ready. Once the transportation problem is resolved, they can be continuously supplied to Shanghai. Also, for temporary emergency relief, Mayor Wu spoke with President Weng on the phone yesterday, requesting that he consult with Wei Daoming, Chairman of Taiwan Province, as soon as possible and find ways to rush 10,000 tons of rice to Shanghai in the shortest possible time. Since Chairman Wei is currently in Beijing on important official business, President Weng agreed to find a way.

The city government attaches great importance to the recent out-of-line actions of gathering to seize rice at several rice shops in the city. Mayor Wu also expressed his great anger about this. Since Commander Xuan has gone to Beijing, he contacted Bao, a staff officer of the Garrison Headquarters, yesterday, saying that for the sake of the safety of all citizens in the city, everyone should rise up to stop them. After consultation yesterday, it was decided that the authorities will severely punish those who seize rice in order to maintain local security and social order, and will do their best to protect rice merchants so that rice sources can continuously come to Shanghai.

In addition, Mayor Wu visited Mr. Lapham of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the rice supply problem. Mr. Lapham said that the US will do its best to provide assistance. The authorities are currently discussing adopting a barter trade method for rice. In addition, they also discussed emergency rescue plans, but they will not be announced until they are approved by the US.

Mayor Wu finally pointed out that the cause of the rice panic was due to the central government's price limit policy. Because at the end of September, he knew that the city had 300,000 *zu* of rice in storage. Due to the price limit, no new rice came to Shanghai in 50 days, causing a rice panic. Now the authorities have found a way, and they hope that citizens will be patient during this transition period.

### Lapham Issues Solemn Statement - US Aid Food Resumes Distribution - Witnessing the Severity of the Food Shortage - Efforts to Expedite Shipment to China

[ECA, Shanghai, 8th] Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, issued a written statement today as follows:

First of all, I must explain to the enduring people of the major cities in China that US aid food is expected to resume food distribution in the major cities in December.

"Seeing is believing" is not an empty saying. When I returned to China from the US last week and witnessed the hardship of the people here seeking food, I was shocked. When I was in Washington, although I received reports from the branch office and learned about the food shortage caused by improper economic policies and poor planning here, I did not initially expect the suffering of people of all classes to be so severe.

Large Quantities of Food Are Being Shipped

The food supplied by the US side has been fully implemented. The initial plan was that US aid food would be distributed and sold in the cities again in January next year, while the needs of the autumn of this year would be met by purchasing rice and wheat domestically in China. However, when I received news in Washington that this procurement was on the verge of failure, I immediately sought to expedite the shipment of US aid food already ordered by the ECA to China.

Large quantities of wheat and flour are on their way to China, and large quantities of food are also being shipped from Tacoma, Washington, and various ports on the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, a large quantity of rice can be shipped from Siam to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou by the end of this month. We are now doing our best to expedite transportation.

Working Together to Overcome Difficulties

We firmly believe that starting in December, we plan to use US aid food to provide the majority of the quantity needed for distribution for several months. We are currently planning to assist the Chinese government in procuring food locally in order to reduce the difficulties experienced by the people of the cities this month.

In this extraordinary period, everyone should have the spirit of doing their best in their jobs and serving the public, in order to work together to overcome the difficulties. The US Economic Cooperation Administration is prepared to do its best within its capabilities.

All of our work this year and next year is proceeding according to plan. The cotton and oil plans will be completed, and fertilizers are being purchased. Cotton yarn and textiles made from US aid cotton will be used to exchange for food. The difficulties currently encountered only indicate that the work of the US ECA in the future should be doubled compared to usual.

I come from a country that loves peace and independence and advocates the spirit of production and self-reliance. We hope that the Chinese people can enjoy the same happiness. This is the purpose of our work in China.

### Several More Incidents of Rice Seizure

Yesterday, there were still several incidents of rice and flour seizure in the city. They were all quelled by the police bureau and the Flying Fortress rushing to the scene. They included: (1) The rice and flour in front of the Licheng Rice Shop on Datong Road were seized the night before and yesterday morning; (2) A large amount of flour was seized inside the fence of the backyard of No. 170 Zhongxin Road, Zhabei; (3) More than 30 bags of flour were seized from the Chengtai Rice Shop at No. 1041 Changchun Road. The responsible branch bureau captured one perpetrator, Ma Zhaohua; (4) Thousands of people poured into the Dachang Rice Shop on Yasi River Road yesterday morning to seize rice and flour. The Flying Fortress of Ti'anqiao rushed to the scene and arrested eight people involved in the incident and sent them to the responsible branch bureau for handling.

### Chief Accountant of Hongxing Shenzhuang Suspected of Illegal Foreign Exchange Prosecuted

[This newspaper report] Chen Deming (fugitive), manager of Hongxing Shenzhuang in this city, and Su Zhipeng, the chief accountant, and Zhou Yao, an employee, were prosecuted yesterday by the Special Criminal Court Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of illegally exchanging Hong Kong currency. The Zhuang was accused of frequently exchanging Hong Kong currency privately for profit. Its telegrams with Hong Kong were all sent by the Oriental Economic Research Institute's Detective Station. The station recorded all telegrams daily into a reconnaissance code daily report compilation card and sent it to the Municipal Police Bureau to send personnel to investigate. Because Chen was not there, Lin and Zhou were sent to be investigated. After investigation by the Special Criminal Court, although Su and Zhou denied privately exchanging Hong Kong currency, checking the contents of the telegrams between the Zhuang and Hong Kong recorded in the reconnaissance code daily report compilation card revealed that they were mostly remittance matters, which clearly showed a strong suspicion of privately exchanging Hong Kong currency. A public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law.

### Suzhou District Prosecutor's Office Re-Investigates Case of Shanghai Police Bureau Chief Being Accused

[Suzhou, 8th] Chen Weida, owner of the Shanghai Weida Hotel, previously accused Yu Shuping, chief of the Shanghai Police Bureau.

### General Household Check Successfully Completed Yesterday - City Silent After the Siren, Orderly Exchange of Documents Household by Household

[This newspaper report] The first large-scale household check and national identity card exchange work after the victory in this city was actively promoted by the Household Check and Certificate Exchange Committee composed of relevant agencies, and was fully completed last night in a very smooth manner, following the announced procedures. This check was held at the same time, and the city is vast, so the authorities mobilized nearly 100,000 staff members, including police, military police, teachers, students, construction team personnel, and household registration personnel. They gathered at the security office after the preliminary siren was sounded at 6:00 PM yesterday to prepare everything. Starting at 7:00 PM, all public transportation vehicles entered the factory in accordance with the regulations. The military police were also dispatched to the streets to urge pedestrians to go home. At 8:00 PM, the closure siren rang loudly, and the streets were cold and empty. All theaters and entertainment venues had previously announced the temporary suspension of night shows, and the iron gates were tightly closed. Only neon lights flickered in the sky, and the city was completely in a state of stillness. After 9:00 PM, the checkers began to be dispatched and checked household by household. The residents, having known the procedures in advance, had prepared new and old documents and application forms. The checkers followed the principle of "one-to-one stamping" and only collected the cost of the new certificate on the spot, which was four corners per person. Each household was successfully completed in about one or two minutes, and the order was orderly. At the same time, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, also broadcast the main points of the check on Shanghai Radio Station. All radio stations in the city also broadcast the dynamics of the check at any time. Yu Shuping, Director of the Police Bureau, also went to Nanshi, Pudong, various wharves, the North Station, and the suburbs of Dachang with Lu Xia, Director of the Traffic Section, and Wu Yan, Head of the Special Household Registration Group, to inspect traffic control and the check situation. The special household registration check also dispatched 104 teams to carry out the check on various hotels, refugee areas, water households, and garrison troops. The process was extremely good.

The last passenger train at the two railway stations departed at 10:00 PM. There were not many passengers, and they all entered the station before 7:30 PM. After 7:30 PM, all passenger cars from Beijing to Shanghai only reached Nanxiang. There were no passengers at the North Station, only police officers on guard. However, a special tax police train departed at 12:30 AM.

Brothels such as Huileyi have stopped operating, and the "public house" area has also closed early. Prostitutes either waited for the checkers to arrive or huddled in bed, presenting a cold atmosphere.

The check officially ended after the alarm was lifted at 3:00 AM this morning. The total population of Greater Shanghai will be counted and announced by the Certificate Exchange Committee within five days.

Regarding the gifts given during the New Year and festivals, at the end of last year, he gave Director Sun a Parker pen and Section Chief Lin a Movado watch, and also gave each of them six cartons of Carle Cigarettes. During the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, he gave them several bottles of famous wine. The court asked Sun Jice whether the gifts provided by the witness were true. Sun said that he did not receive the pen, but he did receive the cigarettes. Regarding the donation, it was a temporary loan and he intended to return it later, but they insisted on not accepting it. Other than that, he did not receive any bribes. Later, Le Zhuangxin, head of the investigation section of the Municipal Government, who handled the case, submitted photos to the court, saying that Suzhou Electric Company paid Sun Jice's check, one was from Xinhua Bank on February 18, and the other was from China Bank on September 21. The China check was exchanged by Xinzhong Qianzhuang after investigation. Xinzhong said that it was sent by Xianglan Chemical Factory. Xianglan said that it was delivered by Chongqing Bank. Finally, it was found that it was delivered by Sun, and the court asked Sun about it. Sun was vague and unable to answer, saying that it was borrowed from Suzhou Electric Company. The court repeatedly interrogated the two defendants, Yang Yunfu and Zou Jidao, on the two points of "purchasing certificate" and "distributing tips". The testimonies were the same as before. Finally, the other defendants were asked one by one, and then the defense lawyers of the defendants debated successively. Finally, except for the defendant Sun Zhigang, who was granted bail, the other eleven defendants were returned to custody. The court ordered that witness Zhang Bintong be summoned on the 17th before the trial.

The cotton transaction was sluggish yesterday, and no transactions were made in each stall. Zhoupu seed cotton was shouted at 360 yuan per load in the morning, creating the peak after the price limit was opened. Later, a few holders needed it for lack of orders, so they sold at a high price, and the price returned to 40 yuan. It was soft again after the high price in the afternoon, and the shouting price fell by 20 yuan again.

### Silk Continues to be Popular

There are very few chips on the artificial silk market. Silk weaving industry is very suspicious of whether CITIC will continue to supply next week. The transaction of the industry is extremely deserted. The small silk factories are increasing and decreasing, and the people are very firm. The market is rising wildly. No. 120 Tianqiao shouted 17,000 yuan, and 18,000 yuan slightly supplied and sold. Dongyang shouted 18,000 yuan, and 19,000 yuan bought in. The holders are still watching, and the market is still popular.

Raw silk has continued to rise in recent days, and the market is soaring in a straight line. The premium retail is shouted at 19,000 yuan, and there is a supply on the market. However, due to the scarcity of sources, the industry is quite expected.

Web satin is being absorbed by the street and the gang as much as possible, and the supply is less than the demand, and the market is stepping up. Huaqiang was first shouted at 7,500 yuan, and there were purchases, but no goods were sold. The price rose straight up, and finally did to 9,500 yuan. The rest of the winter colors are very sharp.

### Food Rice Arrives Rarely and the Off-site Bidding Price Rises Amazingly

Food rice arrives rarely, 90 stones arrive in the Nanshi market, and 550 stones arrive in the Beishi market, a total of 640 stones. Most of them are self-operated by rice shops and rice factories, which are directly sold to the retail store, so the market transaction has not been opened. The quotation of the two city markets is 300 yuan for the middle-class white japonica rice, but the off-site rice dealers' bid price has soared amazingly. The bidding price of japonica rice is extremely chaotic and it is still not easy to buy, which is more than double the sharp increase last Saturday.

Wheat Flour

There is no formal transaction, and the residual price off-site has seen a sharp rise again. The bidding price of No. 2 powder is 160 yuan, and there is also 180 yuan, which is more than double the mad rise, and the bran is 120 yuan, which is doubled.

Miscellaneous Grains

The uniform surge, the less half a fold, and the more than a fold. Yellow soybeans were initially shouted at 300 yuan, and then Poyang Zidou was 250 yuan, corn and red grain rose by 50% or 60%. Sesame was rarely opened, milk sesame was 350, and Yangzhou raw kernel had reached 400 yuan.

Edible Oil

The market transaction is stagnant, and the off-site bidding price is amazing. Soybean oil is 1,000 yuan, raw vegetable oil is 900 yuan, and the soybean office was first opened at 100 yuan, and then retreated to 90 yuan.

Edible Sugar Soars

Edible sugar's off-site bidding price continued to soar yesterday, and the public's confidence was exceptionally strong. This street's absorption was not weak, and it was immediately absorbed when it was blamed. The transfer to other ports was particularly eager, and the bidding prices of the stalls repeatedly created new highs. No. 45 Che Baijing had a transaction of 430 yuan. The group sand supply was very scarce, and the bidding price was even higher. Xinghua Bai Xinghua Chi and others all stepped up.

### Importers and Exporters Association Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Import Quotas

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association has raised opinions on the improvement of foreign exchange deposit payment methods and the relaxation of industrial raw material import quotas, requesting the relevant authorities to adopt and implement them. The following opinions are specifically put forward for (A) amending the foreign currency foreign exchange deposit payment method: 1. Production equipment in Appendix (1) and industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) should be allowed to be used by the original depositors in one lump sum. 2. The wheel-in in Appendix (2) is not limited to the number of limited frequency quantities. 3. Cancellation of the stipulation that the deposit can only be withdrawn after one price month of deposit. (B) Relaxation of the input quota: It is required to relax the quota of various industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) to increase production. (C) Resumption of the settlement certificate, so that the foreign exchange fixed price and the settlement certificate's market are integrated to approach the natural level, and for the sake of encouraging exports, the exporter should be allowed to easily purchase 80% of the export foreign exchange for input production equipment and industrial raw materials, so that both export promotion can be achieved and industrial products can be enriched, and the amount of the Golden Yuan Voucher issued will not increase. (D) Resumption of Loans: It is found that exporters often take months from the purchase of goods from the place of origin to the packaging and shipping, so the capital turnover is quite difficult. The government authorities have insight into their situation and have previously held export loans to facilitate the turnover of export funds. Since the implementation, it has been quite effective. To promote the promotion of exports, it is necessary to rely on the government to provide exporters with financial assistance, then export loans should be resumed as a matter of urgency, and the original export loan method should be restored to facilitate the export business.

### Ganzhou East and Ganzhou South Create Demonstration Areas

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 3rd] Ganzhou County in Southern Jiangxi and Yifeng in Eastern Jiangxi have been decided by the provincial government as areas for promoting the establishment of self-cultivating farmers. The Land Administration Bureau, which is in charge of this new policy, has completed the drafting of plans and budget estimates, and is implementing them one by one. It is expected that the goal of "the tiller has his land" in Sun Yat-sen's will may be achieved in three years.

Ganzhou County jurisdiction

The county is vast, and the county is divided into 43 townships, with a total of 932,043 mu of farmland. When Jiang Jingguo presided over the politics of southern Jiangxi, he had already laid the foundation for "building a new southern Jiangxi", so in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he selected Jibu and Baiyun in Ganzhou County to pilot this new policy. The Jibu demonstration area has already been completed, with a total of 720 self-cultivating farmers established, which has been quite effective, but Baiyun's work has been stalled due to the landowner's appeal, and the work has not been promoted under the planned plan.

It is currently planned to collect 300,000 mu of land in Ganzhou County and support 15,000 self-cultivating farmers, which will be handled in five phases. In areas outside the demonstration area, a kind of support for self-cultivating agriculture will be widely carried out to help farmers purchase land for self-cultivation.

Ganzhou County Supporting the Tiller's Demonstration Area

Phased Handling

The townships and towns and time are set as follows: (1) The first phase, which will start in November 37, includes Ganzhou Town, Baiyun, Shuidong, Shuixi, Yongan, Zhangjiang, Huangquan, Chubu, and it will be completed in October 39. (2) The second phase, which will start in February 38, includes: Shashi, Yunan, Li , Qili, Huajiang, Hele, Liandong, Kangxi, which will be completed in January 40. (3) The third phase, which will start in May 38, includes: Shiguang, Nantang, Qingzheng, Shefu, Jiangkou, Jianjie, Yulu, Longkou, Jie Village, which will be completed in April 40. (4) The fourth phase, which will start in August 38, includes: Songli, Guiyuan, Dangyao, Daxing, Xincun, Hutian, Youzhen, Dahu, Changdan, which will be completed in July 40. (5) The fifth phase, which will start in November 38, includes: Wangfu, Xinxing, Changbin, Hanfang, Xiaochai, Xiahan, Changluo, Dabu, Wangmu, which will be completed in October 40.

Yifeng Farmland

The measurement has been completed, totaling about 1.4 million qiu, 623,1781 city mu. Due to the undulating terrain and vast area of the county, it is difficult to implement district collection and directly create self-cultivating farmers in the whole county, just like Ganzhou County. Moreover, due to the heavy workload, it is impossible to carry out it simultaneously in the shortest possible time with human and material resources. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the business in the future, the county decided to divide it into three phases, select wasteland in the villages, and delineate areas with more tenant land as demonstration areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers. The county plans to collect 200,000 mu of land and support 10,000 self-cultivating farmers. The phased handling of townships and towns and time have also been stipulated as follows: (1) The first phase, which will start in November 37, includes: Yanbu. Xuliang. Fengde. Xuanhua, Luxi. It will be completed in October 39. (2) The second phase, which will start in May 38, includes: Hetang·Xinmin·Tangpu. Tiande·Taiping·It will be completed in April 40. (3) The third phase, which will start in November 38, includes: Xinhui. Qingkai·Shuangku·Huanggang·It will be completed in October 40. The

organizational structure

of the demonstration area for supporting self-cultivating farmers is as follows: The county has one chief of the Land Administration Section, which is divided into four sections: land registration, land rights, land price, and land use, with four section chiefs, six staff members, four assistants, and four employees (according to the current establishment of the county government, the Land Administration Section has been tightened, with only one staff member and several assistants to deal with land administration affairs, and there are no full-time cadres in the townships). There are two technicians and assistants, and three business officers. Each township has one land administration cadre, and a liaison office is set up in the demonstration area of the decision-making self-cultivating farmers to deal with the business of the whole area, with one director, two section chiefs, four section members, two technicians and assistants, six business officers, and four employees. Ganzhou County has five liaison offices, and Yifeng has three.

The implementation of the work

measures is divided into 11 items, including land survey, demarcation of demonstration areas, assessment of land prices, declaration of industry and tenancy and land registration review, section collection, compensation of land prices, reorganization and improvement, division of unit farms, allocation and release, and guidance in handling B-type self-cultivating farmers.

Regarding the regulations for dividing unit farms, each unit farm is divided according to the reorganization and rectification results, or the original topography, according to the number of farmers, population, and arable land area in the demonstration area. Each farmer should contract one unit farm as the principle, and its area should be limited to 10 mu to 30 mu. The share

Release of Cultivated Land

One: Farmers who have the following circumstances shall not be allowed to contract land: (1) Those who have bad habits, (2) Those who have misconduct, (3) Those who have weak farming ability. 3: When allocating farms, it should be close to the residence of the cultivator, or the distribution of the original cultivated land, and its area should be the starting point for the pure income to maintain a family's life, but each household should not exceed the top-grade paddy field of 30 city mu at most. The area shall be determined by the demonstration area office according to the total area of cultivated land in the area, the fertility of the land, and the farming ability of each household. 4: The land price of the released land shall be based on the price of the collected land, and those who have implemented the reorganization or improvement may add the reorganization or improvement fee. The land price of the preceding item shall be prepared by the land-receiving farmers with 20% of the cash, and the remaining 80% shall be borrowed from the Agricultural Bank of China with the land price to be collected after the collection of land and the distribution of the release as collateral. The land-receiving people shall repay in installments every year. (The repayment period shall be in accordance with the loan regulations of the Agricultural Bank.) 5: After the land is collected and released, the original deed shall be cancelled, and the land-receiving person shall be issued a land-receiving certificate, and a release list shall be made to the registration authority for registration and to obtain a title deed, and the land-receiving certificate shall be recovered and a title deed shall be issued after the land-receiving person pays off the land price. 6: The released land is prohibited from being sublet or sold.

### White Bear in Hong Kong Searched for Gasoline Trucks U.S. Merchants Took Countermeasures

— Our Reporter Zi Jian

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 8th Air News] During the last World War, the Axis countries purchased a large number of military equipment and raw materials from the Allied countries through neutral Spain. This scene is now appearing again in a corner of the Far East! However, this time the purchase is the Soviet Union, not the Axis powers, and the location is not Spain, but Hong Kong!

The Soviet Union secretly absorbed military equipment and raw materials through Hong Kong as early as 1947. At that time, it only focused on tin ore and rubber, but since Washington announced the prohibition of military equipment exports to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union began to search for trucks and gasoline in Hong Kong. This activity has been particularly significant in the past two months.

With the development of this need, regular shipping has also started between North Korea and Hong Kong. A Soviet cargo ship named "Bierdaova" often travels back and forth, carrying ships of soybeans to Hong Kong, and carrying gasoline, trucks, wireless equipment, rubber, and tungsten ore back to Zhennanpu, North Korea. These transactions are handled by Chinese people, but the master behind the scenes is the "White Bear" of Siberia.

According to the reporter's reliable sources: U.S. gasoline companies in Hong Kong have now taken steps to prevent gasoline from falling into the hands of the Soviet Union. It is said that unless satisfactory documents are presented, it is now not easy to purchase large quantities of gasoline in Hong Kong. A few days ago, a merchant suddenly searched for 50 "Dodge" trucks on the market. At that time, the "Boldava" happened to be sailing from North Korea to Hong Kong, and sensitive people saw a good omen.

I don't know why, when this "Boldava" sailed into the port of Lei Yue Mun, it collided with a British Blue Funnel Line cargo ship, almost burying itself in Kowloon Bay. Fortunately, it was able to sail to a shallow place with injuries and sink, with its bow stranded on the beach. However, more than half of the 2,500 tons of soybeans it carried were lost, estimated to be about 1.5 million Hong Kong dollars. ?

### "Public Opinion"?

— Lightning

The death of Wang Huiteng, the famous opera singer, is said to have been due to "public opinion being a force to be feared." This can be seen in some of the lines from her will published in the newspapers. Her death inevitably reminds people of Ruan Lingyu, who also died twenty years ago from "public opinion being a force to be feared."

In Shanghai, the death of a "famous" woman—especially a suicide—is bound to cause a sensation. These days, Wang Huiteng's death is, of course, a topic for discussion and writing.

In Shanghai, if something happens to a "famous" woman, it is bound to cause a sensation; if the incident also involves a bit of a relationship between a man and a woman—even if it is just a little—the sensation will be even greater and more inevitable. In the previous period, wasn't Wang Huiteng the subject of discussion and writing?

The suicide of Ruan Lingyu twenty years ago and the suicide of Wang Huiteng this year, although the time distance is almost a quarter of a century, this point seems to be no different in China. The so-called "public opinion" still has a terrible power to kill. Therefore, "public opinion" forced Ruan Lingyu to death in those years, and it also forced Wang Huiteng to death today; it is like a jackal in a flock of lambs, a devil in a group of weaklings—

I think there is no need to use a seemingly "grand" formula for the death of a weak person—whether suicide or murder—such as "suicide is the behavior of the weak," or some kind of didactic tone like "…brought it upon themselves." Because this is neither "irreversible" for the "departed," nor necessarily "pursuable" for those who "come after." It is not only of no benefit to the living and the dead, but is also closer to being frivolous. A torrent of grand theories at most reveals a hypocritical, moralizing, and falsely compassionate ugly face!

Therefore, I am unwilling to elaborate on the question of whether Wang Huiteng deserved to die or not, whether she was weak or, on the contrary, strong. What I want to talk about is the so-called "public opinion" in "public opinion being a force to be feared."

"Public opinion" needs no explanation; everyone knows it is the words of "people." But even the single word "people" does not seem so simple. People are round-headed, square-footed animals, but round-headed and square-footed are only the physical form of people, and not necessarily the real people. Our Chinese interpretation of gods is: "intelligent and upright." Therefore, I also dare to make a comment on real "people": "distinguish right from wrong, know shame." Otherwise, the so-called "words" that only have the "human" form, to put it bluntly, are simply bestial noises from human heads!

But what about our "public opinion"? As long as it is a woman, as long as it is a woman with some reputation, once something unfortunate happens, then the so-called "public opinion" immediately rises like a storm: on the one hand, there is chattering, vivid storytelling; on the other hand, there is the use of "flowery prose," "anecdotes," and "romantic tales"... Saying and writing constitute the noisy form of "a hundred dogs barking," and this form immediately turns into a poisoned arrow, shooting straight into the heart of the weak. And so the weak have no choice but to die.

From the death of Ruan Lingyu to the death of Wang Huiteng, we are in such a society, such a country, such an era. Time has absolutely no effect on us. If you don't believe it, this is a fact.

"Public opinion" is needed by a progressive nation, but not the "public opinion" mentioned above. Because true "public opinion" should be the voice of true people. A true person should support the weak, have pity and sympathy for the unfortunate, guide the confused, strike at the violent, and point out the hypocritical. This is the behavior of a true person, the voice of a true person.

But what about our so-called "public opinion" now? It only knows how to flatter the strong, oppress the weak, ridicule the unfortunate, and play with the confused. After forcing the weak and unfortunate to death, it puts on a face of regret or preaching. What exactly is this?

Ruan Lingyu and Wang Huiteng, these two victims, were too honest and too naive. They were bitten by mad dogs but still treated them as humans, and they were still deluded until their death, saying things like "public opinion is a force to be feared." This is a disgrace to "public opinion." What is "public opinion"? Just "wuwu" sounds!

### A History of Shanghai Parks

— Zhong Jian

The Bund Park was originally a mudflat in front of the British Consulate, which gradually rose due to the accumulation of sediment on the wreckage of a sunken ship. In the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1862), the Shanghai Sports Fund Board of Directors resolved to allocate 10,000 taels of silver to develop the area into a park. In the fourth year of Tongzhi, the Bureau of Works began construction, digging up soil from the Yangjingbang River and filling in the beach from Waibaidu Bridge to Beijing Road. On June 20th of the seventh year of Tongzhi (August 8th, 1868), the park was opened. Two months before the opening (in the fourth month of the intercalary year of the seventh year of Tongzhi), the British Consul Winchester wrote to the Shanghai Daotai, stating that the area had been filled by the Bureau of Works, totaling 30 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, and 3 hao, to be used as a public entertainment venue, and that no buildings would be constructed for profit. He requested approval for exemption from land tax; Shanghai Daotai Ying Bao Shi approved the request. However, the mudflat along the riverbank originally belonged to Chinese government land and should not have been freely disposed of by the Bureau of Works.

Hongkou Park: In the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign, the Bureau of Works purchased land outside the boundary of North Sichuan Road to build a shooting range. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), the park was expanded on this land, and designed and arranged by MacGregor, the Scottish superintendent of gardens for the Bureau of Works. Mr. MacGregor was an expert in horticulture and botany, and the scale of the Hongkou and Zhaofeng parks was all due to his management. Mr. MacGregor served in China for twenty-five years and returned to his home country in June of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China.

French Park: This area was originally purchased by the French for stationing troops when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu. The following year, after the signing of the Boxer Protocol, the French army withdrew, and the area became desolate. In June of the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, the Board of Directors of the French Municipal Council began planning to develop the area into a park. In May of the first year of Xuantong (June 1909), the park was completed and opened in early July of the same year.

Zhaofeng Park: Part of the park was originally the site of the Zhaofeng Garden. In the third year of Xuantong, the owner of the Zhaofeng Garden, E.J. Hogg, sold the garden. St. John's University purchased part of it for 140,000 taels, while the southern end of Jessfield Road was purchased by the Bureau of Works. Later, the Bureau of Works expanded the original site to 300 mu. On March 20th of the third year of the Republic of China, the Foreign Ratepayers' Meeting resolved to arrange the area as a public scenic garden and botanical garden center, and the entire plan was handed over to the garden superintendent, Mr. MacGregor, for design. As a result, the beauty of Zhaofeng Park was unparalleled in the city, and its horticulture was especially praised at the time.

The parks opened by the Bureau of Works and the French Municipal Council mentioned above, although within our country, have always been forbidden to our Chinese people. This is one aspect of the discrimination against Chinese people during the concession period. Negotiations for opening began in the eleventh year of Guangxu, requesting the opening of the Bund Park, but the Bureau of Works ignored it. In the summer of the fifteenth year of Guangxu, as a result of negotiations between the Shanghai Daoxian and the British Consul, the Bureau of Works only agreed to issue permits, but each permit was only valid for one week, and the number was extremely small. In the second year of Xuantong, the City Self-Government Office proposed negotiations again, but it was not until the seventeenth year of the Republic of China that the Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting passed the park opening proposal. From July 1st of that year, all parks were opened to Chinese people, and at the same time, a ticket system was implemented. The annual ticket cost one yuan, and the entrance ticket cost ten copper coins.

### Diligence and Self-Help

— Bao Zhongqi

Today I received twelve gold yuan from the accounting department. This is the price I got for a month of diligence and self-help. Looking at these few dollars in my hand, I have endless thoughts.

Let me first explain the meaning of diligence and self-help. This is a kind of work-study experiment. The school helps ordinary poor students and students who come to Shanghai from the war zone, because after they pay a large amount of tuition, miscellaneous fees, board and lodging, they are really short of pocket money for this semester, including buying books, getting haircuts, and transportation expenses. Therefore, the school authorities considered this difficulty and set aside a part of the tuition income as funding for running diligence and self-help programs. Students are assigned to various departments to assist in work according to their specialties. Such a kind of after-school "occupation" can accumulate thirty or forty hours per month. The remuneration is calculated at thirty cents per gold yuan per hour this year, and it is also about ten yuan. Of course, these money may not be worth a look in the eyes of students who spend tens of gold at once, but for poor students, it is always a small supplement!

I once saw a similar record in a magazine: in American universities, they also have this kind of self-help work. One boy was assigned to clean the girls' dormitory. The first day, the girl paid him a dime; unexpectedly, the waitress who served him at dinner was the one who gave him the money during the day. So, after the meal, he put the dime he earned back on the plate as a small payment, and the female classmate accepted it with a smile. Although this is a coincidence, it can be seen that the promotion of this system abroad is already quite common.

However, I feel that it seems that there are some difficulties in implementing it in China for the first time, that is, the psychology of being afraid of embarrassment, really because the environment is too luxurious, and many classmates will laugh at it as low-status work. In fact, as long as we are not too inferior, I think it doesn't matter.

It was in this mood that I worked in the post and telecommunications office for a month. At the same time, in addition to the royalties I usually get from writing, this is still my first time earning money. I cherish every dollar, I want to use it well, because it represents the harvest of several hours of work!

### Lines from the Depths of the Clouds

Sending Thoughts to Shen Shoudong in Little Qingpu

The city connects to fragrant grass, close in sight, the air enters the high autumn, beautifully purple; the stream water is clear and should see the bottom, the traces of chanting going south are likely to become real (hearing that there will be a trip to Songjiang); the wild Xianghua Bridge recalls the previous visit, the Huilao residence deep, recounting old kinship (Yu Huishu), the ancients had the example of poor poets, only the poetry scrolls remain, unable to be poor.

Drinking at Longtou Isle, the wine family resembles Ji Liang, Shi Shen Xuanchang, Deng Sanmu, and also sending to Shi Shufan at sea

Under the cup, the rivers and mountains are resting from the fires of war, regretting the incomplete hegemonic plans! Ten thousand measures of fine wine must be priceless, a consistent strange feeling is believed to be untiring; why does Shao Wen pity Jiang Guan, turning to laugh at the fish and dragons in many difficulties! For several years, I have left a crazy state in the lakes and seas, after the misty rain, there are old traces on my head.
