### The Executive Yuan Will Hold a Temporary Meeting Today to Discuss the Drafting of Policy Guidelines, Focusing on Policy Priorities

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The policy guidelines of the new Executive Yuan will focus on earnestly implementing the constitution, careful planning, improving work efficiency, and promoting a spirit of reform. Following preliminary discussions at the first meeting the previous day, it has been decided that a temporary meeting will be held again on the 4th to further discuss the matter. Written opinions from various ministries had been successively submitted to the Executive Yuan by the 3rd, and the Yuan is working overnight to collect and organize them. At the temporary meeting, Weng Wenhao will provide explanations based on the collected opinions, and will present several key points from the opinions of various ministries for discussion, before drafting the guidelines. According to reliable sources, these guidelines will differ from past approaches, eschewing itemized lists in favor of focusing on policy priorities.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] With the convocation of the Constitutional Control Yuan imminent, the Min and Qing parties have stalled on joining the cabinet and participating in the Control Yuan due to the unresolved issue of legislators. According to reliable sources, the election and formation of the Control Yuan members have been able to meet the original hopes of both parties, namely, that one member from the Youth Party and one from the Democratic Socialist Party be included among the ten. Therefore, the Kuomintang side earnestly hopes that the two parties will not insist on a complete resolution of the legislator issue before participating, and that the Control Yuan members from both parties can report for duty immediately. The Executive Yuan will also handle matters in accordance with the opinions of both parties. Although the Democratic Socialist Party has firmly stated that it will not participate in the Executive Yuan, the quota for political appointees will still be reserved, and it has been announced that Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party will serve as an advisor to the Executive Yuan. Zhang Junmai had previously stated that although the Democratic Socialist Party would not participate in the government, it would still adopt the same goals as the government and cooperate as an opposition party. Therefore, although they are not participating in the central government, they will continue to participate in local governments. Currently, the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce, who are headed by the Youth Party, have not reported to their ministries to work. In order to prevent delays in ministerial affairs, the Executive Yuan is considering a method of having other cabinet members temporarily serve concurrently. It is rumored that one of these two ministries will be concurrently headed by the Premier, and the other by another minister.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Li Dang, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, firmly requested to resign, but after Wang Yunwu earnestly persuaded him to stay, he has now, like Xu Baiyuan, dispelled his intention to resign. Both Deputy Ministers of Finance have decided to continue in their old posts. The rumor that Pan Xulun would become the Deputy Minister of Finance is now a thing of the past. Furthermore, Wang Yunwu has rescheduled his arrival at the ministry to the morning of the 5th.

### The Legislative Yuan Holds its Seventh Meeting; The Budget Committee Will Propose a Temporary Motion to Request the Executive Yuan to Expedite the Preparation of the Budget for the Second Half of the Year

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The seventh meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 4th to discuss the unfinished cases from the previous meeting.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan convened a meeting on the morning of the 3rd, chaired by Yin Shuxian. It was resolved to propose a temporary motion at the plenary session on the 4th, requesting the Executive Yuan to expedite the preparation of the national general budget for the second half of this year and submit it to the Legislative Yuan before the 15th, so that it can be reviewed and decided before the adjournment at the end of the month. In addition, there was a discussion on the review techniques. In addition to dividing it into two major categories based on revenue and expenditure, the revenue section will be divided into three groups for review: (1) taxes, (2) debt, and (3) government assets. The expenditure section will be divided into several groups according to the agencies listed in the budget proposal. The coordination of policies and budgets will be reviewed both by group and comprehensively. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of Audit, and other Yuan, ministries, and commissions may be invited at any time for consultation.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] Various committees of the Legislative Yuan are actively preparing to start their work. In addition to holding separate meetings to discuss their own grouping and technical issues such as linking with administrative agencies, the 21-member group meeting of the joint conference of conveners of various committees also conducted a comprehensive study.

### Stipends for Legislators Determined in Principle

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The necessary living expenses of legislators will follow the stipend system of parliamentarians in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and a certain amount of public funds will also be determined. This principle was decided by the 21-member group meeting formed by the joint conference of conveners of various committees of the Legislative Yuan. The group meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 3rd in the East Hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall, chaired by Dai Xiujun. After carefully weighing the various proposals from the joint conference of conveners on the 2nd, and taking into account the objective conditions of national poverty and popular hardship, a rational discussion was conducted. Proposals for cars and Western-style houses were rarely mentioned, and the issue of transportation expenses was temporarily set aside. The issue of personnel was also resolved due to factual difficulties. It was decided that the Secretariat would designate several secretaries to be responsible for assisting each committee member in drafting proposals, without the need for each committee member to employ a clerk. As for the most important issue of public funds, the salary required for living expenses will be named stipend, and the amount will be determined after discussion by the plenary session. However, the majority opinion in the group meeting advocated that it should be slightly higher than the monthly salary of 680 yuan for a first-class official during the Tutelage period, in order to distinguish it from ordinary civil servants. However, in order to avoid criticism, they did not dare to request the treatment of a specially appointed official with a monthly salary of 800 yuan. As for the office expenses, including travel expenses for attending meetings and returning home, it will be named public funds, and the amount has not been determined. It is understood that the hope of the various committee members is that the sum of the stipend and public funds should be at least between 8,000 and 10,000 yuan per year. According to the Secretariat, the group meeting also expressed its intention to strive for improved treatment for public education personnel.

### The Battle on the Outskirts of Nanyang Has Reached Its Climax

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The fighting east of the Baihe River near Nanyang has become increasingly fierce in the past three days. The air force here has repeatedly dispatched planes to assist in the battle, bombing and strafing over 3,000 communist troops in Huangao and Caozhuang and other places. In addition, 500 communist troops were discovered six kilometers southeast of Nanyang and immediately shot down more than half of them. A unit of a certain division of the National Army near Nanyang has broken through the encirclement, but the communists are constantly reinforcing their attacks, and the battle situation remains very heavy.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The center of gravity of the war in Central China has shifted to the outskirts of Nanyang, and the decisive battle of the main forces has reached a fever pitch. At 12:00 AM on the 1st, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Kong Congzhou and other communist forces, totaling approximately 100,000 troops, launched a fierce attack in three routes towards the Minghuang National Army positions ten miles south of Tongsupo (thirty miles east of Nanyang). The surrounding seventy or eighty villages have all been occupied by the communists. Although the National Army was outnumbered, it still fought valiantly. The powerful air force also cooperated with the ground troops in the battle. After fourteen hours of fierce fighting, the battle reached its climax at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. The National Army counterattack troops and the National Army from Nanyang rushed to support from three routes. After three hours of intense fighting, the National Army launched an attack from both inside and outside, and finally defeated the communist troops. At 9:00 PM in the evening, the communist troops stubbornly attacked again. The National Army used dense artillery fire to continuously bombard them, and the communist forces were slightly frustrated. The battle is currently ongoing. In addition, the main force of Chen Yi's 38th Column is still in the northeast of Xiping. The rumor that the communist troops have joined the Nanyang battle is not accurate.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 3rd] The elite troops of our southern reinforcement army arrived in Xiping on the 2nd and will advance westward at full speed to intercept the flanks of the communist troops. The main force of the 38th Column, which failed to attack Queshan, has fled to the northeast of Biyang, attempting to echo the communist troops in Qi Gang and Minghuang from east to west.

More than forty Control Yuan members attended, with President Yu Youren presiding and delivering a speech. He briefly stated that the Control Yuan had been fighting hard for more than a decade. In particular, during the War of Resistance, the Yuan's site was located in Jingangpo in Chongqing, and the two characters "Jingang" (Vajra) were like a portrayal of our members. Each member was indeed as strong and firm as a Vajra. Our efforts over the past decade have finally established a foundation and completed the mission, which is truly gratifying. Afterwards, the Secretariat reported several points regarding the conclusion of work: (1) In accordance with Article 3 of the Law on the Conclusion of Political Tutelage, the original statutory powers of this Yuan should cease on the day the first Control Yuan generated in accordance with the Constitution convenes.

### Reasonable Adjustment of the Powers of the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of General Staff; He Yingqin Officially Assumes Office Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The division of powers between the Minister of National Defense and the Chief of General Staff had some unreasonable aspects in the past. With the approval of President Chiang, it has been reasonably adjusted. All matters pertaining to military orders, such as troop deployment and combat command, are the responsibility of the Chief of General Staff, who can also directly receive the President's command. All matters pertaining to military administration, such as equipment and supplies, are the responsibility of the Minister of National Defense. Regarding this matter, President Chiang gave instructions on the basic principles of the Ministry of National Defense on May 29, stating: "The Chief of General Staff shall carry out military orders on the orders of the President, and military administration matters on the orders of the Minister, or on the Minister's instructions." This instruction and adjustment were publicly reported to all levels of officers in the Ministry of National Defense by He Yingqin when he assumed office on the morning of the 3rd.

### Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in Central China, Bai Chongxi, is About to Take Office

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] He Yingqin, the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, assumed office at 10:00 AM on the 3rd and presided over the monthly meeting of the Ministry of National Defense. Former Minister Bai Chongxi first reported that he regretted having made no achievements during his two years in charge of the Ministry of National Defense. He believed that his old superior Minister He would definitely be able to remedy the shortcomings of the past and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Bai also described his personal duties, saying that the Strategic Advisory Committee is the President's strategic advisory body, and the responsibility for suppressing the communists in Central China is also very important. In the future, in order to achieve success in suppressing the communists in Central China, it is necessary to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and implement the overall warfare plan for Central China. He will soon take office and hopes that everyone will continue to work under the leadership of Minister He. He Yingqin then delivered a speech, humbly stating that he had been engaged in military work for thirty-two years and had long planned to retire. However, President Chiang and Premier Weng insisted on inviting him to take on this position, and he could not refuse, so he had to reluctantly accept. He believed that the position of Minister of National Defense should be held by a civilian, based on his personal observations in the United States. This system is to control the military with politics, so as to avoid falling into the path of military intervention in politics. He felt that it was inconsistent with this system for a military man to head national defense, and hoped that a civilian would be appointed in the future.

### He Yingqin Encourages his Colleagues to Devote Themselves to Serving the Country

He Yingqin also mentioned the simple style of military leaders in various countries, where it is common to see senior officers going to the market to buy vegetables, which should be emulated. He also pointed out that the fact that soldiers in various countries are dedicated to military affairs and do not interfere in politics should also be used as a lesson. Soldiers belong entirely to the country. Article 138 of the Constitution stipulates that the national army, navy, and air force must be outside of personal, regional, and party affiliations, and be loyal to the country and love the people. Therefore, we should not have any factions or any small organizations, and should devote ourselves to serving the country. Regarding the work of the Ministry of National Defense in the future, He Yingqin pointed out that special attention should be paid to the lives of officers and soldiers in order to improve morale, and attention should be paid to the clothing of soldiers as soon as possible. Finally, he stated that the selection of personnel should be based on talent, and hoped that everyone would unite sincerely, overcome difficulties together, and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.

After He Yingqin's speech, Chief of General Staff Gu Zhutong also made a brief speech, saying that there are currently two kinds of mentality among the general public, one is pessimistic and the other is negative, both of which are undesirable. In fact, some of our troops are indeed not as good as the communist troops, but there are also many cases where the communist troops flee when they encounter the National Army. Therefore, if the National Army generals can command and use them properly, suppressing the communists will definitely be easier to accomplish. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM, and He Yingqin immediately went to the Minister's office to handle official business. All the officers had lunch together at noon to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new.

### US Government's Proposed Aid to China Plan Passed by the House Appropriations Committee; Utilization Period Extended to Fifteen Months

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The US House Appropriations Committee passed the US government's requested $463 million aid to China plan on the 3rd, without making any changes to the original text. However, in its report, the committee requested that the US agencies implementing this fund exercise very strict control. The committee also extended the utilization period of the aid to China fund and other Economic Cooperation Administration funds from twelve months to fifteen months.

The aid funds to China passed by the Appropriations Committee stipulate that $125 million can be used freely by the Chinese government. Of the remaining $338 million, $60 million will be used for reconstruction projects. The remaining $278 million will be used to purchase: $85 million for rice and wheat, $72.5 million for cotton, $65 million for petroleum and petroleum products, $24 million for fertilizer, $10 million for tobacco, $20 million for replacement items for existing capital equipment, and $1.5 million for administrative expenses. According to US officials, the $72.5 million worth of cotton designated for China will be handled by privately owned American cotton import companies in Shanghai.

According to Cleveland, the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China section, the purchasing procedures for the aid to China plan are divided into three categories: (1) The rice and wheat section will be handled and shipped to China by the US government. (2) For the cotton section, the Economic Cooperation Administration will issue letters of credit to American banks, ordering them to advance the purchase funds handled by private institutions. (3) After the Chinese and American governments reach an agreement on the types of goods that can be purchased freely by the Chinese government, the US government will pay for the goods purchased by the Chinese government in the future.

During the presentation, Economic Cooperation Administration officials told the committee that they plan to establish an office in China with 147 personnel, of which 25 will be Chinese personnel and the rest will be Americans. A total of 36 people in Washington handle the aid to China plan. Cleveland, head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China section, stated during the committee presentation that most of the wheat and flour in the aid to China plan will be transported to Beiping and Tianjin, and possibly also to Qingdao. Most of the rice will be transported to Shanghai, Guangdong, and Nanjing "and possibly also to some smaller cities in the south."

The minutes of the committee's meeting revealed that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai's opinion on the aid to China plan stated that the aid to China plan "is definitely a matter of urgent importance," but requires strict control to ensure that the people actually benefit. The opinion also called for the abolition of commercial monopolies run by the Chinese government. The American Chamber of Commerce requested that the United States insist on a condition for aid to China, that "China should abide by international customs on the issue of inland waterway transportation." The opinion stated, "The abnormal restrictions imposed on foreign ships for the benefit of small private groups in China have greatly reduced traffic volume and increased water freight rates."

Furthermore, the Da Xiao Wen River Bridge and the Yang River Bridge south of Tai'an are major bridges on the Jinpu Railway, second only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Construction began at the end of January, taking four months to complete. Originally scheduled for a formal trial run on June 1st, it was unfortunately destroyed by the Communist bandits due to the outbreak of war. According to the Railway Bureau, even if the Yanzhou-Jining section is reopened, the bridge engineering is so extensive that it will be impossible to repair it for military traffic within three to four months.

[Our JINAN Correspondent, 3rd] From 9 PM on the night of the 2nd, the bandit's 7th Column harassed the area near Wan De, maneuvering along both sides of the Jinpu Railway north of Jieshou. Fierce fighting lasted until 4 AM on the 3rd, when they were repelled.

Bombing and strafing was also conducted against bandit transport outside Da Wen Kou, and the bandit offensive has been suppressed.

[Our XUZHOU Correspondent, 3rd] The National Army in Sishui, central Shandong, voluntarily withdrew yesterday. Fierce fighting continues in Da Wen Kou.

[Our BENGBU Correspondent, 3rd] on the 2nd, Sixian was entered by local Communists who set fires, causing chaos. Refugees fled to Lingbi in droves.

Their mission is to investigate the Chinese economic situation and study the construction projects to be carried out in China under the $338 million aid plan. In addition to restoring essential transportation equipment, developing fuel and power output industries, exploiting mineral resources, and improving port facilities, special emphasis is placed on Chinese agricultural construction. Ten percent of the total amount of this $338 million aid plan is specifically designated for agricultural construction. In addition, the China Economic Survey Team includes Dr. Mayville, an expert on agricultural issues, who will provide Director Hoffman with methods on how to utilize these funds after investigating the Chinese agricultural economy. Furthermore, according to a United Press report from Washington on the 1st, China and the United States are discussing the establishment of an Agricultural Construction Committee, to be composed of two Americans and three Chinese, to investigate China's needs in agricultural construction. The United States' emphasis on and active assistance in our country's agricultural construction is of great significance from any perspective.

Currently, China's economic situation is indeed on the verge of bankruptcy due to the increasingly expanding scope of the Communist rebellion and destruction. In terms of national finance, revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and the government has to rely on increasing the issuance of currency to maintain operations, leading to today's malignant inflation. In terms of people's livelihood, prices are rising day and night, almost to the point of making life unbearable. Therefore, the entire nation, recognizing the severity of China's economic crisis, attaches great importance to the utilization of the American aid plan. Although the aid funds are limited to $338 million, which is hardly enough to meet China's needs in all aspects, this amount is still a substantial sum during China's economic difficulties. If it can be used well, it can serve as a turning point for China's economic recovery. Conversely, if this fund is not cherished and allowed to be wasted, then American aid will not be effective, and there will be no hope for China's economic recovery. Therefore, how to make good use of American aid is a pressing issue for our country, and the US authorities' emphasis on the use of American aid and special attention to our country's agricultural construction is precisely because of this.

Today, the agricultural issue related to people's food has become a serious problem for all countries in the world. The British economist Malthus's theory of population states that the rate of population increase exceeds the land's ability to produce food. We do not need to overemphasize this pessimistic view, but we cannot help but particularly emphasize the importance of increasing agricultural production in the face of food shortages in various countries around the world. As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." If a famine occurs in any corner of the world, local society will not be stable. Looking at countries around the world, this is the case everywhere. The unrest in Western European countries is still due to the "bread problem." The instability in Asian countries is still due to the "eating problem." Life magazine, published on May 10th, also stated that food supply must double in the next twenty-five years, otherwise famine will occur. Looking back at China, the sufficiency or insufficiency of food for the people has often been the dividing line between governance and chaos in Chinese history. Therefore, at times of dynastic change, there has always been a set of theories to reform the land system. Now the land issue has reached a point where reform is imperative.

Throughout its history, our country has always been a country "founded on agriculture," with 80 percent of the national population being farmers. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to adherence to outdated production techniques, coupled with perennial natural and man-made disasters, the rural areas were already on the verge of bankruptcy. By the time the War of Resistance broke out, the country had reached a critical juncture of survival, and the decline of the rural areas was regarded as a secondary issue. Not only that, but during the eight years of the War of Resistance, a large part of the rural areas fell under the occupation of the Japanese invaders, suffering destruction and devastation at the hands of the enemy, making the already riddled rural areas even more dilapidated. The remaining rural areas that were not occupied by the enemy made the greatest contribution to the War of Resistance in terms of manpower and military supplies for the liberation of the motherland. Under the dual pressures of requisitioning grain and soldiers, the rural areas naturally only deteriorated further. After the victory, it should have been possible to recuperate and first seek the recovery of the rural areas, and then further promote the prosperity of the rural areas. However, the Communist rebellion followed one after another, not only spreading the flames of war to the rural areas, but also causing the Communists to devastate the rural areas to an extreme extent, even surpassing the enemy. In some places, the fields were deserted, and no one was cultivating them at all. In some places, although there were people cultivating, the harvests were far below those of the past due to the lack of technology and fertilizers. Therefore, in an agricultural country, the supply of food has also become a serious problem. If the current situation is not remedied, the food shortage will inevitably worsen, and the domestic disorder will be impossible to quell.

All scholars who study Chinese agriculture unanimously say that if one wants to save the crisis in Chinese agriculture today, one must simultaneously implement land reform and apply scientific technology. Regarding the former, this newspaper's editorial has already commented, while for the latter, we must pay special attention to the United States' assistance to our country's agricultural construction. However, whether the United States' plan to assist our country in agricultural construction can achieve its intended goals, we believe that both China and the United States need to make further efforts. On the Chinese side, it must be understood that the Chinese agricultural problem is a problem that requires both institutional reform and the utilization of technology to be implemented simultaneously. Implementing only one of them without complementing the other will not achieve good results. Therefore, in order to cooperate with the American aid plan, our authorities should first implement land reform, so that all rural areas in the country can achieve "land to the tillers," laying a solid foundation for the United States to assist our country in engaging in agricultural construction. As for the United States, we would also like to take advantage of Dr. Mayville's upcoming visit to China to offer a suggestion to the US authorities. The United States' emphasis on Chinese agricultural construction is indeed a wise and insightful view. However, reforming Chinese agriculture must focus on improving production technology so that it can achieve the goal of increasing production in the short term. However, the funds required for this are enormous and cannot be solved with just over thirty million US dollars. Therefore, we hope that the wise US authorities, in order to assist China in engaging in agricultural construction and fundamentally solve the Chinese food shortage problem, should enact another bill to expand the scope of assistance in order to rebuild Chinese agriculture!

In short, the real crisis of the Chinese economy lies not in the decline of urban industry and commerce, but in the bankruptcy of the rural economy. We hope that the Chinese government, under the principle of "self-reliance," can make good use of American aid and implement a comprehensive rural construction policy.

### Dabie Mountain: Nameless Hero - Twenty Years of Military Life, Never Wounded Once

[Our Correspondent, Xinyang, May 29th, Airmail] Tall, with a robust physique, handsome and generous, this is General Zhang Xudong, the nameless hero who roams the Dabie Mountains, inflicting heavy damage on the communists everywhere.

The Huai River Corridor

He is from Shangcheng, Henan. He joined the army at eighteen, initially leading just over a hundred men in suppressing bandits in his hometown. Due to his youth, capability, bravery, and skill in battle, he repeatedly achieved extraordinary feats and was valued by his superiors. Two years later, he was promoted to battalion commander. At that time, the communist suppression reached a climax in Jiangxi, and Liu Zhenhua was stationed on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, responsible for the suppression work. Zhang, with one battalion, confronted a communist division, earning the appreciation of General Liu and being promoted to deputy commander. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when Zhang Xueliang was the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression and Central China was reorganized, political undercurrents drove him to quietly leave the post he had fought for seven years and go to neighboring Anhui Province. He joined his old superior, serving in the 11th Route Army. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, elders from his hometown repeatedly urged him, and he returned to Dabie Mountain, raising the banner of resistance. He reorganized his former subordinates into a formidable force, like a pangolin, traversing the forests of the Dabie Mountains, eliminating countless enemies, destroying dozens of strongholds, and cutting over five hundred pounds of enemy communication lines. Since the victory, due to his many years of outstanding service, he was supported by the people of his hometown and appointed as the Magistrate of Shangcheng County. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), when the Central China communists became rampant, Liu Bocheng, following Li Xiannian, fled to the Dabie Mountains. Zhang, due to his responsibilities, acted urgently, abandoning his political career as county magistrate and making a comeback. Utilizing his former officers and mobilizing the strength of the people, he established today's Security Regiment. For twenty years, he has been galloping through the wind and sand. He is so familiar with the rural landscapes, mountains, rivers, every small ditch, stream, and path in the Dabie Mountains, as if they are a map constantly hanging in his mind. Therefore, he can stand firm in the Dabie Mountains. He can use the isolated city of Zhengyang to control the great plains north of the Huai River, preventing the communists from moving freely in the Huai River corridor.

Soldiers Come from Hometowns

During my one-day stay in Zhengyang, although he extended his warmest hospitality, with meals and accommodation together, he was simultaneously busy visiting local administrative leaders and inspecting the battlefield, leaving me no time to have a detailed conversation with him. Because I had to leave the next morning, it was not until 11 PM that I obtained his permission for a long talk. When he talked about the growth of his troops, it was as if he was describing a nanny raising a baby to adulthood, exhausting his efforts and enduring difficulties to maintain it until today.

His soldiers can be said to be his "younger brothers," mostly from his hometown. Although they are not truly related, the bonds of hometown sentiment and sharing hardships and difficulties for seven or eight, even ten years, have created an everlasting river of emotion between him and his brothers.

Light Equipment and Strong Mobility

His troops are a completely civilian force, carrying their own guns and automatically fighting bandits. This is the only people's army. It has many advantages: light equipment, high mobility, able to disperse and regroup at will. During the War of Resistance against Japan, when there were no battles during the busy farming season, they were given leave to return home to plant rice seedlings and cultivate fields for three or six months, and then they would return without prior agreement, with no one missing. His troops have good discipline, not violating even the slightest thing. They do not seek vanity, only practicality. They only know how to bury their heads and work hard, regardless of whether the country knows or not, always sticking to their posts. Their battle achievements are no less than those of the National Army. In the past, with two battalions, they defended for seven days. Liu Bocheng led four columns, launching fierce attacks in rotation, but ultimately could not cross the Lei Pool by a single step. In the victory at Liulin, they stormed the communist headquarters with a squad of men, capturing senior communist officers and seizing many spoils of war. This time in Zhengyang, they fought bitterly with more than 40,000 communists besieging the city, eventually defeating them and achieving an unprecedented victory. They have so many merits, but they are not proud at all, continuing to work hard and display a spirit of perseverance and determination.

He Was a Lieutenant Colonel for Ten Years

Speaking of their treatment, it is pitiful, even worse than that of beggars in Shanghai. The allowance for non-staple food is low, and salaries are meager, needless to say. Moreover, the source of this money does not rely on national supplies but is supported by local gentry and people with a sense of justice. They cannot eat their fill, cannot sleep peacefully, have no salaries, do not seek fame, do not seek profit. What is it for? There is no doubt that it is for the great goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Their brothers often say, "We only fulfill our responsibility, the natural duty of a citizen. As for whether the country wants to give us treatment or rewards, that is another matter." Regiment Commander Zhang also said, "I will contribute as much strength as I have, I will defend a city, I will definitely defend it to the end, until the last gun and the last bullet, I will still fight to the end." We talked for three full hours, but there was no sense of fatigue. Time was too ruthless. We had to leave the next day. We mutually held a reluctant feeling, and at two o'clock in the middle of the night, we ended this detailed conversation. Walking out of his bedroom, the lively and vibrant shadows of those soldiers seemed to be still hovering in my mind's memory.

In his twenty years of military life, he has never been wounded once, received eleven citations for merit, and won two medals. He has been a lieutenant colonel for ten years. It is said that Commander Zhang has recently promoted him to a major general. I silently wish this nameless hero well. (Our Reporter, Bu Mian)

### Consolidate National Defense and Stop Aggression: The U.S. Expands the Strength of its Three Armed Forces; House Approves Huge Land and Air Force Expenditures

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The House of Representatives on the 2nd passed an unprecedented peacetime appropriations bill for the Army and Air Force, totaling $6.59939 billion, which has been submitted to the Senate for discussion. The House is scheduled to debate another huge peacetime national defense appropriations bill tomorrow, namely the Navy appropriations bill of $3.68673325 billion for the next fiscal year starting July 1 this year. In total, the Army, Air Force, and Navy will need a total appropriation of $10.18672 billion for the next fiscal year starting July 1. This total appropriation bill, which was submitted to the House by the House Appropriations Committee, stipulates the expenses and strength of the three armed forces in the next fiscal year as follows: Army $5.6182 billion, 790,000 personnel; Navy including the Marine Corps $3.68673 billion, 552,000 personnel; Air Force $891.736 million, 444,500 personnel. In total, the three armed forces have 1,786,500 personnel. The total appropriation for these three armed forces' budgets is $505 million more than this fiscal year, and three times more than the budget when the United States was preparing to enter the war in 1941.

The Army, Navy, and Air Force appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, passed by the House Appropriations Committee and submitted to the House, does not include the $3 million recently approved by Congress to purchase aircraft. The amount of appropriations for the Army and Air Force is 6.1 percent less than what President Truman requested from Congress, or $647.903 million. The Navy's appropriations bill includes the construction costs for a 60,000-ton world's largest aircraft carrier, a submarine-hunting destroyer, two high-speed submarines, and two of the latest-type submarines. In addition, the Appropriations Committee also recommended allocating $361 million to establish Army and Air Force civilian reserve forces, including $240 million for the establishment of the National Guard, $100 million for the establishment of the Officer Reserve Corps, and $21 million for the School Reserve Officer Training Corps, totaling $139.75 million more than the civilian reserve force funds approved by Congress last year. The Army National Guard is expected to reach 300,000 personnel by June 30, 1949, forming 5,000 teams. The Air Force National Guard is expected to reach 341,000 personnel by June 30, 1949, forming 5,514 teams. The funding for the Reserve Officer Training Corps is intended to provide officer training to 30,000 students and basic training to 109,000 students.

### To Counter the Soviet Iron Fist, the U.S. Needs to Expand its Military; Army Chief of Staff Urges Congress to Pass Budget

The Italian treaty included clauses on educational, religious, and press freedom, making it the first treaty signed by the United States with a former enemy country since World War II.

### British House of Lords Rejects Abolition of the Death Penalty Bill

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The House of Lords recently passed, by a vote of 181 to 28, to delete the clause in the Criminal Justice Bill that would have provisionally abolished the death penalty for five years, and returned the bill to the House of Commons. The Criminal Justice Bill was passed by the House of Commons in April. The clause to abolish the death penalty was added after a free vote by members of all parties. The government originally opposed abolishing the death penalty due to the increase in crime after the war, but because this matter was unrelated to party politics and was a matter of conscience, it allowed Labor Party members to vote freely.

### Bernadotte in Contact with Arabs and Jews to Discuss Ceasefire Date in the Holy Land; Twenty-One U.S. Officers to Participate in Supervising the Ceasefire

[Our Report] London 3rd Radio Broadcast: Cairo News, Bernadotte is currently in contact with both the Jewish and Arab sides to discuss the exact date of the ceasefire in Palestine. It is expected that the ceasefire can be achieved this week.

[Our Report] New York 3rd Radio Broadcast: Washington News, the United States has tentatively selected 21 Army, Navy, and Air Force officers to supervise the ceasefire in Palestine for the United Nations and is currently awaiting a formal invitation from the United Nations.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Security Council tonight instructed Bernadotte, the mediator in the Palestine war, to quickly determine on-site the time for the start of the ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish sides. The resolution was announced as passed without a vote, with only the Soviet Union and Ukraine declaring their abstention.

According to the Soviet explanation, this is a consistent position of not supporting the dispatch of a mediator from the beginning. The instruction was signed and issued on the spot by the Syrian representative Curry, the rotating chairman for June. Curry also announced that a meeting would be held on Thursday afternoon to discuss ceasefire supervision matters. Previously, after the Security Council received replies from both the Arab and Jewish sides accepting the proposal for a four-week ceasefire, it held a meeting to discuss implementation measures. Chairman Curry ruled that both sides had unconditionally accepted the ceasefire and that the explanations and opinions listed in the replies from both sides could not be regarded as conditions. U.S. Representative Austin and other representatives then successively proposed giving the mediator three days to implement the ceasefire, which was not adopted. At the same time, the Palestinian Jewish army had revoked the third ceasefire order issued by the Israeli government at sunset today. The Jewish representative announced after the Security Council adjourned that the Jewish army had canceled the third ceasefire order and was fighting again, but would abide by the ceasefire as soon as the mediator stipulated the start time for the four-week ceasefire. Some Jews here have taken a cynical attitude towards the Security Council.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 3rd to discuss what kind of management should be implemented to enforce the ceasefire in Palestine. Before the start of the ceasefire, any serious combat behavior by either the Arab or Jewish side cannot be regarded as a violation of the ceasefire order.

### Arab League to Continue Fighting During Ceasefire Negotiations with Security Council; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Northeast and South of Jewish State

[Our Report] New York 3rd Radio Broadcast: Tel Aviv News, the Jewish government is very pessimistic about the prospects of a ceasefire. According to all reliable sources, the Arab side will continue to fight while negotiating the terms of the ceasefire with the Security Council.

[Our Report] London 3rd Radio Broadcast: Cairo News, battles are still taking place today in the Negev Desert and the northeast and southeast of Tel Aviv. Also, the British Foreign Office announced that all Jewish youths of military age are prohibited from traveling from Cyprus to Palestine.

### Jewish Army Advances; Arab League's Important Cities Under Threat

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 3rd] News from the front lines of the Israeli army on the 3rd stated that the Jewish army in central Palestine has launched a major offensive against the two important Arab cities of Jenin and Tulkarm and is currently only one to three miles away from the two cities. One Jewish army unit, launching from the Jezreel Valley, crossed the Plain of Armageddon and drove straight in, only one mile away from Jenin. Also, a major battle is taking place near the city of Tulkarm, twenty-one miles northeast of Tel Aviv. The Israeli army occupied the Boch Heights, only three miles away from Tulkarm, and drove out a large number of Arab troops in the Nablus area. Last week, the Arab side claimed that the Iraqi army had set out from Tulkarm, reaching the coast and cutting Israel in two. The latest communiqué from the Iraqi army stated that shelling occurred in Kfar Yonah, six miles east of Tulkarm. According to news from the front lines, the Jewish army used artillery for the first time in the attack on Jenin. The Jewish forces in Tulkarm claimed that the fighting was suspended at one point because the Jewish army complied with the premature ceasefire order at 3 a.m. on the 2nd, and now the offensives on all fronts have resumed.

### U.S. Aid for the Reconstruction of Japan and Korea; House Appropriations Committee Does Not Approve

[Our Report] New York 3rd Radio Broadcast: Washington News, today the House Appropriations Committee strongly urged that the funds for the Marshall Plan and other foreign aid plans be reduced by 25 percent. The committee has submitted this opinion to the House, and a fierce debate is likely to occur tomorrow. The committee argued that global aid funds should be reduced to $6.0433 billion. In dollar terms, this is only a 7 percent reduction from the original amount. However, in terms of time, the originally scheduled twelve months are extended to fifteen months, which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction. As for the $463 million in aid to China, it was not changed.

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The House Appropriations Committee passed the fund for the aid to China program without any changes, but did not pass $150 million out of the $220 million requested by the U.S. government to revive Japan, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands. The committee argued that if the government wanted to use $150 million to revive the occupied territories in the Far East, it could draw it from the funds of other Economic Cooperation Administration programs. However, the committee passed all of the funds requested by the government to relieve the people of Japan and Korea, totaling $424 million for Japan and $107 million for Korea, to prevent disease and unrest.

### Arab League Proposes Nine Points on Ceasefire Proposal; Advocates Establishing an Impartial Institution to Supervise the Ceasefire

[Reuters, Cairo, 2nd] The Arab countries' response to the Security Council's proposal for a ceasefire in the Holy Land put forward the following nine points: (1) Nothing is more desired by the Arab governments than the restoration of peace in the Holy Land and the friendly coexistence of the Jewish and Arab residents. The Arab governments believe that there must be guarantees for the ceasefire, otherwise the ceasefire will only be a preparation for larger-scale battles; (2) The Arab governments acknowledge that the Security Council has considered their previous opinions, namely that the ceasefire should only seek a reasonable solution. Therefore, the Arab countries are very satisfied with the Security Council's appointment of a mediator to maintain contact with both the Jewish and Arab sides; (3) The main mission of the mediator is to obtain a peaceful and reasonable solution. The Arab governments are convinced that the mediator will confirm that resolutions that do not comply with the will of the majority of local residents and do not conform to the principle of political unity in Palestine cannot be successful; (4) Opening the doors of Palestine and allowing the unrestricted immigration of Jews undoubtedly runs counter to the purpose of the ceasefire and is the greatest threat to the Palestinian Arab people and the entire security of the Middle East; (5) The Arab governments are convinced that the purpose of the Security Council cannot be to allow the Jews to take advantage of the ceasefire to allow a large number of young men of military age to flood into Palestine in the name of immigration. These young men are clearly combatants who are prohibited from entering Palestine during the ceasefire period under Chapter Two of the Security Council's resolution; (6) The Arab governments hope to have an impartial and capable institution to monitor the implementation of the resolutions related to the Security Council and the ceasefire order; (7) The Arab governments do not believe that the Security Council's resolution has adequate guarantees to ensure that both parties will strictly abide by the ceasefire conditions and rules. For this reason, the Arab governments, in their capacity as members of the Arab League, are willing to cooperate with the mediator and the United Nations Ceasefire Committee to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire regulations and conditions; (8) In order to establish peace in the Holy Land and seek a reasonable solution, the Arab governments accept the Security Council's proposal for a four-week ceasefire, the term of which will be calculated from a date to be determined; (9) The Arab governments' acceptance of this proposal is sufficient to prove their sincerity in cooperating with the United Nations to seek a reasonable solution.

### US Strengthens Bases in Japan: Yokosuka Becomes a Mini Pearl Harbor, Honshu's Giant Airfield Only 700 Miles from Vladivostok

[Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd] Allied observers here feel that the United States' policy toward Japan has gradually changed. The US military intends not merely to be a pure occupation force, but to strengthen its bases in Japan. The United States seems unwilling to convene a peace conference with Japan quickly in order to extend its stay in Japan. Although MacArthur recently reiterated his desire to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, his opinion does not seem to have received full support from the Army authorities and the State Department. Currently, on Kyushu, Honshu, and the islands of Hokkaido, Japan's original airfields have been greatly expanded.

Kyushu recently completed a new airfield, and at the northern tip of Honshu, a airfield is being built that can accommodate the largest bombers currently being designed in the United States. The site is only 700 miles from Vladivostok. Unofficial estimates put the cost of constructing the airfield at US$13 million. Since the Far Eastern Commission has not allowed Japan to operate domestic or international air routes, these airfields are clearly not for Japan's use. The US Navy base in Japan, Yokosuka, is also being permanently planned, with new construction no less than a mini Pearl Harbor. These symbols are sufficient to indicate the United States' unwillingness to leave Japan. Although senior US officials deny that the United States will support Japan as its military ally, they do not deny that the United States will remain in Japan based on military needs. In addition to military equipment, the United States has also spent a large amount of money in Japan. If Clapp's proposal is implemented, even more money will be spent. The United States certainly does not want this huge investment in the Far East to fall into the economic sphere of influence of the other side after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.

### Urging MacArthur to Return Home: Effectively Abandoned

US Senate Appropriations Committee Makes No New Recommendations

### ECAFE Debate: Indonesia's Participation

Differing Views Among Countries on Indonesia's Status

This issue was raised at the last meeting of the Commission, but was not resolved. The question is whether the Yogyakarta-based Indonesian Republican government will be an associate member or part of the Dutch delegation. Britain and France support the Dutch position, while India, Australia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan support the participation of the Indonesian representative as an associate member representative. The Soviet representative also supports India's opinion.

### Special Criminal Court Declares Non-Acceptance: Dance Craze Case Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office, Most of the Detained Male and Female Defendants Expected to Be Released on Bail the Day After Tomorrow

[This Newspaper] The sensational dance craze case, after the police department transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, the case was pronounced in the Special Court at 2 pm yesterday. Many people went to listen to the hearing. At 2:10 pm, Chief Judge Wang Zhennan, Judge Sun Tiqian, Judge Xu Nai, and Clerk Xu Leshi took their seats, brought in the 37 defendants in custody, including Zhu Fei, and called for the 30 defendants on bail, standing on both sides. At this time, the atmosphere in the court suddenly became tense, and everyone's eyes were focused on the judgment on the case file, not knowing who would be punished. Then, Chief Judge Wang stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "This case is not accepted." After hearing the judgment, the defendants said "Thank you, Chief Judge." Hong Xiaoping and Wang Min, who had been crying, smiled through their tears. Subsequently, Clerk Xu stood up and read the reasons for the judgment and explained them, stating that "The crimes of the defendants are ordinary criminal offenses and do not constitute Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. The police department transferred the case to this court for trial, and the prosecution procedure was obviously in violation of the regulations. It is ordered that the case is not accepted and is transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling." Chief Judge Wang briefly explained the case again. All the defendants in custody raised their hands to request bail, which was not approved. It was ordered that they be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The court adjourned at 3:00 pm. At 3:30 pm, the Special Criminal Court formally transferred the 37 defendants in custody, including Zhu Fei, to the District Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang immediately dispatched two prosecutors, He Huimin and Zhang Yuanzhen, to handle the case. After briefly questioning the names and ages of the defendants, bail was not granted because the case files were voluminous and required time to review. They were temporarily detained at the South Road Detention Center. However, it is heard that most of them are expected to be released on bail the day after tomorrow.

Reasons for the Judgment

The original text of the reasons for the judgment of the case is recorded below: "After the Central Government issued the ban on dancing, the people engaged in the dance hall industry in the city, for the sake of their livelihoods, labor and management jointly formed a joint office of all people in the Shanghai dance hall industry, specializing in negotiating with the authorities on the issue of the ban on dancing. Therefore, they raised funds and elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition, but to no avail. Then, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to implement the central government's order, taking into account the facts, decided to gradually ban dancing in stages, and scheduled the first draw to be held at 3:00 pm on January 31st of this year. Upon hearing this news, the joint office of the dance hall industry summoned all personnel, and they held a meeting at the New Xianlin Dance Hall on that day to discuss the issue of the draw. Suddenly, news came that the Social Affairs Bureau had held a proxy draw at 11:00 am, and fourteen dance halls, including MGM, had been drawn and should be closed. At that time, the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense, and everyone unanimously demanded to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and at 3:00 pm, about thousands of female dancers and workers (only Jin Ying was not a female dancer, but was invited by female dancer Chen Juping) went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting a temporary suspension of the ban on dancing in order to maintain their livelihoods. It happened that the Social Affairs Bureau was in a meeting and could not come out to see them immediately. The petitioning crowd felt disappointed. For a moment, they were emotionally impulsive

Emotional Impulse

and rushed upstairs to destroy the Social Affairs Bureau. All the doors, windows, glass, and appliances were almost completely destroyed. The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was working on the third floor of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the petitioning crowd mistakenly thought it was the Social Affairs Bureau, so it was also affected. The police who followed to maintain order were injured by being beaten while trying to prevent the destruction. At that time, the order in the Social Affairs Bureau was extremely chaotic. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department reported that it immediately dispatched a team to suppress the situation and arrested many people successively. After interrogation, it was determined that 69 people, including Zhu Fei, were suspected of intentionally disturbing public order and destroying public offices by other means, which constituted the crime of Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. In accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Statute, except for 32 people, including Yu Zhiqin, who were released on bail pending trial, 37 people, including Zhu Fei, were transferred to the court for trial. Now, based on the results of the trial, regardless of who among the defendants actually carried out the damage or who beat the police,

A Prior Question, Whether or Not the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion Should Be Applied to this Case, and Whether or Not This Court Should Try It, Should Be Determined by Whether or Not the Defendants Intended to Disturb Public Order and Destroy Public Offices by Other Means. Regarding this point, it can be analyzed as follows: (1) Destroying a public office. The so-called public office is the entire building used by the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct business. What has been destroyed now is only the doors, windows, glass, and appliances in the house, not the essential parts of the building. According to the previous Judgment No. 470 of the Supreme Court of Justice in the Third Year of the Republic of China, "The crime of damaging a building requires damaging the essential parts of the building, which is sufficient to cause the building to lose its effectiveness for the crime to be established. If only the accessories are damaged, it falls within the scope of damaging objects." Based on the determination of precedents, it is difficult to consider it as damaging a public office. (2) Intending to disturb public order. Investigating the assembly of a large number of people to carry out damage, the impact of which certainly hinders order. Speaking of disturbing public order, it is not entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's Judgment No. 1942 of the 22nd Year of the Republic of China, which states that "The so-called disturbing public order refers to disturbing behavior that is sufficient to harm the general peace and order in the locality." Moreover, the purpose of going to the Social Affairs Bureau, reviewing the investigation reports of Zhu Mengwei, the chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, and Jin Xingguo, a staff member, as well as the meeting minutes of the dance industry's previous meetings, and the consistent statements of the defendants, their motives were to

Temporarily Suspend the Ban on Dancing

and Petition, lacking active proof of intending to disturb public order. Furthermore, testifying with Li Ying, the leader of the political team of the Songshan Police Precinct, who said: "That day, I was ordered to go to the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate. At first, the order was still good. Later, I asked to see the Director. It was heard that the Director was in a meeting and could not receive them. Most likely, the female dancers were angry, which led to the temporary incident of attacking the Social Affairs Bureau." It feels even more credible. As for injuring the police who were performing their duties during the destruction, it can only constitute the crimes of obstructing official duties and injury under criminal law. Based on the above two points, the crimes committed by the defendants are all

Ordinary Criminal

Cases and do not constitute the crime of Article 7 of the Statute for Punishing Those Who Endanger National Emergency During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. The original transferring agency transferred it to this court for trial, and the prosecution procedure was obviously in violation of the regulations. It should be ordered that it is not accepted and transferred to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office for handling in accordance with the law. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Statute and Article 295, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is hereby made as stated in the main text."

### Violating the Publication Law: Times Daily News Suspended

[This Newspaper] The Municipal Government Information Office announced yesterday: The Shanghai Times Daily News served as an instrument for the bandits, Zhang, disrupting government financial policies, inciting student and worker strikes, fabricating rumors, and distorting propaganda. The Municipal Government has issued serious warnings several times. However, on the 3rd of this month, the newspaper again had distorted records of inciting student strikes, which was obviously an intentional attempt to make a big issue out of the situation and disrupt social order. It violated Articles 21 and 29 of the Publication Law. Yesterday, the Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department to immediately suspend the newspaper's publication and has reported it to the Ministry of Interior.

### Newspaper Workers' Union Board of Directors and Supervisors Discuss: Striving for Preferential Rationing of Rice

[This Newspaper] According to the Newspaper Workers' Union, the Civil Affairs Commission's preferential rice rationing measures for news practitioners did not provide rationing for newspaper workers. Yesterday, the union specifically convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors. Directors Sun Jinghu, Li Xingsheng, Hua Guozheng, Shen Xirong, Xu Jinlin, Li Shengrun, Tang Genbao, Zhang Dechao, Chen Jianming, Sheng Buyun, Miao Shengchang, Zhang Ziqi, Dai Fuquan, and supervisors Hu Zhiwen, Dong Rengui, Zhang Jinbao, Sun Jinshui, Zhang Hexiang, and others attended. They all believed that the Civil Affairs Commission's current rationing, while calling it rice rationing for news practitioners, intentionally excluded the most laborious workers with lower wages, which was unfair. It was unanimously decided to prepare a document to the Civil Affairs Commission requesting reconsideration, and workers should be given the same preferential rationing.

### What Chief Judge Wang Said: This Place is a Fire Pit, It is a Great Blessing to Jump Out

Side View of the Pronouncement: Yesterday was the "Moment of Life and Death" for sixty-something men and women in the dance industry. Before 2:00 pm, the audience seats were already full. A bailiff was blocking the door, and forty or fifty people could not get in. The bailiff's waist belt had a box cannon inserted under it, which added to the tension.

The defendants in custody looked more haggard, while the defendants on bail were still carefree. Yangzi You Lingling even put on lipstick, and Rong Yingfeng from Paramount wore a black cheongsam today, which was a bit more simple than a few days ago. The clerk read the judgment, and the courtroom was silent. It was truly "Silence at This Time is Better Than Sound," replacing the joy in the hearts of many people.

After Chief Judge Wang finished reading the judgment, he gave a personal instruction: "This case is not accepted, but that does not mean that you are not guilty. It means that your crime is not a crime that endangers the country, so the defendants in custody will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today. But don't be afraid. You should know that this place is a fire pit. It is a great blessing to be able to jump out. If the court sentences you in the future, I hope you will calmly accept the sentence. At the same time, I also advise you to engage in productive construction undertakings in the future. Dancing is consumption, what good is it for the country?" If the courtroom allowed it, I think someone would definitely applaud greatly. The lawyers requested bail, and Chief Judge Wang said: "Since this case is not accepted, this court will not care about anything. Please do not let me be said to be playing a post-hoc strategy." When the defendants in custody were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, before leaving, Hong Xiaoping, Tang Zongjie, Wang Min, Feng Aina, Zhu Fei, and others hurriedly told their families: "Quick! Go to Lujiawan and find a way to get bail!"

### Shanghai Law College Has Resumed Classes as Usual: Xu Jiqing Expresses Comfort

Xu Jiqing, a director of Shanghai Law College, wrote yesterday: "I reviewed the Shanghai Law College incident at the Municipal Government yesterday and invited people from all walks of life to hold a symposium. At the meeting, I expressed my opinion, advocating that the organizers of the exhibition be investigated and severely punished, and that all illegal activities be thoroughly banned. Otherwise, even if it is dissolved, it will be unavoidable. These are angry words. Now that I know that the college has resumed classes as usual and the order is stable, which is in line with what I hoped for, there is no question of dissolution. I am deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings, so I specially send this letter to your newspaper and ask you to publish it."

### Children's Welfare Charity Sale: Chinese and Foreign Ladies Enthusiastically Select Purchases, The Splendor of Hairpins and Clothes Peaks for Two Hours

[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Children's Work Group of the China Welfare Fund held a children's welfare charity sale at the ballroom on the 11th floor of the Hua Mao Apartment on Bushi Road from 5 pm yesterday. Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, personally presided over it. The interior was decorated with lanterns and colored ribbons, and the arrangement was excellent. In addition to the charity items donated by international celebrities in the city, there were also more than ten boxes of antiques that Madam Sun Yat-sen had collected before the war and transported to Europe for sale. These antiques were transported to France when the German army occupied it, which led to them being transferred around for eight years. They were only recently found in Marseille and transported back. They included ancient bottles, ancient paintings, precious embroidery, hanging skirt dresses, and so on. The entertainment section included fishing paper fish, ring toss, ball toss, shooting, and fortune-telling by Madame Alkon, a White Russian. Well-known ladies served as staff in the venue. Chinese celebrities and ladies from various countries in the city went to watch and purchase enthusiastically. The splendor of hairpins and clothes peaked for a while. The charity sale ended at 11 pm. Many charity items were sold, and the total revenue was not calculated due to the late hour. All proceeds from this charity sale will be used to fund the education and medical work of poor children in Shanghai.

### President of St. John's University Announces Resignation: School Affairs Temporarily Handled by the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees, Several Conflicts Among Students Injure Two

[This Newspaper] Several conflicts occurred among students at St. John's University yesterday. Shi Jiuyu, the chairman of the student union who had been suspended from school for one year by the school, was seriously injured.

Tu Yuqing, the president of the university, felt that it was difficult to deal with the turmoil in the school this time, and decided to resign yesterday morning.

However, I am incompetent and unable to fulfill the responsibility, so I have submitted my resignation to the board of trustees, and from now on, all school affairs will be handled by the school affairs executive committee. I hope that all students will cherish the school, maintain a calm attitude, and not take any extra-curricular actions. This notice."

Because of the turmoil caused by the anti-American and pro-Japanese national exhibition organized by the student union in recent days, the St. John's University authorities held an emergency school affairs meeting on the evening of the 2nd and decided to suspend classes for a week from the 3rd to the 8th, and the final exams for this semester would start early on the 9th (originally scheduled for the 21st). During the suspension of classes, all classrooms, lounges, and auditoriums on campus would be closed and could not be borrowed. When the students heard the news of the sudden suspension of classes, they were quite surprised. Many believed that even if the actions of some students were out of line, it was a minority issue. Now, the school's sudden suspension of classes and early final exams affected the studies of the majority of students. Moreover, most of the courses in each department had not ended, and it was quite difficult to cope with the exams in a hurry. The student self-government association of the school held a general meeting of all students yesterday morning to discuss the matter.

Offering Opinions, No Response

Because the lounges, auditoriums, etc. were all closed, the meeting was held at the South Grass Field. More than 1,000 students attended. During the meeting, students could not agree on their opinions. Some students criticized the student union for only being anti-American and not anti-Soviet. In the chaos, the president came out to persuade them, claiming that the school authorities' decision to suspend classes was to seek stability on campus and had no other purpose. When the meeting continued, it was ended because the tables and chairs on the podium were overturned. Some students sent several representatives to visit the president, offering several points of opinion: (1) Handle the so-called student union based on the results of the school's solicitation of opinions from the parents of each student on the student union at the beginning of this semester. (2) Request the school to severely punish all those responsible for illegal gatherings and instigators. (3) Request the school to declare to all sectors of society the truth about the incident of a small number of people disrupting the school for the reputation of the school and all students. The president did not give a specific response, and within half an hour, he resigned.

Martial Drama Occurred in Zhaofeng Park

After the student union suspended the meeting, the students left one after another, but hundreds of people still stayed in groups of three or five, lingering. There were also small conflicts between them. At about 12:00 noon, Shi Jiuyu and Chen Wenhan were attacked and injured in Zhaofeng Park. Some of them held weapons. They were later rescued by the police officers in the park. Pan Shizi, the acting dean of students, also rushed to the scene after hearing the news. The injured were taken to Tongren Hospital by their classmates for emergency treatment. In the evening, they were accompanied by their relatives and friends and transferred to other places for treatment. After this incident, some of the school directors of the board of trustees held an informal meeting in the afternoon to exchange opinions. Regarding the injuries of Shi Jiuyu and Chen Wenhan, they believed that Shi and Chen were dragged out of the school when the incident occurred, and the location of the attack was outside the school. Moreover, the identities of the group were unknown. This was a public security issue, and the school could not handle it, so it was decided to report the matter to the public security authorities for disposal. As for the resignation of President Tu, it needs to be discussed by the entire board of directors after Chairman Yan Huiqing returns to Shanghai from Beijing. Currently, school affairs are temporarily handled by the executive committee of the board of trustees.

The Longhua District Office of this city, in order to follow the suggestions of the local people, submitted a proposal to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, which was approved by the 104th Municipal Meeting. It decided to widen Hongqiao Road 300 Lane to facilitate travel, and local people raised funds and landowners voluntarily gave up land. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works had nearly completed the project, but the HSBC Bank garden, located on the north side of the road and occupying more than a hundred acres, only needed to give up about two-tenths of an acre for the road widening. To this day, it has refused to move the bamboo fence, causing construction to stop midway.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director Wu of the Social Bureau, regarding the opposition of movie theaters to low-price limited-price seats and the request of Western film companies to adjust ticket prices, otherwise they will stop supplying Western films for public showing, stated yesterday: The maintaining of 30% low-price seats in each movie theater was approved by the municipal meeting so that the majority of citizens can enjoy entertainment. Therefore, it will be strictly enforced and will not be stopped because of the opposition of movie theaters. The Social Bureau will post a public notice with the Police Bureau, posting the map of the discounted seats in front of each movie theater so that citizens can know. Director Wu explained that the authorities do not limit the price of seats outside the 30% quota in each movie theater.

If movie theaters can maintain their operational guarantee after adjusting ticket prices, the authorities will not interfere. Also, the price of low-price seats is not fixed. As for the Western film companies stopping the supply of Western films, Director Wu said he did not value it.

### 欠租判付美钞　自有法律根据

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Restaurant in this city rents its premises from the New Wonderland Dance Hall. Due to overdue rent, the District Court previously ruled that the Shanghai Restaurant should pay the owed rent of US$1,000. The Tenants' Union of this city protested this ruling, believing that if this precedent is set, future tenants will suffer unbearable burdens. This reporter visited the person in charge of the District Court yesterday, who explained the ruling as follows: (1) The contract between the Shanghai Restaurant and the New Wonderland Dance Hall was signed on July 18, 1946, before the government announced the ban on the circulation of gold and foreign currency. Therefore, it cannot be considered illegal to contract in US dollars at that time. (2) The Shanghai Restaurant's rent arrears were from July to November 1943, before the Municipal Government promulgated the Housing Lease Regulations. (3) The judgment to pay in US dollars is calculated by converting to legal tender at the Central Bank's listed exchange rate, so the Shanghai Restaurant is not at a disadvantage.

### 伯大尼二百余孤儿　面临流离失所边缘　各界人士同情捐助者众

[Our Newspaper's Report] Bethany Orphanage on Jiaotong Road, founded with great difficulty by the Christian pastor Qian Tuan Yun, has been around for six years. It has taken in more than 200 orphans and has achieved remarkable results, which everyone praises. Unfortunately, the housing dispute, which has been in litigation for many years, has recently been lost in the final judgment. More than 200 orphans are now facing the edge of displacement. People from all walks of life have great sympathy for the orphanage's plight, and have given spiritual and material encouragement to encourage pastor Qian to continue his efforts. The Bethany Board of Directors has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase land and build houses, targeting 150 billion, with major newspapers and the Continental Bank in this city acting as donation collection points so that more than 200 orphans will not be displaced. It is now learned that people from all walks of life are enthusiastically donating. Hu Yide, of the Da Zhong Brick and Tile Factory, is willing to donate more than 100 acres of land in Nanhui, Pudong. Ye Boxiang is also willing to donate more than 600 acres of land in Da Chang. Yesterday, the Deputy Manager of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank personally visited the orphanage and donated 10 million yuan. In addition, a primary school student sent a letter to pastor Qian stating that he would donate 30,000 yuan he had saved from snacks, a sincere gesture that is touching. However, it is understood that the other party is pressing for the eviction from Bethany and previously insisted in court that they must move out within five days. As a result, the court decided to set the deadline to the 12th, but in reality, it is difficult to find a new site within 12 days. All sectors of society are extremely concerned about this and hope that the winning party will consider the suffering of the orphans and grant an extension.

### 日渔轮船员供认　大规模侵我渔权　笔录五十页整理就绪昨晚携京　是否将作俘虏处置现尚未可知

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 29th of last month, our naval ship Zhongjian intercepted the Japanese fishing vessel Unzen Maru No. 22 and its 11 crew members, as well as 13 crew members from the Zhenxian Maru No. 111 (which had been sunk), near Shaweishan outside the mouth of the Yangtze River. They were detained at the Navy's First Base Command. From May 31 to June 2, Li Youjian, the director of the military law office of the department, conducted continuous interrogations for three days and nights, resulting in the discovery that the Japanese fishing boats' fishing in our waters was a planned infringement of our maritime rights. According to the captain of the Unzen Maru No. 21, Shimomura Kazuto: "Originally, there were more fish in the north, but that area is very dangerous, and Soviet fishing boats regularly patrol north of 38 degrees north latitude, so we came south." At the same time, according to the crew members' testimonies, it is known that Japanese fishing boats have come to fish many times, and the number of fishing boats dispatched is very considerable. According to Shimomura Kazuto: "A total of 20 ships came on this trip, divided into 10 groups... There are four major companies: Yamada, Hayashi-Kane, Nitto, and Nippon Suisan, etc. There are many other small companies. Hayashi-Kane alone has two or thirty groups." Crew member Kumakora Toshihisa said: "The company has ten groups in total. The In Group was the first to set sail, and we were the ninth group to set sail." He also testified, "The captain of the No. 22 ship said once, 'Now our ship is going to the Chinese inland sea.' He said this when we set sail from Nagasaki." From this, it can be seen that when the Japanese fishing boats set sail, they had already decided to infringe on our maritime rights.

Showing Gratitude for Our Favorable Treatment

According to Li Yuelin, the director of the press office of the Navy's First Base Command, in an interview with the reporter: According to crew member Kawaguchi Tadashi's testimony, "At first, the water was green, but later it turned yellowish-brown. I thought we might have reached the outside of the Yangtze River in China," and other words, it can be known that they were indeed within our country's territorial waters (including fishing rights areas), which is beyond any doubt. Also, after three days of interrogation, all the crew members admitted to fishing in Chinese territorial waters, infringing on maritime rights, and violating international law. They requested the government's forgiveness. At the same time, they expressed gratitude for the favorable treatment of our naval authorities and hoped that the case could be concluded as soon as possible and that they would be sent back to Japan. They also guaranteed to report their experience on this trip to the company authorities and pay more attention in the future.

Seized Ships Transferred to Supply Station

However, the Naval Headquarters attaches great importance to this case and has repeatedly sent telegrams urging that all confessions be sent to the headquarters for verification. The confessions have now been organized, totaling approximately 50 pages, and were sent to the capital last night. The seized ships have also been transferred to the Navy's First Supply Station. As our country and Japan have not yet signed a peace treaty and diplomatic relations have not been established, it seems that a state of war has not been lifted. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the detained crew members will be treated as prisoners of war. Regarding the fish caught on the ship, it has been instructed by the Naval Headquarters or the customs, or sold at a price, with 20% of the proceeds used as a bonus for the officers and soldiers of the Zhongjian ship who participated in the operation. As of now, no decision has been made.

Their Sinister Intentions Are Self-Evident

Finally, Director Li also expressed his feelings to reporters: "Japanese fishing boats infringing on our fishing rights have been negotiated many times, and the Allied Headquarters have stipulated the boundaries. There should be no further infringement. After interrogating the fishing boats seized this time, it is true that this was a large-scale infringement of fishing rights, and the number was huge. At the same time, the fishing boats had charts, depth sounders, compasses, telecommunications and other marine equipment, everything needed. Although they say that they came to fish in Chinese territorial waters because of the influence of the tide, their sinister intentions are self-evident. It is a pity that the No. 21 ship, the leader of the group (each group of two ships), was sunk, and the relevant evidence and various records on the ship could not be salvaged, which increased some difficulties in the investigation and future handling of this case. One injured crew member, Oda Takashi, has been sent to the Navy's First Hospital for treatment."

Furthermore, the Navy recently dispatched warships to Liangang Island and Hainan Island to pursue Japanese fishing boats. As of now, the base command has not received any reports.

### Three-Agency Joint Meeting Decides on Method for Offsetting Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit, Importers Must Provide Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificate

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to regulations, the special foreign currency certificates of deposit that the government should pay to the original importers for goods arriving without a certificate of self-provided foreign exchange can be used to borrow one-sixth of the face value from the Central Bank to pay for the payment for goods permitted for import within the limited amount. Now, after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, a registered importer, after obtaining an import permit, must provide a foreign exchange settlement certificate in addition to paying the exchange rate of the national currency when purchasing foreign exchange. Yesterday, at the joint meeting of the Central Bank's Shipping Management Committee and the China Trust Bureau, it was decided that when the China Trust Bureau gives priority to selling these goods, it should still charge according to the stabilization fund exchange rate as stipulated. As for the special foreign currency certificates of deposit paid to the original importers, they should still be exchanged for legal tender at the stabilization fund exchange rate when one-sixth of the amount is due each quarter. If a registered importer uses this certificate of deposit to offset the foreign exchange payment for permitted imports each quarter, it can offset the foreign exchange that should be purchased at the stabilization fund exchange rate. At the same time, the merchant must provide a separate foreign exchange settlement certificate, which must be verified before being allowed to offset the payment. According to the spokesperson of the joint meeting, the above method will be handled by the China Trust Bureau, and the Central Bank will notify all designated banks to investigate.

[Another Report] The National Bank and the Shipping Management Committee recently sent Circular No. 137 to all designated banks, explaining the foreign exchange settlement regulations for import licenses issued before May 31 of this year. It stated: The foreign exchange settlement method for import licenses issued before May 31 of this year has been stipulated in the Bank's Circular No. 135. Now, it is supplemented that the unsettled portion of the original installment foreign exchange settlement should still be handled in accordance with the (1) installment (2) foreign exchange settlement on the stipulated date, and a foreign exchange settlement certificate should be attached. However, permits issued for industrial manufacturing needs for the quota for the third and fourth quarters of this year, according to 25%, 35%, and 40% installment foreign exchange settlement, should still be handled according to Circular No. 135, and the previous regulations do not apply.

### 米粉油粮昨又上涨

Rice prices rose again, because the price in Xishi rose, and the money supply was loose, so people's confidence was restored, and the market recovered. Although the volume of transactions was not large, the supply was even smaller. Prices rose immediately after the market opened in the morning, and the market became increasingly firm. The opening price of white rice in the North City Market was 6.9 million yuan. Early rice and Xian rice each rose by 100,000 yuan. High-quality japonica rice rose by 200,000 yuan to 7.2 million yuan. All grades of japonica and indica rice in the South City Market rose by 100,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rose in unison. In terms of the firm closing trend, the actual increase was 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 3,325 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets.

Flour

After the initial rise, it fell back, and finally saw a slight increase. The oldest Che Fen was initially 2.1 million, then gradually fell back to 2.06 million, while the price of the warship closed at 2.02 million, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng also rose slightly. Wheat bran added 450,000 yuan, and the factory's purchase price of wheat did not increase, opening at 2.7 million yuan at the original price.

Miscellaneous Grains

Green beans and broad beans both rose by 100,000 yuan. There were not many transactions of red sorghum. New yuan wheat had fallen for several days, but yesterday it also rose by 200,000 yuan. Northerners snapped up corn at low prices, and the price rose by as much as 400,000 yuan. Red beans also rose by 400,000 yuan. There were not many buyers of sesame seeds. Raw peanuts have not been priced because the payment date has not been resolved.

Cooking Oil

Factories opened at very high prices due to rising raw material prices, coupled with loose money and large demand. Ultimately, the high opening prices led to retail investors selling, resulting in a price decline at the close. Dayou soybean oil opened at 16.2 million in the morning, and then closed at 15.65 million, rising by 5-600,000 yuan. Jiyutong raw oil was 19 million, and small cart sesame oil was the same price, each rising by 500,000 yuan. Driven by public sentiment, the price of soybean cake reached as high as 1.7 million, but retreated by 20,000 at the close.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, some members of the press have views that differ from the actual situation regarding the relationship between the government's implementation of foreign exchange management measures since August 18 last year and export trade, and the Central Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee's Circular No. 131. The Central Bank and the Export-Import Management Committee jointly issued a statement yesterday, the gist of which is: (1) Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee in August of last year, the adoption of a flexible exchange rate has been very successful in promoting exports and increasing foreign exchange income. Foreign exchange income from exports in March and April of this year is still far above the average figures for July and August of last year, so there is absolutely no fact of suppressing exports.

(2) Since February of this year, the Central Bank has known that the flexible adjustment of exchange rates is a relatively reasonable and effective method for the current situation, and the various obstacles that prevent it from exerting its effectiveness must be addressed comprehensively. Therefore, it began to study several plans to improve foreign exchange management methods, and the recently announced foreign exchange settlement certificate method is one of the three methods proposed. Before comprehensively improving the situation, the No. 131 method was temporarily used as a relief measure. This method was of a transitional nature when it was adopted, so it should be canceled according to the original plan on the date the new foreign exchange settlement method is officially implemented, which has nothing to do with personnel changes.

### Easing of Credit and Cheerful Sentiment: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise, Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Increases by Another 10 Million Yuan

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a loosening of credit and optimistic sentiment. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions continued to procure actively, and large firms also came to buy. The 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 11.1 million yuan, with brisk trading. It closed at 314 million yuan, a further increase of 10 million yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, from 5.6 million to 13.14 million yuan, compared to the previous day.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw yarn prices rising, and merchants remained keen to buy. The 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially rose by 280,000 yuan upon opening. Subsequently, due to competition from local traders and individual buyers, it climbed to 7.25 million yuan, reaching a high of 290,000 yuan. Later, as traders took profits by selling, the market price fell to 7.15 million yuan. After 10 o'clock, with the "Spinning and Construction" brand suspended, only mid-to-low-grade fine cloths were offered, and sentiment improved. "Dragon Head" cloth ultimately closed at 7.22 million yuan, a further increase of 320,000 yuan from the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth, as well as coarse cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth, all saw uniform price increases ranging from 120,000 to 450,000 yuan.

### Strengthening Control of Raw Cotton, Strict Procedures for Transport Permits

[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to strengthen the control of raw cotton, prevent merchants from privately buying and selling, and raising market prices, specifically stipulated that domestic cotton transportation should be based on the committee's cotton transportation permit. The movement of cotton in the Shanghai market should be based on the cotton movement permit. Since the implementation of these measures, most manufacturers have complied and followed them. However, due to unfamiliarity with the procedures, or perhaps seeking convenience, some deliberately try to take chances and smuggle. Considering that it was the initial stage of implementation, the committee did not want to strictly enforce the law. Now that time has passed, and it concerns the unified purchase, negligence can no longer be tolerated. Yesterday, it issued another earnest announcement that all cotton arriving in Shanghai must apply to the committee for a movement permit before it can be moved to storage facilities, factories, and warehouses. Railway station, pier and warehouse can admit cotton only with a transportation permit. From the date of this announcement, if anyone violates this again, the committee will impose penalties in accordance with the regulations.

### Settlement Certificates: Business and Industry Suggest Establishing an Open Market

[Our Newspaper's Report] The selling price of settlement certificates yesterday was 360,000 yuan per U.S. dollar, with a difference of 834,000 yuan from the official rate, which was lower than the previous day. It is heard that business and industry figures are paying close attention to the transfer of settlement certificates. In order to avoid manipulation by powerful individuals, they suggest that the relevant authorities establish an open market, recognize the market for settlement certificates, and assist in transactions between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, since the implementation of the new settlement measures, the prices of exported materials have surged by 25% to 40% within a few days, clearly indicating manipulation. It is heard that the Export Control Committee is paying close attention to this.

### Handling of Overseas Remittances Still Requires Detailed Study

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that after the implementation of the new settlement measures, the handling of overseas remittances, after discussion by the Overseas Remittances Subcommittee, has been decided in principle to also issue settlement certificates for overseas remittances. However, most of the remittance receiving locations are in Guangdong and Guangxi, and due to the vastness of the region, many technical issues are involved. The authorities have decided to further study this matter.

### Limited Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks, Active Trading in Unified Bonds

Chinese stocks fluctuated slightly yesterday. Large investors acted secretively, making the process very unstable. The public was inevitably anxious, showing signs of weakness and fatigue. The decision to increase capital for China Silk actually caused it to fall to the limit.

At the morning opening, stocks already showed weakness. Wing On Spinning opened at 2,860 yuan, but was sold down to 2,830 yuan, before rising to 2,900 yuan, due to the stability of prices outside the stock market. Agency fees opened at the original price, but large investors secretly bought and sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 2,775 yuan. It closed at 2,790 yuan at noon. Compared to the previous close, China Silk fell to the limit before recovering slightly, while Wah Feng, American Asia, Sino-British, New Light, New China, King Fook, and Commercial Press fell by half a percent, and the rest experienced slight declines.

In the afternoon market, Wing On Spinning opened at 2,840 yuan. National banks did not make significant moves, and it rebounded to 2,880 yuan. Subsequently, amidst profit-taking, it was sold down to 2,795 yuan, closing at 2,800 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Wing On Spinning, Wah Feng, Zhabei, China Silk, Wing Feng, and Tongyi rose slightly. Sino-French, Sino-British, Match, Keen Hing, Underwear, and Wing On Fair remained unchanged, while the rest experienced slight declines. Off-market, unlisted stocks, especially bank stocks, were the most popular, rising by half a percent.

Yesterday's fluctuations were even more limited. With one day less to go, and excess liquidity, the results were all minor. Class A bonds fluctuated between 74.12 yuan, and Class B bonds only traded at 74.8 yuan.

Government Bonds

Government bonds gradually strengthened yesterday. Mixed bonds were actively traded. Unified Class C bonds started at 259,000 and gradually rose to 281,000 before turning around. Compared to the previous close, Classes A, B, C, and E each rose by 14,000, and Unified Class D rose strongly by 16,000.

Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, the market was generally weak except for Ye Kwong, which was popular with the Hong Kong and Guangdong investors. Ewo Spinning opened at 4.48 million, and gradually fell to close around 4.35 million. Trading was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, British and Allied Aviation fell by half a percent, while Ye Kwong rose sharply by half a percent. Ewo Spinning, Paper, Steel, and Ewo Jute all reported small declines.

### Bank Inflows and Outflows, Liquidity Remains Loose

Yesterday, the money market in this city remained loose. In the clearing of bills among banks and money shops, national banks had only minor inflows and outflows, with a total amount of 320.4 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had inflows of 142.3 billion, the Bank of China had inflows of 268.5 billion, the Bank of Communications had outflows of 112.4 billion, the Farmers Bank had outflows of 12.7 billion, the China Trust Bureau had inflows of 76.9 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had outflows of 53 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had inflows of 20.8 billion. Commercial banks and shops had large clearing outflows of 294 billion, small clearing outflows of 222.2 billion, and foreign banks had total clearing inflows of 195.8 billion.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Advocating for "Domestically Produced Western Medicine"

— Liang Junqing

We doctors often hear criticisms in casual gatherings about the "domestically produced Western medicine" being poorly made, causing delays in patient care, with the implication that "the finished products are inferior and not worth considering." In fact, this kind of misconception is unacceptable. If we allow such misleading and distorted views to continue to develop, it will not only mean that our country's Western medicine industry will never have a chance to rise, but also, in terms of foreign exchange, our country will truly lose an unknown amount economically each year—

Of course, most imported Western medicines have gone through countless experts' painstaking research and practical clinical trials before the finished products are released, so in terms of quality and effectiveness, they should definitely be welcomed and used by us. However, I must also honestly tell the readers that although imported Western medicines are very effective and easily gain the trust of our people, there are also quite a few poorly made and immature medicines among them (especially those shipped in after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War). Moreover, Western medicines often come with various side effects, and if not handled properly, they can easily harm patients. Therefore, imported Western medicines are not absolutely perfect and reliable, and it depends on the careful selection of our doctors when using them. As for "domestically produced Western medicines," although the equipment and manufacturing may be somewhat rudimentary, the effectiveness of the common medicines among them is really not inferior to imported products. For example, the most frequently used intravenous glucose injections cost about 600,000 yuan per ampoule for imported products, while domestic products cost around 100,000 yuan. With such a huge price difference for the same effectiveness, shouldn't we advocate for domestically produced Western medicines for the sake of the patients' finances and the country's losses in foreign exchange—

Moreover, in this chaotic world of impoverished people and depleted resources, the prices of imported Western medicines are rising day by day due to foreign exchange issues, not only leaving our poor patients with no way to buy them and waiting for death, but even middle-class families find it difficult to scrape together enough money. Even if they sell their belongings and borrow money to barely manage, their family property will be empty, and how will they live in the future? I often think to myself, why talk about using economic aggression policies to destroy our country? Even imported Western medicine alone is enough to exploit the Chinese people until they are drained of blood and resources. Many short-sighted compatriots think that they are setting up many hospitals for us out of charity and to help the poor and sick (Western medicine merchants from small countries like Switzerland are even more extreme, simply not engaging in any hypocritical charity work and only knowing how to raise prices every day). But who knows that this is just a sugar coating on a bitter pill.

This spring, the author attended the National Physicians' Association Joint Congress in Nanjing and was honored with a joint banquet by domestic Western medicine merchants. At the banquet, Dr. Yang Shuxun, director of the Yang's Chemical Research Institute, gave a speech, recounting the suffering of the people due to the lack of Western medicine during the Anti-Japanese War and the difficulties in the development of the domestic Western medicine industry. He also pointed out the current tense international situation and the possibility of a third world war. He hoped that our people could prepare in time and not repeat the mistakes of the past. His words were mournful and full of pain. Unfortunately, his voice was weak and had little effect. Everyone only cares about immediate interests, and who pays attention to those more far-sighted things?

To be honest, if our doctors and patients can pay attention to and cherish "domestically produced Western medicine," and everyone vigorously advocates its use (starting with selecting reliable domestic products from the most commonly used Western medicines and promoting their widespread use), then domestic Western medicine will definitely develop, improve, and become more perfect day by day. If we continue to develop in the future, we may have a day when we can sell domestically produced Western medicine to foreign countries!

"Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds on it." I hereby wish "domestically produced Western medicine" a limitless future!

### Editor's Note

Although the manuscripts in this issue are all theoretical, because they discuss matters that are directly related to doctors and the public, we have specially compiled them and published them in this issue. We hope that readers will not find them too dry and boring!

Dr. Huang Mingju is a senior figure in the academic community. He and Dr. Huang Wurong are brothers and have been famous in the academic field for decades.

Dr. Su Huixiang is a female doctor who studied in Hamburg, Germany, in her early years. Although her article in this issue is written in a rambling style, it is full of a sense of justice. I hope that our medical community, as she said, will do more work in their respective positions, so that "you reap what you sow," and the result will ultimately be good. Otherwise, even if the result is not necessarily a complete disgrace, being abandoned by everyone will make one feel guilty forever.

Many readers write letters asking about illnesses, but do not include sufficient postage and address. Of course, we will not respond to such letters. To be honest, it costs several hundred thousand yuan for a doctor to see one outpatient case now, and now we have to specially take time to answer thousands of questions, is it still okay to ask them to pay the postage?

The next issue will have a very important article on the treatment of tuberculosis, please pay attention to it. We hereby announce in advance.

### Casual Notes from Chunxiao Building Clinic

— Su Zengxiang

Recently, Mr. Hu Shi wrote a small screen for me, on which he wrote "You reap what you sow." When I read these two idioms, they not only express a kind of expectation, but also contain a kind of warning.

For doctors, they work diligently throughout the year and, in addition to treating diseases, must also study how to prevent diseases; they do not treat human life as child's play, nor do they aim at making profits. Doctors who sow good causes will bring good results to patients.

For patients, they should listen to the doctor's instructions as much as possible, cooperate with the doctor, and know that nursing is more important than medicine; they should make good use of air, sunlight, and nutrition, and not do anything useless, so that diseases can be easily cured. This means that patients who sow good causes will reap good results for themselves and bring success to doctors.

Looking at the general situation of society, whether it is industry or commerce, if they value profit over righteousness, hoard goods for speculation, produce shoddy goods, only seek market increases, and do not care about the people's livelihood; over time, the social economy will collapse, which will affect personal reputation on a small scale and mislead the country's future on a large scale. This is sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.

Moreover, the way of dealing with the world is no exception. Destroying one's personality and seeking success by chance will inevitably lead to disgrace and ruin once one is abandoned by the public. This is also sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.

As the hot summer is approaching, if people eat raw, cold, and dirty things at will, without restraint, and without seeking cleanliness, diseases such as fever, diarrhea, cholera, typhoid fever, and epidemics will follow, which will cause harm to the body on a small scale and loss of life on a large scale. This is also sowing bad causes and will inevitably lead to bad results.

In this world, you can only reap melons from sowing melons, and you can only reap beans from sowing beans. This is not superstition, but science. People who have received higher education should be aware of this and warn themselves!

### On Pharmaceutical Education (Part 1)

— Huang Mingju

More than two years have passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The glory of being one of the four powers seems to have gradually faded. In this situation where people are competing for resources and striving to apply atomic bombs, if we do not seize the opportunity and move forward to engage in scientific construction, not only will the term "one of the four powers" disappear forever, but the survival of the entire country may be threatened.

After the victory, the call for building the country has been very loud, both in the government and among the people. However, nation-building requires talents. Do we have enough talents? We won't look at anything else, but just look at the work of taking over the recovered areas in the past two years. We have already felt that there is a lack of talents. How can we talk about nation-building? Therefore, to talk about nation-building, we need science. To develop science, we must recruit talents. If there are not enough talents, we must cultivate them. This is an unbreakable conclusion at present and must be worked towards diligently.

The scope of science is very broad. To move it forward, it must be moved forward in an all-round way. It is absolutely impossible to hope for success by focusing on one aspect alone or being biased towards one aspect. For example, in the early years of the Republic of China, it was felt that natural science was too poor, so the government sent people to study abroad, focusing on natural science. Later, it was felt that the political situation was chaotic and could not be governed, so the government later sent people to study abroad, focusing on political and economic disciplines. As a result, science lagged behind and never recovered. Therefore, the current trend is to focus on natural science again. In fact, this kind of measure is somewhat lacking. We must know that all kinds of undertakings in the world contain science, which must be coordinated and advanced simultaneously, and must not be neglected.

As far as pharmaceutical education is concerned, it can be said that there has been no achievement in decades. Although a few people have loudly called for the establishment of pharmaceutical education, there has been no response. Before the Anti-Japanese War, our pharmacy was backward, and most people did not realize it, because European and American countries were constantly inventing new drugs, which were cheap, effective, and continuously dumped into the country. We could use them conveniently, and we never felt that there would be pain in the future. The so-called industrial and commercial decline and national leaks were not seen by anyone, and no one thought about it. Even if a few people saw it, thought about it, and shouted loudly, it was useless. Decades have passed in this kind of inertia.

After the Anti-Japanese War, the sea routes were blocked, the source of new drugs was cut off, and the drug shortage reached an extreme level. The value of Western medicine naturally skyrocketed. Even if the people had the ability to see a doctor, they had no ability to buy medicine and could only wait for death. Under this situation, although we have not counted the number of people who sacrificed their lives, I am afraid that the number must be quite large. During the Anti-Japanese War, it can be said that everyone felt the direct and personal pain of not being able to supply their own medicines and the backwardness of pharmacy. Everyone should feel it and should develop pharmaceutical education as soon as possible to cultivate advanced pharmaceutical talents in order to achieve self-sufficiency in medicines. However, in recent years, the drug shortage has only become more serious. Everyone has been running around calling for help, but they have only talked about how to relieve the drug shortage, and have never talked about remedying the lack of pharmaceutical talents and the fundamental problem of the backwardness of pharmaceutical education. Those in charge of pharmaceutical education seem to have heard nothing and felt nothing. After carefully analyzing the reasons for this phenomenon, they are generally no more than the following points.

(1) No distinction between medicine and pharmacy

(2) Disordered system

(3) Wrong point of view

Regarding the first point, because in our country since ancient times, medicine and pharmacy have not been separated. Those who know medicine should know pharmacy. Those who know pharmacy can practice medicine. Until now, everyone still has this concept. Therefore, it is believed that pharmaceutical education is also the responsibility of medical personnel. In fact, medicine and pharmacy are two completely different subjects. In ancient times, doctors dispensed medicines and pharmacists could handle medical formulas. This phenomenon was also the case in Europe before it was civilized. Later, when science developed, the boundaries between medicine and pharmacy had to be separated, because medicine is the study of pathology and treatment, and its basic sciences are important, such as anatomy, pathology, and physiology; pharmacy is the study of the manufacture, structure, and chemical testing of drugs, and its basic sciences are important, such as chemistry, botany, crude drugs, and analysis. From the perspective of the basic science subjects, it can be seen that these two are completely different sciences and should never be confused. The only close relationship between medicine and pharmacy is that the manufactured drugs must be tested by doctors. However, it is absolutely impossible to assign all problems to the hands of doctors just because they need to be tested, and all education problems must also be their responsibility. Its error is really laughable. For example, agricultural students grow many crops and call chefs to test them to distinguish their advantages and disadvantages, but they cannot say that chefs know how to plant crops, or even call them to manage agricultural undertakings. Its error is the same as not being able to distinguish the difference between medicine and pharmacy. Of course, doctors must have a deep understanding of the properties and pharmacology of drugs. However, these are all aspects of drug application, and not manufacturing. Therefore, the mistaken concept that medicine is pharmacy and pharmacy is medicine is the crux of why pharmaceutical education is not valued and cannot develop steadily. (End of article by Zhu Wan)

### Democracy and the Rule of Law

— Jingwen

Talking about democracy seems to be the most popular thing nowadays. Political journals are full of such articles, and even general comprehensive or literary journals always have one or two articles on democracy as a decoration. This should be a natural and good phenomenon in our country at the beginning of constitutional rule. We not only do not think there are too many, but we feel there are too few. Just think, the representatives of the National Assembly still need a copy of "Preliminary Steps in Democracy" in hand, which is enough to show that democratic knowledge in our country is still far from being widespread and in-depth.

This is naturally because the implementation of democracy must develop in parallel with the intelligence of the people. "The people can be made to follow it, but not made to understand it" is a means of blocking the people's intelligence in the autocratic era. Therefore, the initial stage of democracy must start with how to "make them understand it." Because although democracy can be explained in thousands of ways, it can be summarized as everyone being able to exercise their free will. The reason why democracy is inevitably linked to the word freedom is the same.

However, the exercise of free will must have a certain degree of public intelligence as a relative condition. Because free will without proper judgment can often become a dangerous thing. Just imagine what kind of situation this world would become if everyone acted according to their own so-called free will? Therefore, democratic countries must strictly implement the rule of law; to a certain extent, the rule of law should be said to be a constraint on individual free will, but in fact, everyone knows that only a strict rule of law is truly a reliable guarantee of freedom and democracy. The so-called rule of law is that the degree of public intelligence of a country has been able to weigh the sacrifice of a part of individual freedom in exchange for the freedom of all members of society.

The Three Principles of the People once criticized that the Chinese people have scattered sand-like freedom, but lack the cohesion of cement. This is because all the freedom we have is too scattered. The English phrase "free-for-all" directly translates to everyone being free to act. We have recently become accustomed to this kind of freedom, such as fighting on trams, fighting in theaters, and group fights among students, etc., all of which can be attributed to this kind of freedom. But on the contrary, it only proves that our degree of public intelligence is still far from being able to talk about the rule of law.

Many people who are dissatisfied with the status quo believe that we cannot talk about the rule of law today. Whoever has power, whoever has money, stands in the upper hand of "rule," and the law seems to be a barrier set up for these people. There is no justice in society, and there is no justice in the world. How can we talk about the rule of law? According to reports, a theater in Changzhou was banned from performing because it changed the plaque "The country is governed by law" in the courtroom scene of the play "The Tragic Death of Chu Fengdi" to "The country is governed by currency," which is enough to prove how disappointed people are with the rule of law.

It is undeniable that social phenomena are disappointing. However, negative sarcasm and even despair do not help to change the social atmosphere. Thinking that the rule of law is impossible and that abiding by the law is tantamount to restricting oneself can only be said to be a biased view. The so-called democratic spirit is to require everyone to have the spirit of striving for the rule of law, that is, to strive for freedom and security through legal channels. The reason why democratic revolution is different from violent revolution is that the former emphasizes the procedures of law and reason, and its process is gradual; while the latter often results in replacing violence with violence.

In an unreasonable society, it is a difficult problem to realize the rule of law, but it is a truly fighting spirit for democracy to know that it is impossible and still want to do it. In the previous period, a lawyer filed a lawsuit against the post office's behavior of adding overdue payments because the post office increased prices without being approved by the Legislative Yuan. At that time, it was only a small matter of several thousand dollars, and the lawyer knew that the price increase had been approved by the administrative authorities, although it had not gone through legal procedures, but it was already impossible to do anything, but he still wanted to do it. This is a democratic action to strive for the rule of law. Although the result of this action was a failure, the influence of its spirit is quite valuable.

Although the meaning of the rule of law does not lie in encouraging people to file lawsuits, in order to protect the interests of individuals or society, everyone should know how to use legal channels to uphold justice. On the contrary, everyone should also restrain individual free will and actions to fulfill their responsibilities to society. Although the constitution has been implemented, there is still a long way to go before realizing true democracy. Whether this road can be passed smoothly depends on whether our level of public intelligence can distinguish between individual freedom and the freedom of members of society, that is, whether everyone can respect the spirit of the rule of law. I do not agree with the so-called democracy that replaces violence with violence, and at the same time I oppose scattered sand-like freedom, and I believe that only democracy based on the rule of law is true democracy.

### Breaking Superstition

— Jimo

There are many people who often feel uneasy because they have nightmares at night, such as being trapped in mud, groping in the dark, chasing trains but never being able to board them; or when they are awake, they accidentally break bowls, cups, or mirrors. I recently learned that even not seeing the coffin in a big funeral is a sign of a small misfortune.

Since Westernization spread to the East, it has brought a lot of new scientific knowledge, but at the same time, it has also introduced some new superstitions. Buying a numbered ticket with the number thirteen, or being forced to pass under a ladder on the road because of crowded pedestrians, more or less makes people feel a little uncomfortable. The troubles and stressful life on the road of life have already made people suffer enough, and adding so many superstitions makes them even more psychologically constrained.

If we spare no effort to compensate for the shortcomings in our material enjoyment, we should also try to get rid of the shackles in our spiritual life. It is said that the contemporary American novelist Sinclair Lewis (the one who won the Nobel Prize money of more than 40,000 yuan, not Upton Sinclair who wrote The Coal King and Boston, etc.) is also a radical element who breaks superstition. Once, when he was invited by a certain revival meeting to attend and give a speech, after denouncing the absurd rumor that a certain free-thinking person was killed by God, he shouted loudly, "I am willing to dedicate myself as a test subject, please God kill me in ten minutes—" For a time, the listeners of the sermon were in an uproar and left their seats one after another.

Originally, the fear of superstition lies in making people feel depressed and feel a certain omen, and developing a fear of the future. It blocks sound thinking and understanding, and is a stumbling block for anyone to make progress. I have witnessed an architect who, after completing the design of a certain project, suddenly trembled his fingers when he picked up a pen to write, hesitated, and finally abandoned his engineering plan, along with delaying the date of his fame in one fell swoop.

Logically, if there is an unlucky omen, there is a possibility that an unfortunate event will occur. Then, before a real disaster or accident comes, there must also be a sign before it can make sense. I remember one year at the end of the year, the author took the Shanghai-Nanjing train from Suzhou to Shanghai. When the train entered Shanghai Station, it collided with another locomotive, and many people were killed or injured. The author was in the last few carriages of the train. Although he was shaken, he was fortunately not injured. However, on the day of the accident, the weather was unusually sunny, and the people in the car were talking and laughing. Until the last few minutes of entering the station, there was not a trace of the slightest sign of misfortune.

### Natural Disaster?

— Haiyan

Not long ago, there was a big fire in Chongqing that lasted for five hours, and it took only more than ten minutes from a spark to a raging fire.

Chongqing is the most difficult place to put out fires. Often, far from the road, turning two corners, the slope of the stone steps is too steep, and the power of the water dragon is not easy to reach. Some roads are not like this. The water dragon arrives in an instant, but the firefighters are helpless. Ten thousand people watch from across the river, only having the share of sighing.

The reason? The reason is that there is no tap water, and the water can be transported by land. Firefighting can only be done with dry equipment in an emergency. So, more than a hundred houses were watched as they turned to ashes.

When houses burn down, fatalistic Chinese people have always called it "natural disaster." The bewildered crows in the fire, circling around because they are lost, reflecting the firelight and transforming into golden wings, are called "fire crows," which are sent by the Fire God to preside over the disaster. After being burned, they also have to perform a fire ritual to reward the gods, otherwise they will come again to wreak havoc. In short, the passers-by watching the fire mostly sigh in unison, "It's God's will!"

Is it really God's will? There is no tap water.

China's science is backward, and there are not enough public disaster prevention facilities, so there is no way to do it. But in Chongqing, several air force members watching the fire said, "If we had an order to fly two planes and drop some sand, it would be extinguished immediately, but without an order, there is nothing we can do."

Floods are also not a small matter. Even if airplanes are dispatched to help with disaster relief, it is not an exaggeration, because it is related to the lives and property of three thousand people after all.

However, not to mention airplanes, the most common and convenient tap water cannot be used. Is the lack of tap water due to the Lunshui injuring people, or other reasons? There is no need to investigate further. In short, the fact that there are no fully utilized facilities is undeniable.

The fate of the Chinese people is always in the hands of the Old Man of Heaven and the Fire Crow. This shows that we are still stagnating in a stupid and backward era, and there is no major difference from before and after the Boxer Rebellion.

We don't need to talk about new scientific construction. Being able to smoothly obtain the tap water equipment from twenty years ago is already a supreme blessing.

### Qian Juntao, Xu Ju'an: Preface to the Epigraphy, Calligraphy, and Painting Exhibition

— Feng Zikai

Juntao and Ju'an will be holding an exhibition of epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting at the China National Products Company starting June 4th. When I was in Shanghai to see Mei Lanfang's play, Juntao told me about this news and asked me to write a preface. Recently, the world is full of wars, which makes me feel more affectionate towards "art," which symbolizes peace and happiness. I came to see Mr. Mei's play with great sincerity, and now I hear this news, which feels like icing on the cake. I am happy to write a preface.

Juntao was originally a design expert, and his designs are unique. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he devoted himself to the study of epigraphy, which allowed his talents to surpass design and develop towards calligraphy and painting. Today, epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting have all progressed equally, which can be called "three perfections." There is an ancient Chinese saying that "calligraphy and painting share the same origin." In fact, this saying is not entirely correct. It should be said that "epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting share the same origin," three in one. And in terms of their order, epigraphy is the eldest brother, calligraphy is the second brother, and painting is the third brother. A disciple of Wu Changshuo told me: Wu Changshuo said in his later years: "People say I am good at painting, but in fact, my calligraphy is better than my painting; people say I am good at calligraphy, but in fact, my epigraphy is even better than my calligraphy." This is true! Wu was proficient in calligraphy because he was proficient in epigraphy; he was able to paint because he was proficient in calligraphy. Epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting are three in one, and epigraphy is the eldest brother among the three, which can be confirmed. Now, Juntao's learning started with epigraphy, with a clear source, from top to bottom, from root to branch, from inside to outside, from deep to shallow. No wonder his calligraphy and painting have progressed by leaps and bounds, and finally, the three talents are flourishing together.

Ju'an and Juntao are artists with the same style. When discussing Juntao, it is also appropriate to discuss Ju'an. And I particularly love his ancient costume figures, which are modeled after Fei Xiaolou, but surpass him. The charm of the appearance, the exquisiteness of the lines, and the appropriateness of the layout are all so endearing! I myself have never painted ancient costume figures. Half is habit, half is because I dislike the ugliness of most ancient costume figure paintings: the bodies of the women are often not physiological, with disproportionate development of various parts, or even disabled. As for the men, I dislike them because they look like Taoist priests. Ju'an does not paint "Taoist priests" but specializes in female figures, and the female bodies he paints are all anatomically correct, with beautiful faces and graceful figures, resembling Mei Lanfang in "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" and "Goddess of the Luo River." That's why I love them so much! I already have many of Juntao's works, but I haven't acquired any of Ju'an's yet. Someday I will ask him for a painting of an ancient costume beauty to hang in my room, as if I see Dr. Mei every day. This does not look like a preface, so let's just consider it as one. (Written in Hangzhou, May 12, 1937.)

### Qian Jun Dian's Seal Carving

### Forgetfulness

— Mei Bai

One day, the famous actress Hedy Lamarr and the famous writer He Quetuo went to visit the Hollywood movie mogul Squillronberg. They arrived on time at the appointed hour. Squillronberg himself opened the door and invited them inside. He said that he had some things to finish and asked the two guests to sit for a while and he would be right back. After saying that, he hurried upstairs and left.

The two guests waited for an hour, but the host still did not come down. He Quetuo whispered to Miss Lamarr: "I'm afraid he went upstairs and forgot about us, maybe he's taking a nap. Let's come back again."

Miss Lamarr happily agreed. So they ran out the door and rang the doorbell again. Squillronberg himself came to open the door and invited them inside. He Quetuo said first: "Sorry, we are a little late." Squillronberg said earnestly: "It's alright, it's alright, I've been waiting for you two for a long time." So Hedy Lamarr and He Quetuo happily talked business with Squillronberg—without mentioning that they had already been there before.

### 

Society is abnormal, and strange news emerges one after another. Last week, there was a strange incident in Tianjin. The wife of a judge sent a vest to a dry cleaner and later discovered that gold ingots, diamonds, U.S. dollars, treasures, etc., were sewn into the hem of the garment. Half of them were lost, and the company refused to pay compensation, so they quarreled and went to court. This wife can be called a truly unparalleled "gold-clad jade," and her wealth is boundless. However, the wonderful thing is not in her "wealth," but in her "fanciful imagination." I heard that when a Japanese noblewoman returned to her country the year before last, the Allied forces found countless gold and treasures sewn into the seams of her clothes, which she had hidden. Those who obtained them kept them privately. One really had to imitate the "clothing edict" of Emperor Xian of Han. But what was this Tianjin wife doing? This is the first unbelievable thing. According to past practice, whenever clothing is handed over to a cabinet for safekeeping or given to a store for cleaning, the receiver must first ask, "Are there any items in the pockets?" The owner either answers "no" or checks it himself and takes out anything he has. But this refers to pockets. If things are sewn into the clothing, the receiver has no way to ask, and the owner is also inconvenient to announce it. This Tianjin wife casually handed it over first, and then openly spoke of it later. This is the second unbelievable thing. The "clothing edict" of Emperor Xian of Han of the Three Kingdoms was discovered when Dong Cheng was watching the lights and the lamp exploded, burning a corner of the belt and revealing the blood edict hidden inside. In addition, there is a story in the Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern, in the case of Teng Dasheng judging family property. He accepted the complaint of Mrs. Mei and only presented the painting scroll left by her deceased husband. The county magistrate looked at the picture and was not very clear about it. Coincidentally, the tea servant delivered tea, and a drop of tea wet a corner of the scroll, revealing words in the inner layer. Upon careful inspection under the light, the entire will distributing the family property was revealed. He judged and concluded the case based on this (details in the original novel, which will not be repeated here). The above are all stories of hiding and revealing secrets. But what was hidden were secret documents, not gold and jewels. The Tianjin woman's property was not smuggling, so why did she have to create such mystery? It is truly incomprehensible. Some say that it is because it is incomprehensible that it becomes modern news, and therefore there are too many incomprehensible strange things today...

Before he finished speaking, he saw a report that a National Assembly representative from Hunan was returning to Nanjing via Hankou with his family. His wife's handbag was stolen, and she lost three gold bars, one gold bowl, and gold jewelry and U.S. dollars worth about 40 to 50 billion. The wife even knew that the thief had followed her from Nanjing. What is surprising is not the "wealth" but the strangeness of the incident. Here, one can only sigh at the wonderful use of words in the ancient text "extravagant storage invites theft." The words "extravagant" and "invites" are both concise and profound. How can old literature be wrong?
