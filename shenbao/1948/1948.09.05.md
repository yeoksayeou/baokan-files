However, the department stated that it must charge China "replacement value."

The Chinese side stated that in some cases, this price is several times higher than the original price. The Chinese side is quite disappointed, because each price increase is equivalent to reducing purchasing power.

### Xu Baiqi Continues to Work While Under House Arrest

### Government Council Discusses Handling of the Tao Qiming Case; Tracing the Source of Information for Profiteering; President Weng and Political Commissioners Agree Punishment Should Be Handed Down with Impartiality

[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu attended the temporary Government Council political affairs meeting on the 4th to report on the process of detaining Tao Qiming, and also emphasized his determination to handle the case. After Mr. Wang's report, President Weng and various political commissioners spoke one after another, unanimously agreeing that the handling of the case should focus on tracing the source of the information obtained by Tao Qiming in selling the Yongsheng yarn short. As for the punishment for the case, it should be based on an impartial attitude, neither lenient nor severe, and mete out the deserved punishment. Mr. Wang's report described in detail that when drafting the emergency financial and economic measures, he personally wrote them behind closed doors, and during the preparation period, no outsider was aware of them. It was not until the 18th, when the notice ordering the suspension of business of the stock exchange was issued, that the ministry was ordered to draft it. However, the initial draft of the document did not have the date filled in, so the facts were extremely confidential, and thus the main measures were not leaked. However, Tao Qiming's short selling came from the news of the stock exchange's suspension of business. Mr. Wang also reported that although the amount of Tao Qiming's short selling was a small portion of the total volume sold that day, because Tao's wife went to the exchange at 9:00 AM on the 19th to wait for the market to open, it led to speculation by some onlookers, who followed suit and sold a large amount, causing major fluctuations in the market. Although Tao himself did not profit much, it is a fact that he used his position for speculation. Mr. Wang's report lasted an hour before it was completed.

[Another Telegram] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu paid a visit to President Weng at 3:45 PM on the 4th, and together they went to the No. 1 official residence of the Government Council. The conversation lasted for an hour, and it is said that they discussed how to handle the Tao Qiming case. In addition, Finance Vice Minister Xu Bogang and Wu Zhaohong, Deputy Director of the Inflammation Committee, also paid a visit to President Weng before 5:00 PM on the 4th and left around 6:00 PM.

Supervisory Yuan President Tan Delays Release of Investigation Report on the Tao Case

[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren, after receiving Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, told reporters that the Tao case is complicated and may involve even greater implications. Therefore, the report of Commissioners Tang and Sun will be temporarily delayed. Tang and Sun also said: This case cannot be released yet, and the results will only be available after a considerable period of time. Mr. Yu also denied the rumor that he had visited the President on the morning of the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Supervisory Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Wanglin, who were dispatched by the Supervisory Yuan to Shanghai to investigate the case of the large-scale selling of Yongsheng yarn stocks on the eve of the currency reform, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th. After reviewing and organizing the various case files and materials collected in Shanghai, the two went to the police department to visit Director Huang Zhenwu, inquiring about the process of detaining Tao Qiming. Immediately afterwards, they went to the Criminal Police Brigade to participate in the team's interrogation of Tao Qiming. The process was extremely detailed and factual, and it did not end until 4:30 PM. They also decided to continue the interrogation on the 5th, hoping to obtain further clues from Tao's confession. After completing the interrogation at the Criminal Police Brigade, the two visited Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren to report on the investigation process in Shanghai and to discuss the direction of continuing the investigation for a long time. They also believed that the case was still in progress and should not be announced early. President Yu then telegraphed this opinion to Finance Minister Wang, requesting that strict confidentiality be maintained regarding the details of the investigation of the Tao Qiming case to facilitate the work. Mr. Wang also expressed his agreement. Reporters separately interviewed Supervisors Sun and Tang on the evening of the 4th. According to them: Our interrogation of the Tao Qiming case is aimed at obtaining more in-depth clues, that is, we must be able to ascertain the source of the information obtained by Tao Qiming. As for what disposition the Yuan will take, it has not yet been decided. It will not be possible to decide what kind of impeachment case, correction case, or accusation case to file until all the materials have been collected and the overall situation has been understood. Mr. Sun also made a four-point statement on his trip to Shanghai: (1) The cracking of this case was due to the assistance of the Shanghai Economic Management Bureau and the police bureau, which enabled the task to be completed quickly. (2) During the investigation period, the details of the process will not be released temporarily, so as not to hinder the investigation work. (3) The criminal behavior in this case occurred in Shanghai, so it is hoped that the relevant perpetrators can be transferred to Shanghai for handling. (4) Currency reform is a major event, and it is inappropriate for anyone to leak the news, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, it should be resolved legally so that any future reforms or planned policies can be promoted smoothly and protected.

Tao Qiming's Confession is Sophisticated, Claiming the Selling Was Based on Judgment

[Our Nanjing Telegram, 4th] Regarding the case of Tao Qiming profiting from selling Yongsheng yarn stocks short on the eve of the currency reform, the Capital Police Department, after continuous interrogation, transferred the entire case to the Special Criminal Court late on the 3rd. However, the suspect Tao is still detained in the police department so that the police should continue to thoroughly investigate. The Special Criminal Court will also send prosecutors to preside over the investigation when necessary. The suspect Tao is very cunning. When interrogated on the 4th, he often avoided answering questions about the source of the information. He said that his spirit had been flagging and his hair was disheveled.

Tao was always firm in his attitude and cautious in his words when answering the interrogation in the Criminal Police Brigade on the 4th. Because Tao is a law graduate and has served in the judicial system, his answers were evasive and circuitous. However, two points were found in the confession on the 4th that differed from the confession made by Tao's wife in Shanghai. One was that Tao claimed he flew to Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 18th, while Tao's wife said he went by train. The other was that Tao's wife said Tao went out for a day on the 19th, while Tao's confession claimed he did not go out all day on the 19th. During the interrogation, Supervisors Tang and Sun repeatedly asked him why he did this short-selling business. Tao replied that he made a judgment that it was possible to speculate and profit. When asked again whether he had obtained any information that led to this behavior, Tao again said it was based on judgment. When asked what factors influenced this judgment, Tao said it was based on materials obtained from newspapers.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] This reporter learned from relevant sources that, as a result of continuous and repeated interrogations by the Criminal Police Brigade of the Capital Police Department, the suspect Tao has only admitted that he flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 6:00 PM on the 18th to visit his sick mother. However, Tao often travels between Beijing and Shanghai and has never flown. He was still in Shanghai on the 15th, and his mother had no symptoms of illness, so the reason for visiting her is difficult to justify. Regarding the sale of yarn stocks, he only admitted that his wife had sold 2 million shares of Yongsheng yarn, profiting over 2 billion. His wife also sold a large number of stocks on behalf of her relatives and friends. Therefore, although Tao firmly denies knowing the news of the currency reform in advance, according to the judgment of the person in charge of this case, Tao's family is not wealthy, and he would not have dared to sell stocks so boldly without prior knowledge. Moreover, the psychological reactions of the suspect Tao during the interrogation using a lie detector and tape recorder showed that he must have learned of the currency reform news in advance. Furthermore, it is also worth studying that Tao, as a mid-level employee, was able to fly directly to Shanghai on the 18th without asking for leave. Although his confession during the interrogation seemed well-considered, it still inevitably contained some contradictions or attempts to evade responsibility. Judging from the circumstances of the interrogation, it is not difficult to judge that this case seems to have considerable implications and connections.

Details of the Cracking of the Short-Selling Case: Personnel Involved Reached 1,000

[Central News Agency, This City] This reporter recently learned from responsible sources the details of the cracking of the case of "anonymous individuals" massively selling Yongsheng yarn stocks short in Shanghai on the eve of the currency reform to speculate and profit. This case was reported in the newspapers and attracted the deep attention of the highest authorities. On August 28, the Presidential Office telegraphed to the relevant agencies in Shanghai, ordering them to crack the case within seven days. At that time, in addition to the Supervisory Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin, Supervisory Counselor Fan Tiren, and Finance Ministry Counselor Zhou Dewei, who were dispatched to Shanghai, there were the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Investigation Department of the Municipal Government, the Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, the Special High Group of the Military Police, the Gold Management Bureau, the Suppression Brigade, the Special Economic Investigation Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Supervisor of the Stock Exchange, and other relevant agencies, totaling more than ten units. The personnel involved reached 1,000. Under the active investigation, on the fifth day after the order was received (September 2), this mysterious case that attracted national attention was finally revealed. It is said that the main clues to the initial discovery of the case were personnel from the Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters' Investigation Department. Group leader Mao Kegang, officers Li Jiguang, Le Jiafang, Wu Shiyi, Yu Bingzhong, and others were all contributors to solving the case. On August 31, the Economic Group personnel learned from Hongxing Securities Company that the "819" short seller was named Li Boqin. Li's partners also included two female customers. It was then learned that Li Boqin lived with his sister Li Guolan at No. 20, Lane 9, Yanqing Road. Guolan's husband is Tao Qiming, a secretary of the Ministry of Finance. Tao works in Beijing and returns to Shanghai once a week. On August 18, Sui rushed from Beijing to Shanghai, took a day off the next day, and then took a car back to Beijing late at night. Tao Qiming's entry into the Ministry of Finance was introduced by Xu Baiqi, the chief secretary of the ministry. He has only been in the ministry for two months. His wife usually plays stocks occasionally, but the number is very small. Starting at 6:00 PM on September 1, the investigators waited for Li Boqin at No. 20, Lane 9, Yanqing Road. Li had not returned by 12:00 AM. From the mouth of Li's family servant, they learned that Li Boqin sometimes stayed at the home of his friend Gao Xiangsheng at No. 57, Ruihua Fang, Fuxing Road. Another group of people was sent to wait at Gao's house, while Li Jiguang and several others entered Li Guolan's house at 12:00 AM on the 2nd. In a skillful manner, they forced Li Guolan to reveal the truth, and learned that after she learned of the currency reform news from her husband on the morning of the 19th, she and her brother and Yang Shuyao, the wife of Xu Zhuanghuai, the chief secretary of the China Petroleum Company, went to Hongxing Securities Company at No. 237, Securities Building, which was managed by broker Du Weiping. They arrived there at 9:00 AM, and when the market opened at 9:30 AM, they sold 2 million shares of Yongsheng stock each, for a total of 6 million shares, making a total profit of about 8 billion yuan at that time.

After the investigators ordered Li Guolan to make a written statement, they went to the Petroleum Company dormitory at No. 343, Hunan Road, to question Yang Shuyao. Yang also admitted to the previous situation. However, Li Boqin had been waited for in various places that day for a long time without being found.

The Economic Group personnel reported this gain to Commander Xuan Tiewu and Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, which led to the subsequent summons of Du Weiping and Li Guolan by the police bureau. In this case, in addition to the crimes of Tao Qiming, Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, and Li Boqin being determined, regarding Du Weiping, it is said that after Li Guolan and others sold short in Hongxing Securities Company on the morning of the 19th, Du also learned of the currency reform news in the afternoon and sold 30 million shares of Yongsheng yarn. Du was originally a bull, and sold 30 million shares in order to flatten his position. As for those sold by Du, it is said that broker Lin Le of Yue Mao Securities Company, Securities No. 190, absorbed 16 million shares, and Zhang of Tianyu Securities Company and several others absorbed the remaining 10 million shares.

### Forecasting National Fortune from Sports

The autumn semester of schools at all levels across the country is about to begin again. Let us talk about sports, focusing on hoping for our national fortune through sports.

The World Games in London in July were in full swing. We also spared no expense to spend 60 billion to open the National Games and select 35 representatives to participate. When the country's foreign exchange was almost exhausted, we bit the bullet and took out 25,000 US dollars, and also donated about 230,000 US dollars from overseas Chinese (the actual amount of donations is unknown), sincerely calculating to have the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth fluttering in the 14th World Games. I once predicted that we would definitely get a duck egg, and now unfortunately my words have come true. If sports are like this, what about the national fortune?

Fifty-nine countries participated in this World Games, with a total of 131 events. Forty-one countries scored points. The United States ranked first with 652 and a half points, and Greece ranked last with one-third of a point. Turkey, Egypt, South Africa, Korea, Poland, India, Ceylon, Cuba, and the Philippines all had considerable scores, and many countries with very small populations and extremely narrow territories even won championships, such as Denmark in four-person rowing, the Czech Republic in the 10,000-meter race and equestrian events, Austria in the women's javelin, Sweden in the 50,000-meter race walk and soccer, the Netherlands in the women's 100-meter race, Belgium in the team cycling event, Peru in pistol shooting, and Egypt in lightweight wrestling. Our neighbor India was first in hockey, and Korea also got third in boxing. Turkey ranked fifth in track and field. Which country is not better than us? Even Japan simultaneously set swimming records in Tokyo for 1,500 meters and 400 meters.

When we set out, we thought basketball was the most promising, but we couldn't beat the Philippines. The game against Chile was even more frustrating. In other events, the soccer team lost 4-0 to Turkey; Lou Wenao failed to qualify in the 5,000-meter preliminary round; Wu Chuanyu couldn't keep up in the 100-meter freestyle swimming; Chen Yinglang finished first in the first group of the 400-meter preliminary race but was almost 20 meters away from qualifying for the semi-finals; Huang Liangzheng was second to last in the 400-meter hurdles preliminary race, 4 meters behind third place, and was naturally eliminated; He Haohua crashed his car and injured his shoulder in the freestyle race, losing two qualifying opportunities. The World Games theme song, "Praise is not for us," is true. All the praise does not belong to us. Is this a warning or satire?

Wu Zhengting, the head of the Chinese World Games delegation, emphasized in a broadcast on July 28 that "our purpose in participating in the World Games is not to win medals, but to promote sportsmanship and study the sports techniques of various countries," which coincides with the words of Baron de Coubertin, the founder of the modern World Games, written on the eight-foot-high scoreboard in Wembly Stadium: "The most important thing in the World Games is not winning, but the essence of participation is not overcoming, but striving." This is not the first time that Mr. Wang has led a team on an expedition. He knows very well, like eating fireflies, that there is no hope for medals, and he is happy to say nice things, focusing on "morality" and "technology."

Our inherent modesty and morality are completely consistent with modern Western sportsmanship. Confucius advocated "bowing and yielding before ascending, drinking after descending, and their competition is gentlemanly," and Su Dongpo's "victory is of course pleasing, and defeat is also gratifying" can represent our sportsmanship. However, where is this morality now? Not to mention its manifestation in external competition, even in the internal relations when there is no competition, it is messy and deteriorating, starting quarrels and physical altercations. The basketball team changes captains, the instructor does not instruct, and everything is a mess. Including the staff, there are only 53 people in total, but they are divided into factions and act on emotions. There is friction between staff members, resentment between staff and athletes, and estrangement between athletes. The bacteria of China's division, selfishness, and self-interest has spread to the cells of each individual. Is the delegation a microcosm of today's motherland? Can we resist foreign insults with brothers fighting within the walls? Can you pick grapes in a thorny bush? The "Notice to Members of the Chinese Delegation" has instructed everyone that "we must unite and cooperate, respect etiquette and abide by the law," but the result is exactly the opposite. In such a situation, how can we promote sportsmanship?

Since the competition was a dismal failure and the sportsmanship that was displayed was only the dark side, if someone deliberately believes the arrogant statement that "European technology is not much better than ours," then what is left for us in participating in the World Games? Originally, failure is the mother of success, but here we must "not forget the past" and "learn from the pain" in order to have hope of success. Participating in the World Games is "not in overcoming but in striving," and the first thing is to strive against our own shortcomings. If we cannot overcome our own shortcomings, we will surely be swallowed by them, just as if we cannot heal our own scars, we will surely suffer from the scars, and even have our whole body corroded by the scars.

Victory should be glorious, and defeat should be magnanimous. One person's defeat increases the meaning of victory for millions of people and opens a path to victory. Experience increases the breadth and depth of our sporting life. On the day of the Chinese delegation's return, they should work with people across the country to discover our own , we must unleash the greatest power of life to cure shortcomings. Why are we selfish? Why are we arrogant? And why are we so completely defeated? Let's not mention the trivial details, we must cure from the root. The root cause of selfishness, arrogance, and failure is that the national quality is not as good as others and the national biological foundation has not been established (1).

If the national quality and biological foundation are too poor, the natural result is insufficient height, weak physical strength, poor endurance, lack of persistence, and unstable nerves. When a person has physical problems, the survival instinct is often particularly strong, and the result is inevitably that the individual is greater than the group, and therefore the selfishness is abnormally developed. Selfishness has ruined our entire country, not just sports competitions! The imperial examination, famines, wars, foot binding, early marriage, opium, epidemics, etc., have all cut off the vitality of the nation, causing adverse selection and reverse selection in heredity! How can we compete with others with groups that are mutually hostile and bodies that are tired and disabled, coupled with a bad environment and lack of training, with no promotion from above and no prevailing atmosphere below? This is not just a manifestation in sports; the entire country will be visible in these subtle things, which is not frightening!

The Olympics originated in ancient Greece in 420 BC. When they were extremely fond of health, beauty, and morality, the national fortune was at its peak, and the greatest gift of culture was the concept that the universe is governed by natural laws. They did their best to train the bodies of young people, and the regulations for athletes were extremely strict. The prerequisite was that they must be citizens of pure blood and have not violated religious and national laws. Many young people dreamed of victory in the Olympics on the arena and receiving the honor of a wild olive wreath. Everyone worked hard and practiced hard for a long time. When a few mosquitoes carrying malaria reached Greece, Greece became a historical term. Germany was at its peak before the war, and its performance in the World Games was remarkable. Currently, the United States is the strongest, and its performance in the World Games is good on average. This proves that the golden age of a national fortune must first have a golden age of the body.

For the sake of the present, we must restore our country's inherent national quality and promote the spirit of sports. The most urgent way to save the situation is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and improve the people's lives. Although it may not be possible for every family to be prosperous for a while, we should at least have an equal distribution of joy and hardship, and food rationing, with "children first, youth first," and then "the young will be cared for." Otherwise, even if we have good seeds and sow them in barren soil, it will be useless, let alone that eugenics has been lost for a long time. How to modernize our country? Please see if there will be a turnaround for our athletes competing in the Helsinki arena in Finland four years later, and the turning point depends on the improvement of the national quality. Eugenics, hygiene, and sports are the essential elements that determine our quality, and we should start from here. The great cause of national revival should be seen in sports.

### Schumann Agrees to Withdraw Resignation, Tries to Form New French Cabinet Again, Military Police Ordered to Be on Alert to Maintain Security

[News Report] London, 4th - Paris report by broadcast: Schumann said that he had withdrawn his resignation and will try to form a centrist cabinet again.

[United Press Paris, 4th] France's most critical political crisis since the war has entered its second week, with the tense situation worsening daily. The solution may inevitably be to dissolve the parliament and hold new general elections. The Communist Party has requested to participate in the government, and strikes demanding wage increases have broken out, which the resigned but not yet vacant Marie cabinet has had to guard against. About 400 police officers in Paris are on standby, and the Republican Security Corps directly under the Ministry of the Interior are on alert in barracks throughout the Paris area. Centrist parties are meeting to work together to try to form a joint cabinet. At the request of Auriol, Marie met with Schumann of the People's Republican Party, Mollet of the Socialist Party, and Queuille of the Radical Socialist Party. The biggest problem is to get the Socialist Party and the right-wing factions to agree on wage increases. The Socialist Party is in favor of raising wages and increasing living expenses, while the People's Republican Party and the Radical Socialist Party have expressed opposition.

[French News Agency Paris, 3rd] The French Communist Party today issued a declaration on the cabinet crisis, stating that "the Communist Party demands the organization of a democratic united government trusted by the people to establish a progressive, democratic, and peaceful policy that is truly needed by the French people in the economic, financial, internal affairs, and diplomatic fields." The declaration continued, "Any government that does not include the Communist Party and Communist sympathizers, who represent one-third of the French people, cannot take on the responsibility of rebuilding France."

### Conditions for Lifting Berlin Blockade, Four-Power Principles Agreed, Berlin Communist Party Attempts to Usurp Power

[News Report] London, 4th - Berlin report by broadcast: The four-power governors held their fifth meeting on the 4th. It is reported that an agreement has been reached in principle on the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade. The meeting lasted nearly three hours. General Clay of the US Army said that further meetings were still needed.

[United Press Berlin, 4th] According to the announcement on the 4th: The expert committee of the Four-Power Military Governors' Conference has drafted a preliminary report on at least some aspects of the Berlin talks, so that the Governors' Conference can submit it for discussion when it meets at 3 pm. Reliable sources said that the Governors' Conference on the 3rd made considerable progress, and the belief that a single currency system should be implemented in Berlin (with the East Mark issued by the Soviet Union as the only legal currency) is close to agreement and can be drafted into a plan.

[News Report] London, 4th - Broadcast: The Berlin Communist Party is stepping up its activities today in order to seize power from the anti-communist city government. The Communist Party today established the so-called "Three-Party Democratic United Front," claiming to represent "the welfare of the people." However, according to impartial sources, this front is actually a "action committee," for the Communist Party to seize power.

[United Press Berlin, 4th] The "Council of Elders" of the Berlin City Government decided to hold a city council meeting in the Soviet-occupied city hall at noon on the 6th to test the Communist Party's strength in usurping municipal power. Communist leaders moved into the city hall on the evening of the 3rd and organized the "Berlin Democratic Bureau" to exercise the functions of the city council. The decision of the "Council of Elders" is clearly aimed at a challenge.

### Argentina to Propose Allowing Spain to Join the United Nations

### Syngman Rhee Asks the United States to Continue Aiding Korea

[US News Service Washington, 3rd] Syngman Rhee, president of the new Republic of Korea, has recently issued an appeal asking the United States to continue providing economic aid in four main areas. Rhee's letter to President Truman was released today, stating: "Your Excellency is undoubtedly very clear about the environment of our country. It is precisely because of this environment that I have to represent the people of our country to request the US government to continue the aid that has been generously provided in the past three years, so that the government of the Republic of Korea can implement its previously stipulated economic reconstruction and national defense security plan." Rhee listed the factors that contributed to the economic hardship and requested assistance in the following areas: providing economic assistance to enable the Korean government to obtain the materials and machinery necessary for the survival and economic activities of the Korean people; assisting in obtaining supplies and equipment to enable the government to maintain law and order and internal security; assisting in the reconstruction of various basic industries to enable Korea to develop its domestic economy and foreign trade; and that Korea should continue to be listed on the International Emergency Food Committee's food distribution plan. Rhee said: If the United States is willing and able to provide this assistance, representatives of the two countries can conduct negotiations on this assistance as soon as possible.

### Absurd Japanese Peace Theory

Heads of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union to Resolve the Problems of China and Japan

[United Press Tokyo, 4th] Ota, a member of the pre-war Japanese "Know China Movement," published an open letter to Zhang Qun in the Chinese-language "China Daily" on the 4th, advocating for a meeting of the three giants—President Chiang, Stalin, and Truman—in Shanghai to resolve the Japanese problem and to unify China and maintain peace in East Asia and the world."

### Whether the United States Will Withdraw from South Korea: Hoping the United Nations Can Resolve It; The US Is Unwilling to Withdraw from Korea Under Soviet Pressure

[United Press, Seoul, 4th] The United States currently hopes that the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Paris will resolve the major problem of how the United States can withdraw from Korea without losing face. The United States never intended for discord to arise between the US and the Soviet Union over the Korean issue, but since a dispute has now arisen, the United States cannot seem to concede under pressure from the Soviet Union. The Korean peninsula extends from Northeast China into the Yellow Sea, situated precisely between China and Japan. The peoples of China and Japan, who still need to struggle between communism and democracy and choose one of them, are closely watching the contest between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea, to a greater extent than the people of the United States and the Soviet Union. Americans here deeply fear that if the United States miscalculates in the Korean affair, the entire East will share the consequences. Therefore, the United States is extremely carefully preparing a plan to ensure that the United Nations General Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, supports the government of South Korean President Syngman Rhee, elected on May 10 of this year under the observation of the United Nations. The United States will try to have the United Nations judge the fact that the Soviet Union refused to allow the United Nations to inspect the elections in North Korea as a grave error. The United States also intends to point out that the Soviet claim that the communist-style elections in North Korea on August 25 can reflect the will of the people is a farce. After the United Nations supports the US policy in Korea, the United States can withdraw from Korea, not due to Soviet pressure, but due to the reasonable completion of an occupation deemed "very successful" by the United Nations. This plan will relieve State Department and War Department officials, who have had significant policy differences in the past. The War Department knows that from a military point of view, South Korea is not worth defending. Even if it ultimately leads to communist control of all of Korea, the War Department wants to withdraw US troops stationed there. Japan has always regarded Korea as a dagger pointing at the heart of Japan and seeks to make the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea. The United States does not want this, but knows that if war breaks out, this will be impossible. The State Department, on the other hand, clearly insists on continuing the occupation of Korea to declare to the world, especially the East, that the United States is determined to fulfill all its international obligations. The State Department and the War Department now both hope that the United Nations General Assembly will provide an answer to their Korean problem.

He was a man who was loyal to his beliefs and dedicated his life and abilities to the Czechoslovak people. He was a statesman who fought against the fascist reactionaries who attempted to eliminate our country's freedom during World War II. When others hesitated, he knew how to continue the struggle. Zápotocký also emphasized that Beneš always refused to compromise with German imperialism and turned to the Soviet Union for assistance in order to liberate Czechoslovakia. The cabinet meeting then decided to declare national mourning from the 5th to the 10th and to grant the late president's widow a lifetime pension from the government equal to the salary of a Czechoslovak minister. After the meeting, all cabinet members went to Beneš's residence in the southern suburbs of Prague to pay their respects to the late president's body. The public will pay their respects to the body on the 5th. It is also reported that after embalming, the late president's body will be buried.

### The President Concerned About the Situation in Shanghai; The Mayor Summoned to Nanjing to Report; Also Visits President Weng; Returns to Shanghai by Train That Night

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, summoned by presidential telegram, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Shanghai at approximately 9:00 AM on the 4th and returned to Shanghai by overnight train at approximately 11:00 PM that night. Wu met with the President twice in Nanjing, reporting on the prices and economic situation in Shanghai after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree, especially providing a very detailed report on the implementation of the recent week's worth of emergency financial and economic measures. After listening to Wu's report, the President provided very detailed instructions on how to implement the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree and how to stabilize prices in Shanghai. Wu arrived in Nanjing in the morning of the 4th, resting at No. 18 Guling Road, and reported to the President by telephone. At 1:00 PM, Wu went to the Song Ziwen residence in Beijige to request instructions from the President, leaving after an hour and a half. He then visited Executive Yuan Secretary-General Li Weiguo for 20 minutes. At 3:00 PM, he went to No. 17 Langya Road to visit President Weng Wenhao, talking for half an hour before continuing to visit other friends. Wu had already booked a ticket for the express train at 6:00 PM, planning to return to Shanghai at 6:00 PM. The President telegraphed No. 18 Guling Road to invite Wu for another talk, but Wu had already gone out. He then telegraphed President Weng's residence, but was unable to reach him. He then sent someone to wait at the station. Wu arrived at Xiaguan Station by car at 5:40 PM and was summoned by the President to return to Beijige to visit the President again, finally leaving at approximately 7:00 PM. He then had dinner with friends at Longmen Restaurant before taking a car to Xiaguan Station at approximately 10:00 PM to board the train and leave Nanjing to return to Shanghai. Before Wu left Nanjing, our newspaper reporter interviewed Wu in the Nanjing-Shanghai train. Wu was reading a foreign magazine, appearing very relaxed. The reporter first asked about the purpose of his visit to Nanjing. Wu said that he had been summoned by presidential telegram last night to report to the President on the economic situation in Shanghai and the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Decree. The reporter asked whether the rumor that the Mayor had come to Nanjing to resign was true, and told him that the outside world was saying this definitively. Wu repeatedly said, "Not true, not true." Wu said: "I came here upon the President's telegram summons. In addition to asking questions, the President also gave many instructions, but none of them are for publication. Although I have resigned several times in the past, now is really not the time to resign." The reporter asked again what instructions the President had given regarding the recent implementation of financial and economic measures in Shanghai. Wu smiled and replied that he could not disclose them. When asked if the President had sent a letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, Wu replied no. The reporter repeatedly asked for his opinion on the arrest of major merchants in Shanghai, but Wu avoided answering. Although Wu was very relaxed during the conversation, he was very cautious in his statements, frequently saying that the President hoped that the work of changing land registration in Shanghai would be completed quickly.

### Applications to Revise Price Limits Will Not Be Considered by the Authorities; Decision Made at the Price Review Committee Meeting

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai District Price Review Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Management Committee held its first meeting yesterday at the Central Bank. Yu Hongjun, Chiang Ching-kuo, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Xu Jili, Wu Yun, Shui Xiangyun, etc. all attended. Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to his visit to Nanjing on official business. Chairman Yu Hongjun first announced that the committee's work scope was to communicate the central and local price policies. The review of various prices in the city would be drafted by the relevant authorities in accordance with the principles set by the committee and then reviewed by the review committee. After Yu's report, the current price limit policy was discussed. It was generally agreed that the government's implementation of price limits was originally intended to break the price increase psychology of merchants in the city, so at this moment, applications to revise price limits would not be considered. However, the price of gasoline for private cars is proposed to be increased to show that prohibition is implicit in the increase, advocating for conservation.

### Planning to Use Government Materials

Another report: The economic management authorities are actively planning to use materials controlled by government agencies to maintain the "819" price limits. Chiang Ching-kuo met with Cheng Yuanfan, director of the Central Trust of China, and deputy directors He Molin and Luo Meizhong yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 AM to inquire about the types and quantities of materials currently controlled by the bureau. At the same time, the Vice President of the Central Bank also met with Shen Zhennan, manager of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, to discuss in detail the use of Taiwan Sugar resources.

### Funeral Parlors Increase Prices; Truly Disregarding the Living and the Dead, Citizens Report and Request Thorough Investigation

Citizen Wang Xinghuan submitted reports to Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, the City Council, and the Economic Inspection Team of the Police Department yesterday, reporting that the Shanghai Funeral Parlor on Xujiahui Road took advantage of the currency reform to drastically increase the storage fees of the parlor, and requested a swift and thorough investigation and an order to restore the original prices of "August 19th". According to the original report: The storage in the parlor is divided into three grades: A, B, and C. In June, Grade A was 1.5 million Legal Tender, and Grade B was 1 million Legal Tender. In July, it was raised to 3.2 million Legal Tender for Grade A and 2.8 million Legal Tender for Grade B. In early and mid-August, it was further raised to 10 million Legal Tender for Grade A and 8 million Legal Tender for Grade B. After the currency reform in late August, it was changed to 10 Gold Yuan for Grade A and 8 Gold Yuan for Grade B. In just three months, the price has been raised four times, increasing by 20 to 24 times, which is truly shocking. In chaotic times, it is difficult for ordinary people to live and die.

### Upright and Impartial; Three Supervisory Committee Members Encourage Themselves with Four Characters; Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office Holds First Reception for Reporters

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office held its first press conference since its establishment at 5:00 PM yesterday. Supervisory Committee member Tao Baichu introduced the heads of the Supervisory Office, Yu Peihou, Qing Shen’an, and Ni Bi, to the reporters. First, female Supervisory Committee member Yu Peihou delivered a speech: Supervisory work is based on public opinion. The Supervisory Yuan, people's representatives, and the media share the same mission. If the three parties are united on the basis of impartiality, abandon personal grievances, distinguish right from wrong, and eliminate evil and promote good, then the eradication of corruption is just around the corner.

Willing to be the People's Vanguard

Currently, people generally criticize that "the country has no discipline, and society has no distinction between right and wrong," which has created a world where opportunists thrive, and virtuous and wise people retreat and hide. In the future, this trend must be reversed for the success of national construction. Supervisory Committee member Qing Shen’an said in his speech: The establishment of this Supervisory Office coincides with the currency reform and the implementation of emergency economic measures. The Supervisory Office bears a great responsibility. After the implementation of the Constitution, the Supervisory Committee members are representatives of the people. In the future, our work will be based on the will of the people, and we hope that the media will provide more assistance. We are willing to be the vanguard, challenging corrupt officials, local bullies, and unscrupulous elements to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the people.

Eradicate Unscrupulous Officials

Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi said in his speech: The Communists are currently using a conciliatory policy, which is extremely harmful. The reason why the Communists adopted this policy is to target the corruption of government officials and political corruption, so eradicating corruption will lead to the self-destruction of the Communists. The so-called "powerful families" are also unscrupulous officials in the government and should also be included in the eradication. Before we came to Shanghai, we already knew that Shanghai was a "tiger's den," but "how can you catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" Whether we will catch the tiger or be swallowed by the tiger depends entirely on the support of the people. Finally, he put forward the four characters "Upright, Just, Honest, and Bright" to encourage himself. After the three Supervisory Committee members finished their speeches, reporters asked questions one after another, which were answered by the three members. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

### Labor Disputes in the Leather Industry and Others; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Based on Reports

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the currency reform, the wages of employees in various industries in this city have been determined by the central government and paid in Gold Yuan according to Article 22 of the Regulations for Consolidating Finance and Strengthening Economic Control. The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee of this city has also formulated four wage standards for various factories and businesses to follow. However, due to past practices, there are still disputes between labor and management in some factories and businesses in this city. The Social Affairs Bureau is trying to mediate, as follows:

(1) Leather Shoe Industry: Yang Fusheng, Chairman of the Shoe Business Association, went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to report the difficulty in calculating wages. Because the workers insisted on requiring that the base salary per pair of leather shoes be multiplied by the cost of living index of the upper period of August to be paid in Gold Yuan, while the employers believed that the marked prices of leather shoes in each store must comply with the prices on August 19th, and the wages should also be calculated based on the cost of living index of the lower period of July. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the employers to maintain their businesses. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting on the 6th to discuss with both labor and management.

(2) Western Clothing Industry: The Western Clothing Industry Labor Union submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the issue of wage calculation, proposing five requirements: (1) The base salary of employees in the industry was 2 yuan and 15 cents in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Now, they request that each silver dollar be converted into 2 yuan of Gold Yuan according to regulations, which translates to a base salary of 4 yuan and 30 cents. (2) The wage should be calculated by multiplying the cost of living index announced for the first half of August by the base salary, and then converted into Gold Yuan as the standard. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a mediation on the 6th.

(3) Needle Manufacturing Industry: The Association submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the industry had signed a record with the Labor Union of Hosiery Needle Industry in July, stipulating that workers' wages should be paid according to the cost of living index of the previous month. The industry requested that it continue to follow the original method, using the cost of living index of the lower period of July and then converting it into Gold Yuan, in order to maintain the survival of dozens of businesses.

### Father's Day Promotion Committee Allocates Large Sum to Promote Scholarships

The Father's Day Promotion Committee of this city sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Our Association held a special broadcast on Father's Day on August 8th at the Shanghai Radio Station to raise scholarship funds for poor students, raising a total of 10,366,600,000 yuan of Legal Tender, with interest income of 1,407,680,000 yuan. After deducting necessary expenses, there is a total of 11,098,550,000 yuan. Half of this amount will be donated to the Shanghai Scholarship Fund and the Linglian Association's elementary school. The remaining half, totaling 5,509,275,000 yuan, will be allocated to your newspaper's reader scholarship fund. Enclosed is a check. Please acknowledge receipt..." Since the start of fundraising for the current reader scholarship fund on July 1st of this year, donations have not been very enthusiastic. Thanks to the Father's Day Promotion Committee's broadcast fundraising and allocation of a large sum of money, the expected goal was quickly achieved, which is truly a blessing for poor students in this city. The members of the Father's Day Promotion Committee worked tirelessly to raise scholarship funds, running around and appealing in the summer heat, and achieved satisfactory results. In addition to receiving the funds, this newspaper would like to express its highest gratitude on behalf of countless poor students.

### 50 Yuan Denomination Banknote: Where Did It Come From If It Was Never Issued? Someone Attempted to Exchange It at the National Bank; Sent to the Police Bureau for Strict Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, said: As reported in last night's newspaper, the Central Bank discovered that a person named Jiang Futai inquired at the bank whether a 50-yuan Legal Tender banknote (with a portrait of the Prime Minister in the center) that had not yet been issued could be exchanged for Gold Yuan. The bank personnel believed that since this type of 50-yuan Legal Tender banknote had never been issued in the past, how could it be circulating in the market? It must be the case that a small number of banknotes were stolen from the ship that transported the batch of banknotes from the United States to Shanghai via India in September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945). The case has been sent to the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau for strict investigation. In short, the portrait on the 5-yuan Gold Yuan banknote is the late Chairman Lin, the 100-yuan banknote has both a portrait of President Chiang and a portrait of the late Chairman Lin, and the other 1-yuan, 10-yuan, and 50-yuan banknotes all have portraits of President Chiang, which are easy to distinguish.

### Workers of Datong Printing Factory Report Dismissal Dispute

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, workers from the No. 1 and No. 2 printing factories of Datong Bookstore hosted news reporters at the Datong Tea House to report on the dismissal dispute that occurred after the government reformed the currency system and stopped printing Legal Tender. According to reports, the factory's handling methods are: (1) About 200 people will be retained out of more than 900 people. (2) Dismissal compensation will be paid according to the regulations of the Bureau of Social Affairs, ranging from three months to half a month's salary for each dismissed worker. The workers' opinions are: (1) In addition to printing banknotes, Datong Printing Bureau also has other printing businesses. The number of workers retained should be increased to more than half. (2) The wages of banknote printing workers are usually meager and the work is heavy, so the dismissal compensation should be paid more generously. After repeated negotiations between labor and management, the factory only agreed to add five days of salary to each person in addition to the dismissal compensation. The workers have separately sent letters to the former General Manager Tao Baichuan and the current Chairman Du Yuesheng requesting help. It is reported that Tao has scheduled to meet with the workers at 10:00 AM today to discuss the matter, and there may be a better solution.

### Ruthless Armed Smuggling of Taiwanese Grain

— Our Special Correspondent, Wu Shourin

[Our Taipei Dispatch on the 11th] The Taiwanese food policy is the greatest force in ensuring stability in Taiwan, where few people need to worry about their daily meals. However, precisely because the price of grain in Taiwan differs so greatly from the mainland, it has become a shortcut for risk-takers to get rich. Economic principles tell us to "exploit the land's resources" and "facilitate exchange of surpluses and shortages." Taiwan has fully achieved the former, but the latter has been shouldered solely by the government. Why? Because the famine on the mainland is too severe and widespread. If "facilitating exchange" were to become an unorganized, uncounted, and unrestricted activity, then even exhausting Taiwan's entire grain production would not be able to alleviate the mainland's starvation. It would inevitably lead to the joke of "failing to save the tadpoles but starving the snakes." The Taiwanese provincial government understands this mutually exclusive situation, and therefore has blocked private channels for exporting grain. However, where there is profit, who would not want to seize it? Especially since adventurers have their own methods.

Looking coldly at the rampant grain smuggling in Shanghai in recent months, it truly involves clever plundering and forceful seizure, using both soft and hard tactics. The scale varies, and the number of occurrences is countless. The thoroughness of the planning and the boldness of the operations are truly astonishing.

Late at night on June 2nd, Sun Cailiang, a police officer from the Taichung County Police Bureau, led several officers in secretly exporting 154 bags of rice from Lukang. Unfortunately, they were discovered by Zheng Zhenxian, a police officer at the Lukang police station. Even more unfortunate was that this officer, although of low rank, was a tough man. As a result, he was not intimidated by the other party's police officer status and confiscated all the smuggled rice, handing it over to a local resident named Zhan Zhang for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, late at night on the 3rd, Sun Cailiang led a group of people armed to the teeth, making a comeback. They also transported more than 200 bags of rice, threatening Zhan Zhang to rob the 154 bags of rice that had been confiscated, making a total of more than 400 bags, and blatantly smuggled it away.

As the saying goes, "paper cannot contain fire." Although the grain was spirited away under the cover of weapons, word also spread. The journalistic circles in Taichung felt that it was outrageous for those responsible for suppressing smuggling to be engaged in armed smuggling. Therefore, upholding a sense of justice, they beat the drum and attacked, causing the matter to escalate. Gong Luduan, the magistrate of Taichung County, felt that he could no longer play the role of "a blind old man" and ordered Chen Ding, the chief of the county police bureau, to investigate and report. However, Chen's response was unexpected, simply concluding that "no such incident was found." Unfortunately, the journalistic circles were too nosy, and the new offensive spread to the newspapers in the provincial capital. Xu Zhenxiang, a special commissioner of the Provincial Police Department, together with County Magistrate Gong, personally went to Lukang to investigate and found that the evidence was conclusive. They immediately transferred all the suspects to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. This case should have come to an end under the pronouncement of "handled according to the law." Unfortunately, it was another case of "hot money in a cold pot." The Taichung County Journalists Association suddenly issued a telegram on August 30th, stating that the suspects in the case had recently been released by the court under the ruling of "insufficient evidence." However, they believed that the evidence was very sufficient and should not have been released. They also said that Sun Cailiang was an ordinary civil servant, who would not have the huge sums of money to purchase grain for smuggling and profiteering, nor would he have the courage to openly lead a group of people in armed smuggling. They determined that there must be a mastermind behind the scenes. They wanted to question Chen Ding, the chief of the Taichung Police Bureau, why he tried to cover up the case at the beginning, claiming that "no such incident was found"?

Now this telegram full of gunpowder is out, and all agencies and newspapers in the provincial capital have received it. However, it is hard to say what results can be achieved by "scholars discussing war on paper." According to our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on August 28th, the Ministry of Food has already been paying attention to the smuggling of Taiwanese grain. We sincerely hope that the central government's concern will prompt the local authorities to pay attention. At the same time, to take a step back, smuggling to mainland ports can still be considered as the benefits not leaking out. However, the reporter is very worried that grain ships will sail to foreign countries only a sea apart.

### Developing Zhejiang Province's Resources: Establishing a Mineral Resources Survey Team

### Central Committee Member Dai Chuanxian and Others Plan to Rebuild Jinshan Temple

Establish a Committee to Raise Funds

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was previously destroyed by fire, resulting in significant losses. It is difficult to restore its former appearance in a short period of time.

### Former Director of Hunan Province's Land and Food Department Exposed for Accumulating Arrears of Grain Tax

Huang Dean's Statement on Grain Deficiencies

[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 4th] Since Jiang Gu took over the Hunan Provincial Land and Food Department, he has discovered that the previous director had accumulated huge arrears of grain tax and military provisions, with rumors claiming the amount to be over one million shi. The previous director, Huang Dean, issued a special statement regarding this: (1) The grain deficiencies in various counties are mostly accumulated over the years and not the result of a sudden event. In the past, the central military provisions were never fully transported, and new and old taxes were intertwined, making it difficult to detect. There were also many disputes this year. The central government's urging was very strong, so the matter of grain deficiencies was not discovered in many cases. (2) Recently, the counties owed more than 700,000 shi of military provisions, scattered in remote areas, and the initial collection and transportation had not yet been carried out. Among these untransported provisions, there may be some misappropriation, but it is definitely not the entire amount. (3) As for the 700,000 shi owed, it was for the central government's grain purchases. The province's Purchasing Committee purchased a total of 332,127 large bags of rice and 419,179 shi of grain. 323,214 large bags of rice and 384,263 shi of grain have been delivered. 3,913 large bags of rice and 34,916 shi of grain are owed and awaiting transport. In addition, the Guangdong Provincial Government previously purchased 100,000 shi of provincial-level grain, and the grain funds were directly handed over to the Finance Department for transportation and purchase, and distributed to various counties. The Provincial Land and Food Department is responsible for urging the counties to transport and allocate the grain. This grain is also scattered in remote areas, making it difficult to concentrate, especially since local people oppose transporting grain to relieve famine. Moreover, there were many disputes over transportation, so it has not yet been fully delivered.

### Yarn Prices Hovering at Limits

The cotton yarn market was stable yesterday. At the opening, the Textile Construction Corporation had not yet posted its prices. It was late, around 12 o'clock, when the Textile Construction Corporation posted its prices for sale, and the Six District Associations handled joint distribution. Yarn factories each sold separately in the store front and supplied sufficient yarns which calmed the nerves within the market. As the money market was still loose, there were still sporadic demands from all sides. The asking price was revolving at the limit price. General owners, aware of the sluggish market sentiment, sold off their stocks in order to make way, which formed a situation of clarity that was in reality not so firm. A total of 133 bales were traded throughout the day.

Also learned: The Textile Construction Corporation posted prices around noon, selling 20-count Red Man Bell, Sailing Boat, and Red Bee at a uniform price of 707 yuan.

Also learned: The Dasheng Yarn Factory also opened a large amount of yarn on the market, with 10-count Blue Kui Xing priced at 545 yuan, with 144 bales opened, and 10-count Old Man Peach priced at 542 yuan, with 14 bales opened.

Formal contracts can be signed with the factories next week. The China Trust Bureau has completed the customs clearance procedures for this batch of cotton and has limited it to five days.

Regarding the ports of delivery for US aid cotton and yarn cloth, it is rumored that the last Cotton Group meeting rejected the request from inland factories to increase the number of ports.

### Price Sticking to Original Disk, Rice Transactions Rare, Flour Falls Back, Oil Market Sluggish

The rice market is sticking to the limited price, but transactions are becoming increasingly scarce. The price of rice from rice producing areas is relatively high. If sold at the limited price there may be a loss, and therefore owners were not willing to sell. The scarcity in the supply is also due to the limited prices. Japonica rice in particular is rare. The available samples on the vendors' tables were few. There were more transactions for Indica rice, and the price also remained at the limit. High quality coarse Indica rice was sold for seventeen yuan per bag. Jiangxi polished rice was also opened with slight openings. A total of 4,892 shi arrived in the North and South markets.

Flour saw a slight decline, as holders rush to offload the stocks because the deadline of the warehouse receipts was approaching. Increased supplies were absorbed and the transaction was brisk. Closing price of old Che brand powder fell to seven yuan and three jiao five fen from seven yuan and four jiao; a drop of one jiao and five fen. Bingshun [Boat] powder closed five cents lower, Red Bee lost five fen, and various brands were reduced by one jiao and one jiao and five fen. Bran is still sold at the limit price, and wheat remains at ten yuan and three fen.

Transactions for coarse grains were sparse. Prices of soy beans was inversely related to the prices in the producing areas, so it was rarely sold. Two hundred packages of Douchi were traded. Corn and corn products from the north are sluggish and the price fell by two jiao. Red grain prices are low. The customer's help picked up and the market became firmer. There were few transactions for Yuan wheat, and broad beans were supplied at the limit price. There was limited amount of mung beans opening, and one hundred packages of sesame seeds were supplied by vendors, with each household on this street receiving one package. Supplies of raw peanuts were low and transactions were sparse and sold at five hundred thousand per unit. (Kaifeng raw peanuts traded for two to three hundred packages.

Edible oil was sluggish. At the opening, oil factories planned to supply in large quantities at the limited price. Hearing the news, scattered households released the hold, and they were swift in removing the stocks before the limited price was enforced. The factory did not open its sales in the end. China Planting Factory [Zhongzhi chang] had some sales for raw vegetable oil with 20 packages at the limit prices. More stocks from Huilong were released. Soybean oil initially opened at fifty-one yuan and five jiao, closing at fifty-one yuan. Raw vegetable oil closed at forty-six yuan with each down by one yuan. Crude oil dropped slightly by one jiao, while the Old Bucket Xiao Che oil did not open but called the old prices to no avail. Stockings of soybean cakes were low. Dasheng Yuan Factory opened two thousand pieces of Dayuan cake at the limit price, and Datong and Yiji also sold.

### Commercial Briefs

After the silk market surged to the limit price, transactions in the market have almost stopped. Generally, holders of warehouse receipts are unable to move, so they extract the goods from the factory. The storefront and shops sold at a limited price. Actual sales were very strong, and they all tried to supplement the stocks from various factories. The factories are limited in the quantities they sell. Each household is allowed to purchase one piece.

Since August 19th, there has been little trading in white newsprint, and it is not easy to purchase, especially No. 2 paper and Daolin paper, which are even rarer. It is said that paper shops only allow the purchase of 50 sheets of newspaper per time, and the purchaser (such as printing houses) must provide a letter. The prices of industrial raw materials are limited, and fewer people are coming to the market. The sales have decreased because actual demands have been reduced from many factories.

The production of new red jujubes and Chinese wolfberries [Gouqi] from Ningxia has decreased greatly. Two batches that arrived were not saleable and the asking prices fell and nobody was buying them. Codonopsis pilosula [Dangshen] and Sichuan lovage [Chuanxiong] prices have stopped growing and are limited.

Regarding the raw materials for the copper and tin industry, such as copper blocks, tin blocks, lead, zinc, and aluminum, the "August 19th" market prices have been reviewed by the association and submitted to the Social Bureau for approval. The manufactured products, such as copper sheets, copper pipes, and copper wires, will be jointly reported by the copper factories.

### Unfair Distribution of Gasoline, Guidance Office Asks for Correction

The Municipal Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office requested an increase in the gasoline quota for domestic machinery factories. The Ministry of Land and Commerce allowed to increase quota of oil for industrial use after the investigation. It was discovered that the gasoline quota allocated by the Oil Allocation Association was extremely unfair. The original text stated: "In order to increase the gasoline quota for various domestic machinery factories, save factories from shutting down, and prevent workers from becoming unemployed, and prevent the occurrence of serious consequences after the severe city closures, the Petroleum Allocation Committee is requested to increase the gasoline quota to maintain the crisis of the national industrial clan. Since the establishment of the Gasoline Allocation Committee, the control of various uses has not only failed to meet demand, but the allocation has also been quite unfair. The association allocated 1.25 million gallons for general use, while the factories only received 250,000 gallons, including the fuel for civil aviation. The allotment is so overly harsh and unfair that a panic has arisen throughout the city's industry. For example, the rubber industry must use gasoline as a solvent and binder. It is one of the main raw materials for rubber, with a planned quota of 100,000 gallons, which is less than half of the actual demand. If it is not improved, the power of various factories will inevitably be forced to shut down. If the factory stops, there will be tens of thousands of unemployed workers, and the subsequent shadow effects will be disastrous. Rubber is a key industry designated by the government, which not only to essential for civil daily necessities but is also used in tire heavy-duty tires, military for aircraft. Other industries also have their key industrial uses. Gasoline for transportation can be replaced by domestic alcohol, or used together. Gasoline in industry cannot be replaced. In short, the control distribution should first understand the inside story of each industry, and then weigh the pros and cons and proceed. Now the control is only implemented in Shanghai, while other ports are allowed to be as before. In fact, it is useless, and there are many problems. To save the serious crisis of unemployment of the vast majority of workers in this city, we plan to request the Shanghai Gasoline Allocation Committee to re-examine and divide the quantity, increase the allocation of industrial oil, reduce the gasoline used by private individuals, or order the use of blended domestic alcohol. Also should limit vehicles without licenses, and disallow fueling in the city. These are a small hope of savings from the shutdown of industries due to the petroleum limits. The textile factories were limited to Shanghai. Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and foreign ships can reach the four ports. Inland yarn factories and flower yarn cloth must bear their own transportation costs to the port of delivery. The ratio of domestic and export sales of yarn is planned by the management office and is not divided within the quota paid by each factory.

### Tea Market Footing is Solid

Domestic tea yesterday had balanced incoming and outgoing quantities, remaining without much fluctuation. As for foreign firms' tea market, the trend shows an expanding brilliance, largely because the responsible parties sense that the demand for Chinese tea abroad is very high, and prices are also frequently improving. This optimistic attitude is further strengthened, and the market atmosphere is thriving, with a footing that can be called solid.

According to informed sources: Since our government imposed price restrictions on export goods, it is said that recently in the international market, not only tea is gradually rising, but also tung oil, raw silk, furs, and other commodities are showing signs of improvement. If this continues, the domestic economy can be stabilized, and at the same time, more foreign exchange can be earned, consolidating the currency system.

### Aid-the-Students Basketball First Day: Transportation Auto and Morning Friends; Shanghai Team Wins Over Warrior by Three Points; Tonight Transportation Auto Faces Dagong

The basketball charity tournament organized by the Municipal Education Bureau to raise scholarship funds for needy students held its first day yesterday, with two games scheduled. The games began at 7 p.m. at the Municipal Gymnasium. The weather was hot, and the seats were sparsely filled. Ticket sales totaled just over 200 gold yuan. In the first game, the Shanghai team competed against the Warrior team. Director Li of the Education Bureau tossed the opening ball. As a result, the Shanghai team narrowly defeated the Warrior team 39-36. In the second game, Morning Friends played Transportation Auto. The two sides battled fiercely, ending in a 41-41 tie at the final buzzer.

Shanghai Team Wins by Three Points

At 7 p.m. sharp, the Shanghai team and the Warrior team took the court. After Director Li tossed the opening ball, the two teams made contact. Zhi Ji of the Warrior team made the first basket, followed by a free throw from Li De and then Wei Cong. The two sides battled for a long time, scoring only on free throws. After 7-7, Li De of the Shanghai team made two baskets from the center circle, leading 12-7. The Warrior team chased hard, but the Shanghai team's captain was unable to hold them off. The Warrior team seized the opportunity to break through, tying the score at 18-18. The first half ended with each team scoring 20 points. After switching sides, it was still difficult to determine who would take the lead, and the score was tied again at 24-24. Zhi Ji made a long shot, and Wei Xu followed with a basket, giving the Warrior team a 29-24 lead. Qing Jiang of the Shanghai team came on, and the two sides entered a chaotic situation, with frequent fouls. At 32-31, the Shanghai team was still one point behind. Zhang Pu made a shot, and Yan Wei broke through, tying the score at 34-34, making the game tense.

### Open Tennis Senior Singles; Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng to Compete for Final Spot Today; Tao Guanqiu Defeats Cai Guoheng

[Our Newspaper] The Open Tennis Men's and Women's Singles Quarter-Finals were held yesterday. The Men's group had new outstanding talent Cai Guoheng face the City's reigning champion, Tao Guanqiu; and in the Women's group, Tianjin champion Dian Ai-yu faced National Games Champion Yang Weibin. The iron grid was filled with hope for those new talents, so the youth tennis had five to six hundred people. As a result of the fierce battle, Tao Guanqiu and Yang Weibin were determined to be the older masters, while Cai Guoheng and Lei Aiyu reported their defeat. Lei was on another level, at the mercy of Yang Weibin. It's such an aberration that she only got three games in the two sets. Cai Guoheng is the Nanjing representative for the National Games. He's rich in strength and a promising talent. His powerful strokes are amazing. Tao was repeatedly embarrassed, but his hitting was not stable, and his net skills were not yet up to par. There was no way to support him after he entered. Tao Guanqiu was stable and remained normal. The competition was still exciting. The results of the two groups are as follows:

Free Talk

### English, Math, and Chinese

— Xu Qinwen

English, mathematics, and Chinese are commonly listed as important subjects. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese proficiency of general students has gradually declined. Previously in Fujian, when examining new students' Chinese papers, I always felt that they were not up to par; I thought it was because I was used to seeing papers of higher cultural standards, which were in math. Since returning to the province, I have reviewed entrance examination papers for Chinese four or five times, and I have come to realize that Chinese proficiency has generally declined. In order to improve Chinese proficiency, the Ministry of Education once issued a notice stating that students who fail Chinese cannot be promoted, cannot graduate, and cannot be admitted to entrance examinations. According to pre-war standards, there are very few Chinese papers that are acceptable now. After opening schools, you have to enroll students, so you can only lower the standards or relax the grading, so that they formally comply with the law, but in reality, Chinese proficiency has not improved.

The Hangzhou Senior High School entrance examination papers are always sealed; Chinese papers are routinely divided into sections for grading, one person specializes in interpreting, one person specializes in translating, and one person specializes in writing. This time, the writing section that I looked at was at the end, so I had to summarize the scores. I remember very clearly that out of more than 1,300 papers, only one scored 87 points, followed by 81 points, and then 80 points; only three were in the A range, and the rest scored no more than 79 points, and there was only one of those. Most of them scored less than 60 points, and there were several that scored less than 10 points.

To avoid personal relationships, I looked at the sealed areas, and there was only one code number. So the officials who registered and calculated the scores only knew what number the first place was, and what number the second place was, but they didn't know the names of the people who were admitted. When the admissions committee opened, the director of the Department of Education called out the number of the first place, and another official looked it up and reported who it was, and where they graduated from. The ranking is calculated based on the overall score. English, mathematics, and other subjects only need to not be zero, but Chinese must meet the standard; so another official immediately looked it up and reported the Chinese score. This time, 150 people were admitted, and I never left the venue. I heard very clearly that the student with the highest Chinese score of 87 was not reported and actually failed; the student with the second highest score of 80 was also not admitted. The student with the third highest score of 80 was admitted, but his ranking was not high. The Chinese scores of the top three students were not high. It is obvious that, in an invisible way, it is shown that students who are good at Chinese are poor at other subjects, and students who are good at science are not good at Chinese either. Chinese and science are difficult to master at the same time, and it is simply a matter of conflicting interests. This is because Chinese is both complicated and difficult, and students have limited energy and time. It is really difficult to do both. In the past, writing an article required ten years of study to be considered "not proficient", otherwise you couldn't even talk about the qualifications of being "not proficient". Now, at the same time, you have to study many subjects, so how easy is it to be proficient!

However, it is still a problem that the Chinese proficiency of those who are admitted to senior high school is not good. In order to pay attention to English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, they cannot concentrate on studying Chinese; in the short three years, Chinese will not improve, and they will still not be proficient after graduation. But this is not a major problem for entering university. Whether or not they are admitted is still mainly based on English and mathematics. This is really a big problem. Needless to say, to make the country rich and strong today, it is necessary to develop science, and the time spent on studying Chinese must be reduced; Chinese must be simplified and improved. However, this is not a question of literary Chinese or vernacular Chinese. Whether it is vernacular Chinese or literary Chinese, only clarity is required, and attention to grammar is all that is needed, which does not take much time. The so-called ten years of study to be considered not proficient is to put many classical idioms in the "article" and praise many ancient books, which requires a long time to study. Therefore, what takes time is in "Chinese studies". Chinese studies are not unnecessary, but if everyone is required to pay attention to them, not only will they not be able to take care of science, but even writing will be difficult to be clear. Middle and higher-level students should be clear in writing, and those who fail should not be allowed to graduate or be admitted. However, the clarity of writing and Chinese studies should not be confused as one thing. For the sake of the general youth, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, and for the sake of Chinese itself, Chinese and Chinese studies should be divided into two subjects; Chinese is a major subject, and Chinese studies is a major subject only in the humanities. In this way, the practice of admitting those with poor Chinese grades at a high level will not happen again, and those with Chinese scores above 81 will be failed instead. I believe that there are very few people who agree with this view at present, but I am convinced that this needs to be distinguished!

### Selling Books

— Hongxian

In order to cope with the urgent needs of life, I have recently gone to sell books three times.

The first time went fairly smoothly. I took a collection of famous seals of past dynasties to sell. It was a printed edition from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty and an antique from my family's collection. Although that sharp-eyed bookseller kept picking on it, saying some amateurish things about it not being the original Yang Seal, he still gave me a considerable price, enough for me to buy eight dou of old rice. So, under the condition of self-consolation, I transferred this famous seal album and brought back a few dou of rice to the home where I was staying.

The second time was very unsuccessful, because I brought a "Han Wen Kao Yi" (Research on the Writings of Han Yu). This Han Changli, who started the decline of literature in the Eight Dynasties, was not valued by booksellers. I ran to several old bookstore shops, but none of them were willing to buy it even at the price of waste paper. Moreover, the bookseller sincerely explained to me that this kind of ancient article does not sell as well as an ordinary novel. I also admitted that what he said was right, because nowadays, people who read articles are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, but popular novels really spread like wildfire. So I decided to put this ancient text away and sell it again when someone promotes Han Yu's writing style.

The third time was also unusually unsuccessful, although I brought two romances by Li Yu and a "Huang Mei Story". But these novels and dramas also seemed to be out of date. In the eyes of the bookseller, these bamboo paper woodcut editions were particularly despised. Although they had been preserved for decades, they were indeed not as strong as newspaper paper. So I brought them back again under the bookstore's low valuation. Because if two ci and qu cannot even be exchanged for a few cigarettes, then why not keep the famous aphorisms to play with and chew over?

After the third time, I stopped thinking about selling books.

### I Want to be an Official

— Kang Jun

After reading the article "I Want to be a Teacher" written by Yi Jun in the Free Talk section on the 31st, I had a strange feeling in my heart. He is willing to be a teacher, but I want to be an "official." I studied politics in university, and after graduation, like Yi Jun, I went around hoping to get an official position, but lacking the skills of ingratiation and flattery, I gained nothing. Unexpectedly, through a friend's introduction, I ended up working as a substitute teacher in a middle school, and later became a full-time teacher. I have been a teacher for four years now, and I am still continuing to teach. As Yi Jun said, there is indeed "development," and the principal's praise increases year by year, and the places where the principal can exploit me (teachers focus on teaching, while the principal is only interested in profit and knows how to make money) also increase year by year. The principal gets richer every year, but my income decreases every year (according to the price index and general salaries), and life is becoming more and more difficult. Although entering the education field to be a teacher was not my original intention (quite the opposite of Yi Jun's intention), in today's world where eight out of ten things go wrong, it is difficult to find a job and using what I have learned is hard, which is not just the case for me and Yi Jun! Yi Jun wants to teach but becomes an official, and I want to be an official but become a teacher. If Yi Jun's "official" could be exchanged for my "teacher," wouldn't that be great!

### Confessions of a Thief

— Qi Feng

Recently, this publication has often discussed thieves, and seeing their theft methods and tricks, which are constantly emerging and changing with each passing day, I find it quite interesting. A certain Western magazine had an article of a thief confessing. He frankly pointed out that most thefts occur due to the negligence of the victims.

He said: Many people like to close the doors, windows, and shutters before leaving the house—especially when going to another place for summer or winter vacation. This is equivalent to clearly telling the thieves: No one lives in this house, please come in with confidence!

Some people are also smart alecks, and in order to make the thieves think that someone is in the house, they deliberately leave the lights on in the bathroom or bedroom when they leave. Little do they know that the thieves are even smarter than them. They must "case" the house in advance during the daytime before stealing. Seeing the lights on during the day and no one in sight, they know that you are trying to create a false impression, and they can come and do their thing leisurely at night.

Some people also like to leave a note in the milk bottle, telling the milkman: when to leave and when to leave this house, temporarily stop sending milk. When the thieves know this, it is another good opportunity.

The social news section and the news of the whereabouts of celebrities in the newspapers are the best intelligence supply sources for thieves. Because they know that once the owner leaves, the servants will inevitably become negligent, and they can take this opportunity to show off their skills. Moreover, most of these families are wealthy and powerful, and the harvest must be considerable!

Most thieves operate late at night. When they have finished "working," they are not in a hurry to escape. If they are in an empty house, they can rest in the house for a while, and after dawn, they can take a few suitcases or bags, dress neatly, and walk out calmly and generously. Others will think they are going to catch the early train!

In a house with people, if they feel that they have been discovered by the owner, they will use the fear of ordinary people to make a kind of mournful and strange sound, so that the timid owner thinks it is a "ghost cry" and dare not get up to catch them; or they will imitate the barking of cats and dogs to dispel the owner's suspicion. Some even dress up as ghosts and monsters to scare people.

An experienced thief doesn't care about alarms, dogs, locks, and all other anti-theft devices. Because stealing is fundamentally an attempt to outsmart and study psychology, their success is by no means accidental!

### On Feng Chaoran's Paintings

— Pan Gongdian

The other day, on my way to Beijing, I read Hu Yaguang's "Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran" in this newspaper's Free Talk section and was surprised. Zhang Zixiang's name was Zhang Xiong, alias Yuanhu Waishi, from Xiushui. He was born in the eighth year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1803) and died in the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886) at the age of eighty-four. He was skilled in flower painting and also painted landscapes. His calligraphy followed Huang Shangu. He was indeed a famous painter of the Tongguang era. However, Hu Jun's claim that Mr. Feng Chaoran studied under Zixiang is not true, and it is even more absurd and baseless to mistakenly refer to Mr. Chaoran as an apprentice in a barber shop. Mr. Chaoran called himself Shende Jushi, also known as Dige, and named his painting studio Songshan Cottage. He lived in Shanghai, residing on Songshan Road for nearly twenty years. In the winter of Xinyi (1941) in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, his disciples compiled a collection of paintings to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. From this calculation, it can be known that he was only five years old in the twelfth year of Guangxu. How could he be an apprentice? How could he be capable of calligraphy and painting? Mr. Chaoran was from Wujin. He studied poetry in his youth and entered the county school. Later, he devoted himself to painting and traveled with Mr. Fei Longding, studying poetry with Shen Yuezai Mingjing. Fei liked bronze and stone inscriptions, while Feng liked painting. He began to travel to Jin at a young age. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu (1907), he traveled to the capital for a long time, and his knowledge and experience became more extensive, and his attainments deepened. He also resolutely refused the employment of powerful figures and returned to Wumen. From then on, his paintings became more valued by the world. At the turn of Guangxu and Xuantong, he moved to Shanghai. On good days in spring and autumn, he often visited Li Pingshu, Wu Changshuo, and others to comment on calligraphy and painting. His intention was to hide himself through painting. In addition to landscapes, Mr. Chaoran's paintings of figures and flowers are not unskilled. He can take the excellent works of the Four Wangs and promote and develop them. He followed the orthodoxy of Dong Yuan and Ju Ran and merged the Northern and Southern schools into one. Di Pingzi and Pang Xuzhai were both connoisseurs, which is well known, and they both highly praised Mr. Chaoran's paintings. Therefore, Hu Jun's work is not worth a smile from those who know art.

### Skin

According to the Ping City Daily, a Shanghai financial circle dispatch reported that someone's check was rejected because the word "yuan" (圓) was written as "yuan" (元) when paying with gold yuan coupons. He inquired with the bank's business bureau, and Director Li explained that although there is no explicit regulation, since the currency system decree is for gold yuan and not gold yuan, the word "yuan" must be written in order to be valid. This matter is very interesting and humorous, and can be used as a small interlude in many heated programs such as major reforms and major discussions.

In the past, disputes over checks were nothing more than: (1) discrepancies in the amount, such as overdrafts exceeding the balance without overdraft arrangements; (2) unclear amounts, such as careless and simple writing with traces of alteration; (3) inconsistent seals, or blurred seal colors, which were rejected or required to be re-issued for the sake of preventing fraudulent claims. This is reasonable. The reason why numbers must be written in "uppercase" is also because there are more strokes, making them less susceptible to alteration. Adding a "zheng" (正) character at the end has the same effect as "Only" after the number on Western checks to prevent fraud. However, it is rare for problems to arise between "yuan" (圓) and "yuan" (元).

The character "yuan" (圓) not only conforms to its original meaning, but also has more strokes. If it involves the entry and exit of funds, it is appropriate to write a few more strokes. The so-called conforming to its original meaning is because coins are originally "round" in shape, whether they are gold or silver, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, so the currency system is also called the "yuan method." As for banknotes, they are square (rectangular) pieces of paper, but they are representatives of hard currency, and the original shape of hard currency is still round. Not only is the word "yuan" (圓) written in large characters on this new coupon decree, but it has also been written on all currencies since the creation of new currencies in the early Qing Dynasty. In addition, private records and correspondence use "yuan" (元) instead of "yuan" (圓) simply for convenience, which is fine since it does not involve entry or exit. The details of the check rejected in Shanghai this time are unknown, but it is conceivable that if it were written "Please pay gold yuan coupons for so many yuan, so many jiao, and so many fen," the first "yuan" (元) would clearly separate it from the numerals, and even if you added strokes, you couldn't overdraw a few coins, so there would be no actual liability. The next "yuan" (元) is quite susceptible to altering the numerals (e.g., if you write fifty yuan, if you change the "yuan" (元) to "wan" (萬), you'd make a fortune!). However, it still needs a "yuan" (元) below. Can you add another word below it? In short, it is never easy to make money on the "yuan" (元) character, so those who prevent fraud have never paid attention to this. And those who write checks usually write "yuan" (圓), so-called "be careful, there are no mistakes."

When banknotes were first made in the early Qing Dynasty, the word "yuan" (圓) was written on the front in Chinese, and Dollar was written on the back in Western languages, because only silver was used in the past, and the currency style and manufacturing method were modeled after Europe and the United States in order to resist imported currencies. But later, because the quality of European and American coins was not uniform, and the fineness of "Chinese-made foreign coins" was also slightly different, the transliteration Yuan was used instead. Therefore, the origin of "yuan" (圓) was due to Dollar, and Yuan was its ultimate destination.

The character "yuan" (元) disappeared for a period of time in the early Ming Dynasty because Emperor Taizu of Ming was named "Yuan 　," so he ordered "Yuan Year" to be changed to "Original Year." In the early Qing Dynasty, because Emperor Kangxi was named "Xuan 　," all "Xuanhuang" (玄黃), "Xuanwu" (玄武), etc. were changed to the character "yuan" (元). The character "yuan" (元) became very popular and prevalent in the Qing Dynasty.

### Listening to the Rain at Lake Pavilion

— Shi Shufan

One evening after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the owner of Bai Xie Lou went to Jin Hong to appreciate the moon over Taihu Lake. The garden was at the top of Xiaoji Mountain, with willows lining the embankment. The thick green foliage provided no shelter, and people passed through it as if walking through accumulated bamboo. At sunset, the host was under a rich wisteria trellis, facing several acres of lotus pond. The swaying breeze and swimming fish were all fragrant. There were eighteen white lotuses that bloomed the latest, especially plump and lovely. Each bud was carefully supported by eighteen bamboo poles, and they were as big as basins, truly the best of the white lotuses. Before long, it started to rain, and it didn't stop as evening approached. So, we stayed in the pavilion and drank to our heart's content. The misty lake was covered with white clouds, and the sight of two or three fishing lights was no less enjoyable than seeing the stars and moon. The next day, it was still raining, so we went to Meiyuan in the rain and returned. The companions were the Sanmu couple, Kong Wo's father and son, and Brother Bai Jiao. That night, Wu Man sang passionately and spoke freely, even mentioning anecdotes from the wilderness. All were included in the poem.

The flying wheels carried us to a cool place, with clouds and water rushing around us. After leaving Jiangnan after the new rain, we forgot to return, wrapped in thin blankets.

The duckweed and algae naturally formed patterns on the water. The wind blew through the wisteria trellis, scattering flowing dust. The sound of insects accompanied the wine, letting us know the taste of autumn. The late-blooming white lotus made the rustic people sit.

Closing the pavilion, we sang, forgetting the noise of the night rain, truly like listening to the frost falling under the moon. The full measure of sorrow and anger flowed in our slightly drunken state, as we stole leisure from the chaos and painted the water garden.

The lake shrimp were clean and tender, and the wild rice shoots were sweet. Who would believe that the chaos in the Central Plains has not been quelled? With cold eyes, we looked at the mountains and rivers, and the sparse white hair faced the gnarled beards.

The absurd and overbearing spirit floated to the sky, and the spirits and ghosts proudly stroked their heads. I don't despise Ashu for indulging in dreams, the green forests and incense continue with the fishermen.

The ten thousand willows deeply hid the weak stone bones. The old plum silently delivered the flushed face. Raising our heads, we visually wrote the silent painting, with the Guanshe Mountain connecting to the Xuelang Mountain.
